    "generalInfo": "Unlike a typical safari, which lasts just a few hours, the Game Count Safari immerses guests in Hwange’s wilderness for a full 24-hour period. Stationed at a designated waterhole, participants track a diverse array of species, from vast herds of elephants and elusive predators to rarely seen nocturnal animals.<br/><br/>Morning to afternoon offers the chance to witness antelope, giraffes, and warthogs as they arrive for their first drink of the day. As the sun begins to set, predators start to stir, and the landscape transforms with the calls of night birds and the distant roar of lions. Through the night, guided by the moon and the quiet sounds of the bush, the nocturnal world comes to life. By dawn, the park awakens again with the sounds of the wild, marking the conclusion of an unforgettable conservation experience.<br/><br/>This unique adventure is available exclusively for guests staying at selected safari camps.<br/><br/>The Game Count happens over 24 hours, but is part of a 3 night stay at a lodge which includes game drives on the other days.",

        "description": "Transfer to Hwange National Park for 3 nights on safari. Hwange National Park is Zimbabwe's largest game reserve. Vast stretches of wilderness, extend from horizon to horizon and form part of the ancient migration route towards Northern Botswana's Chobe and the Linyanti. This diverse landscape of mopane and teak forests, semi-desert scrubland and granite hills is inhabited by a wide variety of mammals and birds. Although a year round destination, Hwange is particularly appealing during the winter months (April to October) when large concentrations of animals flock to artificially pumped waterholes as the seasonal pans dry out. The park's network of waterholes sustains life when natural resources are unavailable. Massive herds of elephant make their presence felt during the dry period. Buffalo, zebra, sable and roan antelope, as well as lion, leopard, cheetah and wild dog can are also to be seen. Stay in an intimate camp with a feeling of remoteness and seclusion. Rooms boast views of a productive waterhole which draws local wildlife. Elles are often drawn to the pool right at the front of the lodge for a drink on a hot day: it’s an incredible privilege to be so close to these magnificent giants. During the day, game drives will have you tracking lion prides, buffalo herds, and learning about the work of the local wild dog conservation centre – a visit to the centre is an absolute must to hear the story of how dogs are being brought back from near-extinction in this area. Guests can also visit local village and conservation projects which are funded by the Lodge’s Trust. This is a very special place: prepare to be immersed in the wilderness and friendliness of the local people."

This camp is idyllically located, overlooking the Zambezi River and the imposing Great African Rift Valley. Ruckomechi Camp is situated in an exclusive concession of Mana Pools National Park, in the heart of the Zambezi Valley. The setting of Ruckomechi, located amongst a large grove of acacia and ebony trees, allows for exploration of the rich and varied wildlife. An intoxicating blend of wildlife and bird species abound. The dry season sees large herds of elephant and buffalo together with hippo, waterbuck, kudu, nyala and eland all seeking to slake their thirst along the banks of the mighty Zambezi. Predators follow with lions frequenting the floodplains and adjacent woodland, while leopard stalk the thickets. Cheetah and endangered wild dog are also often seen. The area is equally famous for its superb birdlife, offering over 350 species including collared palm-thrush and African skimmer. Ten spacious en-suite tents, including a honeymoon suite and family room, maximise views of the Zambezi River and the escarpment beyond. Each has both indoor and outdoor showers, and the camp boasts an outdoor ‘bath-with-a-view’ in a secluded, scenic spot. A central dining, bar, library and main area complete the camp offering. There is a separate deck with infinity pool for swimming and sun bathing, and an inviting, cushion-strewn sundowner and stargazing deck."

        "description": "Arrive Bulawayo Airport and transfer to your lodge for 3 nights in Matobo Hills. A landscape like no other, Matobo Hills' ancient granite kopjes, wooded valleys and weirdly balanced rock formations offer a unique experience. Mysterious and beautiful, this World Heritage Site is located 40 kms south of Bulawayo and is an area of massive spiritual and cultural significance to local people. Millions of years of erosion and weathering has hewn shapes from granite rock and these gravity-defying formations point to the skies above, as though in communion with the elements responsible for sculpting them. Stay in this lodge, owned by a Zimbabwean family, who are actively involved in local community and environmental projects, which you can visit and see first hand how tourism is benefiting the locals. Cycle to a rural village: you will have an opportunity to interact with locals through an interpreter to hear the challenges of living in post-Mugabe-era Zimbabwe: how unemployment means that parents have to leave children to be looked after by grand-parents, the reality of a system that doesn’t provide free education or healthcare – and how poaching has affected wildlife. The people are so very friendly, and though previously not happy to talk politics for fear of reprisals, they are now very open and critical of their recent past. Lodge activities include: nature drives, rhino tracking by vehicle and on foot, a visit Cecil John Rhodes grave where you will hear the history of Zimbabwe and how Zimbabweans still revere Rhodes, cycling to a rural village, hear about ingenious projects that have benefited from the Lodge’s Trust donations, such as fence-building to combat poaching, widows provided with chickens, whose eggs are then purchased by the Lodge’s kitchen – then providing a family with income - and visits to ancient rock art sites to learn about the significance of these ancient paintings."

Vast stretches of wilderness, extend from horizon to horizon and form part of the ancient migration route towards Northern Botswana's Chobe and the Linyanti. This diverse landscape of mopane and teak forests, semi-desert scrubland and granite hills is inhabited by a wide variety of mammals and birds. Although a year round destination, Hwange is particularly appealing during the winter months (April to October) when large concentrations of animals flock to artificially pumped waterholes as the seasonal pans dry out. The park's network of waterholes sustains life when natural resources are unavailable. Massive herds of elephant make their presence felt during the dry period. Buffalo, zebra, sable and roan antelope, as well as lion, leopard, cheetah and wild dog can are also to be seen. Stay in an intimate camp with a feeling of remoteness and seclusion. Rooms boast views of a productive waterhole which draws local wildlife. Elles are often drawn to the pool right at the front of the lodge for a drink on a hot day: it’s an incredible privilege to be so close to these magnificent giants. During the day, game drives will have you tracking lion prides, buffalo herds, and learning about the work of the local wild dog conservation centre – a visit to the centre is an absolute must to hear the story of how dogs are being brought back from near-extinction in this area. Guests can also visit local village and conservation projects which are funded by the Lodge’s Trust. This is a very special place: prepare to be immersed in the wilderness and friendliness of the local people."

        "description": "Transfer to Victoria Falls for 3 nights in a local guesthouse style lodge. When you wander through the lush rainforests above the Victoria Falls, newly baptised in the mist, your ears holding the echo of thundering waters, it isn't hard to imagine that this is where it all began. Eden. As the land cuts away beneath the ancient Zambezi River, the waters plummet dramatically into the Batoka Gorge, over 100 metres below. The angrily churned up spray shoots skyward, painting the landscape in billowing clouds. This striking \"smoke that thunders\" can be seen for miles, a geographic pointer summoning visitors into its presence. The Victoria Falls reaches its zenith in about May each year. It is a truly awe-inspiring experience - the sight, the sound, the smell and the humbling feeling that here indeed, is Natures Supreme Masterpiece. No photograph can begin to depict the reality and nothing prepares you for your first sight. Remember to hire a raincoat when the Falls are at their peak: you will otherwise be soaked! One evening, take a sunset cruise to enjoy possible sightings of hippo, crocodile, elephant and a variety of birds. With sundowner in hand marvel at the beauty of an African sunset - a perfect end to a great day. During the day, perhaps take an 'Insider Host' tour. An 'Insider Host' gives guests an opportunity to meet real people and understand what makes Victoria Falls tick...from an 'Insiders' perspective. This is an activity with a difference and not something visitors can experience by wandering around town on their own or by booking any of the many activity-based excursions on offer. The Insider Host lives in Victoria Falls, has been part of the Victoria Falls scene from many years, knows lots of interesting locals and, if need be, can make things happen. She/he can also talk about anything and everything Zimbabwe-related: another opportunity to learn about the effects of living in a country devastated by a tyrant. Your time with the Insider Guide is flexible - we always recommend starting at the Tour of the Falls and then, depending on the guests' interests, they could visit an art gallery, do a drive though Chinotimba Township or visit the Elephant Walk Shopping & Artists Village. Other activities on offer include cycling trips to local villages, bungy jumping, white water rafting, zip-lining and kayaking. One evening, visit Chinotimba township for a local meal, cooked over an open fire in cast iron pots and ovens, giving guests an authentic, wholesome and tasty food experience."

At Victoria Falls, the earth splits open and swallows one of Africa’s greatest rivers, the mighty Zambezi, creating the largest sheet of falling water on earth. As the water hits the narrow depths of the Batoka Gorge beneath, it blasts a cloud of mist skywards, lending the falls their local name ‘mosi-oa-tunya’ (the smoke that thunders). When the Zambezi is at its fullest, the mist hangs a permanent raincloud above the falls, showering visitors on even the sunniest of days and visible for miles around. As part of your stay here you can enjoy a tour of the Zambian side of the Falls from which you can get a side on view of the falls and the Batoka Gorge. Various additional activities are available for an extra cost including white water rafting, bungee jumping, river cruises, helicopter flights and much more. With 2 included activities per day, you will want to take advantage of your unique location by joining game drives, walking safaris and boat cruises in search of the enigmatic wildlife that resides here.

It is a remote gem that leaves you awed and humbled by the landscape, a landscape that feels both eternal and wonderfully alive.

These floodplains attract wildlife in huge numbers, and on your included walking and driving safaris you will have the chance to get up-close to some of these majestic animals. The area is known for its immense bull elephants and the sight of an elephant standing upon its hind legs to stretch for the seedpods of a giant Albida tree upon the floodplain has become iconic. Yet it’s not only elephants that you’ll be searching for. In the company of your expert guides, you can fully immerse yourself in your unforgettable surroundings, tracking everything from beetles to wild dogs and lions. With over 380 species of birds recorded, birdwatching is also incredible here!

        "description": "You can hear Victoria Falls from your lodge, and it’s a low growl, an endless thunder that arrives on the breeze. You are just a few miles upriver, and you can gaze over the rapids and watch the monkey troops that impishly swing past. After your flight and transfer, there will be some time to relax and refresh before you are escorted to the park gate. You will pass the raucous baboons that guard the entrance to walking trail, and you will feel as though your adventure has truly begun. Victoria Falls divides Zimbabwe and Zambia, but two-thirds of the spectacle is on the Zimbabwean side. The first ten minutes of the trail bring iconic views as the tumbling water is usually enhanced by a 360-degree rainbow. Travel further across the canyon, and there will be no tree canopy for cover as you stand face to face with the falls to feel the spray that rises from the canyon as you marvel at the spectacle's power. Other waterfalls may be higher and wider, but none dispense as much water as this one does. After taking it all in, you will be returned to your lodge, and a sunset Zambezi cruise will bring your first day in Africa to a close."

Colors swirl on nature's canvas below, and you will admire cataracts that stand tall in the Lower Zambezi. Touch down, and your guide will take you over the bridge and into Zambia, where you will walk alongside another part of the falls, taking bridges to the cataracts that are often enshrouded in mist. Dependent on the Zambezi River water levels, you can also take a boat towards the edge of the precipice. Spend a couple of hours in the town of Livingstone to visit a traditional market and a number of colonial buildings from the time of the explorer that gave the town its name, David Livingstone. Returning to Zimbabwe, a sunset cruise is included in your lodge stay and makes for another peaceful and serene evening."

Hippos rest in the slow-moving pools as sometimes dozens of them will congregate with their enormous jaws and bellowing grunts. Nile crocodiles bask in the sun, lining the banks with an eery menace. Baboons and various monkey species scurry across the ground, while a handful of different antelope come down for a drink. You will spend the day exploring the river, with your morning spent on a kayak tour and your afternoon on a luxurious boat as canapes and cocktails are served as the wildlife roams past. With six days of safari beginning tomorrow, your time spent on the water will be a perfect introduction to the landscape and a chance to relax before your safari adventure continues."

Lounging back, you can watch giraffe and zebra come for a drink with a massive pod of hippos barging about just after them. Slowly, you will journey deeper into the wilderness with the open grasslands of Namibia to one side and the thick woodland of Botswana to the other. Zebra emerge and splash in the shallows, buffalo keep their heads and horns clear of the water, and you will disembark into the forest. The animals cannot see you, and you can turn a corner to find a herd of elephants soon surrounding your vehicle. Turn another, and you may be just three meters from a tower of giraffes. Buffalos may soon cover the trail, and you will have to stop to allow them to pass. Your luxury camp is deep in the wilderness and surrounded by the woodland's natural orchestra. With a safari in Chobe, you will be engaged at all times of the day and night."

You will see the melancholy of old bulls that wander lonely, and then admire the enthusiasm of youth as the glint of discovery coats the expression of younger elephants. Take in the thoughtfulness of the matriarchs, as their eyes and subtle smiles impress from all angles. Today's game drives will take you indelibly close to it all, both the pachyderms and the predators in the trees. You will cross a large section of Chobe and discover what hides beneath the canopy. Choose from morning and afternoon drives, or a full day that heads out to the remote Savute area of the park."

In a private concession on the edge of Chobe, you will enjoy a morning walking safari as your journey begins in dense woodland and then opens out onto open grasslands. Here you will find the grazers in huge numbers with the zebra and red lechwe among those that are scattered for as far as the eye can see. Moving patiently and quietly, you will be able to get exceptionally close with your focus switching from a giant herd to a small individual. After lunch, your privately guided safari will continue with a game drive back towards Zimbabwe as you follow muddy trails through Chobe's remote southern woodland. This region of the national park sees few vehicles, and part of your experience will be to stop in the middle of the woodland and wait for the animals. From your silent vantage point, it will be easy to spend hours taking in all the intimate details ranging from lone springboks with faces of anxiety, graceful giraffe towers that hold their heads up high and majestic lions on route to the water."

There are few places for animals to hide, so the ungulates live by safety in numbers. There are over 100 types of mammals to find, from the world-famous giants to the unusual characters that you will rarely see outside Hwange National Park. Your lodge will be in the center of the park and provide easy access to diverse ecosystems. As with most privately guided safaris, you can choose from a collection of activities and schedules. In Hwange, you can also choose the type of habitat and animals that you would most like to see. Explore miombo woodland and seek out the park's legendary leopards, or cross the open grass plains to find lion prides in abundance. Follow the curves of the river to find its residents, or journey onto the Kalahari-style desert to discover the migratory giants."

Impala skip past, eland bashfully gather together, a sable antelope's horns may bring an iconic photo, and soon you will be able to identify a dozen different antelopes. As everywhere in Hwange, these antelopes are not seen in isolation as interaction is everywhere. You can listen to baboons give a warning call to the grazers below, and then watch sentinels raise the alarm as a hundred heads jump up from the grass. You could smell the fear and imagine that a leopard is lurking nearby, which is what makes an African safari so different from simply being at the zoo. There are no fences and no script, just the magic of the wild."

You might encounter lions on a hunt and nothing else will interrupt your photos, and then spend an hour watching playful hippos without another vehicle in sight. As you explore, you will realize that safari is not just about the most famous animals as it is also about all of the endemic species and intricate details such as the glint in an eye, the expression on a face, and the beautiful sounds that keep you company through the night."

Even from your lodge, 24 miles upriver, it’s possible to see the spray and hear the dramatic growl of the water. Matetsi Private Game Reserve has 17 miles of private river frontage and over 50,000 hectares of pristine wilderness. This safari oasis is within easy reach of the falls, yet fully surrounded by Zimbabwe’s four-legged wildlife. You’re greeted at the airport and transferred to your river lodge. Safari is private here, and you watch animals directly from your river-facing suite; hippos quarreling, baboons playing, zebras grazing, and buffalos wandering as you dip into the private plunge pool on your verandah. There’s also a fabulous circular bath that looks out over the Zambezi, a lazy space for recovering from the flight."

Or take a boat upriver, where pods of hippos wade through the shallows and migratory elephants are never far away. Transfers to the falls are included, and you can choose when you want to see the spectacle. For the rest of the time, the safari continues all around you, Springboks, and impalas among those that scamper past as you’re lounging on the verandah."

You touch down in Zimbabwe’s longstanding and largest national park, Hwange National Park, a flagship destination on an astonishing scale. Enormous herds of elephants and buffalos roam here, sometimes hundreds of them seen in a single panorama. Gemsboks graze as packs of rare brown hyenas form. One of Africa’s largest populations of wild dogs can be found close to the camp, thriving on a floodplain in the heart of Hwange. This is a classic big game safari and the next three days are all about the expressions of wild Africa. Two game-viewing activities are included each day, and the camp’s central location allows you to explore the park’s diverse habitats and animals."

The sun is rising, and the predators are getting desperate, lunging unsuccessfully at zebras. Wildebeests canter past, full of energy. Buffalos fill a waterhole, grunting and slurping without pause. It’s impossible to keep track of the elephants, especially when you journey north into the woodlands. Game drive south and the Kalahari Desert plains attract a rich abundance of antelope: bushbuck, eland, kudu, gemsbok, reedbuck, hartebeest, impala, steenbok, duiker, and more. This wide-ranging menu creates food for the complete cast of predators, and a 3-day safari is a great chance to see the iconic combination of lion, leopard, cheetah, wild dog, and hyena. Sometimes they’re resting, but often you follow them as they hunt and explore."

Stay at Changa Safari Camp on the shores of Lake Kariba, a camp that epitomizes ideas of waterfront escapism. Your spacious tented suite has a private deck overlooking the water, with curved stairs leading down to a wide beach and a large fire pit, where the warming flames are constant throughout the evenings. Some aspects of the Lake Kariba experience are reminiscent of a typical waterfront getaway. Boat safaris take you past a rich array of birdlife, while storks and fish eagles are familiar sights around your suite.

Today’s exploration is dedicated to the endangered giants, a conservationist leading you on a drive into the rhinos’ realm. Watch in awe as the white rhinos rumble past, fierce, and determined in their movements. Then wait patiently to see the smaller and shier black rhinos, which only emerge when they’re confident.

There are no fences and animals move freely, with Zimbabwe’s section of the park just as rich in the big game as South Africa’s (the Mozambican side was heavily targeted by poachers during a long civil war, forcing many animals into South Africa and Zimbabwe). In particular, this is a haven for some of Africa’s largest elephants, big-tusked and often aggressive males, along with scores of rhinos and predators. Fly here and settle into the serenity of the safari experience, with twice-daily game drives complemented by game walks and boat cruises on the lake.

Tucked away in a private game reserve, it is just a short drive from the famous waterfalls, and this boutique hotel will gently ease you into the African experience. Lounge in your hot tub as zebra drink from the river below, and then sip premium wines as the enduring orange sun disappears from the sky. Listen to antelopes grazing outside your door and spend the evenings around a crackling fire. There is a colonial grandeur to the hotel that evokes a certain era and style, yet the promise of the wilderness is not interrupted, and you will quickly get acquainted with a wide collection of animals. You will be greeted upon arrival at Victoria Falls International Airport for a short transfer to the Stanley and Livingstone. The rest of the day is at your leisure, and there are plenty of places to relax with panoramic views, including the heated plunge pool. Local guides can take you on short walks around the game reserve to slowly introducing you to the animals of Zimbabwe. As with each stop on this safari, all meals are included, and you can expect an extremely high level of quality with creative fine dining served in inspiring settings. The next day will be all about Victoria Falls. Dependent on the river level, you can take a boat to an island next to the precipice as the rising spray and the deafening rumble hint at the spectacle's power. A self-guided walkway will lead you past numerous baboon troops and take you to beautiful lookout points. From these viewpoints, you can capture the full mile-wide sheet of water and admire how it disappears into the narrowest of canyons. For the ultimate vista, you can take a micro flight above Victoria Falls that will also reveal the distinctive landscapes of four countries: Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana and Namibia."

        "description": "Elephants define the panorama in Hwange, Zimbabwe's largest national park as they roam in huge herds and follow the ancient migratory routes between the Kalahari and the Zambezi. On your game drive transfer to your luxury lodge, you will already begin to lose track of how many elephant herds you have seen. You will have flown from Victoria Falls to the small Hwange airstrip, a convenient flight that maximizes your time on the savanna. For many years, this park was a private royal hunting ground for Nbedele warrior King Mzilikazi, and it has been a protected national park since 1929 and a premier safari destination. But elephants are just the start, as over these three days, you will find over 100 mammal species to discover. The diversity is what makes Hwange so special. Cheetahs run across the desert sands and towards the antelopes that huddle around waterholes. Lions bask on granite rocky outcrops, imperious predators that watch you closely even as they appear to be sleeping. Giraffe and elephant dominate the woodland, their irrevocable presence also found in the scarred remains of uprooted trees. Gemsbok and brown hyenas battle on open grasslands and the echoed drumbeat of the escaping herds float all the way to your camp. Such distinctive habitats create a very rounded safari experience, with each day exploring a diverse ecosystem with its own collection of specialist animals. At the heart of it all is your next safari property. Elegant and unassuming, the camp does not interrupt the atmosphere of the landscape. Animals graze in and around your luxury tented suite, the perfect sight as you open your curtains to watch the dusk fade into the night. You will sleep with your ears open to the savanna and hear distant lion calls and the harmonious shouts of primates in the distance. Meals are served beneath the stars, with the odd elephant or giraffe painted along the horizon. Hide Safari is a classic safari camp with just a small handful of tented suites amongst open miles of wilderness. Each day is privately guided, and you can choose your pace. The classic program is to explore in the early morning and late afternoon, leaving a few hours to relax at the camp around lunch time. But on a private game drive, you can also spend your whole day exploring as you head out into remote corners. Watch lions and leopards on the hunt and admire dozens of ungulates within reach of a waterhole, and then follow the prints to seek out rare wild dogs. There are also options for game walks as you follow designated routes that will bring close to the park's different ungulates. With privately guided activities, you can tailor each day to your interests as your guide will lead you through these three days that will unravel the pure authenticity of an African safari."

        "description": "Wake to the sounds of elephants and watch the babies as they swing their trunks past the camp. Enjoy your final breakfast in Hwange as you sip an artisan coffee as the giants of Africa rumble past. From here, you will board a light aircraft to the shores of Lake Kariba, where the isolated Matusadona National Park provides your next two days of safari. Buffalo congregate in the thousands as they line the shoreline as pods of hippos fill the center of the lake. Waterbuck and roan antelope graze close by, providing ample food for the famous collection of resident leopards. All of these animals can be spotted directly from your next lodge, an opulent base immersed in the sounds and sights of the shoreline. With its panoramic lake views, this contemporary lodge is all about the luxury extras that make safari so special. Enjoy massage treatments while watching the hippos, uncork premium wines while watching male buffalo rampage about, and admire the procession of antelopes that come for an evening drink. These two days are also privately guided, with game drives complemented by boat cruises. While Hwange is a park for adventure and exploring, Mutusadona and Lake Kariba are focused on sitting back and allowing the wildlife to come to you. Your stay includes up to three activities a day, each handcrafted to provide a new angle. Seek out leopards on mountain slopes, the spotted hunter hiding beneath a canopy of acacia trees. Walk to a herd of female buffalo, getting close to their vigorous huffing and curled horns. Cruise past herons and storks and then watch the fish eagles descend on the lake. And most of all, lie back and savor the tranquility of the African wilderness. Nothing artificial breaks the repose as you can glance up from a book to see animals wandering past, or take a nap by the pool and have a baby elephant come by to say hello. For escapism, there's little that can rival Lake Kariba and the charms of Mutusadona."

Baboons and zebra guard the entrance to the highest boulders with their black and white contrasting with the sharp red of the stone. A local guide will lead you on a journey by foot, so you will clamber high onto the boulders to explore an enchanting collection of ancient rock art. Stories are told with every painting and narrate messages that were left behind thousands of years before. Spirituality defines the atmosphere, and it will feel as though you are following in the footsteps of Zimbabwe's ancestors as every cave or rock reveals another piece of a mystical history. Tucked into an ancient San bushman shelter is your next camp, a delightful accommodation that will help you to savor the stories of the past. Panoramic views stretch out from your thatched suite as a bar and swimming pool overlook the local waterhole. This is not just a place of cultural heritage as it remains a home for many of Africa's most famous mammals. You will discover a new collection of antelopes and birds, along with the odd elephant and buffalo, and you will also enjoy exclusive experiences with both black and white rhinos. Matobo Hills has one of the finest populations of rhino anywhere in Africa, and you will see the two species side by side. As in the time of the bushmen, you can explore on foot as you enter a protected reserve that is home to over 60 rhinos. Black rhinos are bashful and hide among the bushes with their majestic horns and sturdy frames. White rhinos have a confident air and are almost double the size of their cousins. Despite the names, both are gray in color. Throughout the day, you will quickly learn to distinguish the two as you admire their contrasting lips and behavior. There are very few places in the world where it is possible to get so close to rhinos, especially black and white rhinos together and their abundance on these ancient plains will astound you."

        "description": "Zimbabwe will impress you deeply when viewed from the air. The roads are colored a deep red as swathes of forest and grassland are interspersed by villages of thatched huts. Hills roll towards Mozambique while desert stretches out towards Botswana. Flying between safari destinations saves a huge amount of travel time and ensures you transfer directly from wilderness to wilderness, yet every journey is also a scenic flight and a chance to savor Zimbabwe from the air. You will always have a window seat in the small planes and on some flights, like the one to Malilangwe Wildlife Reserve, are private charters. Touch down in the southeastern corner of Zimbabwe and you will be surrounded by the enchantment of the Greater Kruger ecosystem. Mountain acacia woodlands and ironwood thickets are home to rhino and elephant, while huge baobab trees are as constant as the giraffe. Life revolves around a central lake, the permanent water source for thousands of migratory animals. This is a private game reserve, and access is restricted to a handful of visitors. It is also a very compact wilderness and covers a mere 150,000 acres. In comparison, Hwange National Park is bigger than some US states allowing for a greater sense of intimacy with the landscape. In essence, Malilangwe is like the Greater Kruger in miniature as it pieces together diverse wildlife and habitats. This region is also home to Zimbabwe's most opulent accommodation. A wood-burning fireplace will dominate your huge sitting room as a viewing deck provides 270-degree views over the savanna. Your personal bar will be stocked with premium wines and spirits while a personal butler will attend to anything you need. Step out of your gorgeous suite and into your bubbling private hot tub that has an endless view. There is also a spa, an old-world library, and various places to enjoy fine dining in the bush. After your adventure around Zimbabwe, this beautiful property is where you will come to reenergize and savor the incredible comforts. Of course, you must also prepare for a thrilling safari experience as you watch lions pride follow zebra while the lionesses hide in the grass before setting an ambush. Follow the hyenas that scurry across the savanna, their strange faces accompanied by their menacing snarls. Watch an elephant tower over your vehicle and then spot a small herd using their trunks as snorkels. There is a lot to see in a short time, with morning and afternoon game drives celebrating the best of an African safari. You can also head out on bush walks ranging from 30-minute journeys to entire mornings spent on the savanna. When each activity ends, the luxury of your lodge is ideal for watching the rest of the wildlife wander by."

After a relaxed morning, you are transferred to the falls where a thrilling self-guided walking trail runs parallel to the thundering whitewater. At some places, the views are magnificent, with 360-degree rainbows swirling in the mist, or millions of gallons of gushing water stretching onwards for a mile. At other times you get soaked, the mist raining down, exemplifying the power of this waterfall.

There won’t be any rapids, so you are not going to tip, although you’re sometimes required to paddle away from hippo pods or elephant herds acting aggressively. The next few days follow a similar rhythm, waking early for a light breakfast in the bush then paddling for a couple of hours. Stop for a more substantial breakfast on the banks, then keep canoeing until midday, where you reach a remote Zambezi island in Mana Pools National Park. It’s hot now, so take a siesta after your lunch. Afternoons are leisurely, relaxing at the camp and enjoying a walking safari in the surrounding riverine woodland area. On this safari, you will paddle the full length of Mana Pools National Park. It is a leisurely journey, following the river downstream. Today’s first stretch is light on wildlife but big on epic landscapes. Deep, silent gorges rise above you, glowing through red and orange tones as the morning sun rises. The seclusion is absolute, just a couple of canoes and the enormity of the Zambezi canyons. You will have seen a similar canyon at Victoria Falls; this section close to Chirundu is higher, narrower, and only sees a few people a year. There is no access without being on the water, and you will delight in the remote atmosphere. You are sure to spot a few animals, grazers and giants who occupy the park’s remote corners, often large males cast out from their herd. Over the day, you will settle into the style of safari, feel the grandeur of nature, and spend the night on a remote uninhabited island."

        "title": "Mana Pools National Park – Unique Canoe Expedition",
        "description": "Traveling like this almost makes you feel like a nomad. Everything feels so wild. It is like you can better appreciate the life of elephants who roam the banks, sensing that they are also on a long, intrepid journey. Perhaps most poignantly, it feels like you’re on your own journey, not simply heading out to find wildlife. Such a mindset seems to make each encounter more special. Following the Zambezi, you paddle into the game-rich central areas of the park. It is worth noting that these areas remain mostly void of other people, as most Mana Pools boat safaris concentrate on the park’s lakes. Hippos are a constant now. Large pods cluster in calm waters, with individuals casually yawning to reveal trademark jaws. Younger hippos are regularly spotted on the banks, sometimes less than 15 meters away from the canoe. Elephants make for regular encounters. There are youngsters practicing their swimming, large adults walking on the riverbed and using trunks as snorkels, plus gracious matriarchs showcasing enviable equanimity. Buffalo are also common close to the Zambezi banks, and sometimes you see a huge herd descending into the water, swimming across to Zambia. Baboons seem to be ever-present around your camp while zebras emerge with almost metronomic consistency. The camps are basic but comfortable. The encounters are legendary. From the water you see everything coming from a distance. You see the herds of waterbuck and wildebeest from afar, hear the grunting giants, watch giraffe go from distant silhouette to high-definition close-up. At water level, you have a complete perspective on the landscape, what animals are where, and which sounds are echoing endlessly. Canoeing is almost silent, so when you approach wildlife, it doesn’t run away frightened. Even lions may be spotted, a pride of predators drinking from the banks. Perhaps you see a cheetah, maybe even a leopard, lurking in the reeds. Canoeing is not just silent safari. It is also slow safari, helping you discover all the little clues and all the predatory eyes hiding along the banks."

Stop the canoe by the banks and watch everything unfold, the herds marauding forward and the pride of lions lying in wait. Raucous baboons spoil the hunt, hooting fanatically to warn everyone of the camouflaged predators. The zebra and wildebeest walk downriver, looking for a more open place to drink. You watch the lions thinking, and admire the telepathic communication between females, then you see them sulk off in the opposite direction. Today you complete the canoeing, reaching the eastern edge of Mana Pools National Park by lunchtime. Spend the afternoon game driving back through the park, exploring the lakes and floodplains that were out of sight from the river. In particular, the guides are searching for the predators you haven’t seen yet. Wind into riverine woodland, scanning the branches for leopard spots. Then cross the plains, deciphering the camouflage of cheetahs in the grass. After three nights of relatively simple camping, you spend this night in a new luxury camp, enjoying a huge suite with floor-to-ceiling glass windows and a private shower beneath the night’s stars."

It’s harder for the cats to blend in here, and you have no trouble spotting lions and cheetahs on your introductory game drive. One pride seems to pose for the camera, sitting proudly on a rock that juts above the savannah. They approach you, slowly circling the safari vehicle before returning to their beautiful state of repose. Arrive at one of Hwange’s best camps around midday, where lunch is served and a guide introduces the style of safari. Set in its own private concession, in the east of the park, this camp is widely celebrated for having Zimbabwe’s best walking safari guides. Over these next three days, you have an open canvas to explore, with a variety of routes, all of which are highly unlikely to see other people or vehicles. You have complete flexibility. You will be driven to trailheads, then walk back to camp on foot, for two hours or the full day. Loop around waterholes close to the camp, or take a walk in remote mopane woodland, far from the camp. Mix walks and drives through the day or stick to two feet. These three days can respond to your mood, as well as the natural environment.

Many of these animals would quickly skip or canter away from a vehicle. But you are just another mammal, and the wildlife isn’t afraid. They return your gaze and inspect their visitor. You watch emotion change in a zebra’s eyes, admire the proud pouting of horned males, feel the connection with these rare and remarkable animals. Keep walking. Buffalo are up ahead but they don’t bother you, the large harem behaving very peacefully. Elephants are also up ahead, constants on the horizon. Expert guides know exactly how to respect the elephants’ space while getting you within heart-pumping proximity. A southern giraffe wanders past, then the rest of its family, including a new baby that towers above you. All the while you have not seen another person. You are fully engrossed in dozens of different species, perhaps seeing upwards of 50 unique mammals on this 3-day walking safari.

        "description": "Malilangwe is one of Southern Africa’s spheres of luxury, where you watch elephants from a private plunge pool and fine dine as lions roar in the distance. Safari is easy here with an exotic cast of animals attracted by the reserve’s permanent water that migrates into the reserve from the corners of The Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park. Operated by one of Africa’s legendary luxury names, this reserve will ease you into the safari experience, without forgoing any Western comforts. You will change planes at O. R. Tambo International in Johannesburg, flying north to this savanna in the southeast of Zimbabwe. Cocktails and champagne are served on your first afternoon game drive as silhouetted animals grace the panorama as you dine, and you only need to sit back on the balcony to enjoy many of the continent’s animals as the lodge looks over a floodlit waterhole that is populated throughout day and night."

        "description": "Lions are seen in the distance, basking in the morning sun with their golden manes rippling in the breeze. Elephants move gracefully past your vehicle and hidden amongst the bushes, you can spot rhinos, a mother and calf returning your gaze. Buffalo are commonplace here, and sometimes the guide must stop and wait for them to clear the rutted four-wheel drive trail. In Malilangwe, you will have an excellent chance of spotting a leopard, your guides’ intimate knowledge helping to uncover their hiding places. These are the Big Five and deserve their place as Africa’s biggest icons, and while this private reserve does not support a remarkable profusion of life, its mixed habitat provides residence for an array of life, including the famous five. The schedule will be flexible as you may wish to lie in after your journey to Africa. Activities can be tailored to your energy levels, but it is worth going on at least one game drive in search of these revered mammals. Short bush walks are a possibility, and it is possible to keep exploring in the dark with a nighttime safari about the weird and wonderful of the savanna. Malilangwe’s ease comes from its compact size as you will not need long or adventurous activities to start spotting the icons. Rather, you often just need to sit back and watch the show from your private lodge verandah or plunge pool. So soak up the luxury, tick off the famous sights, and gradually tune your senses to the wilderness."

        "description": "On the first couple of days, you will find yourself photographing every elephant, stopping at each zebra, and delighting in every new species uncovered. But your safari is about atmosphere and immersion, about surrounding yourself with nature’s theater, not knowing what is going to happen next. Gonarezhou shares an unfenced border with Malilangwe and stretches over a vast area, butting up against South Africa and Mozambique. The region is wild and untamed, and the animals’ behavior is tinged with aggression and belligerence. Without any permanent lodges, this is one of Africa’s last big-game frontiers, mostly unexplored and certainly not understood by the human world. The animals are very similar to Malilangwe and neighboring Kruger National Park, yet they are scattered and spread, harder to find, and more likely to surprise. On a day trip, you can take a picnic and feel the thrill of an expedition as you bump through a canyon of red granite boulders, following prints in the dust. There will be a profound sense of freedom as no other people or vehicles are in sight, nor much evidence of their presence. So you can keep exploring, getting stared at by an elephant and listening to the rolling beat of hooves across the plains. When you return to Malilangwe, you will be tired and dusty, but your luxurious bathtub will be just one way to cool off and re-energize."

        "description": "Light aircraft connections bring both convenience and speed as they link the parks found in the different corners of Zimbabwe. While practical, your flights are also mesmerizing as the colors of the wild flow beneath your wingtips, especially on today’s flight across the Chimanimani Mountains. Coming in for a landing, you can see the park’s four permanent pools that were created by river channels that stopped flowing many centuries ago. Mana translates as “four” in the local Shona language, and these expanses of water attract all manner of wildlife throughout the dry season from April to November. You will have landed in a place of abundance with food and water to support high numbers of animals. And like revered real estate in the city, predators, and giants voraciously protect their territories. These two days are fully flexible, and after an introductory game drive, the guides will outline the different activities. In almost all parks, you must be in a vehicle for encountering the predatory cats as walking simply is not safe. But boat and canoe safaris provide a unique perspective of the carnivores not seen from above but from eye level. A lion pride stares straight back at you, perhaps a cheetah or hyena may slip silently just ten meters away, or an elephant squirts water, and you are just out of range. In Mana Pools, motorboat safaris can get you close to a larger number of animals, but a canoe safari approaches silently to bring an even greater level of intimacy. Swap wheels for walking and the animal focus is different. Avoiding the cats, guides lead you onto open floodplains, which stretch out from the four main pools – named Main, Chine, Long, and Chisambuk. Eland and kudu wander nearby, herds of impala skip past on two sides, distinguishable from the equally large herds of duiker. Sable antelope point their spiraled horns in your direction while zebra waits inquisitively as you approach. Then there are baboons and vervet monkeys, the odd mongoose poking its head out, even a harem of buffalo grunting close by. With a walking safari, there are no fences or barriers, so you move silently, and you are not seen as a threat, meaning most animals will not run away. From this inspiring perspective, you can drink in the subtleties of behavior and style, the safari experience going far beyond the obvious. Over these two days, game drives can be complemented by these unique activities, the safari always feeling new and nuanced."

Grasslands turn brown, the acacia scrub is bulldozed down by elephants, and shallow pans shrivel in the dry season sun. Somehow, Hwange is home to one of Africa’s biggest concentrations of wildlife. Hwange symbolizes the precarious balance of nature as so much is able to survive, but only the elephants and buffalo truly seem to thrive. As Zimbabwe’s largest and most famous park, some 3.4 million acres of wilderness are yours to explore. Keeping the experience exclusive, you will be staying in the private Makalolo Concession with your luxury tented camp open to nature’s sounds and the savanna as your personal playground. In this landscape, you can game drive and walk at the guides’ discretion, and diversifying the experience are the convergent habitats, such as the acacia woodlands and teak forests that are occupied by thousands upon thousands of elephants. Follow the trunks through the trees with a brass band of hoots guiding you to flapping ears and twirling trunks. The elephants will surround you, each scene imbued with intimacy as babies chase away warthogs, infants playfully bash their heads, and colossal tusks crash into tree branches with silent standoffs between herds at the waterhole. In this kind of landscape, you will not count or tick off what you see so much as you will immerse yourself in the behavior of the herds, never sure what they will do next."

        "description": "Out on the plains, you can see hundreds of animals in a single view. The antelope and zebra graze in the open, their sentinels pricking their ears to detect a predatory threat. Across these arid lands, there is a profusion of cats, and a few days in Hwange is a prime chance to see them prowling. They hunt in the early morning and late afternoon, as well as during the night. Sometimes you will spot lionesses inspecting their menu, looking around for a target to attack after dusk. On other drives, you will find a leopard bounding down from a tree, keeping to the high grass as a wildebeest herd plays unwittingly close. Cheetahs and wild dogs also provide mesmerizing scenes. Though usually hard to spot, these predators are relatively easy to find in Hwange. Spotted hyena charge past you at regular intervals, their snarl such a contrast to the delectable grin of the smaller brown hyena. Sometimes, you will only see the predator, but wait around, and the scene will slowly play out as the hunter biding its time in creeping ever closer to the herd. When vultures swirl, the guide will take you closer to a ragged carcass fought over by birds and jackals. On another point in the safari, you may see the actual kill or the immediate aftermath, perhaps a lion roaring with authority, mane splattered with the blood of a young zebra. All of these scenes are possible in Hwange, as well as the other parks you visit on this 10-day Zimbabwe safari, but they will never grow old."

You can track scenes over multiple days, such as a hyena that is harassing a wildebeest herd one evening, and then found finishing off the carcass the next morning. Your camp is located in a private concession, so it is possible to stay close and develop a detailed understanding of the residents. Game drives can take you further afield and into the land of the elephants or that of the lions. After eight days on safari, there may be some animals you will have yet to see, so the guides can specifically tailor the game drive towards finding them. Or you might have a favorite, an animal you want to understand in more detail. Whatever the program you create with your guide, the safari will continue your rich engagement with ancient animals on lands that few people have had the fortune to explore."

Fly north to spend the day at Victoria Falls and be deafened by its growling roar and enthralled by the spiraling spray. Photos do not do justice to the falls, as they are unable to represent the sheer volume and power of the water. A guide will lead you on a walking trail that runs most of the length of the falls, where there are many points for treating your senses to the enormity of it all. Then for a final evening in Zimbabwe, you will take a boat cruise down the Zambezi River as sunset colors flicker on and off the water’s surface. Tonight’s accommodation is a legendary five-star hotel that is close enough to see the clouds of spray emitted from the falls."

Not everyone would call it attractive, but you will have a real sense of landing in Africa and being somewhere entirely unique. And while the museums are not modern, but they tell the poignant tale of the country and its past. Spending the day can be unavoidable given flight schedules, but will certainly not be a day wasted as you will be accompanied by a local guide and driver the whole time you are in Harare, picked up from the airport and given a tour of a city that hides a certain grace.

A roan antelope walks past, elongated horns like something from a work of fiction. Hippos open their jaws, and you will witness this scene continuously over the next two days. Gaze out over Lake Kariba, and the wide open panorama provides a baffling quantity of life, particularly the herds that graze on the open floodplains. Yet at the same time, there is an escapist quality to standing on the beach and watching the water ripple. Take the animals away, and Lake Kariba could be a vacation centered upon lounging on the beach and forgetting notions of time. You will fly to Matusadona this morning, the light aircraft touching down amongst a dusty savannah of elephant footprints. Safari is relaxed here, and Lake Kariba provides the permanent feeling of repose. Game drives move slowly through the park, wildlife easy to find as most species stay within a two-hour walk of the lake. Walks are more adventurous, especially when both rhino sub species coexist in the park. Following expert trackers and accompanied by an armed ranger, you can creep closer to the giants, admiring the boisterous bulk of the white rhinos and how they wander with an air of defiance. Smaller and much more shy, the black rhinos are one of the safari’s great indulgences with barely a thousand left in the wild. If you are on foot, you can find yourself within 50 meters of them."

Or spend the morning driving deeper into the bush, searching for leopards hiding in the trees, conspicuous eyes betraying their camouflage. You could spend an afternoon relaxing on the beach, or walk into buffalo country, exhilarated as a herd fiercely returns your gaze. Matusadona National Park provides one of Southern Africa’s most relaxed big-game safari experiences as it is both quiet and remote, with very few other people around. Wildlife is varied and easily spotted, and the focus is always about being able to create your own safari program."

You can smell the tension as it floats through the trees and consumes every moment from mid-afternoon until late-morning. Only in the height of the heat of the day does the apprehension of the antelope cease as the lions are spotted snoozing beneath flowing acacia branches. Zimbabwe’s flagship park is connected to the Zambezi through a large protected wilderness, which merges elephant-filled woodland into the cat-dominated plains of the Kalahari. You will be staying in a private concession, where a large water-filled pan attracts four-legged mammals from the opposing habitats. Fly here from Matusadona, and it will not be long before the big cats take center stage. Lions move lazily with their paw prints close together as their golden coats shimmer in the sun. But spot them later in the day, and there is a genuine menace to this slowness as lionesses crouch as they approach the waterhole. Baboons start shouting to send a vociferous warning to everyone having a drink. Impala pin their ears and then run, leaping clear of the high grass as they disappear into the distance. An echo of hooves alerts you to a zebra herd charging away, and it will seem that the lions will not be hunting successfully now. But the tables are turned after dark, and tomorrow morning, you may spot limbs being torn from a carcass. By spending three days in Hwange, you might also see the hunt move beyond stalking to attacking."

From the verandah, you will discover what animal likes to drink and when. The procession of wildlife changes dependent on the time of day, with large elephant herds dominating the scene after dark. On game drives, you will come to understand what animals occupy where, from the herds of wildebeest and zebra on open plains to the strange antelope who hide in the trees. With walking safaris, you hone in on the individual interactions, watching how some take their turn on sentinel duty as the others graze. Hwange proudly supports more than 100 mammal species, but the safari experience centers not on the quantity, but the clarity and quality of the individual moments: a cheetah nursing her cub in the high grass, large southern giraffe arguing with their eyes, a breeding herd of elephant so proud on the savannah. While you can never tire of the famous animals, a multi-day safari allows you to look beyond the obvious and into an ancient world that brings new impressions every moment of the day. Your safari here is flexible. By combining walks and drives, you can come to appreciate the delicacies of an environment that holds many secrets.

The former is extremely wild, with little tourist infrastructure. The Zambian side makes the wilderness accessible, while still maintaining its primitive charm. Sometimes all you see of an elephant herd are the trunks, poking out like snorkels above a reef. Buffalo swim slowly, keeping their heads clear of splashing water. Hippos do not actually swim, but rather sink to the riverbed and walk, their immense lungs holding a single breath for more than five minutes. You will see all three of these species from your suite, the daily comings and goings of the Zambezi intimately admired as you sip on cocktails or coffee. Fly east from Livingstone and most of today is relaxed, so much wildlife to see on the panoramas around the luxury camp. A boat safari continues the tranquil theme, as you cruise past the swimmers and uncover different herds along the banks. On a late-afternoon game drive, you can slowly start to notice the contrasts on this side of the river as it is far more than what you had seen before. Especially in the dry season, the permanent availability of water makes this whole area a magnet for game. And even if it is not seen on a drive or walk, there is a good chance that you will see it migrating past the camp."

On a boat safari, the hippos are just a few meters away, as are any of the big cats that drink from the shallows. During game drives, it can feel as though you are surrounded by elephants, the herd walking on both sides of the vehicle. Much like Hwange and Matusadona, a multi-day safari in this park is a means of getting closer. Different activities are more suited to witnessing different animals, and as a collective, they enable you to build a broader impression of how the giants go about their day. Create a personalized program over these two days, mixing the game drives with thrilling safari walks, along with the serenity of a boat safari along the Zambezi. A fitting and recommended conclusion to the whole safari is a boat trip that will run the length of the park’s riverfront, gazing one way to Zimbabwe and the other to Zambia.

As the grass levels decrease, you spot them beavering away, majestic carnivores that are difficult to see across most of Africa. Along with the wild dogs, the afternoon drive is a good introduction to safari and an opportunity to get accustomed to Zimbabwe’s wilderness."

        "description": "Vertical mountain slopes provide a staggering backdrop to Chizarira National Park, giving the park its name: a modification on Chijalila, a local Batonka word meaning “great barrier.” Deep jagged incisions flow beneath the mountains with canyons and ravines engulfed by lush vegetation. Naturally isolated, this 2,000 square kilometer park holds claim to being Zimbabwe’s most remote wilderness. It will be a wild bushland, a pristine landscape where leopards thrive, and a handful of animals find tranquility. Although the game densities are low, two days here will bring encounters with a selection of wildlife. However, the real experience comes from exploring such a remote land as the rocky, broken landscape is quick to make you feel humbled by nature. It will come as a real surprise if you encounter another person here. A four-wheel drive vehicle follows remote tracks before you continue the adventure on foot, wandering amongst an otherworldly landscape that could rival any backcountry experience. Stay in mobile camps and appreciate the solitude, a vast outdoor playground so devoid of human life. Occasionally a springbok skips past, an elephant bull wanders lonely, or buffalo are spotted drinking from clear natural springs. You disappear into the rhythm of nature, tuning your senses into the wild African bush. Chizarira is an excellent early stop on a Zimbabwean itinerary as it really relaxes the body and the mind before you launch into the more game-rich wilderness areas."

Elephants guide the way towards Lake Kariba, the sapphire centerpiece of the park and the water you look over from a luxurious lodge suite. Rhinos do not leave such an obvious trail, and you will spend a thrilling afternoon following their spoor, traveling with local trackers in search of Africa’s endangered icon. Stop on a clearing and wait, rather than inspect the bushes. Slowly the white rhino emerges, followed by a young calf, both strutting proudly. Goosebumps cover your arms as they walk silently past the vehicle. Black rhinos are smaller, and you will find them cantering into the bushes, one of the very timid individuals that make up the less than 1,000 that are left in the wild. Rhinos are a focal point of the safari experience here, and the guides may also allow you to track them on foot, dependent on localized conditions."

Short walks follow some of Africa’s biggest animals, and you can often stand across from elephants and buffalos, and sometimes even rhinos. Drives seek out Zimbabwe’s densest population of lions, their abundance vastly reducing the number of other predators. Prides lounge, sleeping with one eye open, imperceptibly noticing your presence. Lionesses prowl, taking elegant steps towards herds of antelope and zebra. Over two days, you can appreciate the marking of territories as revealed through grunted roars that echo for miles and the ravaged scars on young bachelor males. A safari in Matusadona is also very relaxing, with the lakeshore providing quiet hours after activities."

After an early-morning transfer by road, you enter Mana Pools National Park on a canoe, paddling with the current. This is big game country, and the animals cover the banks, elephants, and hippos clustered where vegetation rises, plus antelope herds gathered on open floodplains. The canoe safari takes you alongside them, just a few meters of water separating you from tusks and horns. Then the guide leads you off the river, into the maze of channels and lagoons that Mana Pools is famous for. Zebra splashes around, wildebeest slurp besides your paddle, and elephants use their trunks as snorkels. Not only is Mana Pools one of the great examples of untouched Africa, the canoe safaris also brings one of Africa’s most unique perspectives. Accommodation for the next two nights is at a luxury camp on the Zambezi."

Impala and nyala provide contrasting experiences as the walking safari continues, such profusion of life greeting you at almost every corner. Mana Pools is also relatively unique in that you can safely walk amongst a thick density of big game. The herds surround you, half a dozen antelope species plus the stripes of a zebra. You become part of the landscape, walking in the early morning and late afternoon, joining the movement on the plains.

You will follow a two-day trail through the park beneath strange pinnacles, gazing down on escarpments of color. Birdlife is prolific and the wildlife focus of the walk, over 300 species fluttering around a park of perennial rivers. There is a break from the big game here, although two days usually include encounters with monkeys and small antelope.

        "description": "Fly south and enter the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park, a vast unspoiled wilderness that covers three countries and spans an area bigger than many US states. There are no fences here with elephants, rhinos, and buffalos among those that roam widely. To the south is South Africa’s Kruger National Park, one of Africa’s most popular safari destinations. This region blurs seamlessly into Zimbabwe’s Gonarezhou National Park, home to the same assortment and abundance of animals, but with hardly another person in sight. Follow the map a little further north, and you will see Malilangwe, a private wildlife reserve bordering Gonarezhou. Permanent water makes this reserve a crowded meeting point for animals who cluster in the far north of The Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park. Two different safari experiences are available here and they are ideal for the final days of a safari. In Malilangwe, the safari is almost impossibly easy. Giant elephant bulls, secretive nyala and rhinos, herds of zebra and wildebeest, a propensity of predators including leopards and cheetahs all abound as this compact Big Five reserve is quick to showcase the wildest of Africa’s mammals without you having to drive too far. The region is also home to Zimbabwe’s best luxury lodge and is operated by the same people behind many of Africa’s best lodges, Singita. After the intrepid adventure of the last ten days, three nights at this lodge will return you to decadence and extravagance with a swimming pool visited by elephants, fine dining beneath the stars, huge suites with balconies overlooking the park, and the service you would expect from one of Africa’s finest properties. You can walk and game drive in the private reserve, creating a personalized program of activities that makes the best of this game-rich landscape. Activities are usually for two to three hours, leaving lots of time to relax at the lodge. The other option, which is highly recommended for one of your days, is a full-day drive into neighboring Gonarezhou National Park. You will see the same animals, but they are more widely spread with a sense of openness accompanying a drive through the shimmering red valleys. Safari is about surprise, and nowhere is this better illustrated than Gonarezhou, a wilderness that few people know about and even fewer have explored, even if it’s a continuation of the Kruger. Exploring the park means you take a picnic and create your own trails, an inspiring way to finish your journey through unknown Africa."

But check into the tented camp, and there’s a herd of elephants welcoming you. Hippos are down in the water below, and a zebra herd is grazing next to your suite. It’s all an indication of how wildlife plays an essential role almost everywhere in Zimbabwe. Your camp is set within its own wildlife reserve, with the prime attraction being the animal that gives the camp its name. Spend the afternoon relaxing at the camp, watching more than just elephants wander past, opening your ears to the strange sounds of the bush. There are only a handful of guests in the entire reserve, helping to ensure tranquility after the flight. As the afternoon ebbs away, you glide along the Zambezi, a dinner cruise opening up the wonders of this famous waterway. Hippos are emerging from the water just as you’re served your starter. Nile crocodiles are sloping into the water as sunset tones ripple across the water. Dessert is accompanied by haunting sounds, the monkeys piping up and the baboons guiding you back towards the camp."

Walk along a mystical trail, the falls appearing and then disappearing as you journey through the forest. Then the trees come to an end, and you’re alone with a mile-wide sheet of water. Spray splashes up from the chasm, and you get soaked in seconds, something that’s an essential part of the experience. Next, you see the spectacle from the air, a helicopter soaring above the river, bringing the dreamy visuals of Zimbabwe’s most famous sight. So many colors collide; floodplains and forests, remote islands and roaring water, a narrow crevasse, and the rising clouds of spray. Return to camp and the rest of the day is at your leisure, time to put your feet up and enjoy the wildlife of the reserve."

There are paw prints in the surrounding sand, indications of just how close you are to the predators, notably resident cheetahs and hyenas. Of course, there are still plenty of elephants, Hwange being famous for the trunk-swinging giants. Giraffes are equally prevalent in your first impressions with their vibrant orange markings that contrast the lush green of the grassland. The hide is nestled between Hwange’s two main habitats, hidden in the acacia woodland, and gazing over the open plains. There is no better location for experiencing Hwange’s wildlife. And what wildlife! Serval and caracal leave their prints around the camp, kudu and bushbuck roam through the camp, and you soon learn the difference between duiker and impala. Your stylish suite is beneath a cooling patch of forest, featuring a private veranda that’s perched above a waterhole. Over these three days, you’ll intimately understand the habits of those that drink there: elephants, giraffes, zebra, kudu, and buffalo. Interiors are full of rustic luxury, helping maintain a connection with the wild. Each day you will build your own program of safari activities, choosing up to four a day. Combine walks, drives during the day and night, and experience the unique vantage point of photography hides. The idea is to provide an encompassing experience, helping you connect with the raw essence of Hwange."

        "description": "A game drive at sunrise is an ideal time to find black-maned lions on the move. Suspense floats on the breeze as you see a pride loping toward a herd of blue wildebeest. The ungulates are quick, but the lionesses are many, and the scene captivates you for over an hour. Spend the middle part of the morning in one of the sunken hides, concealed from those who visit the waterhole. An elephant herd arrives, and you stare straight down at their trunks. Admire the tusks on the old bulls, then laugh at the antics of babies who chase warthogs and duiker away from the water. Of course, this is just an example of how the day could look, as the actual program will depend on your mood. It’s more specific than just activities. If there are particular animals you’re interested in, they can become the focus of any activity. After lunch, you take a walk and learn how to track steenbok and gemsbok, imposing antelopes that leave obvious clues. Footsteps crunch onto the dirt and you pass the giants, including buffalo and giraffe that give you a funny look. Within 20 minutes you’re amongst the herds, exploring the facial emotion, and understanding the peculiar behavior, and means of communication. The walk continues, and you may encounter any of the Hwange residents, other than the big predators. Relax at the camp, then complete the day with a nighttime drive, a journey that seeks out leopards on the move. A spotlight stops and the spotted hunter looks your way, lucid blue-green eyes revealing a calm menace. The leopard’s hunt continues, and your eyes must adjust to the moonlight and sounds, something that doesn’t produce great photos but creates a thrilling appreciation of the savannah at night."

        "description": "Visit Africa and certain animals are always high on the list. Elephants are unmissable in Zimbabwe; you’ll find them wherever you go. Lions are just as present in Hwange and Mana Pools. Leopards are an elusive sight but one that’s captured on a five-day safari. You’ll also experience rhinos, the endangered giant that is far more graceful than you might expect. On a morning game drive, the guide stops, seemingly in the middle of nowhere. Look around, and you see nothing. But slowly, meticulously, a white rhino and its calf amble out of the bushes. Refusing to change course, they walk straight past the vehicle. It’s a heart-racing moment, and your finger quivers on the camera shutter as you caption the image of this imposing creature; so proud and undaunted. Keep exploring, because Hwange is home to over 100 mammal species. Some are found in the woodland, others on the open savannah, and still more on vast Kalahari grasslands that can be visited on longer game drives. You will track packs of wild dogs and you will discover that there is something mystical about their effortless nomadic journeys. Seek out the rare civet and aardwolf, in the early morning or after dark. Discover one of Africa’s largest cheetah populations. Walk across the plains to truly admire the horns of roan and sable antelope, arguably Africa’s most impressive antelope species. On a single game drive, you’re likely to see two-dozen species. While on a two-hour bushwalk, you might meet 12 – 15 ungulate species, including those that are rarely seen outside Zimbabwe. Immersive and intriguing, Hwange takes you beyond traditional notions of safari. It is a park bigger than some US states, and it feels like you have it all to yourself."

        "description": "In Hwange, you see the dust spiral, and the nomads go on an endless search for water. In Mana Pools there’s water everywhere, bringing lush exotic colors and a sense of excess. Animals migrate here during the dry season, knowing there is permanent goodness in the rivers and lakes. To see them all, you are best starting off in a boat, cruising along the banks, as hundreds of mammals come to drink. A motorboat is followed by a canoe, a narrow vessel that travels into a complex web of canals. Now you are even closer, barely steps away from hippos yawning and buffalo drinking. Occasionally there are eyes hidden in the grass, like those of a lioness laying an ambush, waiting for an impala herd to drop their guard. Fly to Mana Pools and check into your next camp, a remote outpost that’s ideally situated for canoe and walking safaris. This modern camp is arguably the park’s first genuine ultra-luxe lodge, with glass-walled tents offering uninterrupted river views. Elephants are just the start of the visitors here, with nyala and spotted hyenas also regularly heard and seen around the camp. Both side-striped and black-backed jackals operate on the camp’s outskirts, stealthy figures you may spot when opening the curtains. Wetlands mean food. There’s grass to graze, fruit to find, and easy pickings for the park’s predators. You’ll find that the liquid bounty creates drama. Not just with the lions and leopards, but with breathtaking hunting displays by wild dogs, and scrappy battles amongst the smaller predators."

Impalas are scattered everywhere, and it’s as if they are dancing the ballet, dainty skips sending them clear off the grass. A herd of buffalo stares at you, chewing without pause. Following subtle tracks, you go in search of zebra, finding them grazing on the plains. Take a step closer and wait. The zebras appear uninterested. So you get closer, watching for any change in behavior. Zebra eyes meet yours, and you admire how every set of black and white stripes is different, their version of our fingerprints. Then an elephant starts rumbling across the pan, and the guide gets you back to a safe distance. Over both days here in Mana Pools, you build your own safari program, mixing water and land-based activities as you please. Walking is one perspective. Drives provide another, further opportunities to trace the predators. But the great highlight here is a kayak safari into the channels. It’s quiet, hardly a sound made by the guide’s paddle. Every sound is appreciated; the rustling of grazers, the grunt of hippos and buffalo, an elephant bull digging beneath the riverbed. And it feels like every corner you turn brings another intimate sight. From the water, you get astonishingly close to Africa’s biggest mammals."

Water is scarce during the dry season, so animals start to huddle around the surviving waterholes, or they make long dangerous journeys in search of something better. Spurts of dust follow elephant and giraffe while zebra marches in their hundreds. Kudu and springbok cluster together, black-maned lions prowl with their coats blending into the golden colors of the plains. Safari is both charming and dramatic at this time of year, Zimbabwe’s flagship park coming into peak game-viewing season.

They are getting desperate, the short grass making it hard to hide and difficult to get close. Wildebeest see them coming, and they gallop into the distance, the rumble of hooves heard as well as seen. As the safari continues, you may lose track of the elephants, so many of them converging with enthusiastic calves, boisterous infants, melancholy matriarchs, large herds, and lone bulls with astonishing tusks. Slowly, you will come to recognize the antelopes and able to distinguish the hartebeest from the eland, the impala from the roan antelope. Rhinos also occupy this park, and these months are the best time to find them with the diminishing bushes making it harder for a shy creature and harder to find quiet tranquility. And spending three days, you will have a great chance to see leopards, the stealthiest of the predators using the most surreptitious of methods to place an ambush at the waterholes. During these two days, you will mostly explore on game drives, which take you on a tour of the permanent waterholes, discovering the densest concentrations of wildlife. Walks are also a possibility, the dry plains opening up the greater possibility to walk safely through the big game of Africa. Like everywhere on this safari, the activities are completely private, and you have room to customize your own program. There are over 100 mammal species here, and in the dry season, you could expect to see over 50.

Although you cannot get as close, the motorboat helps you to uncover the parties of animals on the Zambezi’s banks in areas closed to vehicle access. The afternoon is free, and you can choose from any of the activities with your private safari continuing in one of Africa’s great wetland parks."

        "description": "A short charter flight follows the Zambezi back upriver, just four seats in a small plane that offers a window onto Zimbabwe’s wild scale. Matusadona is compact yet remote, a national park defined by the soothing waters of Lake Kariba. Check into your lodge, and it initially feels like this is the waterside escape that comes at the end of the safari. But things are not as it seems, as soon, out of the trees comes an elephant, a big bull marching through. In the distance, you see springbok and zebra clustered on open plains, and when you explore the area around the lodge, you will find black and white rhinos, both subspecies of Africa’s endangered icon. Matusadona is two destinations in one as the lake provides gentle views and an atmosphere of tranquility and the surroundings offer Zimbabwe’s great concentrations of wildlife with the rare chance to spot both species of rhino on a single drive."

        "description": "White rhinos barge across the land, horns pointing proudly, eyes staring intently. They don’t rush, as they are comfortable with their size and confident that nothing will interrupt their equanimity. Black rhinos are smaller and much timider, generally preferring to hide out in thick bushes. It is unlikely that you will see them after 10 am, as they usually return to the dense vegetation. Game drives in Matusadona are the best way to see these rhinos, but there is also an exclusive possibility to track them on foot, particularly the white rhinos when they rest in the midday sun. As with each day, your program is private and flexible, game drives and walking safari complemented by short trips on the lake, where wonderful crowds of birds keep bringing new impressions to the safari. Spend the mornings exploring, or spend them lounging by the lake. Take footsteps through the forest to follow the elephants, or create footprints in the sand with an afternoon on the beach a rejuvenating way to complete a day of safari. Drive into the park’s remote corners with a bottle of champagne and a picnic lunch, or keep the activities to less than two hours, giving you more time to savor the view from your suite verandah. You can opt to spend more time along the lakeshore where there is more wildlife, or you can move into the woodland, where it is easier to get closer, particularly to Zimbabwe’s highest density of lions. In some parks, it can feel like you are missing out if you are not exploring at every minute of the day. In Matusadona, you are always comfortable with the blend of atmospheres making for the classic end to a Zimbabwe safari."

        "title": "Victoria Falls – The Rising Waters of the Zambezi",
        "description": "Sporadic bursts of thunder swell the Zambezi and its tributaries as the water levels rise and the river picks up speed to surge past your lodge on the banks. Hippos must move and relocate to pools protected by giant boulders. The trickling sound of the dry season is replaced by the sloshing of the green season, especially since the water level reaches its zenith in late March. Today, you touch down at Victoria Falls International, and it is a short transfer to the lodge, followed by a relaxed afternoon on the banks to watch one of Africa’s great rivers thunder past. Baboons and vervet monkeys are regular visitors here, sometimes scampering across the grass, other times floating through the trees. In the late afternoon, you embark on a boat that cruises the Zambezi with drinks served as you go in search of hippos and crocodiles out of the water. The crocodiles do not hide in the dense reeds along the banks as they bustle their way through the green, alluring animals that continue the feeling that Victoria Falls is extremely remote. The cocktails and wines continue to flow as you explore the Zambezi at a slow pace, with a vibrant African sunset over the woodland. A three-course dinner is included on the cruise with time to relax on the river and start listening to the animals of the night as both the four-legged giants and the rowdy insects move through the evening. This sunset dinner cruise is a gentle introduction to the country and an easy way to start the wildlife experience."

        "description": "When the Zambezi bulges, Victoria Falls truly falls as water levels rise from November onwards, peaking in late March and April. It is during this time of year that you can fully appreciate the scale of this waterfall as this is the world’s largest sheet of falling water, a mile wide and over 100 meters deep. But most impressively, it is the depth of the falling water as in peak flow, upwards of 700 million liters drop into the abyss every minute. Rising from the narrow chasm is the spray, bouncing back off the Lower Zambezi, sometimes ascending in clouds that reach 400 meters above the falls. You can see and hear this spray from your lodge, and today you will stand next to it. At first, the walking trail is sheltered with the thick bushes keeping you dry though you are almost deafened by the monotonous groan of the falls, nature’s version of an industrial power tool. As the bushes open, you will find a rainbow, curling over 270 degrees through the canyon, moving diaphanously with the spray. Keep walking, stepping onto the rocky cliffs on one side of the chasm, opposite Victoria Falls. Now the water really tumbles, thick and proud, roaring and relentless. Whole sections of the walkway are consumed by mist, and within a single second you’re soaked through, Victoria Falls raining back down on you. While this isn’t the best time to get great photos, the immersion in power is astonishing. For the aesthetics, you might consider the option of a helicopter tour."

        "title": "Hwange National Park (North) – Game Drives in a Time of Babies",
        "description": "An unbroken wilderness runs along western Zimbabwe, a migratory route used by elephants that travel from Zambia, past Victoria Falls, and to Hwange, the mesmerizing national park at the heart of most Zimbabwe safaris. Today’s first two hours of the drive are on a tarred road before you veer onto a rutted four-wheel drive track into the park. Travel will be slow going at this time of year, but that is part of the appeal as you will have a real sense of adventure as your Land Rover splashes through puddles and pebbles that cover the vehicle in the mud. You will be going off of the beaten track, and you can feel it, especially as the nearby elephants flap their ears and stamp their feet in the trees. The northern section of Hwange is the most visited, famed for elephant concentrations and one of Africa’s greatest diversities of mammals. Over 100 different mammals can be seen here, from rare mongoose species to chacma baboons and bat-eared foxes to large-spotted genets, eland to greater kudu. This time of year sees the grasses rise and thick bushes form for food for the grazers and hiding spaces for the predators. Fresh colors make for outstanding photos, particularly of elephants and buffalos charging through the flourishing grass. While some animals can hide, all of the prey must huddle together, choosing safety in numbers in an attempt to avoid the carnivores. Not only is the food abundant, but it is also rich in nutrients during the green season and the best time for all manner of animals to raise their calves. Over these two days, there will be no end to the baby footsteps seen across the landscape. Reedbuck calves are small and defenseless while the newborn duiker are prey for swooping birds. Adult eland and kudu are too big for cheetahs, but their youngest is not. Oo over these two days, you will take game drives amongst this time of abundance, following the antelopes to open plains, where the predators are waiting to pounce. While it is harder to spot lions and leopards at this time of year, it is easier to find them hunting. There are few sightings of lazy animals, so it is just two days of raw drama and animals colliding upon blankets of color."

        "description": "Hwange is transforming, and you will have the best seats to see it all as your slow train rumbles through the park from north to south. Southern giraffe grace the horizon, their vibrant markings colliding with the flowering trees. Red hartebeest amble in small herds, such imposing antelope close to the tracks will engage your interest. Blue wildebeest are widely scattered, constants on this journey through the park. The Hwange train journey is one of Africa’s unique safari experiences and a chance to sit back and watch the landscape’s transformation as the woodland slips into the boundless panoramas of the plains. You will arrive in time for lunch at a new lodge on the Ngamo Plains before an afternoon game drives continue the theme of babies and breeding."

        "title": "Hwange National Park (Ngamo Plains) – Concentration of Big Game",
        "description": "The rains are not continuous, and it will not thunder all day, and nor does it rain every day either. High pressure builds, and the clouds unfurl in brief, yet violent, afternoon storms. You will not need to pack a raincoat because nobody can be outside at this time, so the vehicle’s pop-up roof will come down, or you will run into the shelter of the lodge. Within 15 minutes, the height of the storm will pass, and usually within an hour, it is all over. Step back outside and be inhaling the fresh scent, watching impala and steenbok shaking off their fur like dogs do when they jump from a river within moments. Within two days of the storm, you will see the flowers and all manner of exotic colors spouting amongst the grass. While the brief rain interludes can be annoying, watching Africa’s plains bloom is exquisite. Wildlife converges on the Ngamo Plains during the green season. Much like the great wildebeest migration in East Africa, massive herds gather to give birth and breed. When the calves are strong enough, they will move on, returning towards permanent water sources from April onwards. The difference with the great wildebeest migration of East Africa is that these animals move in a hundred contrasting directions, plowing their own path, rather than following the same pattern. In a single view, you can take in duiker, grysbok, impala, wildebeest, reedbuck, waterbuck, and bushbuck. Over the two days, you can get close to sable and roan antelope, plus eland, kudu, and buffalo as they are raising their calves. Unlike in East Africa, this is a congregation of diverse species, all attracted by the same bountiful grass. With all of this prey comes the predators with lion pride spending the day resting in the high grass, your raised vantage point allowing you a glimpse of their flowing manes. Leopards and cheetahs have many places to hide, and you are guided by sounds as baboons and birds shout vociferously, alerting all the animals to a menacing predator. Sometimes the antelope guide you to a carnivore, a herd of upturned ears indicating they suspect something is lurking. Often the best approach in the green season is to park, and then wait for the action to unfold. Gradually a lion pride emerges, showing itself, but simply inspecting the options for a nighttime hunt. A cheetah pounces from nowhere, a few rapid steps to a duiker calf that has strayed a little too far from the herds. Hyena roams amongst the animals, polarized between states of disinterest and vicious snarling. They are looking for the very weak, overtly searching for any herd that does not properly protect their calves behind a barrier of horns. With a kill comes the scavengers, jackals the cheekiest in looking for scraps, and vultures the telltale sign of a bloodied carcass in the grass. The focus of the game drives will be the interactions, but you will also have continued insights into the charm of safari as the giraffe and elephant wander elegantly past the camp."

        "description": "Most safari days start early as dawn is the best for predatory scenes. This morning, there will be a change in pace as you lie in for breakfast with views over the plains. You are then driven south and through Bulawayo and to Matobo Hills National Park, arriving for lunch at a luxurious lodge back-dropped by glowing red boulders. This is Matobo Hills, or the “World’s View” as Cecil Rhodes called it. The landscape enchants, and the lack of lions and elephants make it easy for walking safaris as the high grass makes them dangerous in Hwange at this time of year. And you’re not just walking with zebra and antelope, you are following the spoor of rhinos. Creep closer, staying downwind of the giants. They rarely stir in the mid-afternoon heat, and you will be close enough to see the rise and fall of humongous bellies. Even in a prostrate position, there is no denying their size as their sharpened horn rises above a gargantuan jawline. These are white rhinos, the easiest to spot, but in the park, you will also find black rhinos, witnessed from a greater distance yet just as impressive. After the walk, you will be picked up in a game vehicle and drive back to the lodge while taking in the eclectic cast of other wildlife in the park."

        "description": "Enjoy another relaxed morning before you wander past the giraffe and rhinos, ascending to the red boulders that stand over the park. History is inscribed on the stone, paintings left behind by San bushmen scrawled into small caverns and overhangs. Each piece of rock art is a chapter in the local history book, depicting a scene, leaving a message for the next San who passed through. An expert guide helps you decipher the scenes and feel the atmosphere of a distant time, a time when tribes effortlessly coexisted with the wildlife. After lunch, your afternoon is free, and you will have the choice of a game drive or a walking safari."
