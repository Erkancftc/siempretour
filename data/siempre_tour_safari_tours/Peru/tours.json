    "generalInfo": "Boasting the greatest diversity of mammal life in the world and being one of the birding hotspots in the 4th most diverse country for bird life; Manu National Park in Peru’s Upper Amazon Rainforest is a wildlife enthusiasts dream.<br/><br/>Home to literally thousands of animals the rainforests and riverways of Manu are home to huge numbers of wildlife, clay licks offer chances to see dozens of parrots and macaws together, the rivers are home to caiman and giant otters and the forests themselves are teeming with birds and primates everywhere you look.<br/><br/>But the rainforest is not the only thing that the Peru has to offer, we will also travel into the Andes and visit the historically and culturally important site of Machu Picchu before going off in search of a very different set of wildlife in the arid north of Peru. <br/><br/>Our final stop will be in a small private reserve that takes in injured and orphaned Andean bears with a view to rehabilitating them into the wild. Along with the wild population of bears here we hope to see certain species that are not found in other areas of Peru.<br/><br/>The north-west of Peru is an undervalued yet wonderful part of this large and diverse country. Exploring this region and looking for it's wildlife is a great way to see various species which are not commonly seen elsewhere. Animals like spectacled bears (the original inspiration for Paddington Bear), Sechuran foxes, Andean condors and white-winged guans are all seen with ease in the amazing Chaparri Eco-Reserve.  <br/><br/>This unique trip transports you from the central highlands and the former seat of power for the Incan people down into the steamy and diverse Amazon rainforest before heading north and to the dry forests of the far north-west of Peru. All in all this wildlife exploration is one of the best and most comprehensive available for this country.<br/><br/>Throughout the itinerary you'll be accompanied by expert full time guides, often including: professional zoologists (where available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us), English speaking local naturalists and a local driver for all transfers. Being in the company of a naturalist is the best way to learn more about ecology and animal behaviour and will help you identify different species and interpret behaviours. <br/>Each location and habitat visited on this tour is unique and home to a set of wildlife different from the next. <br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner where mentioned). There will be filtered or boiled water available for each guest each day. We have our own private AC vehicles with an excellent driver for all vehicular transfers. You will have a local cultural and naturalist guides. The guides have spent years in Peru and know the places and wildlife and cultural monuments and sites intimately. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>We choose September - November as a good time for this itinerary, this is due to the weather being drier during this time of year than the northern hemisphere summer.  <br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced local naturalist or guides as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• Our local Machu Picchu expert guide is provided for your guided visits to the site and is an expert in the region and Incan history in general.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it.<br/>• This specific wildlife tour is one of the few in the world that explores remote and wilderness areas of Ecuador in the company of expert guides.<br/>• We provide camera traps for you to set up and you are free to use any and all of the photographs and videos that this camera trap gets during your stay.  <br/>• All the above reasons give this, our unique Peru Wildlife &amp; Cultural Holiday a great success rate of seeing rare wildlife. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Peru which explore other areas and focus on other species such as the Amazon rainforest and more specific birding holidays as well as many other species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/> <br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour visits three distinct locations, firstly the Incan capital of Cusco and the historical and world famous site of Machu Picchu in the Central Andes and then we travel into the remote and wild upper reaches of the Amazon on the eastern slopes of the Andes before heading north-west to the dry coastal forests and in particular the Chaparri eco-reserve.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>Some of this trip is at relatively high altitude and whilst there is not much walking (in terms of trekking) on this itinerary, we do walk around Machu Picchu and have walks in the lower altitude in the Amazon and Chaparri Reserve. There can be uneven ground and so we advice to be used to walking for 1-2 hours in heat and some experience of being at altitude is good but far from necessary.<br/>There is one optional hike up to a view point overlooking Machu Picchu, this is a steep climb and can be physically demanding, however it is optional.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking. We can also include specialist equipment on request such as camera traps, infrared cameras, thermal imaging equipment and spotlights. .<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 15 Years Old",

The drive usually takes around 8-10 hours and we will have some breaks where we can experience some of the Andean villages and small farmsteads as we pass by. The architecture is a mix of Quechua and colonial which makes for a very scenic drive before we reach a pass that overlooks the Amazon Basin. Along the way you may see puna teals, Andean ducks and puna ibis in the high altitude habitats and then as we descend a little to get to the Cock of the Rock Lodge you will begin to hear the calls of birds such as quetzals, trogons and wood rails, and see a variety of orchids that grow in the perpetually damp cloud forest. Our lodge for the night is also home to the tamest and most accessible Andean cock-of-the-rock lekking site in the world. Also found around the lodge (alongside the plethora of bird species) are woolly monkeys, brown capuchin monkeys and very occassionally Andean bears. Some of the more common and impressive bird species we will try and see here are emerald toucanet, torrent duck, golden-headed quetzal, grey-breasted mountain-toucan, Amazonia umbrellabird, blue-banded toucanet, fruit-eating tanagers, red-crested cotinga, banded-tail fruit-eater, tyrant flycatchers and the blue-crowned mot-mot. If we are in time (depending on the traffic, road conditions and how often we stop) we will visit the lek this evening to see the lodge’s namesake bird before retiring for the evening.

Around the Cocha Salvador it is possible to see giant otters and around the camp itself it can pay to keep an eye out for brown-mantled tamarins, black-capped squirrel monkeys, gray woolly monkeys and Peruvian spider monkeys. Being so deep into the forest lots of the wildlife is visible around the camp and with a full day tomorrow we hope to see many species that are difficult or impossible to see elsewhere.

The centre is located on the Madre de Dios River and the wildlife is abundant here, as well as trails and canopy towers the centre is also close to a salt lick that is very productive for macaws and tapirs and also two large oxbow lakes that are good places for wildlife watching. Travelling along the river to the centre we will try and spot aquatic wildlife such as caiman, giant otters and hoatzins as well as other wildlife. Once we arrive at the centre you will have some time to settle in and familiarise yourself with the private lodge located in its own 16,190 ha. rain forest reserve adjacent to the one million-acre protected area named the “Amarakaeri Reserved Zone”. Over the next three full days we will explore this area in full and finish our exploration of the Peruvian upper Amazon. (all meals included today)."

        "description": "Machu Picchu - Travelling & Sightseeing This morning we will leave the hotel and be taken to the train station, from here we will get the train to the Sacred Valley. The Vistadome train passes through picturesque Andean scenery, passing traditional villages, Inca ruins and rushing rivers. You will descend 1,300m through the Sacred Valley of the Incas and follow the Urubamba River to Aguas Calientes (which is now called Machu Picchu Pueblo). After dropping off your luggage at the station we’ll take the 20-minute bus ride up to Machu Picchu, perched 600 meters above the river. After lunch your archeological guide will take you on a walking tour of the site. It is important to have your camera equipment in a small bag ready to take on the bus to the site so that we can leave the train and catch the bus straight away. The famous lost city of the Inca is one of the most magical and mysterious places on Earth. Situated on the spine of a jungle cloaked granite peak towering some 600 meters above an entrenched meander of the roaring river below, the site is frequently shrouded in misty clouds pierced by the powerful equatorial sun. Constructed from precisely sculptured granite blocks carefully joined with the projecting exposed stone of the surrounding mountain, the site may well be the finest architectural achievement of the new world. In the late afternoon we will head back to the town and have the rest of the day to relax in the stunning Andean surroundings. Tomorrow we will make the climb up Huayna Picchu which offers stunning views over the ruins. (breakfast is the only meal included today)."

        "description": "Machu Picchu - Sightseeing This morning we will once again get the bus to the ruins to further explore the vast city of Machu Picchu, at 10am we will start the ascent of Hauyna Picchu (this means Young Peak) and is a peak in which the Urumbamba River bends. This is a pretty hard climb and for people not wanting to do this you can spend the day around Machu Picchu and take in the sites at your own pace. The Incas built a trail up the side of the Huayna Picchu and built temples and terraces on its top. The peak of Huayna Picchu is about 2,720m above sea level, or about 360m higher than Machu Picchu. The top of the mountain was the residence for the high priest and the local virgins. Every morning before sunrise, the high priest with a small group would walk to Machu Picchu to signal the coming of the new day. The Temple of the Moon, one of the three major temples in the Machu Picchu area, is nestled on the side of the mountain and is situated at an elevation lower than Machu Picchu. Adjacent to the Temple of the Moon is the Great Cavern, another sacred temple with fine masonry. The other major local temples in Machu Picchu are the Temple of the Condor, Temple of Three Windows, Principal Temple, “Unfinished Temple”, and the Temple of the Sun, also called the Torreon. Only 400 people are allowed to climb the peak per day and we will be in the latter group as the clouds will hopefully have lifted allowing for excellent views over the ruins. The climb is steep and can be slippery when wet so we are best to take our time in getting up to the top. After exploring the site more we will get back to the hotel (via the bus) and then board the train back to Cusco. The rest of the evening will be free to rest.

    "generalInfo": "Peru is a well known holiday destination, whether it is to explore the wonderful and world famous ruins of Machu Picchu or to experience the upper Amazon rainforest there are many reasons to visit Peru. But few trips combine the very best wildlife watching in the Amazon Rainforest and visits to South America's most iconic historical site. This is one such trip and we are sure that anyone wishing to visit Peru for the first time and get an appreciation for what Peru is all about.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>Boasting the greatest diversity of mammal life in the world and being one of top bird watching locations in the world (ranking number 4 for the number of bird species); Manu National Park in Peru’s Upper Amazon Rainforest is a wildlife enthusiasts dream. <br/><br/>It is often very difficult to see a lot of wildlife in the dense thick tropical rainforests, but what makes Manu National Park so special is there are wide open rivers where wildlife can be see on the banks, ox-bow lakes which accumulate wildlife, canopy walk ways and towers which allow great views across the forest as well as salt and clay licks which provide wildlife with much needed minerals and attract them from miles around. <br/><br/>These factors make the wildlife watching in Manu National Park better than most other locations in the upper Amazon Rainforest. It is the salt and clay licks in particular which are adored by many species of parrots and macaws. <br/><br/>The pristine lakes and rivers that seldom have visitors are home to many caiman and families of giant otters and of course the forests around Manu are home to some of the Amazon’s most iconic and accessible wildlife. Whilst spotted jaguars may still be very difficult the smaller mammals (particularly primates) and of course the birds should entertain us as we delve deeper and deeper into the Amazon. <br/><br/>Whilst in Manu we will visit 4 different lodges / camps. The first being in the cloud forests on the border of the Amazon and home to a variety of wildlife that is not usually found in the rainforest further down. But the rainforest is not the only thing that the Peru has to offer, we will also travel into the Andes and visit the historically and culturally important site of Machu Picchu, one of the true wonders of the world.<br/><br/>Machu Picchu is regarded as one of the 7 Wonders of the World and is one of the most iconic and wonderful locations in the world to visit, so many people come and see the ruins and we will spend 2 full days exploring the site and getting expect guidance into its history and the cultural importance of the site to ancient and modern Peruvians.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner where mentioned). There will be filtered or boiled water available for each guest each day.

So we will spend the day with our local expert guide and see what animals we can find, in general during the day the wildlife that is readily seen in the rainforest are primates, aquatic animals and also the hundreds of different bird species. After dark we can also try and find some of the nocturnal species such as opossums, night monkeys, caimans and possible very rare mammals that only come out in the dead of the night.

        "description": "Manu National Park - Wildlife Watching This morning will be our last around Aguaje Camp and we will have some time to see the wildlife again before heading on the river again and this time heading to Manu Wildlife Centre. We will take a packed lunch and spend a good portion of the day slowly travelling to the centre and trying to see wildlife along the river banks as we travel. The centre is located on the Madre de Dios River and the wildlife is abundant here, as well as trails and canopy towers the centre is also close to a salt lick that is very productive for macaws and tapirs and also two large oxbow lakes that are good places for wildlife watching. Travelling along the river to the centre we will try and spot aquatic wildlife such as caiman, giant otters and hoatzins as well as other wildlife. Once we arrive at the centre you will have some time to settle in and familiarise yourself with the private lodge located in its own 16,190 ha. rain forest reserve adjacent to the one million-acre protected area named the “Amarakaeri Reserved Zone”. Over the next three full days we will explore this area in full and finish our exploration of the Peruvian upper Amazon. (all meals included today)."

The Vistadome train passes through picturesque Andean scenery, passing traditional villages, Inca ruins and rushing rivers. You will descend 1,300m through the Sacred Valley of the Incas and follow the Urubamba River to Aguas Calientes (which is now called Machu Picchu Pueblo). After dropping off your luggage at the station we’ll take the 20-minute bus ride up to Machu Picchu, perched 600 meters above the river. After lunch your archeological guide will take you on a walking tour of the site. It is important to have your camera equipment in a small bag ready to take on the bus to the site so that we can leave the train and catch the bus straight away. The famous lost city of the Inca is one of the most magical and mysterious places on Earth. Situated on the spine of a jungle cloaked granite peak towering some 600 meters above an entrenched meander of the roaring river below, the site is frequently shrouded in misty clouds pierced by the powerful equatorial sun. Constructed from precisely sculptured granite blocks carefully joined with the projecting exposed stone of the surrounding mountain, the site may well be the finest architectural achievement of the new world. In the late afternoon we will head back to the town and have the rest of the day to relax in the stunning Andean surroundings. Tomorrow we will make the climb up Huayna Picchu which offers stunning views over the ruins. (breakfast is the only meal included today)."

The Incas built a trail up the side of the Huayna Picchu and built temples and terraces on its top. The peak of Huayna Picchu is about 2,720m above sea level, or about 360m higher than Machu Picchu. The top of the mountain was the residence for the high priest and the local virgins. Every morning before sunrise, the high priest with a small group would walk to Machu Picchu to signal the coming of the new day. The Temple of the Moon, one of the three major temples in the Machu Picchu area, is nestled on the side of the mountain and is situated at an elevation lower than Machu Picchu. Adjacent to the Temple of the Moon is the Great Cavern, another sacred temple with fine masonry. The other major local temples in Machu Picchu are the Temple of the Condor, Temple of Three Windows, Principal Temple, “Unfinished Temple”, and the Temple of the Sun, also called the Torreon. Only 400 people are allowed to climb the peak per day and we will be in the latter group as the clouds will hopefully have lifted allowing for excellent views over the ruins. The climb is steep and can be slippery when wet so we are best to take our time in getting up to the top. After exploring the site more we will get back to the hotel (via the bus) and then board the train back to Cusco. The rest of the evening will be free to rest.

    "generalInfo": "The north-west of Peru is an undervalued yet wonderful part of this large and diverse country. Exploring this region and looking for it's wildlife is a great way to see various species which are not commonly seen elsewhere. Animals like spectacled bears (the original inspiration for Paddington Bear), Sechuran foxes, Andean condors and white-winged guans are all seen with ease in the amazing Chaparri Eco-Reserve.  <br/><br/>This trip combines the dry forests of the north with the world famous cultural and historic site of Machu Picchu in the central Andes.<br/><br/>This unique trip brings you closer to rare wildlife and allows you to experience the Incan wonder of engineering like never before. The small private reserve of Chaparri takes in injured and orphaned Andean bears with a view to rehabilitating them into the wild, so you can see their project and understand how they are working tirelessly to protect one of the most endangered and enigmatic species in the whole of South America. the captive rehabilitated bears live here along with an increasing wild population of bears and we hope to see certain species that are not found in other areas of Peru.<br/><br/>Throughout the itinerary you'll be accompanied by expert full time guides, often including: professional zoologists (where available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us), English speaking local naturalists and a local driver for all transfers. Being in the company of a naturalist is the best way to learn more about ecology and animal behaviour and will help you identify different species and interpret behaviours. <br/>Each location and habitat visited on this tour is unique and home to a set of wildlife different from the next. <br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner where mentioned). There will be filtered or boiled water available for each guest each day. We have our own private AC vehicles with an excellent driver for all vehicular transfers. You will have a local cultural and naturalist guides. The guides have spent years in Peru and know the places and wildlife and cultural monuments and sites intimately. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>We choose September - November as a good time for this itinerary, this is due to the weather being drier during this time of year than the northern hemisphere summer.  <br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced local naturalist or guides as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• Our local Machu Picchu expert guide is provided for your guided visits to the site and is an expert in the region and Incan history in general.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it.<br/>• This specific wildlife tour is one of the few in the world that explores remote and wilderness areas of Ecuador in the company of expert guides.<br/>• We provide camera traps for you to set up and you are free to use any and all of the photographs and videos that this camera trap gets during your stay.  <br/>• All the above reasons give this, our unique Peru Wildlife &amp; Cultural Holiday a great success rate of seeing rare wildlife. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Peru which explore other areas and focus on other species such as the Amazon rainforest and more specific birding holidays as well as many other species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/> <br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour visits two distinct locations, firstly the Incan capital of Cusco and the historical and world famous site of Machu Picchu in the Central Andes and then we travel north-west to the dry coastal forests and in particular the Chaparri eco-reserve.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>Some of this trip is at relatively high altitude and whilst there is not much walking (in terms of trekking) on this itinerary, we do walk around Machu Picchu and have walks in the lower altitude Chaparri Reserve. There can be uneven ground and so we advice to be used to walking for 1-2 hours in heat and some experience of being at altitude is good but far from necessary.<br/>There is one optional hike up to a view point overlooking Machu Picchu, this is a steep climb and can be physically demanding, however it is optional.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking. We can also include specialist equipment on request such as camera traps, infrared cameras, thermal imaging equipment and spotlights. We also provide all snorkelling equipment onboard the boat in the Galapagos.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 15 Years Old",

Various buildings have lavish balconies that wrap around the entire second floor, decorated with detailed wooden railings. The scent of sugar fills the streets from milled sugar cane juice made fresh from street venders. Board another boat for an excursion along the river where you can settle into the exquisite accommodation of Posada Amazonas, located up river from Puerto Maldonado. Watch the speed of the black and white Pied Lapwing as it maneuvers through the sky along the edge of the canopy. Black Skimmers skate across the water’s surface in search of fish, the sound of rippling water rises into the air. Arrive at the beautiful and unique Posada Amazonas where wooden bridges stretch over the lush Amazon surface. The thatched roofs of the resort blend into the canopy from a distance.

The sounds of bustling birds sing in the distance. Venture out to explore the bustle of the jungle and come across the fabulous clay lick. The cliff side is filled with natural vitamins within the mineral rich soil, hovering beneath lush green vines. The clay shines a faded pink in the morning sun while macaws and parrots flap their wings, caw at one another, and climb along the cliff snapping at the wall. Stunning blues and reds wave into the air with each wing flap of the macaw. Parrots glow green and yellow against the hue of the clay. From the wall it is a lovely and quick hike through open vines and lingering tree branches to reach Tres Chimbadas Lake. The water is serene, mirroring the sky and the surrounding trees along the shore. Whether on a boat or at the edges of the observation deck, you can watch the water come to life with turtles slipping along the surface or giant river otters sunbathing on the shore. They are fast in the water but large on land reaching over five-and-a-half feet long. Their tails help propel them through the fresh lake and to blend in with fallen branches. Atop the 100 foot observation deck you can view the lake and the wildlife almost from within the canopy of the trees themselves. The kaleidoscope of toucans is iridescent against the leaves. Macaws radiate a deep blue against the tree bark. The peaceful moments above the Amazon give you a deeper connection to the majesty of the wild and the sensations of the incredible."

The air is crisp and cold along the cobblestone streets of the city. The stones are a vast difference from the wooden walkways and earthen paths of the Amazon. The cologne of burnt sugar follows you through the streets, along with the tanginess of Pisco, the traditional Peruvian spirit. Enjoy the remainder of the day on a tour through the city and its surroundings to experience the collection and connection of Spanish and Incan remains. The Plaza de Armas is considered the main square of Cusco and looks like the capitol of a city in Spain. It is easy to see that much of colonial Cusco was built on the foundations of the Incan stonework and layout. Santo Domingo Church is considered to be the mother of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cusco filled with history and an incredible amount of colonial artwork having transitioned into more of a museum in recent years. The church was once the ancient Temple of the Sun, home to gold lined walls and Spanish dreams of El Dorado. Although the foundation of the original structure remains, the Spanish church rose in its stead. The church is constructed with mortar and stone giving the structure a medieval look and a textured feel. The spire is adorned with a dome and various smaller spires that wrap around the bell tower. The magnitude of the church is impressive; from its entrance it would seem that the church was two stories; however, as you journey through the building you find that the church follows the downward slope of the street, leading into lush gardens that lay beneath the looming stone. The flowers that spread along the courtyard give a gentle bouquet to the coarse and aged grit. The beauty of Cusco is filled in its layers of history, along with its hidden and not so hidden gems, from the Spanish facades to the Incan ruins."

The ruins of Pisac sit along a plateau giving a tremendous view of the surrounding valley and the encircling mountains. The stones shine a rich red and pink in the morning sun, in contrast to the deep green of the valley. Terraces climb the sloping mountains like stairs. The citadel sits at the top of the terraces, the structures still intact; the aged brick open to the elements and fragile against your skin. Continue to the royal estate of an Inca Emperor at Ollantaytambo. The site was once the capital of the Incan empire during the resistance of the Spanish. The scent of roasted choclo, large kernel corn, drifts from the town and lingers against the stones of the ruins. Steep terraces climb up a central hill of the site, surrounded by sheer rock making the area look more like a fortress than a religious center. Each tier stretches the width of the mountainside and clambers up the valley from the river below, marked with one set of stairs. The gentle trickle of water rises from “The Bath of the Princess,” a single stone with tiered designs carved into a fountain that sits at the base of the ruins. The valley is lush with incredible vegetation and history spreading through the hills."

Climb the stone steps that take you higher to the plateau where the rocky walls open and give way to the expanse of the Lost City.

In the opposite direction you can see the three pillars of the Sun Gate sitting above the clouds and looking down on the city. The grass is soft and lush. The ruins give a faint musk of wet stone. Terraces continue to tier the mountainside. The hitching post of the sun stands at a tall and open point; it’s large, round stone standing above the city, within the confines of the remaining walls, continuing to tell the time."

Llamas graze on the rich grass, their mouths moving sideways with each bite. Once at the Sun Temple you can see carvings circle around the tower to pinpoint the position of the sun during the summer solstice. Rock slabs and stones surround the structure, but the most recognized detail about the Sun Temple is the view. The entire city of Machu Picchu is open to you like a postcard, from the details of the ruins to the peak of Huayna Picchu. The clouds have long dispersed and your view of the Lost City of the Incas is nothing less than breathtaking.

Islands decorate the horizon; however, a few islands seem to shimmer in the morning light. They drift with the wake of the lake and your boat nestles into a small dock. You have arrived at one of the famous floating islands of the Uros. The islands are made with dried totora shoots, wound and woven to make a steady surface. You can feel the rough shell of the dried grass on the soles of your feet. The fragrance drifts through the open air of the lake. The houses are made from the same reeds as the island itself. The locals are as colorful as the textiles you saw in Pisac market, bright pinks and reds gleaming along the clear waters of the lake. After the floating island you will continue along Lake Titicaca until you come to the gentle natural harbor of Taquile Island, a stationary island almost 30 miles east of Puno. The slope of the island is steep from shore to tip with terraces that stretch along the sides of the island allowing for agriculture and irrigation. The town sits along a tiny plateau with some homes edging along the less steep slopes of the hills. The roofs are a bright pink while the stone buildings keep the interior cool in the summer and warm in the winter. At the top of the island you can see the expanse of the lake, where the vastness of the water comes to light within the main square of the town. The sun meanders across the sky and you make your way back to the boat to return to the shores of Puno."

        "description": "The sparkling clear waters of Lake Titicaca drift beneath you as you fly over the Andes and away from the undulating mountains and vibrant colors. Arrive back in Lima and settle into your luxurious accommodations, located in the beautiful neighborhood of Miraflores. Stroll along the winding walkways where the scent of the sea blows in on the back of the breeze. The Kiss, a large statue in Lover’s Park, showcases two people wrapped in an eternal embrace overlooking the ocean. The cool air of the ocean sweeps across the city and brings you back to the memories of the Machu Picchu and sitting amidst the clouds."

        "description": "Lima stretches out like a distant oasis as you make your way out of the city and into the arid desert of Ica, which is also an important agricultural region of Peru. The sweet smell of grapes and dry earth stretches across the open desert plain. When you arrive in Ica you will board a sightseeing plane and ascend into the open sky to view the famous and mysterious Palpa and Nazca Lines. Scattered around the Nazca plateau, the lines are large geoglyphs showing a variety of natural and geometrical objects, from a bird to a monkey, carved into the earth and stretched over an expansive area only visible from the sky. Continue on to the Haucachina Lagoon to experience the oasis within the sand dunes of the desert. It feels as if you have traveled to the Sahara, with dunes rising and surrounding you in every direction. The palm trees sway in the desert breeze. The natural spring of the oasis is cool against your skin. The sun is warm as it drifts across the sky. From secluded relaxation along the water to the loud rush of adrenaline that comes with dune buggies, around the oasis you can soak in the sun or the sand, both offering the warm embrace of the desert before arriving in the town of Paracas."

        "description": "Today you will venture away from the desert oasis of Paracas and cruise along the cool, sweet ocean to the Ballestas Islands. The mist is refreshing and cool blowing in the breeze, while the fresh saltwater scents wraps around you. Look back at shore and see the stationary candelabra of Paracas drawn into the hillside like the Nazca Lines. The Ballestas Islands are a series of rock formations that have become a haven for wildlife along the Peruvian coast. Over the crash of waves you can hear sea lions barking. Their slick bodies lounge in the sun along the shore. Sunlight shines through the craggy holes in the rocky islands like tunnels to nowhere. Once on shore you will journey to the stunning Lagunillas located in the Paracas National Reserve. You can see the arid hills reach the corners of the sea and roll into the horizon. Climb the rocky terrain and look out into the water, the coarse earth hard against your palms. You can hear the crash of waves and the soft whisper of the breeze. Enjoy a delicious and rich lunch at San Jose in Chincha, a colonial hacienda that dates back to the 17th century. The hacienda stretches the length of a city block with arches opening the heart of the building to the outside world. The opulence of the building and the decadence of the food seems like it couldn’t have changed in almost 400 years. After lunch you will return to Lima for your flight home. From the winding eclecticism of Lima to the magical wildlife of the Amazon, the cultural sensations of Lake Titicaca to the unique lines that decorate the Nazca plain, you have traversed Peru and have seen that the city of Machu Picchu that floats in the clouds and the oasis of Paracas as it twinkles beneath the sun. The world is filled with wonders; however, none can beat the Inca-credible wonders of Peru. If you'd like to extend your Peru vacation, take a look at the trip reviews for Machu Picchu . You will get ideas and read about what other travelers enjoyed in Peru."
