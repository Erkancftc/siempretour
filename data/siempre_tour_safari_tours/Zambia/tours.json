This itinerary is available seasonally from the 1st May to the 31st October. <br/><br/>We have designed this itinerary as remedy, not only does it include two fantastic camps that have managed to blend rustic luxury with a pure safari experience of old, but it allows you to spend five nights in each area. <br/><br/>The first camp is the fantastic Kutali Camp in the Lower Zambezi National Park. This park boasts some of the best scenery and wildlife sightings to match of any park in Africa and as well as this you have the flexibility to explore by game drive vehicle, walking safari, boat safari or canoe trip. <br/><br/>The second camp, Musekese, is located in the heart of the vast Kafue National Park, it was the first camp to open in this area and thus helps to protect a vast area of the park, previously forgotten about. Again you have a range of activities on offer to explore this rugged park and you can be sure you will do so in almost complete exclusivity.<br/><br/>Both camps are powered by solar panels at the camps.",

Beside the river, there is a hippo out of the water with a curious face standing upon its thick shoulders. You are watching it all from the camp, and you get your first introduction to the area’s inhabitants before your first day of private game drives. Over these four days, you are staying in the Luamfwa Concession in the south of the park, close to the Luangwa River which is a magnet for all kinds of wild game. At least sixty mammal species can be seen here as they wander through the mopane woodland and scattered savanna. Spotting it all is remarkably easy, and you will quickly discover that a Zambian safari is not a glimpse into the wild, but an absolute immersion. Your game drives are private and tailored to your interests. On this first full day, the guide will recommend a morning and afternoon drive, exploring distinctive habitats within the park. Elephants dominate the trees with their trails of destruction as conspicuous as their whirling trunks. Kudu and eland cluster in small herds and are easily distinguishable from the abundant impala. Carnivores are prolific in this southern area of the park. Lions are relatively easy to find during the daylight hours, and leopards are a particular specialty of South Luangwa. Of the Big Five, it is only rhinos you will not see here, but these private game drives showcase how an African safari is about so much more than ticking off the famous giants."

        "description": "Nature’s orchestra becomes louder at dawn. Elephants sound like a sporadic brass band, lions emit long baritone roars, yellow baboons hold the harmony together, and some of the park’s 400 bird species add a smattering of treble. It is a beautiful wake-up call and an immediate reminder of exactly where you are. Take a light breakfast, then start exploring with a private game drive that bounces along the rutted trails. Because you are staying in a private concession, the driver can take you off the main tracks and bring you closer to the individual scenes. Stop beside hyenas that tear into a wildebeest carcass and witness the blood smeared across their menacing faces. Follow the vultures to a fresher kill, where you are close enough to hear and smell the ferocious feast. After around two hours, you stop for brunch, a hearty meal enjoyed with a view over the Luangwa River where hippos and buffalo are among those bathing below. The sun is rising, and you can feel the savanna’s energy slowing as animals move at a walk rather than a canter. It is a private safari, so you have options over the day’s program. Choose to stay out for the full day, building a comprehensive picture of South Luangwa and its residents, straying into areas that hardly ever receive visitors, or return to the luxury camp where the tranquil atmosphere is infused with animals jumping around nearby. Later in the afternoon, you continue the safari with another activity. Four days is ideal here as game drives are just one part of the program. The wildlife and the wild atmosphere makes South Luangwa one of Africa’s great parks. But it is the variety of activities that creates the experience. Spend some time walking, and enjoy short journeys with the herds or expeditions into unchartered land inaccessible to vehicles. South Luangwa pioneered the African walking safari and wandering with the herds is unforgettable. Nighttime drives can be part of your daily program, and the nocturnal world is full of drama and charm. By piecing together a private collection of activities, you start to appreciate the ineffable beauty of wild Africa and how it is found in both the small nuanced details and the great impressions of scale."

The spacious suites look more like contemporary hotel rooms from the inside. They have the African touch, like an indulgent outdoor shower with a view over the plains, and a private balcony for dining while surrounded by animals. Like in South Luangwa, the safari program is completely private and customized to your interests, with game drives and walks likely to be a feature on your first day here. Some animals are constants on a Zambian safari. Large prides of lions are prominent on the plains where manes shimmer in the sun. Elephants and buffalo are so plentiful that you barely raise an eyelid when they pass; although, the breeding herds always have the ability to grab your attention. You notice differences, like distinct subspecies of zebra and wildebeest, rare predators such as wild dogs, and a fresh assortment of antelope species. Best of all, as the safari progresses, you will understand that the experience has a lot to do with how the animals behave. This is nature’s theater, and with a private safari, you have the best possible seats."

It moves again, and your eyes adjust to see that, amongst the green canvas, there is a shock of yellow and black. A leopard, serene and sublime, watches over the river. She is scanning for food and looking more closely, you see her cub, playful and adorable on the branch. At another time during the safari, you might see the leopard prowling with cold precision as she stalks her prey. Lions are often found lazing and snoozing and occasionally seen on the hunt. As the safari progresses, you watch the scenes from multiple perspectives. You admire a leopard hunting from one perspective and watch the impalas’ fear and tension from another, while witnessing the mourning of a herd who has lost a youngster is a moving third. South Luangwa and Lower Zambezi classically complement each other, and personal moments with big cats spread across the full six days of your safari. In this park, you add activities on the water to your program, cruising along the famous Zambezi River. Open floodplains are packed with life, and the motorboat gets closer, giving you a very eye-to-eye perspective on the animals. Down narrow channels, there is less to see, but the thick foliage is a prime place to set an ambush, and a brilliant chance to get very close to the carnivores. There is also an option for a canoe safari, adventurous and enchanting as it silently explores the landscape. Each activity has its highlights while over six days, the combination of wildlife scenes and safari angles symbolizes why African safari is the world’s most unique travel experience."

There are other animals in the park, but it is not on the level as South Luangwa and Lower Zambezi National Parks, two of Africa’s greatest destinations. After the flight to Livingstone, you are taken by vehicle into the park before approaching the rhinos on foot, an easier way to get closer. Walking slowly and silently, you come to within 15 meters of the iconic horns and bulging bellies, Africa’s endangered giants seen from a unique perspective. Seeing rhinos completes the Big Five experience and, more pertinently, it completes your impression of Africa’s wildlife diversity. Spend the rest of the day relaxing at a luxury lodge within the national park as animals continue to feature regularly on the vistas."

        "description": "After seven days focused on adventure, it is time for the classic escapism that comes at the end of many vacations. You are not on the ocean, but the river, where the profusion of hippos means there will be no sunbathing on the banks. Instead, unwind on the veranda, enveloped by the sounds and wildlife. Seeing animals from your suite is one of Zambia’s great highlights. On a safari activity, you approach the animals who register your presence before deciding what to do next. At the lodge, the animals approach you, registering that you are not a threat. There can be occasions when you drift off on the sun lounge, only to be woken by a herd of bushbuck barely two meters away. You may find yourself reading a book as a large troop of monkeys jumps from the trees to your roof. Get up to grab the camera, and the animals will run off. Don’t move and the proximity can be astonishing. These intimate moments with wildlife are combined with another piece of nature: Victoria Falls. Take a private boat trip to the islands near the precipice, close enough to hear and smell the rushing water. Walk the trails and cross narrow bridges to cataracts in the Zambezi, where you are engulfed by the power and noise of the falls. Sunset Zambezi cruises are another included activity here, a peaceful way to end your final days in Zambia. After the early starts on the safari, these two days are about resting amongst nature and appreciating the tranquility of Zambia’s untouched landscapes."

Livingstone is the country’s tourism hub, a quaint town a few miles from Victoria Falls. Touch down, and you will be smoothly transferred to a luxury lodge on the banks of the Zambezi River. The lodge is calm and charming, and you can pass a lazy afternoon of watching the water and recuperating from your journey. Spend your first evening on a sunset cruise and enjoy fine dining as elephants and hippos start to appear along the banks.

        "description": "Flights to Liuwa Plain only leave twice a week, but it is this new aerial addition that has made Liuwa Plain an accessible destination, along with the establishment of two luxury camps. To put the isolation into perspective, Tanzania’s Ngorongoro Conservation Area receives over half a million visitors a year. Liuwa Plain only gets two 16-seater planes of visitors a week. Touch down, and the wildebeest are there to greet you, tens of thousands of them marauding over the grasslands. Magnificent tsessebe join them in impressive numbers, making similar journeys around the plains. Biologists are only just coming to understand their movements and the next five days bring you centerstage at one of Africa’s largest yet unknown migrations. From January to April, the Liuwa Plains are covered in water with huge herds of ungulates congregating in the park’s southern pans. Safari during these months is challenging, with the camps only accessible by walking and canoeing from the airstrip. It is a series of challenging adventures, but you may be the only visitors in the park. From May to July, the herds follow the receding water northwards, wildebeest joined by zebra and tsessebe, while red lechwe and eland stick to the southern pans. Slowly the herds drift into the northern woodland and savannah, accessing fresh pastures. This is a spectacular time to visit and surround yourself with galloping herds. Rather than return on mass, the herds start marching southwards from August to October, preceding the rains. By the last two months of the year, the Liuwa Plain is packed with animals again. November and December are generally considered the best time to visit, a mix of staggering animal densities and accessible four-wheel drive trails. However, May to October remains a great time to explore, as the rescinding water makes for tense scenes at the waterholes. Arrive by flight today, and you will check into a newly build luxury camp before spending the afternoon to explore the Liuwa Plain for the first time. Like every game drive over these five days, it will be a journey into the unknown."

        "title": "Liuwa Plain National Park – Spectacular Big-Game Safari",
        "description": "Lions have been roaring through the night, so as dawn arrives, you will be looking for them from your private deck at the lodge. The lions blend expertly into the golden grasslands, flowing manes camouflaged with ease. You will find one large male, who immediately rears up and bellows his disapproval at your presence. A mile away you will find the victor of last night’s battle, a giant cat mating with an elegant female. He is also unsure of your presence, and after his rippling growl, he charges the safari vehicle. The driver quickly gets you away from the scene and all is safe, but it is an early indication of how aggressive the lions are in Liuwa Plain National Park. They are not posing for photos, rather they are confirming that they remain the apex mammals. Out on the plains you will soon find a pack of wild dogs. There will be almost 20 of them, fanning out around a herd of oribi. The antelopes huddle together, then scatter, unsure of which way to turn. One is separated, and the chase begins, the young oribi quicker, the wild dogs seeking to keep their prey in sight at this early stage of the hunt. You will follow along in your vehicle, bumping across the plains, admiring how the dogs run complementary routes, forcing the antelope along a single path. For several minutes the oribi seems safe, but the wild dogs have incredible stamina and the longer the chase continues, the greater their chance to kill. Over the next four days you will also encounter dozens of hyenas, animals that quickly challenge their stereotypes. Hyenas hunt most of their food, rather than scavenge, and these open plains are a great place to see them prowling for smaller antelopes. Cheetah and leopard complete the picture of predators. These two animals are both harder to find, the glowing gold tones of the grassland making a stealthy hunter even more hidden. However, this is not just a one or two-day safari. Nearly a week will allow you to explore all of the park’s corners and follow the stories as they unfold. For example, watch lions hunt unsuccessfully one evening, but then return the next morning and watch them continue their search. There are many delights to find here. Zebra joins the wildebeest in making huge herds, red lechwe congregates in the open, while eland and Lichtenstein’s hartebeest reveal a shyness that betrays their size. Reedbuck and roan antelope make for impressive photos while sitatunga hide in the waters on the edge of the park. Best of all, all this wildlife reacts naturally to your presence. Return their looks of curiosity, see their brief moments of indecision, decipher the glimmer in their eyes. These animals are not used to seeing people or vehicles, making the encounters different to those in Africa’s more famous parks. The five-day program of game drives responds to what is happening in the park and guides have full flexibility over where to go. Your modern camp then provides tranquility after a day of adventure."

        "description": "Kafue is bigger than dozens of countries as it stretches out across the remote center of Zambia, disconnected from towns and cities. Kafue has been a national park since 1924 and remains one of the largest in Africa. However, tourism has never completely taken off here. The inaccessibility of it all does not help, and unless you have many days to spare, flying is the only way in. Furthermore, Zambia has only started to receive the safari recognition it deserves. Most safaris are based on the country’s three flagships, South Luangwa, Lower Zambezi and Victoria Falls, so this enormous park hardly receives any visitors. Touch down and begin your game drive on the Busanga Plains, where blankets of fresh grass are dotted with enclaves of wild date palms and sausage trees. Miombo and mopane woodland dot the outskirts of the nearby Busanga Swamp, bringing elephants to your safari for the first time. Such a diverse range of vegetation supports a massive cast of antelopes. Huge red lechwe and puku herds provide first impressions, kudu and eland are scattered everywhere, while bushbuck and reedbuck are regular visitors to your luxury camp. Duiker, grysbok, waterbuck and wildebeest about, and there are plenty for the cats to choose from. And over the next three days, the intense scenes between predators and prey will continue."

An elephant herd marauds past, seemingly in a hurry as two lionesses emerge from the bushes, scattering a puku herd. Your expert guide will eventually find one of Kafue’s elusive leopards hiding deep beneath the mopane canopy. Today is flexible in Kafue, and you will have the chance to combine game drives with walking safaris for a great way to appreciate the behavior of the park’s many antelopes. You will be walking in the land of giants, passing elephants and buffalo among others. After six days of somewhat rugged game drives, this option will help to keep the experience fresh and reveal a new angle."

        "description": "Hiding in the grass, you will spot a cheetah alongside her two young cubs, both rather playful and curious. Spots blur into the golden hues of the plains as the three start to move for an early hunting lesson, the cubs staying close with their mother, learning how to move slowly and quietly. The cubs are not the best of pupils, and they get a stern stare after play-fighting for too long. Kafue is a fabulous place to spot cheetahs as it is one of few African parks where the majority of the antelopes are part of their diet. Smaller lechwe and puku are easy targets for cheetah, but buffalo and zebra are much too large. Your Kafue safari will culminate with a drive into the central and southern part of the park, where the wildlife density decreases but the sense of surprise is elevated. It is highly unlikely that you will see another person or vehicle, and the wilderness is quick to impose its scale. The landscape rolls on and on, and you will begin to appreciate its scale. Elephants dot your journey, eclectic antelopes greet you along the trail, and you will continue to meet predators on the way. Spend the night in a new camp in the heart of the park, and listen to the hyenas call through the night."

An elephant bull lopes past, melancholy and majestic while a buffalo harem brings moments of charm. Zebra seems to line up along the horizon, and your guide will follow trails that lead to the Kafue airstrip, from which it is a short flight back to Livingstone. Touch down and spend your afternoon relaxing at the lodge as you return to a world of swimming pools and internet access. Your sunset cruise will ensure that you remain connected to nature while enjoying the modern comforts.

        "description": "Samburu seems to stretch on forever. Ochre dirt blurs with the scorched yellow of grass, elephants dot the horizon, and rocky pinnacles are occupied by lion prides. Everything is wild and rugged with nothing artificial for many miles in any direction, just zebra skipping past and buffalo herds grunting in the distance. Samburu is Africa at its expressive best, and it is hard to get your head around the panoramas. It is as if you have been transported to another planet, such is the redefinition of reality. You will fly here from Nairobi Wilson Airport and then transfer to a luxury lodge that is perched high above the savanna, built into natural rock features. Everyone anticipates the drama of safari, but few envisage the tranquility. This vast national park is a timeless escape, and the silence is empowering, flowing on the breeze then punctuated by the roar of a male lion. These three days are completely flexible, and this length of stay is long enough to grow accustomed slowly to the atmosphere of Kenya and safari. On game drives, you will see few other vehicles as the guides follow the prints of cheetahs and hyenas, tracing the grazing patterns of various antelope. Walking safaris are also possible, and you will really feel the enormity of Africa, which is a humbling experience, especially as a herd of elephant walks past you. Three days slowly brings encounters with the famous characters of the African savanna. Drive to lionesses and hold your breath as they approach you, circling the vehicle in a peaceful show of menace. Leopards are elusive, but skilled Samburu guides are experts at uncovering their camouflages while hyenas scatter the plains. At first, they seem boisterous and ugly, but over time you will come to enjoy their strange grace and unusual facial expressions. Samburu is not where you are going to see a spectacular abundance of animals, but instead, the experience is about creating an appreciation of Africa’s untamed scale. You are not seeing the continent, you are feeling it, immersing your senses in notions of wilderness that stretch on and on and on. Start your safari here, and you will have a beautiful insight into what wild Africa is all about."

        "description": "Wildebeest are genius animals, especially during the morning. The young males buck and gallop, sending an infectious enthusiasm through the rest of the herd. Old males struggle to keep pace, and you will admire how their beards are turning to gray. Young calves are carefully herded, yet the wildebeest do not always have the best eyesight, and you will watch as they jump in panic after accidentally coming within ten meters of a sleeping lion pride. Zebra are very different are there is a serenity to their movements and an elegance to the black and white canvas. In the Masai Mara, you will not see just a few of these animals, nor a few herds. Rather, you will surround yourself with tens of thousands of them, even when you visit outside the great migration months of July to October. This Masai Mara celebrates unrivaled abundance. Ungulates scatter the plains. and with one sweeping vista, it is impossible to consider just how many. With those on four hooves come those with paws, a famous profusion of predators tracing the wildebeest and zebra. Fly from Samburu to the Masai Mara and base yourself in the Mara North, an exclusive conservancy in the north of the park. Not only is this a landscape that restricts visitor access, it is becoming a beautiful haven for young leopards and cheetahs to raise their young. Over the next three days, you will game drive in the conservancy while also having the option to spend a full day in the larger Masai Mara National Reserve. Sunrise and sunset are the prime times to explore as the Masai Mara is all about finding the predators on the prowl. Leopards, cheetahs, hyenas, jackals, lions abound, and the battles are not just hunter versus hunted, but predators pitted against each other. Watch a lion pride wake from slumber with paws rubbing eyes as they gracefully rise to a rocky outcrop above the plains. Feel the tranquility as the pride inspect the evening menu, and then feel the tension rise as they descend onto the plains. The buffalo herd has seen them coming, but attacks here are rarely about stealth. Over the next hour, you will watch shows of aggression, belligerent displays of attack and defense and everything leading up to an ambush that you cannot predict. Over these two days, you will watch the scenes through the eyes of the hunter, but also appreciate it all from the perspective of the hunted."

The view is Africa on the macro level, and arguably the continent’s most iconic experience. Touching down to a champagne brunch, you will have a final morning on safari before your flight back to Nairobi. An overnight in Kenya’s capital is an essential part of the itinerary as the direct flight to Livingstone, Zambia, departs early in the morning, so this evening you will be taken to East Africa’s most famous restaurant, the appropriately named Carnivore, where game meat is served from Masai swords."

No other waterfalls can tip more water over the precipice each second, yet you cannot grasp this power at a single viewpoint. Instead, you will feel and hear the energy on the walking trails as clouds of mist rise from the canyon, then tumbling down on top of you. During most months of the year, it is very challenging not to get soaked, and it will be impossible to miss the growling rumble of the falls from afar. After landing in Livingstone, you will have a few quiet hours at your riverfront luxury lodge before a guided afternoon excursion to the nearby falls."

Guides take you towards hippo pods and you will eye the giants from water level, appreciating their menace and power. They have been tagged as cute and cuddly, but witnessing hippos from the water quickly squashes that misconception. Disembark your kayak and drive into Moai Au Tunya National Park, where the wildlife does not have the same allure as Samburu or Masai Mara, except for one very special creature. A group of white rhinos live here, and the local trackers bring you closer on foot, keeping you downwind of their enormous frames. Somewhat scary and stupendously surreal, walking towards the rhinos epitomizes the intimacy of the Zambian experience. After your adventure, complete the day with a sunset dinner cruise on the river for a chance to unwind as hippos emerge from the water."

A herd of Cookson’s wildebeest charges past, beards flowing, scrawny frames showing remarkably energy. Brilliant orange colors are glimpsed through the trees, those of the endemic Thornicroft’s giraffe. A troop of vervet monkeys passes the vehicle, 40 or so black faces staring impishly back at you. There are close to a hundred mammal species here, from rare nocturnal hunters like caracals and servals to beautiful antelopes like puku, klipspringer, and reedbuck. You will fly to South Luangwa from Livingstone and transfer to a remote camp in the south of the park, perched above the legendary Luangwa River. Over these three days, you will mix walking with driving, a unique combination that will enable you to explore some of Africa’s most untouched corners. You will be driven to a trailhead and then led through landscapes that are impenetrable by vehicle. It will be just you and the wild with your footsteps crunching across the dry, dusty ground. You will be walking across the floodplains, which are open enough to keep you clear of predatory threat, yet intimate enough to bring sublime moments with many unusual species. After the walk, you will be picked up by a vehicle and game drive to a new part of the park, stopping for lunch beneath a shaded tree before the afternoon’s journey. It is all an intrepid adventure, and it is highly unlikely that you will see another person during the day. Parts of the walk will bring you to photography hides, where you can wait patiently for dramatic close-ups of elephants and buffalos. When night falls, you can continue with nighttime drives in search of nocturnal creatures. Walk slowly past the roan antelope and admire dramatic horns that rise from tiny faces. Surround yourself with impala, hundreds of them skipping in front and behind you. Sharpe’s grysbok provides a strange sight, especially when you are just ten meters away. Sometimes, the path is blocked by a buffalo herd so you can wait patiently before continuing the journey. At other times, you will find leopard prints, so the trackers will reroute to keep you clear of the predator. This exclusive walk and drive combination creates a mystical connection and will help you appreciate the nuances that are not visible when an engine is running. Over the three days, you will tune into each smell and sound and learn how to track different animals, and enjoy a remarkable insight into a world untamed. South Luangwa is where walking safaris were first practiced, and it continues to be the continent’s leading walking destination."

Lower Zambezi is certainly in the latter category, a World Heritage wetland of pools and permanent water that attracts diverse life from across the region; elephants, buffalo, zebra, eclectic antelope herds, along with the unavoidable cluster of predators. From your camp, you can watch some of these animals arrive, notably buffalos swimming and elephants using their trunks as snorkels. Sometimes you will snooze and wake to impala and kudu grazing next to your luxurious canvas suite. You could be dining as roan antelope wander by, or as monkeys send their bellowing calls through the trees. When you leave your camp, there is always a thrilling collection of activities. This is Zambia, so it will never be just game drives. Walks are actively encouraged, boat safaris can take you along the Zambezi, or canoe safaris can explore the labyrinthine channels and canals of the park. Nighttime drives are a special and open up a nocturnal world of civet, genet, and wild dogs on the prowl. Over the previous weeks, you will have experienced huge wilderness areas. The Lower Zambezi is noton that scale as instead, it is compact. The activities only need to last a couple of hours, which make them ideal for the last days of a long safari program. If you decide to sit back and spend the morning or afternoon at the camp, you will still be surrounded by incredible wildlife encounters."

        "title": "South Luangwa National Park – Relaxed First Day on Safari",
        "description": "An air of tranquility flutters across South Luangwa National Park. Sit on your balcony as you arrive and slowly allow your senses to succumb to the scene. Trumpets echo from afar as a herd of elephants crosses the mopane woodland. Fresh scents float on the breeze, suggestive of a land untouched by humankind. Giraffe lopes along the horizon while zebras dominate the landscape beneath the camp. You have likely come to Africa for the big cats, but seeking them out is not a race across the savanna. Begin as you immerse yourself and your senses for that is the only way to understand the predators’ world. Take your time and breathe in the seductive air of a landscape untrammeled by humans. You will be able to feel how your mind and body can be energized by the wild, and there will be lots of time to follow the predators, so you can relax and unwind as you arrive. Earlier in the day, you will land in Lusaka, and a representative will assist in transferring you onto a domestic flight bound for South Luangwa National Park. It is a one-hour game drive transfer to your boutique camp that overlooks the water, and you will find yourself on a rich open savanna, even able to see lions from your balcony. You will often hear them during the evening with baritone roars that can echo for up to eight miles. There will be time for a late-afternoon game drive and perhaps even a nighttime drive, but the main focus of the day is for you to settle into the landscape’s rhythm and let your senses adjust to the environment."

        "title": "South Luangwa National Park – Diverse Cast of Big Cats",
        "description": "Set off on the trail of the predators on a privately-guided game drive to explore the untrammeled plains and valleys of South Luangwa. Hyenas are usually the first predator you will spot, as they are strange creatures that cover huge distances every day. Some dominate the plains in small cackles and will howl aggressively to protect their range. Others are nomadic and follow the migrating herds throughout the year. Uniquely, the dominant hyenas will allow other hyenas in their territory, without quarrel, providing they are only passing through. At first glance, these are ugly creatures but watch them carefully, and there is a charm to be found in their peculiar gestures and their menacing scowls. Lions are likely to be next. The kings of the landscape, they are able to bask in the open and only hide when out on a hunt. In South Luangwa, you will find pride lounging in the shade, snoozing away the day. These majestic predators only need to eat every four days, so they are usually in the state of repose. When the vehicle approaches, the lionesses will grow curious. They will rise and get closer, circling the vehicle slowly. The silence will be great enough for you to hear your own heartbeat, and then the lionesses will lie down in the shade of your vehicle’s back wheel. Especially in the early morning, there will be a good chance of spotting a carcass, ravenous teeth having ripped through both skin and blood. Watch carefully for an hour, and you will be able to appreciate the pride’s social structure as the alpha male eats first while the young males are forced to wait. On another occasion, you may find a bachelor group with their bodies scarred by battle, their tender frames struggling to adapt to life away from the pride. Then there are the leopards, wild dogs, and smaller predators like mongoose, serval, and caracal. South Luangwa has a fabulous population of hunters, and best of all, the park receives a small fraction of the visitors seen in neighboring Tanzania. So you can happily spend an hour watching a pride or solitary cat, without another vehicle arriving and interrupting the scene."

        "title": "South Luangwa National Park – Exclusive Nighttime Drive",
        "description": "In most of Africa’s safari destinations, the premier time to see big cats prowling is in the early morning. These cool dawn hours are when lions and leopards are on the move, hunting their prey before the sun dominates the landscape. However, the best time for these predators to hunt is actually at night, beneath the cloak of darkness. In most of Africa, you will not be able to game drive at this time. South Luangwa is unique in offering nighttime game drives that can explore the enormous scale of a national park. It is not an add-on, but a regular part of every safari day. You can stay out on an afternoon game drive and admire the change of atmosphere as dusk takes hold, and the drive continues after dark. Or you can head out into the night after dinner to explore the haunting atmosphere of the wild. During your time in South Luangwa, these nighttime drives will provide thrilling opportunities to uncover an abundant leopard population. A roving spotlight will illuminate a moving hunter that moves elegantly through the grass with careful steps towards a herd of Crawshay’s zebra. When the light hits the eyes of the leopard, they will reflect bright blue, and there will be a lucid moment as your gazes meet in the dark. On another night, you can watch a leopard cross beside your safari vehicle, barely five meters away. Perhaps on another adventure, you will find the carcass in the tree, the hunt completed, a limb hanging limply from the branch. It is not just the leopards that you will see, as these nighttime drives bring intimate moments with a full range of bit cats. But there’s something wonderfully elusive that makes this spotted hunter the ultimate safari sight."

        "description": "South Luangwa rewards time and patience, as it is not a park to rush, nor one with a single famous scene or encounter to experience. South Luangwa is a destination that slowly reveals Africa’s dramatic theater as each moment immerses you further in the wilderness. A minimum of three nights is usually recommended, but four nights ensure the safari program will move at a relaxed pace while still encountering the premier scenes. Along with nighttime drives, walking safaris are a regular part of the program, and you will be able to walk through a wilderness that teems with big game safely. As with every day in South Luangwa, your privately guided program is fully flexible and can respond to your interests. There is a good chance of returning to certain predators, as perhaps yesterday you heard two males fighting, a pride hunting unsuccessfully, or a leopard’s cub taking first steps, and today you can return to the storyline."

        "description": "It will take close to two hours to fly between South Luangwa and Kafue National Park, and your plane will skirt the edge of Zambia as you crossed the seemingly endless swathes of dusty red and scorched yellow. Kafue is one of Africa’s hidden gems, a vast paradise that makes it onto few safari itineraries. The game is not as concentrated as in South Luangwa, but the sense of surprise is exquisite and worth the while. You could spend 15 minutes on a drive and see nothing but a small zebra herd. Turn another corner to wind around a clump of bushland, and a large herd of buffalo are found protecting the waterhole from a smaller herd of thirsty elephants. The search for water dominates here, so by following the waterholes, you will enjoy exclusive access to this treasure of a park. While Kafue would make an excellent addition to any safari, two elusive species makes it stand out: cheetahs and wild dogs. These are amongst Africa’s rarest, yet most spectacular encounters and over the next days, you will be finding these animals in their natural habitat. As in South Luangwa, your privately guided safari program is fully flexible. On game drives, you will explore the north and the center of the park. Drives can be bumpy and dusty and cover considerable distances. But what an adventure it is when you cover a hundred miles of untouched bushland to track a pack of wild dogs without seeing another vehicle the entire day."

        "description": "Lions are photogenic, leopards exude natural beauty, and cheetahs move with captivating elegance. Wild dogs do not have any of these attributes, and a single photo cannot capture these remarkable animals, even those with majestic fur coats of different colors. To experience wild dogs, it is more about following the movements of a pack. Admire how they move as one, but then split up to explore more ground, communicating their findings silently. Watch them hunt and harass as a pack, splitting up and encircling prey without ever barking to each other. The ease and grace of their hunting is one of Africa’s greatest sights, as up to 30 dogs work a herd to separate the weak. Spending three days in Kafue will provide a premier opportunity to follow these animals and come to understand their behavior. With an expert guide leading the way, you can be immersed in the world of the elusive predator."

        "description": "The evocative Busanga Plains stretch across the north of Kafue National Park, a landscape of subtle yellow grass that blends perfectly into cheetahs’ fur coats. It will feel as if the cheetah chose their color by evolving from these plains. Easy camouflage and an abundance of smaller prey means Busanga has one of Africa’s healthiest cheetah populations. From the vehicle’s raised vantage point, you can unravel the spots from the grass. Cheetahs are often shy creatures, found in a place of solace on the plains, yet they are also hunters. See cheetahs perched on rocks to survey the potential dinner menu. Watch them prowling, long slender necks expertly dipping into the grass. See how they hide a carcass and keep their distance from each other, and how they roam the outskirts of their territory, a look of menace emanating from what are usually charming faces. And, if you are lucky, you can see the cheetah accelerating over the plains. This is one of the rarest sights in Africa, and Kafue gives you one of the best chances to see it."

Your program is fully flexible, and you can choose a number of other self-guided activities, such as crossing the bridge to Zimbabwe and exploring the other half of Victoria Falls. The optional activities include everything from kayaking on the Zambezi to helicopter flights above the falls. After the safari, Livingstone offers the tranquil base before returning home while continuing your immersion in nature.

Hippos emerge from the water to graze on the banks, slowly turning into silhouette as dusk takes hold. Crocodiles bask on the banks and then slope into the water with menacing grace.

Enjoy a relaxed morning at the lodge as you take breakfast on a wooden verandah above the river. Continue your morning along the river, a small boat taking you to an island on the edge of the precipice. Water rushes past at a ferocious speed, and you will be nearly deafened by the noise, the growl of nature delivered in full surround sound. From here, the boat will drop you along the riverbank, and a walking trail will lead you alongside the falls. You will see them for the first time, a mile-wide sheet of water disappearing into the chasm below, and you will still feel them as clouds of mist rise above you, scents of the new forest accompanying the walking trails as you will explore the nuance of the sounds. Cross Knife-edge Bridge to the isolated cataracts in the Zambezi, where you are consumed by the roaring water and mist, then return to drier land and take lunch before the helicopter flight. The mist is such that it is hard to see all of Victoria Falls from one viewpoint particularly as the falls are spread across two countries. A helicopter flight will provide the best visuals; the widening Zambezi, a mix of exotic colors as the water drops into the canyon, the plains of Zambia and Namibia mixed with the woodland of Zimbabwe and Botswana. You might even see elephants from up here, those that are part of the world’s largest elephant population. Return to the lodge, and the rest of the day will be at your leisure, with a sunset Zambezi cruise included if you wish."

        "description": "Your early morning flight will get you into South Luangwa when the big mammals are still active. Elephants send up flumes of dust as they cross the savanna, giraffe lope past on route to the river, while herds of buffalo gives the plains a menacing feel. These animals are usually seen on a transfer from the airstrip to your luxury camp, where there is time to settle into the luxury of a Zambian safari. Your suite’s canvas walls will allow exotic sounds to penetrate as the nightly lion roars and the grazers rustle by. The interior is nothing like camping as you will have a raised bed, antique furniture, and a spacious en-suite bathroom with hot water and Western amenities. For a deeper connection with nature, there is a beautiful open-air bathtub, perfect for reenergizing while zebra walk by. Zambia has some of the best luxury camps in Africa, and the accommodation has been handpicked for your stay in South Luangwa and Lower Zambezi. Spend your afternoon on a game drive through the park to follow the drama that the wild creates. Lionesses snooze but watch you with one-eye open, their cubs playfully looking for engagement. A herd of roan antelope with spectacular horns that rise proudly from bashful eyes. A young giraffe will take first loping steps to make a strangely adorable canter to keep pace with its mother. Baboons and monkeys occupy the trees in large troops, their enthusiasm leading to photographic moments. Buffalos graze peacefully when you see them first, but later on the drive, you find a bachelor herd, hissing and grunting with an antagonism brought on by testosterone. This first-day game drive will be all about taking it in, from the diversity of life in South Luangwa to the special encounters from a few meters away."

        "description": "It is always worth the early start on safari as the cooler dawn hours are when animals are active and moving to new grazing spaces or hunting for breakfast. Endemic Cookson’s wildebeest move in great herds, and you will admire their enthusiasm, the males galloping about with untamed abandon. Thornicroft’s giraffe cross the plains, necks extending towards the sky as baboons shout and yelp while herds of zebra peacefully graze. Predators are on the move, and you will hold your breath as you watch the lionesses stalk the zebra. After 9 or 10 am, the lions will be in a state of repose, but they are magnificent and menacing during these early hours, a male’s mane fluttering in the breeze as the females showcase the solemn precision of a hunter. The other active time is after dark. Again, the cooler temperature means the bigger animals use less energy to move around. But the atmosphere is very different, some animals comfortable in the dark, others tense and frightened. South Luangwa specializes in nighttime drives so not only do you uncover nocturnal animals, such as caracal, African wild cat, and other small hunters, you will also feel the tension of a nocturnal world. In particular, follow the park’s legendary leopards and watch them descend from the trees to hide effortlessly in the grass. Elephants hoot, their poor eyesight compensated by their power but the gazelle have little defense and it is common for the spotlight to illuminate a limp carcass between a leopard’s jaw. Daytime and nighttime game drives are possible on each of your days in South Luangwa, so build the day’s itinerary according to what you want to see on the savannah. Another unique option is to disappear into one of the park’s unique photography hides. Located around the water, these are places that reward patience. You can sit for an hour and see nothing, but then an elephant herd will turn up, and the swinging trunks will be barely five meters away from your hideout."

Lion pride and young bachelor lions bear the scars of battle while the leopards are solitary and solemn with their movements. Elephants number in the hundreds, including many that wander straight past your camp. Endemic Thornicroft’s giraffe come along with almost a dozen ungulate species, each remarkably different from the last. A walking safari adds a new dimension to these sights. South Luangwa was where the African walking safari was born, and it continues to be the best place on the continent to walk in the wilderness. Just as with the drives, there is a huge flexibility over where to go. Choose a full day on foot to submerge all of your senses in this rare world. Choose to walk for half a day, or just 30 minutes to test out the experience. Or spend the day combining walks and drives and enjoy intimate moments while still exploring vast areas of the park. On South Luangwa’s walking safaris, you will cross the floodplains to find open landscapes that are easy for spotting wildlife. Endemic Crawshay’s zebra watches as you pass, their curious black and white stripes surrounding you on all sides. Giraffe and elephant appear much bigger when you are on foot, even if you are further away. Wildlife is not afraid, and you become just another mammal, rather than an imposing vehicle. Guides teach you the basics of animal tracking and keep you well clear of the predators. You follow the ungulates, standing on plains that teem with gazelle and buffalo, giraffe and zebra. Roan antelope stand above you, mongoose scamper past, and the connection with nature is exquisite, whether you are out for 20 minutes or a full day walking safari."

Fly to Lower Zambezi National Park, a World Heritage wetland along the Zambezi where a labyrinth of natural canals leads to lakes and swamps, with the permanent water attracting wildlife from hundreds of miles around. After your flight, you will explore by motorboat to take in the enormity of the park. Pass raucous hippo pods and watch the battles between males, and then see countless elephant herds along the banks, along with buffalos swimming from Zambia to Zimbabwe. Then transfer to a narrow wooden canoe, a silent vessel for intimate exploration and the animals will be much closer; baby elephants splashing, hippos staring boisterously, giraffe standing wide-legged when taking a drink, small zebra herds slurping tentatively, the eyes of three lionesses hiding in the high grass. Lower Zambezi is one of Africa’s great wetlands, a land of abundance that is best understood by a safari on the water. Just sit back and watch the show, admiring everything that approaches the banks. Your luxury camp also provides a water-based safari, with elegant suites rising on stilts above the water. From your private verandah, you can watch the animals come and go, herd after herd taking a drink from the clear blue below. Over your time spent here, you will learn the rhythm of life here in how zebra and small antelope drink in the day, then elephants and buffalos come throughout the evening and into the night.

Colors are tropical rather than rustic, and the landscapes are fresh rather than cracked. Abundance is everywhere, from the flowering forests to the density of wildlife. With permanent water comes a huge population of ungulates, all seen within a short distance of the camp. With the ungulates comes a healthy population of predators. Drive in search of African wild dogs, majestic hunters that wander menacingly across the plains. Their coats combine colors and their communication defies normal logic, the pack splitting up and converging without a noise being uttered. Witnessing wild dogs on a hunt is one of Africa’s ultimate experiences, especially when you see individuals drive a gazelle into an ambush. South Luangwa is huge, enhanced by the sense of escapism. Lower Zambezi is compact, and most safari activities will encounter dozens of different species in just two hours. Most programs combine two or more two-hour activities each day, taking you from land to water to vehicle. Spot lions from the lakeside, and then transfer to a vehicle to watch the hunt unfold. Walk with zebra and stand just meters from their endearing stripes to appreciate how these are a different sub-species from those in South Luangwa. Likewise, the giraffe and wildebeest and the walking safari will help you watch and feel the contrasts between subspecies.

As the forest rescinds, you will be consumed by the power of the falls as a seemingly endless blanket of water disappears into the abyss and rises as mist. Pass the baboons as they guard the trail and follow a walking track to various viewpoints to feel the enormity of the falls when you cross Knife-edge Bridge and are consumed by the spray. Return to the lodge for lunch before an afternoon safari that will very different from what you might expect. Livingstone stands at the heart of the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area, one of the world’s largest tracts of protected landscape. Elephants are constantly on the move here and follow the rains as they travel around Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Angola and Namibia. Conservationists are unsure of the exact figures, but it is widely believed that there are over 100,000 elephants, perhaps nearly 200,000. Not only is this easily the largest elephant population in the world, but this is also where you will see the world’s biggest old bulls that tower meters over the safari vehicle. This afternoon’s tour will not bring you to a national park or reserve as instead, you will follow the roads, both the tarred main highway and the ochre-colored dirt roads that lead to the local villages. Elephants cross these roads, large herds flapping their ears as they wander over the asphalt. They are seen within 100 meters of border posts, juxtaposed with the “Welcome to Zambia” sign. You will see evidence of their journey along the road as pathways of bulldozed trees extend in every direction. This harmony between man and nature is an unusual sight, especially when a 22-ton truck is photographed alongside an elephant. Over the coming days, you will get much closer to these giants, but as an introduction, this afternoon’s drive will showcase how elephants are the true kings of the landscape in Zambia and Botswana."

        "description": "The inspiring pachyderm population is on route to the Zambezi, and the other permanent waterways of southwestern Zambia and northeastern Botswana. After breakfast, you to will cross the border and trace one waterway into another before transferring onto a Chobe River cruise. Throughout the morning, you will follow the Chobe River deeper into Chobe National Park and admire the hundreds of elephants found along the riverbank. Some squirt water while others use their trunks as snorkels. The adolescent elephants playfully battle each other in the shallows while hippos also congregate in astonishing numbers. The boat cruise is the best opportunity to get close to them and gives you a front row seat to both populations. After the boat ride, you will continue by vehicle for a first real immersion in the scale of this elephant population. It is sometimes hard to travel 100 meters without seeing another herd. Giants continually block the trail as hundreds of them wander without a care in the world. Large males tower over the safari vehicle with five tons of power reaching two meters above you. Trunk-swinging babies are in abundance, their comical gestures making for adorable moments. Giraffe also live here in unrivaled numbers, and after a single game drive, you will have seen many hundreds of them. For the next two nights, you will stay at a small luxury camp deep in the national park, where the antics of the elephants will accompany you through the evening and into the night."

        "description": "A surreal soundtrack fills the morning as in the distance you can hear the hooting and the loud blasts of the elephants’ natural trumpets as they echo across the mopane woodland. Another herd will have come closer, and you will hear the crack of a large branch being ripped from its trunk. These elephants are not just clearing a path to aid their movements, as they are searching out the nutrients found within the trees as they bash them down with their domineering rumps and powerful trunks. Closer still comes the sound of elephants at a waterhole near the camp, a strange slurp that epitomizes just how close you are to the world’s largest elephant population. The day will be spent on a game drive through Chobe National Park with a focus on the elephants, but you are also likely to encounter lions and a wide range of antelopes. This will be an immersive day that gradually helps you to understand just how many giants there are. It is possible to imagine seeing 100 elephants, maybe even 1,000. But being amongst 100,000 is an experience that cannot be described in photos or videos, and it is an experience that is felt as the sounds, sights, and smells are likely to live with you for eternity."

Linyanti is an unfenced private concession reserved for just a handful of guests that will cover a huge area at the end of the elephants’ migratory route. This region a prime location to explore the battles between herds as rambunctious young males fight majestic old bulls, their deadly battles lasting many days with the haunting crack of clashing skulls reverberating across the land. Matriarchs lead their herds to water, and you can spend hours watching the interaction at the river, as size dominates and some herds refuse to wait their turn while others prefer the more relaxed, informal queuing system. Linyanti is also the best destination within the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area for spotting big cats, notably an impressive leopard population. Along with lions, they provide further highlights on this relaxed safari day."

As your eyes adjust to the darkness of the night, the elephants will become silhouettes, and as your eyes adjust further, you will realize just how many there are. The exclusive nighttime game drives in Linyanti provide a new level of intimacy as in the darkness, you can truly sense the power and the size of these mammals. You will also notice that the elephants can be a little edgy, their poor nighttime vision meaning they often use their size as a defense mechanism in flapping their ears and marauding when threatened. The guides will keep you at a safe distance, and it will be a magical experience to be surrounded by elephant herds in the dark. Earlier in the day, you will have personalized a safari program with game drives and walks."

The trip will require an early start, and after arriving in Zambia’s flagship park, there will be time to relax at the lodge through the latter part of the morning. South Luangwa’s varied landscapes provide a home to a great diversity of wildlife. You will quickly notice that elephants are not seen in the abundance of Chobe, nor are they the obvious kings of the environment. Buffalo herds and lion pride are seen in impressive numbers, along with endemic species like Crawshay’s zebra and Cookson’s wildebeest. During the afternoon, you can game drive around the park and savor a new cast of animals as you are introduced to the park’s distinctive landscape. The mixture of dusty open floodplains, the flowing savannah, and the riverine forest will capture your attention, and your accommodation will be in the park’s most luxurious lodge.

        "description": "Zambia is the place in Africa for a walking safari as huge sections of South Luangwa are inaccessible to vehicles, so endless miles have never been interrupted by humankind. Guides can tailor every walk to follow the ancient tribal trails to bring an enhanced understanding of how Africa’s wilderness operates. Small fly-camps are erected alongside rivers, many miles from any road, and they are simple, yet beautiful, with raised beds, dug-out toilets, and hot bucket showers. From your cozy camping chairs, you can listen and smell the wonders of your surroundings as a zebra grazes nearby, unusual monkey troops occupy the trees and endemic Rothschild giraffe lope past. This three-day journey will provide the ultimate immersion in the wild and a very exclusive chance to track elephant herds on foot. Elephants are big and potentially dangerous animals, so you are led by experienced trackers who intimately understand their behavior and know what constitutes a safe distance. But on this South Luangwa walking safari, you will quickly understand just how big these pachyderms can be. Clues are left everywhere, and the journey will provide an understanding of elephant behavior. You will inspect dung and learn how to ascertain the age, sex, and health of the individual from a single glance. You will trace their migratory patterns through indentations in the trees and from the ripped up branches, and then intimately uncover the different movements of lone bulls and large herds. From a safe distance, you will really get a grasp of their social structure, and you will quickly come to understand the behaviors that reveal an elephant’s feelings. Each day will follow a similar pattern. You will start walking just after dawn, as the cooler hours are also the time when the herds are on the move. Stop for a large early lunch, and then rest at a mobile camp around the late-morning. In the afternoon, you can walk in the vicinity of the camp and follow the clues in an attempt to get as close as safely possible to the elephants. South Luangwa does not have the same concentration of elephants as Chobe, but its healthy population will help you to appreciate how these animals roam in a diverse habitat. When the nighttime stars are out in full, there is nothing quite like the sporadic trumpets that alert you to another herd in the trees nearby."

After two hours of kayaking, your adventure will continue with a walk through Mosi Au Tunya National Park. Soon, you may find yourself just 12 – 15 meters away from rhinos or a group of them. Horns protrude, bellies rise, and you may be close enough to hear the huff that might be misconstrued as a snore.

Each is completely different from the others in terms of landscape and wildlife, yet all share this unique mix of scale and intimacy.

You will follow the water and could spot hundreds of elephants as they splash in the shallows and beneath the riverbed. Giraffe typically walk past and they are visibly different to those in Lower Zambezi as the endemic Thornicroft’s subspecies are distinguished by incredibly vivid markings. Also endemic are Crawshay’s zebra and Cookson’s wildebeest, two more species that make South Luangwa a bucket-list destination for safari aficionados.

You can hear the grazing as you listen to each set of hoofs thudding into the rustic-red dirt. Walking further, you will find a herd of roan antelope, their magnificent horns fully appreciated because you are also on the ground level. It is not simply the animals you see, but the way you see them, out in the open.

Settle in, and then take your first walking safari after lunch to hear the crunch of your own footsteps over the landscape. This one will be an easy explorative journey to help you get accustomed to the atmosphere and the style of the safari. Nothing is rushed on foot, so you will walk slowly and carefully admire all of the changes and clues. The locals have always done this, coexisting with nature in their own unique way. Their complex understanding of animal behavior and animal tracking makes a walking safari very safe, even if you occasionally encounter giants, like an elephant herd.

        "description": "South Luangwa has played a pioneering role in developing African safari as this park was the first to make big-game walks available to visitors. Over these three days, you can follow in the footsteps of Africa’s oldest walking safari and cross the floodplain expanses that are inaccessible to vehicles. These plains are close to the water which brings them a very high density of wildlife. The openness allows your trackers to check continually for predatory threats, and the days are flexible dependent on the evolving environment and your own interests. You may opt to drive to a trailhead and then walk to the next camp before an afternoon game drive or a walk around the camp. You may walk the full day with a vehicle bringing you a picnic lunch to be enjoyed beneath a towering acacia, or you could walk all morning and then get picked up by vehicle for a quiet afternoon at the lodge. Either way, the focus will be on exploring parts of South Luangwa that cannot be reached with wheels. Kudu will stop to graze and will watch you pass while Thornicroft’s giraffe looks down from above the trees, another endemic species just a few meters away. You will quickly learn how to identify waterbuck from reedbuck as massive herds of oribi and duiker scatter across the plains, surrounding you on all sides. At one point, you will be stopped by buffalo, as these belligerent males are to be avoided, but your guide will show that it is safe to stop at the river, where a large herd of elephants is bathing on the opposite bank. Predators also fill your adventures as side-striped jackals scurry past, rare mongoose species emerge from their holes, and caracal peer intently from a grassy hiding place. You will explore the southern part of South Luangwa over these three days, staying in permanent luxury camps that enhance the experience’s intimacy. Start walking just after dawn and cross relatively flat landscapes in the cool morning hours. Take your time and learn the clues of animal tracking. Inspect the beautiful details and appreciate animal behavior, notably the warning signs when a mammal is unhappy. Feel the connection with Africa in how it wraps you in a special atmosphere of sights, sounds, smells, and surreal happenings. Afternoon walks are usually shorter and can be switched for game drives, and in the evening, you will also have the opportunity to head out on nighttime game drives for more unique moments on the South Luangwa plains, including those with leopards."

Herds of blue wildebeest canter enthusiastically and you can join them and ride alongside their wispy beards and conspicuous expressions. Weave into the woodland, and there is a chance to ride past elephants. Baboons look down on you here to wonder about this new mammal that is entering their trees as the landscape opens and you will gallop across the Busanga Plains to pass the herds of puku and impala that have jumped clear of the grass. Horseback safaris are a specialty of Kafue, particularly in private concessions that share unfenced borders with the national park. Some horseback experience is required for these multi-day adventures and riders must be able to handle a horse confidently. There is a wide choice of horses in the stable and all are forward-moving and responsive. Today will be about getting used to the horse and the style of adventure as your guide leads you into different habitats to walk, canter, and then gallop with the herds on the plains.

        "description": "Skirt the edges of the Busanga Swamp and admire the strange aquatic animals found in this part of Zambia. Sitatunga hides in the swamp, sometimes just their peculiar ears poking out. Puku stays close to the water, ready to jump into the liquid if predators get close. The horse’s hoofs make squidgy sounds as you take in the bounty, many exotic animals and colors gathering around the swamp. Over these two days, you can ride in the mornings and afternoons with each ride taking you into a distinctive part of the Kafue ecosystem. The swamp area reveals an abundance of life, with small herds gathering and interacting. Many of these may scatter upon hearing a safari vehicle. But on horseback, you can ride to within meters. Continue through the woodland and watch the behavior of elephants. Flapping ears and stomping feet is a bad sign, one of the three warnings given by an angry elephant. Herds of blue wildebeest and Burchell’s zebra (note the different subspecies from in South Luangwa) join you on the plains, and you can let the horse run. Wildebeest sometimes get caught up in your horse’s enthusiasm, sharing your rapid steps as the wind rushes past your face. In Kafue, you can also switch afternoon horse rides with afternoon game drives that continue after dark. These provide perspectives with the park’s lions and wild dogs, predators you must avoid on a horse."

        "title": "Lower Zambezi National Park – Paddling Through the Evocative Canals",
        "description": "When you move silently, you can hear everything. Your canoe will glide softly into the canals as the only rustling comes from the reeds and you can paddle to find waterbuck along the banks. Later on, you can hear a different rustling as lionesses hide within the reeds, camouflaged for an afternoon ambush. Suddenly a loud hoot comes over the air, with an elephant charging around the banks. Paddle across, and you will see a young male, angry at being shunned from the rest of the herd. The hooting continues and you hear the thick musty sound of his feet stomping against the sandbank. It is all such a contrast to the last elephant herd you encountered, just minutes ago. Babies were playfully submerging each other, young males waved only their trunks above the waterline, and old bulls blasted jets of water across their backs. The beauty of a water-based safari is this opportunity to move silently, and safely, with the big mammals. You cannot stand ten meters from a lion. But you can sit in a canoe, ten meters of water away from a lion. Lower Zambezi National Park is one of Africa’s great wetlands and blends the Zambezi River with a series of lakes, plus a mazy collection of canals that rise and fall with the rains. Fly here and start your experience with a morning motorboat safari and a chance to explore the scale and grandeur of the park. After lunch, you can continue by canoe and get much closer to the banks to gaze up at elephants’ tusks."

        "title": "Lower Zambezi National Park – Unique Water-Based Safari",
        "description": "Early mornings bring serenity to the water as sunrise colors ripple across the landscape, the silence feels more poignant, and a procession of animals lines up along the horizon. Your guide will paddle you to the islands in the lakes, where sitatunga are setting up their hiding places. You can stop beside open plains and watch the herds slowly come to take a drink. Then you can inspect the thick high grass carefully, alerted by the faintest flicker of a sound. It will take minutes for you to find the leopard as the cat does not move, it just waits patiently, with blue eyes staring intently. Your eyes will adjust, and the spots will come into view, clustered between the green shoots. Suddenly a movement, the leopard’s head moving 90 degrees, the neck dipping even lower. Some puku are approaching the water, and the hunt is on. A Lower Zambezi water-based safari provides these unique perspectives, the lack of artificial noise helps you to appreciate the intricacies of the wetlands. Motorboat safaris allow you to cover large distances to the most remote parts of the park, where the engine is cut as you encounter Africa’s biggest mammals. Canoe safaris do not have the same range but increase the authenticity of the atmosphere. Of course, there will be hippos, with hundreds of them passed in the lake and on the banks, as well as buffalos and other large mammals, everyone coming to drink at least once a day. Along with the water-based safari, you will have options for walking safari and game drives. Or you can sit back and watch the wildlife from a decadent camp perched over a river bend."

        "description": "Walking, riding, and canoeing are all behind you, so not it will be about relaxing. After ten days of intimate African safaris, fly to Livingstone to your wonderful lodge on the banks of the Zambezi River. Slide into the swimming pool, sip cocktails as baboons maraud past, soak up the opulence of the surroundings, and rest after your adventures. You are still deep within nature as your suite looks out towards hippos and elephants, but the focus is no longer on exploring. Rather, it is about rest and recuperation, epitomized by the daily sunset river cruises and the fine dining restaurant. From your lodge, you can see a strange cloud, and hear the distant thunder of Victoria Falls, barely five miles down the river. Transfers to and from the falls are included in your stay. From the park gate, there are self-guided walking trails, both down to the river and over to cataracts across from the falls. You can also add on other Victoria Falls excursions, including a sightseeing flight. Three days also creates further safari options, notably a chance to see the white rhinos in Mosi Au Tunya National Park. But after ten days in the bush, these three days are tailored towards tranquility."

        "description": "Cape Town provides a delightful first image of Africa with a chain of mountains rising ruggedly above the hues of the deep ocean blue. The city sprawls out amongst nature, nestled into the valleys beneath the peaks, enveloped by the frothy white of waves. The landscape will inspire as you consider it from the window of your arriving plane, and it is even more imposing on the transfer to your waterfront hotel. Table Mountain will loom larger than ever as you approach the city. Everyone expects the beautiful vertical face, but few anticipate just how wide Table Mountain is and how it stands miles across, dominating the view from almost every angle. After checking into your hotel, the rest of the day will be at your leisure. You will be staying within the pedestrianized V & A Waterfront area, where you can easily walk to excellent restaurants and boutique markets. A driver will be available to you as well and can provide transfers around the city, including to the nearby beaches."

        "description": "Almost every afternoon, Table Mountain is consumed by the mysterious tablecloth , the layer of mist that keeps falling like a curtain yet never seems to get any lower. In the morning, the summit is usually clear, making morning the best time for a cable car ascent. Rise above the city and spend an hour walking around the top to explore the 360-degree views. To the south, you will find a spine of peaks that extend to the tip of Africa. To the north, take in the city draped alongside Atlantic waves, and to the east, the colorful suburbs of the city as they meet the hues of the Indian Ocean. Hidden on the slopes, just out of view, are the vineyards of Constantia. After descending, you can enjoy lunch at one of these vineyards with a platter of local delicacies accompanied by some of the country’s oldest wines. Three vineyards provide contrasting tasting experiences here. One is for the views, the next for the decadent tasting room, and the third for South Africa’s most award-winning wine. You will return to the hotel by mid-afternoon and the rest of the day will be at your leisure, with your guide able to provide tailored dining recommendations."

        "description": "Langa is a canvas of color, a surrealist artwork painted with the most vibrant tones. Houses are painted flaming red and indulgent blue and signs and graffiti come from all the gaps on the rainbow. Locals proudly wear all manner of unlikely color combinations, their clothes a fitting tribute to the smiles on their faces. Langa is one of Cape Town’s townships and while economically weak, the region is culturally rich and overflows with stories and heritage. As part of a township tour, you will be invited into homes and learn the basics of the Xhosa language, taste traditional beer, and admire the township’s role in anti-apartheid history. The tour is safe and insightful, a journey into an urban landscape that is as welcoming as any in Africa. Following the colorful cultures comes the white beaches, and an afternoon spent on the opposite side of Cape Town’s spectrum. For sunbathing privacy, you can be dropped at the white beaches of Clifton, where rolling rocks divide the beach into secluded bays. Nearby Camps Bay is the place to be as seen, a wide white beach backdropped by Table Mountain and a number of upmarket cocktail bars. In the evening, you will have dinner reservations to Africa’s only entry on the World’s Top 50 Restaurants list. Taste your way through a gastronomic food and wine pairing, each course fusing local organic produce with culinary extravagance."

        "title": "Stellenbosch – Explore the Elegant Vineyards of South Africa",
        "description": "Move next into the vineyards as endless miles of vines are backdropped by nature’s rugged excess. Table Mountain will shimmer softly in the distance, but it will be superseded by the granite slabs that separate the Stellenbosch Valleys. South Africa’s premier wine region is home to hundreds of vineyards and the vintages that have made the country famous on a world stage. You will transfer to Stellenbosch by private vehicle and settle into a suite at a 19th-century vineyard with dramatic views over the vines. Your first tasting is here, a journey through different vintages and an introduction to the national grape, Pinotage. The next two days will bring an almost endless choice of where to go and what to taste. You will have a local private guide to tailor the experience, and on the dry flat slopes, you will find sensual bubbles and a French-inspired sparkling wine. High in the hills, you will find the country’s most prestigious names, vineyards that mostly focus on Bordeaux-style red blends. The history of Pinotage can be traced through four iconic vineyards, three of which will open exclusively for you to taste. Go beyond wine at Spice Route, a vineyard that also specializes in chocolates and cheeses, or you can journey to the heart of the Cape Winelands to share a glass with the winemaker in rustic farmhouse tasting rooms. Other options include spending time in Stellenbosch and Franschhoek, the two 18th-century towns where the Cape has its colonial origins. You could also travel through the remote mountains by bicycle or horseback for journeys that can stop at various vineyards. The Winelands are a place to explore, but they are also a place for lying back and soaking up the serenity of the Cape. Evenings are leisurely, with long semi-desert sunsets that stretch out onto the horizon. So settle into a private outdoor pool to watch the night draw in, and then taste your way through the country with handpicked dining recommendations."

        "description": "The Cape will pack a huge variety of experiences into a small space. Mountains, culture, wine, and beaches are all found within one hour’s drive of each other. But move to Livingstone, and Zambia opens up the enormity of the wilderness. In an hour’s drive, you will see little but elephants along the highway and baboons shouting from the trees. Space will take on new definitions as the Zambezi River roars between the open floodplains and the thick woodlands. You will not need to look for the backcountry here as it is virtually everywhere in Zambia. You will fly to Livingstone via Johannesburg, a half-day of travel that is continued with a boat transfer to a lodge on the Zambezi. A menagerie of wildlife can be seen from your balcony, and a sunset dinner cruise will bring you closer, with hippos rising from the water for their evening of grazing. You will quickly forget the urban landscape, and be enveloped by the enormity of nature."

        "description": "The river rumbles past and takes you with it on a boat cruise that will bring you to an island on the edge of the falls. The rumble will become deafening with the low-frequency growl of millions of tons of water sliding over the edge. It will be as if you are within a stone’s throw of the world’s most powerful waterfall, daring yourself to look that little further over the edge. From here, you will be transferred to the riverbank and follow a walking trail to the other side of the chasm, where Victoria Falls is visually presented in its untamed glory. Tiny bridges lead to a series of cataracts for inspiring photographic angles, while the surreal swirls of spray provide another showcase of Zambia’s natural drama. This is pure backcountry, perhaps best understood by its surroundings. A huge tower overlooks Niagara, and only baboons and forest can be found close to Victoria Falls. The afternoon will be at leisure before you complete your day with a second sunset dinner cruise."

Your morning snooze will be interrupted by baboons, who will wander past with a grace that belies their rowdy behavior. You are miles from anything artificial, lost in the charms of Zambia’s wilderness. Today will be at your leisure, and you might want to lie back and enjoy nature’s show. Optional activities include a helicopter flight above the falls, kayaking on the Zambezi, safari with rhinos in Mosi Au Tunya National Park, and returning to the falls for another morning with nature’s showcase."

        "description": "Within moments of landing in South Luangwa National Park, you will be surrounded. Vervet monkeys are in the trees, their mischievous black faces full of emotion. Side-striped jackals are on the move, possibly smelling a fresh kill. A herd of kudu lines the trail, a herd of eland who rest on the savannah. The brilliant red hue of Lichtenstein’s hartebeest and the graceful grandeur of elephants bring two more species you will encounter on the drive to the camp. It will be impossible to keep track of South Luangwa’s animal diversity, which will amaze you even as you just arrive. Wild and remote, this vast national park has recently evolved from Africa’s secret gem to its unmissable new icon. Diversity thrives with close to 100 mammal species delighting in the range of habitats. Rare roan antelope wander directly past the camp, waterbuck congregates in large herds, and you will see thousands of impala on every drive. With the ungulates, comes the predators. Not just lions can be seen, but also leopards, unusual serval and caracal, raucous spotted hyenas, and a healthy population of wild dogs. South Luangwa is an example of Africa untouched by man or modernity and this first day will provide an introduction to its array of wildlife."

        "description": "In the calm of sunrise will come a haunting cry. Your driver will follow, and you will find a fresh kill with a zebra’s black and white stripes smeared by flashes of blood. A large male lion is eating first, cracking through bone, and sending discarded limbs into the air. Mane bloodied, the lion will rock back onto his hind legs and unleash an intense roar, demanding the pride’s other males to keep their distance. On another game drive, you may watch the earlier stages of a hunt to follow lionesses as they dip their necks into the grass. You may also watch the hunt through the eyes of the hunted, sensing the fear of an impala herd that does not know which way to turn. Early morning is widely regarded as the best time to see the predator’s hunting. In reality, most of the hunting takes place after dark, the cats’ excellent eyesight making ambushes much easier. South Luangwa is rare in that it offers nighttime game drives as standard, so you will have a genuine chance to see leopards and lions hunting beneath the moonlight, one species boisterous and unruly, the other stealthy and silent. Over the next three days in this backcountry, you will build your own safari program with the local guides to combine the game drives with nighttime drives, walking safaris, and patient hours in the photography hides. Each will provide a new experience and a new insight into the remote world of Zambia."

But your guide’s knowledge will put you at ease as he shows you the clues, slowly helping you to identify an animal’s spoor. On a walking safari, antelopes will not run from you; rather they will stop to inspect you with curiosity. You are just another mammal, and they are not afraid so you can move astonishingly close. Likewise in the photography hides, which are expertly positioned at waterholes, you can wait patiently, and an elephant will come to drink, its huge swinging trunk less than five meters away. Then a herd will arrive, and you can watch a melancholy expression come across the eyes of the displaced old bull. Throughout your South Luangwa safari program, walks and hides create a thrilling intimacy with wild animals. Often you are so close that your finger may shake involuntarily over your camera shutter."

Explore during the day to admire the unique details of the endemic species as you observe the tight stripes of the Crawshay’s zebra, the bright markings on the Thornicroft’s giraffe, and the bizarre beards found on the Cookson’s wildebeest. Inspect sable antelope horns, a puku herd’s dancing steps, and the oribi and duiker meeting on the plains. During the day, you will see the details, but at night, you both smell and hear the landscape. When the engine is cut, you can pick up on the subtleties of the soundtrack as the hyenas communicate and the civet scurries about. You will be able to smell the tension and feel that something dramatic is about to happen. When the guide shines the spotlight, you see just how close the animals are, and you watch a lion pride harass everything at the waterhole, you will marvel as young elephants show ear-flapping shows of aggression. In South Luangwa, you can choose to stay out after an afternoon game drive, or you can return for dinner before a late-night journey into the mystical backcountry."
