This makes the Okavango Delta, as this swamp is known, one of the largest inland deltas on Earth and a true natural wonder. The delta islands are home to a vast array of wildlife, including all the usual suspects, though numbers reach their peak during the dryer winter months when animals, including many of the larger ones, migrate here. We head into the delta in mokoro dugout canoes poled by local villagers who have grown up here. Camping with our local guides, we learn more about their lifestyle and culture; in the evening of Day 5, we're also treated to traditional music and dance of the BaYei and Hambukushu ethnic groups, an unforgettable chance to learn more about their culture. The camp will be put up by the polers and we use canvas dome tents with camp stretchers, mattresses, sleeping bags and pillows provided. There is also a gazebo for shade, which doubles as a mess tent. Please note, you only need to take luggage for two nights – bags will be provided. In the delta, we get to experience African wilderness at its fullest, not least at night when the Milky Way can be seen across the sky with a billion twinkling stars.

        "description": "Matobo National Park, also known as Matopos National Park, is an area known for wildlife and kopjes (giant boulders that seem to be stacked precariously). The park is one of the best places to see both black and white rhinos and has a very dense population of leopards (though these predators are still elusive). It is also home to a third of all eagle species. These hills were once populated by the indigenous San people, who have left their mark with rock paintings depicting giraffes, elands and kudu. It was also the colonialist Cecil Rhodes’ favourite place and where he asked to be buried. We enter Matobo National Park early in the morning and go on a game drive followed by a game walk where we hope to see rhino. We visit World’s End, where Cecil Rhodes is buried, and see some of the granite formations and rock paintings. We spend most of the day inside the park returning to the lodge in the afternoon.

    "generalInfo": "The remote and rugged nature of the Botswanan wilderness means that often the best and only way to get around, particularly quickly is with a light aircraft. During this tour you will be taken from location to location in your own chartered plane, increasing time in the field, by decreasing transit times. <br/>Botswana is a legendary safari destination as it is home to one of the highest densities of predators in the world, and is one of the few places where African wild dogs can be frequently seen.  It harbours the largest concentrations of African elephants and cape buffalo anywhere in the world as well as having the largest inland delta in the world. So after all that it is no wonder why Botswana is a wildlife lovers paradise and this tour aims to showcase all the very best parts of this wonderful country, Moremi Game Reserve, Savuti and Chobe National Parks are all explored during this ten day adventure.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife safaris of Southern Africa including Botswana. Botswana is a huge country with some of the most photogenic and isolated wilderness anywhere in the world. Home to the world’s largest inland delta and the huge numbers of wildlife, any trip to Botswana is a must for wildlife enthusiasts.<br/><br/>It is hard not to be mesmerised by the wealth and abundance of wildlife everywhere in Botswana. It is because of the unparalleled populations of buffalo and elephants along with vast numbers of antelopes, zebra, giraffes and other herbivores that the country boasts some of the highest densities of large predators anywhere in the world. <br/> <br/>Lions and spotted hyenas are the most common species seen on safari<br/>here (as in many other African countries) but it is the frequent sightings of leopards and the fact that Botswana is the best place in the world for African wild dog sightings that make Botswanan safaris the best place in the world to go.<br/><br/>There are so many different places to visit in Botswana, this itinerary visits three of the most popular and best for wildlife sightings. Moremi, Savuti and Chobe are all visited here and time spent in each location on safaris. <br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Maun. We have our own private chartered light aircraft and air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers and game drives. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Botswana (and elsewhere in Southern Africa). Your zoologist or naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. Whilst the trip involves a lot of camps, these are not pitch your own tent camping camps, instead these are luxury tented camps where the tents are permanent and you do not need to bring any camping equipment or sleeping bags with you. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the Botswanan wilderness, night safaris are available in some locations (subject to the local conditions on that day). You will have to speak to your guide on arrival there and book places on these (this is not included). A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>Northern Botswana stays completely dry during September, but the centre and south may receive a few scattered showers. Temperatures climb rapidly throughout the month and no longer drop below 0°C, even in the Kalahari. Average lows are between 10°C and 15°C, a bit cooler in the south and warmer in the north. By the end of September, the days are hot everywhere, averaging over 30°C and approaching 40°C in Maun and Kasane. September is another busy month in Botswana, and the popular northern camps should be booked well in advance.<br/><br/>September and October are particularly impressive along the Chobe and Linyanti Rivers. Thousands of animals rely on these waters for survival, especially elephants. Moremi is also excellent in September, although by now the days are getting very hot. The dry, thin vegetation makes for excellent wildlife viewing and the cooler mornings and evenings are best for predator spotting as they come to the channels to drink. By September, the Okavango’s barbell (catfish) run is in full swing and it’s also prime time for tigerfish in the northwest panhandle. In September, the Kalahari and pans are almost at their driest, but the full October heat has yet to arrive. <br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced zoologist or naturalist guides as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>• Our zoologist (please check the availability of our specialist zoologists for this trip when enquiring) that escorts all our safaris has great experience working with and studying wild animals all over the world and has experience in working with large mammals on 6 continents.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it. We do our best to include as many wildlife activities as possible in all of our itineraries.<br/>• Depending on budget and interest we have a range of different accommodation packages to offer, from luxury top end lodges, national park safari lodges and mobile-camps which often offer unbelievable wildlife watching deep inside national parks as well as camping.

The first three nights are spent in the Xakanaxa region where we explore the surrounding wilderness on morning and afternoon game drive excursions. Wildlife: From the air only the larger animals are easily seen. These include large breeding herds of African elephant that live in the mopane scrub. On the open plains large herds of buffalo and lechwe can be seen and in the waterways, pods of hippopotamus are a common sight. Once you land in Xakanaxa and board your land cruiser, the smaller game animals can be found."

        "description": "Following an early morning breakfast you take a slow drive through Moremi Game Reserve north-east towards the Khwai and Mababe Areas. On this moving day we shall do a mokoro excursion in the calmer back-waters of the Khwai and Mbudi channels as opposed to doing the mokoro in the quicker moving section of the Khwai River that runs through Mababe. Habitat: The Manuchira Channel is known as the Khwai River at its eastern most extremity. The day’s journey follows this water course, with the track weaving from the riverside and floodplains into the mopane veld and the woodlands that to the Mababe Private Reserve where we camp on the banks of the Khwai River before it flows out and into the Mababe Depression. We pass the magnificent Dombo Hippo Pools in the morning stopping to enjoy the scenery and the antics of the resident hippo and shall game drive through Khwai until we reach Mababe. Wildlife: The south-east mopane veld is home to mostly breeding herds of elephant whilst the more northern reaches of Mababe is home to some impressive old bulls. The mature bulls revel in the cool waters of the Khwai River and are far more approachable while drinking and bathing than the breeding herds. The river has an unusually high density of hippo as well as some huge crocodile. Leopard- (western part of NG41), cheetah, serval and lion are common predators along this route and both Xakanaxa as well as Mababe are included in the home ranges of different packs of wild dog. General game includes southern giraffe, Burchell’s zebra, tsessebe and red lechwe with roan and sable antelope being less common residents."

        "description": "The Khwai River meanders through the concession giving ample riverside routes to explore. We spend the following two nights camping at an exclusive campsite in the Mababe concession that has a strict max of 20 vehicles for the whole concession at any given time, exploring the river banks, Kalahari shrub to the east, cathedral mopane to the south on game drives both during the day and at night. Exploring after dark with spotlights offers you an opportunity to experience some of the nocturnal animals that are rarely encountered during the day. We will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding wilderness on foot (please note that this activity is seasonal based on rains and grass height, your guide will determine the safety of walking in Mababe) to enjoy an up close and personal encounter with Botswana’s flora and fauna. It is important to note that night drives and guided walks are not permitted within the national parks and reserves. These activities are conducted outside the boundaries of the Moremi Game Reserve in the Mababe Private Reserve. Habitat: We spend our time between the dry-land habitats of the lead-wood and camel-thorn woodlands and savannahs and the riverside and marshy back-waters of the Khwai. Wildlife: The Khwai region boasts excellent populations of both bull elephant as well as breeding herds. Lion, leopard, serval and African wildcat are common predators of the region with wild dog and cheetah being less common. Buffalo use this area seasonally with large herds moving in during the summer rains. The swampy areas in the west are home to red lechwe. Other ungulates include tsesebe, blue wildebeest, giraffe, kudu, sable antelope, roan antelope and impala."

        "description": "We head further north en-route to Central Chobe region, exploring the desert-like landscape on game drives. Habitat: A fascinating days drive looking at some of the evidence of the Paleo-Lake Makgadikgadi that dried up some ten thousand years ago. The most challenging part of the trip is crossing the Magwikwe Sand-ridge that formed the shoreline for this massive inland sea. The winding track through this deep sand makes for interesting travel in the early summer! The old lake bed is now the Mababe Depression. The dense clay floor of the depression result in high protein feed for wildlife and the area teams with game after the rains. During the rainy season the depression is impassable due to the “cotton soil” and alternative routes must be used. Wildlife: A day when anything could happen. The range of habitat that is covered encompasses most of the habitat types of northern Botswana. We pass through excellent lion country and some of the best cheetah country that our safari will cover. Elephant occur throughout the drive but are more common at the start and end of the drive where permanent surface water can be found."

        "description": "Spent on game drives in Central Chobe. Habitat: Unlike the vast majority of the country, Central Chobe is not a totally flat landscape. Large outcrops of volcanic rock reach up out of the Kalahari sands, towering over the endless savannah. These hills provide habitat for a completely different array of small wildlife, birds and plants. The Savuti Marsh has been the stage for many of the most dramatic wildlife documentaries in Africa. The wide open country, good ungulate populations and particularly strong prides of lion and hyaena clans make for dramatic wildlife interaction and excellent viewing opportunities. The now dry Savuti Channel runs through this landscape linking the dry sand-veld, the waterholes, the hills and the grassland that was the Savuti Marsh. Wildlife: Undoubtedly it is the interaction between lion and elephant that is the most interesting aspect of Savuti. The area is inhabited by a huge pride of lions with numbers fluctuating from 20-30 members. These remarkable lions have learned over the years how to hunt these massive pachyderms that are supposedly above predation. Launching their attack under darkness and using their numbers, they manage to kill adolescent and even young adult elephant. The marsh is prime cheetah country and in the wet season it is not unusual to have the wild dog hunting here in Central Chobe."

        "description": "On our final day on safari we will leave Central Chobe early to travel along the Chobe River arriving in Kasane where we will stop for a picnic lunch before taking an afternoon boat cruise to end the safari. As today is a long day we recommend either spending a night or two in Kasane at Chobe Safari Lodge or two nights in Livingstone at Taita Falcon Lodge or Victoria Falls at Ilala. For those transferring to lodges in Kasane or across to Zambia/Zimbabwe it is recommended that your transfer be organized to meet you at Kalahari Tours at 15h30. Habitat: The habitat on today’s drive takes us through the stunted mopane scrub of the Goha clay basin, across the sand-ridge and through the wonderful Zambezi teak woodlands of the Chobe Forest Reserve and along the Chobe River itself. The Chobe floodplain is tens of kilometers wide and in years of exceptional rains the water stretches as far as the eye can see. Wildlife: While there are community areas that we pass through that are settled by local tribes, for the vast majority of the day’s drive we pass through wild country where wildlife moves un-inhibited by fences or man. Roan and sable antelope thrive in the teak woodlands where the low density of predators and lack of competition for food by other ungulates makes this prime habitat for these large ungulates. Leopard occur in these woodlands in low numbers but they are highly secretive and seldom seen. The Goha region has natural waterholes that hold water well into the dry season and herds of buffalo, Burchell’s zebra, greater kudu and elephant come down to drink."

It’s a complete contrast to the bush and riverine setting of Chobe further north. <br/><br/>Early starts are common on this trip. Not only do they allow you to beat the crowds to popular wildlife-viewing spots, but they also allow for the best sightings of some animals that are at their most active shortly after dawn. One example is the meerkat, and you’ll head out to find a resident family as they forage and frolic, and hopefully pose for some photos.<br/><br/>The final stop of your Botswana trip, and another stunning change of scenery, is the Okavango Delta,  its waterways teeming with animals from hippos to crocodiles. The best way to see them is from a traditional dugout canoe, known as a mokoro . You can also take a scenic flight above the delta if you wish, for some spectacular bird’s eye views.<br/>",

The vast Makgadikgadi Pans are the last evidence of a prehistoric super lake that was once found here, and today it is one of the last true wilderness areas left in Africa. Famous explorers, who passed through this region on their voyage to the ‘interior’, include David Livingstone, James Chapman and Thomas Baines. Situated in the tree line, Nxai Pan Camp consists of 8 custom-built rooms (including 1 family room). All rooms are en-suite and have thatched roofs and insulation so it is cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter. The main area consists of dining room, lounge area and a viewing deck. The camp also offers a swimming pool, library and curio shop. Nxai Pan Camp is adapted to the surrounding environment and runs on solar power. Nxai Pan is well known for its huge springbok population and once the rains have started, gemsbok, elephant and zebras migrate to the region. At this time zebras come in their thousands to drop their young at Nxai Pan. These large herds of zebra, springbok and wildebeest attract many predators – lion, cheetah, jackal and both spotted and the elusive brown hyena, as well as the endangered wild dog and the secretive leopard. Activities include game drives in open 4x4 vehicles, stargazing, day trips to Baines’ Baobab and nature walks in the vicinity of the camp with the bushman staff. Following breakfast on the final day transfer to the airstrip for your flight to Maun where your Botswanan adventure finishes on arrival."

The Okavango has many faces, which change throughout the year, prompted by that most unpredictable phenomenon of all: the weather. Water levels rise and drop, expanding and shrinking islands, while animals move where the life is easiest and the grass greenest.

Much of Nxai Pan can be explored in a day, however the real reason to visit is to take a slower pace and watch the waterholes as the wildlife arrives to drink. If you’re lucky, your patience might pay off as a hungry cheetah charges a thirsty springbok, sending a shower of dust over the waterhole. Once the summer rains arrive, Nxai Pan’s dust is washed away and the landscape turns bright and vivid, with hundreds of wildflowers providing the backdrop for the increased predator and prey interactions of the rainy season."

Today's total journey time is eight to nine hours (depending on time spent at the border crossings) including comfort breaks and a lunch break. The drive takes us north to Namibia's Caprivi Strip, before heading to the riverside town of Kasane, in Botswana. The Caprivi Region has a colourful and interesting history, playing a central part in the Berlin Conference of 1890. Named after German Chancellor General Count Georg Leo von Caprivi di Caprara di Montecuccoli, the strip was once administered by the British before it was swapped for Zanzibar with the Germans at a time of great European political manoeuvring. We'll arrive in Kasane in the late-afternoon, just in time for a refreshing sundowner at our lodge on the banks of the Chobe River. A major draw of Chobe is its elephant population - it's considered to be the largest surviving continuous elephant population in Africa and is currently estimated at 120,000 strong. The population covers most of northern Botswana, plus north-western Zimbabwe, and has been built up since the early 1900s"

The natives named the waterfall, Mosi-oa-Tunya, meaning 'the smoke that thunders' because of the plumes of water vapour that rise like smoke into the sky above the falls, accompanied by the deafening roar. In the late afternoon we'll board our boat and soak up the evening atmosphere on our sunset river cruise. Sit back and relax while sipping a cold drink and enjoying a few quiet hours along the mighty Zambezi River.

Thousands of rock paintings are here, a link to ancient ways of life in the region. An expert local guide will take you on a walking tour to see the rock art and understand the meanings behind it.<br/><br/>Moving west and leaving Botswana temporarily, Victoria Falls is on the border of Zambia and Zimbabwe.

Back in Botswana, you’ll spend a few nights under canvas in the legendary Chobe National Park, home to some 120,000 elephants as well as an enormous cast of predators and prey species including lion, leopard, impala, and zebra. Your days will be taken up with safari drives accompanied by informative guides, while at night you’ll return to the comforts of a luxurious tented camp.<br/><br/>The wildlife wonders continue in Moremi Game Reserve, which is considered to contain some of the most beautiful terrain in Africa.

        "description": ": We'll have an early start this morning as we set off on the very long journey to Victoria Falls. Today's total journey time is approximately eleven hours (depending on time spent at the border crossings) including comfort breaks and a lunch break. The crossing point into Namibia is the Mohembo Border Post. The drive will take us through north to Namibia's Caprivi Strip, before heading to Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe. The Caprivi Region has a colourful and interesting history, playing a central part in the Berlin Conference of 1890. Named after German Chancellor General Count Georg Leo von Caprivi di Caprara di Montecuccoli, the strip was once administered by the British before it was swapped for Zanzibar with the Germans at a time of great European political manoeuvring. We'll arrive in Victoria Falls in the late afternoon, just in time for a refreshing sundowner at our lodge accommodation."

        "description": ": Often referred to as the adventure capital of Zimbabwe, Victoria Falls is most famous for being home to one of the natural wonders of the world, its namesake - Victoria Falls. This morning we'll visit the falls from the Zimbabwean side of the river where the Zambezi River plummets over a sheer cliff wall spanning more than 1,676 meters/5,498 feet and dropping approximately 100 metres/328 feet into the abyss below. The locals named the waterfall, Mosi-oa-Tunya, meaning 'the smoke that thunders' because of the plumes of water vapour that rise like smoke into the sky above the falls, accompanied by the deafening roar. After the visit you can take your time to further explore the network of paths and enclaves around the falls. This afternoon is free to relax, or you can book a two-hour game drive in Zambezi National Park in search of the Big 5. Alternatively, there is the option to take a scenic helicopter flight over the falls or go white-water rafting in the Zambezi. All activities can be booked at your lodge directly and full prices are available in the 'Budgeting and packing' section of the trip notes."

There are no boundary fences separating the village from the park and game such as elephant and hippo are often spotted roaming around the town. If on the lookout for elusive game, pay a visit to the Sedudu Valley Road, where large dead trees provide temporary homes for leopards.

The Chobe Boat Cruise is a wonderful way to experience the Chobe National Park. Puku and lechwe antelopes are common on the Chobe Floodplains and herds of elephants can be seen crossing the Chobe River to the islands. Other common sites are hippos and crocodiles basking in the sun. There are a variety of boating options for the Chobe boat cruises. Guests can join a standard cruise on a river cruiser taking about 30-40 people or have the opportunity to take a smaller boat and focus on photography and birding. The bigger boats have bars on board for drinks and soft drinks. All Chobe boat cruises depart from Kasane, the town which borders onto the Chobe national park. There are regular afternoon and morning departures. One of the original natural wonders of the world, the Victoria Falls is breathtaking and not suprisingly a World Heritage Site. Known locally as ‘The Smoke that Thunders’ this spectacle is accessible from both Zambia and Zimbabwe. Unlike other waterfalls, Victoria Falls has a natural catwalk across from the falls which provides spectacular viewing."

    "placesVisited": "Stay on small, locally run campsites, Well-maintained, comfortable expedition vehicles, Shop in local communities with groups sharing cooking and cleaning duties, David Sheldrick Elephant Orphanage, Ngorongoro Crater, Serengeti National Park, Relax on Zanzibar’s white sand beaches or swim with dolphins, Visit a local Maasai village, Optional climb to Kilimanjaro base camp, Game-viewing on horseback in Zimbabwe, Wide range of adrenaline-packed optional activities at Victoria Falls, Chobe National Park, Canoe safari in the Okavango Delta, Etosha National Park, Swakopmund – Namibia’s ‘adventure gateway’, Sossusvlei, Cape Town",
    "generalInfo": "Designed by overland travel experts with the ambitious and culturally curious traveller in mind, this is an epic two-month odyssey taking in Kenya, Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and finally South Africa. Journeying in a comfortable and spacious vehicle with a small group of fellow adventurers, you’ll bond over a range of unforgettable experiences in iconic destinations from Victoria Falls to the plains of the Serengeti, and sharing duties at the locally run campsites you stay at along the way. <br/><br/>This Nairobi to Cape Town overland tour is the kind of trip where you start waking up at sunrise with the birds because you’re in a hurry for the day to begin. You’ll enjoy absolutely spectacular wildlife-watching throughout: on the floor of Ngorongoro Crater, roaming the Serengeti, on the riverbanks of the Okavango Delta, from horseback on a game ranch in Zimbabwe. These safaris are led by hugely knowledgeable local guides able not only to point out the animals to you, but to explain their behaviours. They’ll also tell you about the threats to the animals’ survival and how conservation efforts are making a difference – several of which, such as the Otjitongwe Cheetah Preservation Park in Namibia, are directly financially supported by your holiday. <br/><br/>But – as awe-inspiring as it undoubtedly is to watch as elephants cautiously approach a floodlit waterhole by night, to swim with dolphins off Zanzibar or to head out in search of the critically endangered Black rhino, it’s often the little moments in-between that will stay with you longest after your trip comes to an end. That might be spending an hour with a Maasai elder in their village to learn a little about their traditional ways of life. It could be the satisfaction of clambering to the summit of a towering Sossusvlei sand dune to take in the sunset. Or it could simply be having a laugh with a new friend as you take your turn at the washing-up station on the campsite. <br/><br/>This kind of trip does not suit everyone. It is best-suited to those content to rough it a little, to work together as part of a team, and above all to share their space. And it introduces you to people throughout who are also prepared to share space with Africa’s amazing wildlife, even though it sometimes inconveniences or even sometimes endangers them. Because they know the benefits that responsible travellers on trips such as this can bring to their communities. <br/>",

Over the next 3 days you can take our optional Add-on to enjoy a safari into the Serengeti National Park and Ngorongoro Crater. These areas are one of the world's great wildlife hotspots, and you are sure to see a huge variety of different game species including Elephant, Lion, Cheetah, White Rhino, Buffalo, Hippo, Antelope, Crocodile and Pink Flamingos as well as vast herds of wildebeest roaming the plains. For those who don't want to add this safari experience onto the trip, there are options to visit the Snake Park, visit a local Masai Village to learn about their culture and way of life. You can also arrange day trips into the Serengeti or Ngorongoro Crater (bear in mind these will involve a lot of travel time to and from the park, and therefore much more limited time actually on safari)."

Camping in Malawi sums up the spirit of an Africa overland trip with Oasis. We spend several days at friendly laid back campsites where most people choose to relax on the sandy beaches or try their hand at scuba diving, snorkelling or windsurfing as we follow the lakeshore south. If you are more inclined to just relax - then there is no better place than on the shores of Lake Malawi. This really is a warm friendly country - making it easy to wander off and meet up with your local hosts in one of the many villages or schools nearby. You can also view first hand the talent of the local artisans and purchase some exquisite pieces of furniture and carvings made out of ebony and mahogany."

        "description": "Bulawayo Victoria Falls If we can, then from Bulawayo we like to follow a journey that is steeped in history and say goodbye to the truck for a night and take the overnight train from Bulawayo to the mighty Victoria Falls. However, in recent years the service has been unreliable at best, and not suitable for us to use. Your crew will update you whether we think we can include this on your trip. If we can, then expect basic conditions, but the views and experience of looking out the window and watching the world go by more than make up for it. Alternatively we will drive from Bulawayo to Victoria Falls, arriving late in the afternoon. For some, Mosi oa Tunya - The Smoke That Thunders, is the highlight of their African safari. From the main road, in the bush 20kms away, a cloud of mist and spray can be seen against the blue sky. As you get closer, a low rumble like thunder can be heard. When you arrive it is a surprise to discover the enormity of Victoria Falls. One mile wide and hurling over 5 million cubic metres of water a minute into the Zambezi Gorge this sight is breath taking at any time of year. The water levels vary hugely depending on the time of year, but it is always an amazing spectacle - in fact it can actually be better when there is a little less water, as there is less spray blocking the falls from view. The Gorge below the falls is also the setting for one of the most adrenaline fuelled grade 5 white water rafting rivers in the world. But there is also plenty to do here for the less active too. Why not take a day trip over the Victoria Falls bridge to view the falls from Zambia, take the Flight of Angels - a great way to get a birds eye view of the falls in a microlight or helicopter, enjoy a civilised afternoon tea at the Victoria Falls Hotel, join a Sunset Boat Cruise or a more sedate Canoe trip. For those who want to make the most of the adrenaline activities, get your fix with the Gorge Swing, Abseil or 'enjoy' one of the highest commercial Bungee Jumps in the world."

You will have a chance to spend the afternoon on an included boat cruise on the Chobe River - a less intrusive way to view game and wildlife - as well as the Namibian frontier across the river. There is also time to take an optional game safari into the park if you wish. We then head south into the Kalahari Basin - known for its dry, desolate and expansive plains. On our way we will pass the Nata Bird Sanctuary, and the Makgadikgadi Salt Pans, one of the largest salt flats in the world. After we arrive in Maun, you will have an opportunity to leave the truck to venture into the Okavango Delta. Local poler guides will navigate the extensive waterways using canoes similar to their traditional Mokoro's (dug out canoes). This is a great experience - and a great way to have a chance of seeing some of elusive wildlife of this unique desert oasis. After the mokoro trip on the water, you will have a number of opportunities to go on game walks with rangers - giving you the chance to see elephant, crocodile and hippo up close and personal. The Okavango Delta is one of the world's largest inland waterways and its calming serenity will leave those who experience it feeling supremely relaxed. There is also the opportunity to experience the heights of African adventure travel too"

As well as a getting a glimpse of Zimbabwe and its most spectacular natural heritage site of Victoria Falls. Travelling in a small group on an overland truck specially designed for long trips through this wide variety of terrain, your journey starts in Namibia at its adventure hub of Swakopmund. If you arrive early you will have an option to take on a variety of experiences here from skydiving to sand boarding. <br/><br/>One of the cultural highlights of our time in Namibia is meeting the Himba people, semi-nomadic bush people who share with us some of the fascinating aspects of their lifestyles, from painting their skin with ochre and ask to communal pastoralism. After our time with the Himba, we head to the country’s celebrated Etosha National park. Here we spend two days taking in the Etosha Pan’s superb wildlife including lions, elephants and rhinos. Before heading into Botswana on day seven of the trip, we take some time in Namibia’s capital city of Windhoek. <br/><br/>Botswana boasts the most spectacular array of wildlife experiences, the first being the Okavango Delta where we spend three days. Before that we spend time with the San community in Ghanzi, thought to be ancestors of all the world’s human beings, due to their high genetic diversity.  At Okavango, we explore the immense inland data on foot and by boat, taking in its network of winding channels and small forested islands. All of which act as a giant watering hole and feeding fest for 164 different mammal species. This is followed by a day at Chobe National Park, Botswana’s oldest park, which also has one of the highest densities of wildlife in Africa, especially elephant herds. <br/><br/>There are few better finales to a trip through southern Africa than at Zimbabwe’s Victoria Falls known  locally as ‘Mosi-oa-Tunya’, which means ‘the smoke that thunders’. <br/><br/>**Important Note:** The  itinerary below is written with an optional activity package so that you can pick and choose adventures according to your budget. You need to book these in advance so do chat to us about your interests. <br/>",

Upon arrival, our experienced guide will provide a comprehensive briefing, preparing us for what to expect during our exciting afternoon mokoro excursion into the Okavango Delta.

    "generalInfo": "This 3 week trip takes you through the vast and ever-changing scenery in Namibia, venturing off the beaten track into the Caprivi Strip, where carts are pulled along the roadside by donkeys, goats and cattle wander free, and life is lived along the riverfront.  Take in the culture as you drive through: this is no museum nor village visit: it is life, carrying on without intrusion.  Experience the vast openness and serenity of the Caprivi Strip’s National Parks: lions hunting for prey, eagles soaring above, awaiting their turn, and the call of hippos and hyenas at night a reminder that you are in the wilds of Africa.  Visit Chobe National Park, renowned for huge elephant and buffalo herds: take a sunset cruise, and you might catch a herd of elephants crossing the river to get to more succulent grasslands.  Finally, cross the border into Zimbabwe: the roar of the Victoria Falls beckons: visit at sunrise for the best photography, and end the day on a sunset boat cruise: Africa will surely beckon you to return.<br/><br/>Namibia: a land of vast, open spaces, sweeping deserts, wild coastline, tall dark-sand dunes as high as skyscrapers, and diverse wildlife. Because of the mainly-gravel roads, we recommend a 4x4 vehicle to give traction and height which affords views across the expansive landscapes. This is not a mass tourism destination: roads are empty, lodges are small and distances to drive will range from 4 – 6 hours, but the rewards are great: the lack of light pollution makes star gazing immensely rewarding; seeing the sunrise over the towering sand dunes at Sossusvlei is a photographer’s dream; kayak alongside frolicking seals and dolphins off the coast; track desert adapted elephant on foot and in vehicle in the stark landscapes of Damaraland, and watch for predator activity in Etosha National Park: renowned for sightings of lion, rhino, elephant, giraffe, zebra, etc.<br/><br/>Botswana has a policy of minimising bed nights to keep mass tourism at bay: this itinerary suggests 2 nights at Chobe National Park, but you can also opt to fly into the true wilderness of the Okavango Delta, where camps are accessible only by light aircraft.  The peacefulness of the waters on this landlocked oasis, and the succulent grasses attract multiple varieties of antelope – of course then attracting attention of predators. <br/><br/>We always offer small, locally owned luxury lodges for road trips around Namibia, with a focus on Namibian culture and cuisine. From our years of experience, we recommend that the best time to go to Namibia is during the dry season, June-October, as this is not only when temperatures are manageable but also when you will get the best wildlife viewing. During these months temperatures range from 20 °C-25 °C, although they do dip at night time. The temperatures start to soar as high as 40 °C during the rainy season which, in Namibia, is between Dec-March.<br/><br/>We will provide you with detailed maps, driving directions, mobile phone pre-programmed with all supplier contacts, and 24/7 support should you require it on the ground. You will cover some distance, but never feel rushed: the spectacular scenery, endless horizons and unique experiences make a road trip in Namibia one to remember.<br/><br/>Every effort has been made to ensure your self-drive holiday is a great success with ground handlers talking you through your itinerary at the start of the holiday as well as assisting with hire car contracts before you set off. Maps, cool boxes and route notes provide further confidence for first-time drivers in Namibia in addition to accommodation contact details pre-set in a local mobile phone.  We suggest dropping the hire vehicle at the border to Botswana to avoid cross border fees, but also because transfers are easily organised between Botswana and Zimbabwe.",

    "generalInfo": "Botswana is renowned for exclusive safari experiences in untouched wilderness, and Tuli Block is the hidden gem of the country. This trip takes you to pristine African bush thriving with healthy populations of all of Africa’s most iconic wildlife and gives you a week to explore, have close, uncrowded encounters with wildlife, and take some incredible wildlife photography.<br/><br/>Spend a week at a safari camp in the heart of Botswana’s wilderness, exploring the stunning Tuli Block each day, and training your sights on a spectacular cast of wildlife.  Tuli Block is a goldmine of wildlife photography opportunities. It's an incredible location to see big cats like lions, leopards, and cheetahs, as well as larger species like elephants and giraffes. Near to where you’ll stay, there’s a hyena den offering a rare, exciting opportunity to photograph the fascinating animals up close. Your guides will also use their knowledge of the area to take you on the best night drives to find all of the region's nocturnal species. <br/><br/>Tuli Block is also a haven for bird lovers. Boasting over 350 bird species you’ll find a stunningly colorful and diverse avian species to observe and photograph. The varied landscapes, including grasslands, riverine areas, woodlands, and rocky outcrops, provide habitats for a wide array of birds. This includes birds of prey like African fish eagles, bateleurs, and numerous vultures, among a long list of beautiful bird species.<br/><br/>Whilst it won’t be the focus, the scenery you’ll witness on this trip is extraordinary and shouldn’t be overlooked. You’ll find a remarkable variety of landscapes across the Tuli Block and see a stark contrast between the rugged terrain of the rocky hills and the lush vegetation of the riverine areas. You’ll see some incredible river scenes along the Limpopo River too. The landscape throughout the area is dotted with the iconic Baobab trees too. The topography is more than dramatic enough for landscape photography, but if nothing else, it will serve as an ideal backdrop to your wildlife subjects.<br/><br/>On top of the destination and the incredible wildlife, you’ll find there, you’ll also enjoy expert guidance and tailored photography tuition across the week. You’ll be joined by seasoned wildlife and conservation photographer, UK ambassador for FUJIFILM, Alan Hewitt. Hid tuition will cover a range of topics including the technicalities of photography as well as the more creative aspects. Also, thanks to the small group size, tuition really can be tailored and personalized to each photographer's interests.",

There is only one day in Johannesburg, as we prepare to hit the road for the big beauty in between – Botswana. Which is where we spend most of this wildlife watching and adventure holiday. <br/><br/>This overland tour is categorised as budget because we travel as a small group, in a bespoke truck with a few long road trips, and camp along the way albeit in some stunning locations. Most camps have great facilities, but we do spend two nights in wilder bush camps, where everything is a bit more ‘au naturel’. Which is all part of the adventure. <br/><br/>Our wildlife watching journey in Botswana starts at the Khama Rhino Sanctuary, a stunning conservation project where we take an evening game drive to see their protected white and black rhino as well as many other wild animals on the edge of the Kalahari Desert. Our next wildlife wonder spot is the Okavango Delta, where we spend three days taking in this giant inland delta, home to zebra and lion, elephant and giraffe, to name but a few. See hippo from a trip across the delta in a traditional mokoro canoe and camp on a lagoon island, one of the wildest spots on the trip. <br/><br/>Your next campsite is on the edge of the Makgadikgadi Salt Pans, an extraordinary sight to behold, before moving further north to Chobe National Park which is all about the elephants. With up to 100,000 in the park, this is ele heaven. Last stop, Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe. Talk about going out with a splash. <br/>",

    "generalInfo": "This Southern Africa overland holiday is a small group tour, travelling in a purpose built overland vehicle, and camping along the way in some of the region’s most magnificent landscapes. Starting and ending in Johannesburg, we head into Botswana almost immediately where highlights include paddling a traditional ‘mokoro’ canoe across the Okavango Delta, seeing elephants in Chobe National Park and driving across the extraordinary sight of the Makgadikgadi Salt Pans. One particular highlight here, and there are many, is wild camping on an island in the heart of the Okavango wilderness. <br/><br/>There are few border crossings like the one into Zimbabwe, where the great Victoria Falls awaits nearby and where we spend a couple of days. Our next wildlife wonder is Hwange National Park, south of the Falls and Zimbabwe’s biggest national park. It is also famous for its prolific elephant population, and where you can spot four out of the Big Five here.  <br/><br/>There are several long journeys on this trip, and the one between Hwange and the Matabos National Park is 7-8 hours, although we break it up with a detour through the city of Bulawayo. In Matabos, we get to track rhinoceros on foot with a local expert guide and also take in the magnificence of this ancient place which has particular sacred significance for local people. <br/><br/>Our last leg of this overland itinerary is back in South Africa, and enables us to spend a day with the Hananwa people in Blouberg in the Limpopo region. There are two more big drives after this, one to Kruger National Park where we spend two days, and the final one back to Johannesburg. In Kruger, not only do we get to enjoy a full day game drive in one of South Africa’s most famous national parks, but we also camp within the park itself for one last, superb night under the African stars. <br/>",

There may also be a chance to meet any rescued or orphaned wildlife currently in their care. Hwange National Park became the royal hunting grounds of the Ndebele warrior-king Mzilikazi in the early 19th century and was set aside as a national park in 1929. Today, Hwange boasts a tremendous selection of wildlife, with over 100 species of mammals and nearly 400 bird species.

    "generalInfo": "Botswana is home to one of the highest densities of predators in the world, and is one of the few places where African wild dogs can be frequently seen.  It harbours the largest concentrations of African elephants and cape buffalo anywhere in the world as well as having the largest inland delta in the world. So after all that it is no wonder why Botswana is a wildlife lovers paradise and this tour aims to showcase all the very best parts of this wonderful country, Moremi Game Reserve, Savuti and Chobe National Parks are all explored during this ten day adventure.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife safaris of Southern Africa including Botswana. Botswana is a huge country with some of the most photogenic and isolated wilderness anywhere in the world. Home to the world’s largest inland delta and the huge numbers of wildlife, any trip to Botswana is a must for wildlife enthusiasts.<br/><br/>It is hard not to be mesmerised by the wealth and abundance of wildlife everywhere in Botswana. It is because of the unparalleled populations of buffalo and elephants along with vast numbers of antelopes, zebra, giraffes and other herbivores that the country boasts some of the highest densities of large predators anywhere in the world. <br/> <br/>Lions and spotted hyenas are the most common species seen on safari<br/>here (as in many other African countries) but it is the frequent sightings of leopards and the fact that Botswana is the best place in the world for African wild dog sightings that make Botswanan safaris the best place in the world to go.<br/>There are so many different places to visit in Botswana, this itinerary visits three of the most popular and best for wildlife sightings. Moremi, Savuti and Chobe are all visited here and time spent in each location on safaris.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Maun. We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers and game drives. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - a zoologist is not always available, please inquire at the time of booking if you wish to have a zoologist escort for this trip) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Botswana (and elsewhere in Southern Africa). Your naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. Whilst the trip involves a lot of camps, these are not pitch your own tent camping camps, instead these are luxury tented camps where the tents are permanent and you do not need to bring any camping equipment or sleeping bags with you. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the Botswanan wilderness, night safaris are available in some locations (subject to the local conditions on that day). You will have to speak to your guide on arrival there and book places on these (this is not included). A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>Northern Botswana stays completely dry during September, but the centre and south may receive a few scattered showers. Temperatures climb rapidly throughout the month and no longer drop below 0°C, even in the Kalahari. Average lows are between 10°C and 15°C, a bit cooler in the south and warmer in the north. By the end of September, the days are hot everywhere, averaging over 30°C and approaching 40°C in Maun and Kasane. September is another busy month in Botswana, and the popular northern camps should be booked well in advance.<br/><br/>September and October are particularly impressive along the Chobe and Linyanti Rivers. Thousands of animals rely on these waters for survival, especially elephants. Moremi is also excellent in September, although by now the days are getting very hot. The dry, thin vegetation makes for excellent wildlife viewing and the cooler mornings and evenings are best for predator spotting as they come to the channels to drink. By September, the Okavango’s barbell (catfish) run is in full swing and it’s also prime time for tigerfish in the northwest panhandle. In September, the Kalahari and pans are almost at their driest, but the full October heat has yet to arrive. <br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist guides as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it. We do our best to include as many wildlife activities as possible in all of our itineraries.<br/>• Depending on budget and interest we have a range of different accommodation packages to offer, from luxury top end lodges, national park safari lodges and mobile-camps which often offer unbelievable wildlife watching deep inside national parks as well as camping. We can also arrange mobile camping safaris of Botswana is very popular and all of your camping gear will be provided.<br/>• Spend all the daylight hours searching for wildlife and visiting various natural wonders and stunning landscapes.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our Botswana wildlife safaris a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Southern Africa so that we can try and find and observe some of the rarer and more elusive species. We have great itineraries and expertise in all Southern African countries (Namibia, South Africa, Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Mozambique) and can arrange trips to find some of the rarer species such as aardvarks, aardwolves, brown hyenas and black-footed cats among other species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour visit various locations within Botswana, however they are all in the north of the country. We will start and end the trip in the capital Maun and then move north and into the heart of the Okovango Delta and the reserves of Moremi, Savuti and Chobe National Park.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from a vehicle and whilst there is some walking, most of the walking is over flat terrain. This doesn't require any special fitness level. The biggest consideration is the heat, it is very hot in the wilderness of Botswana during the day.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 12 Years Old",

Campsites in and around the key destinations feature a range of facilities, some more sophisticated than others, but you’ll be camping wild in the Okavango, with only dug-out toilets and no showers. You won’t be left to fend for yourself, though!  As well as your fellow travellers, you’ll be accompanied by a group leader, driver and camp assistant, who puts up the tents each night, giving you more time to relax at the end of a busy day. <br/>",

We embark on a walk with a local guide exploring the ancient Brandberg Massif to view the Brandberg White Lady rock painting.

The park's best wildlife sightings are typically found around its productive waterholes scattered along the edge of the expansive salt pan. These life-sustaining waters draw in elephants and herds of antelope, which in turn attract predators like lions and cheetahs. On day 6, we’ll enjoy a late-afternoon game drive before leaving the national park to relax at a comfortable nearby lodge. The following day will be dedicated to exploring Etosha further, on game drives, and we will spend time waiting at the waterholes to observe the diverse wildlife come and go."

During our safaris, we'll travel in customised, open-sided land cruisers. The land cruisers are ideal for game viewing but can be a bit brisk and windy at times, so we recommend bringing layers for longer travel days. The roads through both Botswana and Zimbabwe vary in quality, so travel days can be slow and bumpy, but the scenery and wildlife more than make up for this.

We'll join a local expert guide on a short walk to see these curious little mongooses and learn about the conservation work currently taking place. It's worth noting that these semi-habituated animals are wild.

En route, you can watch as the ever-changing scenery introduces us to new flora and fauna. Savuti and Chobe are famous for their high density of buffalos and lions. During the most recent aerial game census, it was estimated a population of over 130,000 elephants was living in Botswana - around 90% of those were found to be near the lush forests and plains of the Savuti Channel and the Chobe River. Our drive today covers around 150 kilometres/93 miles. Due to the poor road conditions, we expect this to take between five and seven hours. We'll keep a leisurely pace to maximise our chances of spotting wildlife. We aim to arrive at our camp in the afternoon and the rest of the day is free to relax or do a bit of bird spotting."

        "description": "Arriving in Maun, Botswana, you immediately feel the openness of your surroundings, the air light and refreshing, the absence of traffic, and the presence of donkey-drawn carts a welcome change from the usual fast pace. A friendly welcome and a light-aircraft transfer to the Central Kalahari Game Reserve immerses you in a vast wilderness of dry, dusty earth mixed with golden grass, a testament to how thirsty this land is. Settle into your classic African-inspired lodge or camp before embarking on your first game drive in Botswana. The open 4x4 safari vehicle exposes wilderness and wildlife as you traverse plains and pans in search of peeping meerkats, your eyes peeled for impalas, wildebeest, and roaming elephants."

You may be fortunate enough to spot your favorite animal or enjoy the thrill of the search, your guide’s eyes peeled for zebra or cheetah, tracking the spoor of a lion that may have roamed by just a moment before. Visit a San village, embracing local culture and listening to intriguing folklore and tales, such as that of the praying mantis, sleek and sly in outsmarting enemies."

A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the delta offers safari experiences on the water and land, expanding the search area across rivers, over sandy tracks, and through brush and thicket. Feel the rumble of the tires as you cross woodland areas in search of the elusive leopard or red lechwe, its markings almost blending with the sand. Step inside a tender boat for an afternoon of bird watching and animal spotting, observing how the dark-colored slaty egret, mostly endemic to the Okavango Delta, captures its food by folding its wings to create an umbrella-shaped shadow over the water."

Your guide or “poler” will find a place to beach in preparation for your walking safari.

In contrast, the afternoon sees activity wind down a little, a chance perhaps to encounter a pride of lions lying on the trails and tracks as they soak up the last bit of warmth before nightfall.

Flying across Botswana in light aircraft isn't just a convenient way of traveling, it's a chance to grasp the astonishing scale of the landscapes. Your international flight arrives in Maun, where a representative assists in the transfer to a small plane bound for the Central Kalahari Game Reserve. You land in big game country, touching down in Africa's largest game reserve. One glance from the luxury camp and you can sense the enormity of it all. An elephant graces the horizon, nomadic giraffes sweep past, and there's an immediate sense of wild the Central Kalahari can be. After landing, the drive to the camp is also a game drive, a chance to spot a few animals before an evening of tranquility at the camp."

        "title": "Central Kalahari Game Reserve – Classic Desert Safari",
        "description": "Water is king in the desert. There isn't much here. The Central Kalahari Game Reserve stretches for over 50,000 square kilometers, and everything is on the move, always moving in search of water. Kudu and springbok sip from a remote waterhole, their ears peeled for danger. Elephant bulls make mammoth journeys and dig for water beneath the surface. Giraffe lope across the horizon and you follow their journey to the waterhole, where a herd of buffalo controls the precious fluid. Drive on and you're also on a search, following the water trail to find sublime encounters. Impala drink at another waterhole, but they quickly disappear as a lion pride approaches. The male's mane flows elegantly, a serene brown that stretches out like a proud beard. Lionesses approach the safari truck while three cubs play impishly besides the water. Keep driving, past a zebra herd that's on the move, then onwards to a hyena who scurries on a solo mission. Cross a ridge and there might be nothing. In the Central Kalahari, you won't find wildlife at every moment. But when you do spot big game, the encounters can be mind-boggling. In such a wild land, every encounter comes with an enhanced sense of drama. This is not a land of abundance, but an evocative portrayal of nature's battle for survival. Emotion is sketched across faces, and the tension intensifies when herds meet. Spot a cheetah and follows its prowl, tracking its desperate hunt for a meal. Find a leopard and admire how it blends into the landscape. Over these two days, you take long game drives through the Central Kalahari Game Reserve, heading into remote realms and piecing together the waterholes of the desert. These bumpy journeys are filled with raw and redolent scenes, an opportunity to see Africa's wildlife at its wildest. Complementing the adventure is the camp, a luxurious base which gazes across the flickering colors of the Kalahari. A fire crackles at night and the stars glisten above, their luminescence accompanied by the distant roar of male lions. It's calm and serene here, hundreds of miles from anywhere. Particularly after the international flight, a remote camp like this helps reenergize while still encountering the big mammals."

These dried-up oceanic lakes are larger than Switzerland, and ancient evaporation has left behind a crusted layer of glistening salt. A mirage occupies every angle, whiteness blurring on the horizon with a layer of mystique. One glance and you're transfixed. This barren landscape isn't filled with wildlife, although you will spot meerkats, the odd elephant, and a collection of roaming ungulates. Instead, you're here for a submersion in one of the world's most surreal landscapes. In the afternoon, you drive an ATV across the salt pans, surrounding yourself in the enormity of it all. Then your camp provides the iconic panorama, nothing but white cascading out beyond the horizon."

        "title": "Moremi Game Reserve – Big Game Kalahari Bliss",
        "description": "From orange to white and blue, your journey by light aircraft now takes you across the world's greatest delta. Admire the transition, subtle at first, then all-encompassing as nothing but lush colors flicker beneath the wingtips. Your destination is an island, a lost haven in the heart of the Okavango Delta. Just like the wildlife, you're heading straight for the Kalahari's ultimate bounty, the revered grasslands and woodlands that rise amidst the flowing channels of the Delta. In the Central Kalahari, you followed the wildlife prints. Now, in the Okavango, you can sit back on your camp verandah and watch the wildlife elegantly roam past. Moremi Game Reserve is the abundant centerpiece of the Delta, a place where it's impossible to count the encounters. Leopards roam through the trees and you admire, watching a female as she descends from a branch and disappears into the grass. Zebra herds splash through the water, frolicking with impala, kudu, springbok, hartebeest, and so many more antelope herds. Baboons shout from the trees and their boisterous antics forge another piece of the soundtrack. Then there are hippos, thousands of them basking in the water and rolling in the mud. And when the antelopes are in abundance there's always the scent of lions, the dominant hunters roaming freely through the landscape. For big game encounters, this is one of the finest places in the whole of Africa. Next, you land on Chief's Island and spend the day on a game drive, connecting the variety of habitats that exist in Moremi. Open grasslands are dappled with herds, thick woodland is home to primates and elephants, and you're never quite sure when the big cats will fill the experience. While the following day offers a flexible safari program, the great appeal of Chief's Island is the opportunity to explore the variety of ecosystems, making game drives an excellent choice. Walking safaris and mokoro (canoe) are also possible. And when the afternoon drifts into the evening, you always have a view from the luxury tented camp, with a procession of wildlife roaming past along the lush channels of the Okavango."

        "title": "Vumbura Plains – Exclusive Oasis Safari",
        "description": "Cross the Okavango by canoe, a slow journey that helps you fully connect with the landscape. Giraffe and elephant tower above the canoe as you weave a path through the Delta. Moving almost silently helps you get even closer, the animals not seeing you until you're right upon them. Some must be avoided, the gondolier skillfully taking you around bathing pods of hippos. Others seem to enjoy the admiration, like buffalo and zebra inhabiting the banks. The destination is an open and expressive grassland that overlooks the major waterways. From a luxury camp, you have the ultimate panorama: gaze one way for the water, then turn to spot all the wildlife of the plains. Moving away from the center of the Okavango brings a different safari experience. Local canoes are known as mokoros, and these provide an indelible means of exploration. Twist down narrow channels and most corners bring a surprise; like impala drinking, lions resting on the banks, or a hippo out of the water. You can access areas of the Okavango that can't be explored by vehicle, allowing you to venture into an often unseen wilderness. There is so much water around that it's sometimes difficult to remember that you're in the middle of the desert. Rainfall in Angola before a four-month journey brings so much life to the Kalahari. Walking safaris are equally inspiring, a chance to wander serenely through a landscape of big game. Follow the clues and you get astonishingly close. Elephants and giraffe wander by, and their size becomes more apparent. Buffalo and hartebeest reveal an unmistakable power. Local trackers ensure your safety by following all the wildlife clues, staying clear of the big cats and maximizing your encounters with dozens of different animals. Vumbura is a private reserve, and you'll hardly see other tourists. For these two days, the experience is focused on a complete immersion in the wild fringes of the Okavango, with the mokoro and walking safaris providing a serene and surreal experience."

Others curl through the northern stretches of the desert, stimulating a flourishing woodland that's home to Africa's largest collection of elephants. Some say there are 100,000 of them. Various concessions and parks converge here, and you spend your time in the Linyanti Concession, iconically situated for exploring different angles. Waterways continue to abound, and the mokoro excursions are complemented by sunset and sunrise boat cruises. A vivid swamp provides the centerpiece of the concession, its importance judged by the abundance of wildlife that call it home. Linyanti shares borders with Chobe National Park, where thick woodland brings astonishing pachyderm encounters. After trying a variety of activities, these final two days enable you to create a personalized program based on your interests. You're still deep in the wilderness, the concession only realistically accessible by light aircraft. You soar across the Okavango, taking in views of the rivers that crisscross the desert. Touch down and the sandy trails require expert guides and drivers. Access is restricted to a handful of guests staying at your camp, so every sighting is delivered with an exclusivity. Just like in the Okavango, your luxurious accommodation is elegantly perched above it all, meaning the safari experience never stops. Even when reading a book in bed, you only need to open the curtains and see hippos wading or elephants drinking. As the habitats collide, Linyanti offers an exceptional diversity of big game. There are the classic sights, those that have become such commonplace over the last ten days: lion, leopard, hippo, zebra, kudu, buffalo, impala. And of course the elephants, spotted in such staggering numbers; there could be thousands on every game drive. Then the unusual, like Sable and Roan antelope, red lechwe and sitatunga. And for a final safari treat, Linyanti is home to a stunning collection of wild dogs, rare hunters that only grace a few reserves in Africa."

Zebras typically congregate around the drier sections of the floodplains and constantly travel in search of fresh grass. You may find a pack of wild dogs on a hunt. The patchwork on their fur shine with red, brown, black, and white colors while they move through the tall grass and scattered mud patches."

Enjoy the delights of an early morning tea or coffee before venturing out deeper into the wilderness to experience the life of the wild. The private world within the reserve allows you to discover the charm of the area in a more intimate setting. The scent of fresh grass rises from the ground. In the rainy season the fields are tall and lush giving way to the exuberantly green trees, with wide branches and thick stumps. In the peak of the wet season you can look at those same branches and find lions lingering within the shade, scouring the vast plain in search of food, away from the damp grass. Their golden fur shimmers against the dark bark; their tails sway with the delicate breeze."

As the truck comes closer you can see the flicker of their ears as they search the field for the source of the sound becoming scared and uncertain. Their hooves have adapted to the muddy, slippery marshland allowing them to jump, kick, and even submerge into the water when afraid. However, it is in the open field that you once again find the beauty of the open space. A troupe of elephants marches along the grassland near the waterway.

Along the banks you can see the outlying floodplains, sandridges, and forestry displaying the variety of the surrounding scenery, filled with rambunctious baboons and stoic fish eagles. The sun begins to set and the orange and purple of the night stretches along the horizon. The numerous wildlife rangers on the boat point out the countless birds swaying, calling, and flying over the water, and in the short distance–but far enough to not feel threatened–is a pod of hippos blowing bubbles beneath the water’s surface.

The sounds of the forest are never far away as you make your way from Chobe, across the Botswana/Zambia border crossing where a ferry will take you over the river, settling into the luxuries along the Zambezi at Livingstone. The majesty of Livingstone is in the culture and surroundings that create the city, most notably one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World, Victoria Falls. The falls were named by David Livingstone, thought be the first European to ever witness their grandeur in 1855, and named in honor of Queen Victoria. When you enter the gates you can see the incredible depth and width of the falls spread over a series of walkways that lead to various viewing points. From above you can watch the river trundle over the rocks and disappear in a cacophonous rising mist. Two natural pools sit along the precipice, one known as Angel’s pool, the other known as Devil’s Pool, where you can look over the steep cliff and watch the water tumble. Along the steel bridge you step through puddles and can hardly see the water due to the encompassing mist. When the water isn’t too tumultuous you can take a boat tour to the island below, wading along the waves and viewing the true magnitude of nature sprawling across a width of over 5,500 feet and a height of over 350 feet. No matter where you watch the beauty of the falls you know that the company with which you see this magnificent display of power and nature is as romantic as an evening under the stars."

For a fabulous experience, that will bring you closer to the wildlife than you have ever imagined, you can enjoy a lion walk. The excitement behind the breeding program is almost as palpable as the thrill you have of viewing lion cubs up close. The movement of the river can be heard over your pumping heart. After a brief summary and tutorial to help you understand the various factors of the project, to help breed lions and train them to live in the wild after a certain amount of time among the staff, you step in line with two cubs under the age of 18-months. Walk along the path and watch them scamper in the dust and lounge beneath the trees, all within open and close proximity to you. It is a unique experience that brings you closer to the remarkable romance of the wild and another memory of an unforgettable vacation."

The land became a national park in the early 1970s and now covers over 5,620square-miles. The woodland savanna is lush against the backdrop of the river making it a haven for giraffes. Their long, elegant necks stretch into the canopy with their golden brown fur shimmering in the light. You can see their black tongues wrapping around the tree branches and scraping the stems clear of leaves. The afternoon is yours to relax in your lavish accommodation, returning you to the beauty of the park near sunset to experience the nocturnal wildlife that brims along the savanna.

Lagoons and meandering waterways extend beneath the wingtips, bringing a compelling impression of just how lush and large this oasis is. The Okavango is the world's biggest inland Delta system, and even during the low-water months of November to March, permanent channels ensure a haven for the rich variety of waterbirds. Touch down in the Xakanaxa area, and then take a boat tour through the waterways of the Xakanaka Lagoon, where the rare slaty egret is likely to be a major highlight. Coppery-tailed coucal and red-chested flufftail are found in the reeds, along with the aquatic sitatunga antelope. Large herds of buffalo carry birds on their backs, and there is a rich list of rare birds to see including the black coucal, the purple swamphen, and Allen's gallinule. After your boat tour, you will check into your luxurious camp for a couple of quiet hours before heading out in the late afternoon to explore the savannah on a game drive.

Birds will soon add their calls, and you will catch a view of a fishing owl and hippo pod as they enter the river below. Head off in a traditional mokoro , a narrow wooden canoe that is paddled expertly along the mosaic of channels. Along these narrow channels, you will find the birds of the papyrus and reeds, and as these flow into lagoons, you will find one of the last refuges for wattled cranes. Pel's fishing owl are abundant, and it is rare to spend an hour on the water and not see this magnificent bird. Sometimes the guide brings the mokoro to a tiny deserted island where you will explore on foot and seek out the unusual nesting birds. Traveling on foot is safe in the Moremi Game Reserve, and the local trackers will use their ancestral knowledge to keep you away from the predators and larger mammals. Often you' will be crossing broad savannah and the extensive floodplains, where the open landscape offers excellent visibility. Game drives are also an integral part of the itinerary, and they allow you to cover large stretches of Moremi Game Reserve. Elephants and giraffe grace your journey, and as you scan the marshes for lesser jacana, movement in the trees will alert you to a lone leopard. During this safari, you can create a daily program dependent on your mood to combine the different activities to build a comprehensive picture of the habitat and its residents. While early morning and late afternoon will provide the prime times for safari, there are no limitations and the activities can be as long or as short as you wish.

More of the Okavango's precocious waterbirds are seen here, including large numbers of herons, egrets, and cranes. Stop for brunch and a quick coffee at the Dombo Hippo Pools and admire the resident mammals. The humongous yawns of the hippo could easily swallow dozens of the cute rosy-throated longclaws that fly around you. Continue north to traverse the mopane woodlands to see areas that are both lightly and densely covered areas, before roaming around the swamps of Khwai. This private concession is where habitats collide as waterbirds are joined by the residents of the woodland and the swamp. This region is one of the Okavango's most picturesque areas, and it is a crucial bird-watching destination.

These sights will contrast with those of the Savuti marshlands, which are different to the birds that settle around the large outcrops of volcanic rock. This diversity makes Savuti Channel a prime bird-watching stop, yet also a haven for a full range of Botswana's mammals. In particular, you will be surrounded by the world's largest elephant population with almost 100,000 occupying these woodlands.

You're going to get wet and this only increases your admiration for what locals call “the smoke that thunders.”"

        "description": "After a leisurely morning, it's less than an hour by road to Botswana and Chobe National Park. Elephants migrate through this wildlife corridor and you often see the pachyderms within 100 meters of the immigration office. Board a luxurious riverboat and the safari starts on the water, an eclectic range of mammals dotting the banks as you cruise in comfort. The shaded upper deck offers an elevated vista; kudu and gazelle splash in the shallows, large hippo pods cover great stretches of the river, and it's not long before you're marveling at playful elephants squirting water. Elephants cover the surrounding mopane forests and you quickly lose count of the trunk swinging herds that wander past the river. After three hours on the river, you're transferred to the airstrip for a short flight to the western side of Chobe and your splendid safari camp."

        "title": "Linyanti Reserve – Big Five Safari and Romance",
        "description": "Open the curtains to elephant herds and listen to their resonant calls as you take a hot shower beneath the mangosteen trees. Your safari camp is idyllically nestled in the private Linyanti Wildlife Reserve, overlooking a hippo-filled lagoon and bordering the unfenced boundary of Chobe National Park. It's one of Southern Africa's most game-rich areas, the immense elephant numbers enhanced by bountiful leopards and lion prides. Over these three days, your local guide will craft a private itinerary that includes both Chobe National Park and the Linyanti Reserve. The former offers scale; every corner brings another elephant herd, hartebeest and kudu skip across flourishing grasslands, and hidden spots provide euphoric hunting conditions for resident prides. Game drive in Chobe and there's never a dull moment, from eagles soaring overhead to a herd of lechwe shaded by acacias. The Linyanti Wildlife Reserve offers a different experience. Access is restricted to just a handful of guests so it's highly unlikely to stumble upon another safari truck. The plains thrive with the wanderings of ungulates; giraffe poke above the treetops, impala, and tsessebe graze on short grasses, and wildebeest are joined by their renowned friends, the zebra. Such an abundance of hooves inevitably brings predators and the drama of a hunt is far more impressive when you're the only ones to witness it. While game drives bring delight, Linyanti can also offer indelible walking safaris, a chance to walk hand in hand within close proximity to the world's largest wild elephant population. And the safari experience never ends here. As a campfire crackles the silhouettes of mammals roam along the horizon it stirs evocative memories from these three days of sharing Botswana's wildlife with your partner."

        "description": "Botswana's diverse ecosystems ensure that every safari day is different. Moremi Game Reserve epitomizes this melange of environments and the next two days provide a thrillingly unpredictable safari experience. Open floodplains, woodlands dotted with acacias, riverine ecosystems, marshlands, and the famed grasslands that roll beyond the horizon. Just a single game drive can take in all these places; cheetahs chasing impala, rhinos emerging from the trees, wild dog finding a haven to hunt, and then the omnipresent elephants crossing paths with giraffe. Your safari camp is situated in its own private reserve, ensuring that short local safaris bring enchantment without the crowds. King-sized beds stand on wooden floors raised above the landscape, en-suite bathrooms offer unrivaled natural panoramas, and your private verandah is perfect for moments of solitude in Botswana's hinterland. Like every camp on this itinerary, expect five-star deluxe interiors yet harmony with the surroundings. Moremi Game Reserve forms part of the Okavango Delta, a vibrant oasis in the Kalahari Desert. Wildlife migrates for hundreds of miles to drink from the effervescent channels and your safari experiences are imbued with tropical colors and boisterous calls. After arriving on a light aircraft the itinerary is flexible. Stop for lunch in the heart of Moremi's plains, looking around at the 360-degree concoction of grazers. Safari by boat and admire the mammals that come down to drink, as well as the crocodiles that laze away an afternoon. Choose short game drives or go on an all-day adventure that crosses rutted trails and seeks out lucid eyes in the forest. Evenings are languid and bewitching, another chance for gourmet cuisine and quiet moments with your partner."

        "description": "Another micro flight takes you to the southeastern realms of the Okavango. Gaze down at lavish waterways and green hues, and then across at the blistered yellow of the surrounding Kalahari. The maze of canals and lagoons call for a new safari experience: a traditional wooden mokoro canoe. Glide peacefully across the blue and sounds begin to break the silence. An endemic flock of lovebirds, the rustling of buffalo in long grass, springbok sipping along the banks, and then the haunting yelps of an ungulate being pounced upon. This beautiful and remote corner of the Okavango Delta offers a very traditional and peaceful experience. While a land camp brings constant excitement and unpredictability, a water camp is all about settling into an unhurried rhythm and allowing nature's spell to slowly take hold. The profusion of wildlife is often hiding in the canopy of green, yet patience provides rewards, and those who stay silent are treated to astonishingly close encounters with a myriad of Botswana's great mammals. You're many miles from any road, camp, or settlement. So the stars bring additional sparkle to pristine evenings, the clinking of wine glasses sometimes the only interruption to the omnipresent hush."

        "description": "The green tinges and blue shades soon disperse as you fly into Namibia. A major highlight of this amorous vacation is using micro flights to connect destinations. A journey between Okavango and Etosha may take three days by road. The aerial route catapults you from hinterland to hinterland in just a couple of hours. Take off and landing provide opportunities to witness herds from the sky and the aesthetics begin to ingrain new ideas about the scale of Southern Africa. You can fly for hours and swoop above nothing but wilderness. As the fringes of Okavango disappear behind the rear of the plane, the panorama turns a scorched yellow; you're entering prime desert landscapes and these four days in Namibia reveal two very different parched landscapes. Etosha is one of Africa's largest national parks, a vast dusty expanse crossed by nomads seeking water. Carefully positioned hides provide intimate encounters: cheetahs crossing, gemsbok and hartebeest migrating, cast-out elephant bulls with melancholy eyes. Your safari camp, perched above Etosha, is perfect for nighttime and walking safaris. Walk together and leave footprints in the dust, a skilled guide keeping you on the trail of both Black and White rhinos. Again, patience and silence provide rewards. Don't make a sound and you can feel the tingling sensation of standing less than 20 meters away from a wild horned rhino. It's another addition to this all-encompassing safari, a unique experience that will linger for decades in the memory."

The desert vistas continue for two hours, a million dunes rising and falling beneath the wingtips. Your final destination is Sossusvlei, a remarkable natural wonder and a chance to experience the uninhabited and untrammeled desert. Gaze out from your lodge and there's little but sand dunes for hundreds of miles in every direction. So just imagine the view when you watch the sunrise from a nearby dune on day 14. The sun's descent leaves lasting reflections on both days, sand transformed from yellow to orange and then the exuberant red that Sossusvlei is famous for. These two days include all activities and you'll be treated to a myriad of angles. Few places offer such a romantic backdrop to complete a vacation."

Ahead of you is your first destination, just a short flight away, at a safari camp in the heart of the Okavango Delta. This unique ecosystem is a geological marvel, brought about by a tectonic trough within the dry and dusty land of the Kalahari Desert. The rains that fall in the highlands of Angola flow down to this alluvial fan and create an oasis of spectacular and diverse scenery, wildlife and birdlife. Your charming safari camp is an elegant lodge created from local timber, reed, and thatch and is nestled in the Moremi Game Reserve. This reserve was named after Chief Moremi of the BaTawana tribe and is the ideal location for your initiation into the wilds of Botswana. For the next two nights, enjoy your private and secluded view of the lagoon in front of camp, or venture to the cozy fireside lounge for cocktails in the evening. There is a swimming pool with a breath-taking view and you can lay back and watch out for some of the famous bird species of the area, or explore the watery channels by mokoro .

The camp consists of eight gorgeous safari tents elevated on wooden boardwalks and decks, hidden in amongst the cool and inviting riverine woodland. Resident hippo will serenade you from the water on the floodplain in front of the camp. Each tent has its own viewing deck and a breath-taking view over the Delta, so that if you wish, you needn’t leave the comfort of your own room for your safari! During the next two days, experience the elegantly serene aspect of the Okavango. There is no better way to do this than to climb into a mokoro and be propelled gently through the glassy waters of the Delta by an expert poler. Serving as your guide, your poler can point out some of the hidden gems of this stunning wilderness, such as kingfishers, herons, crocodiles and perhaps even a fish or two! After a relaxed lunch and siesta, head out once more in a vehicle and end the day with an exhilarating game drive, searching for predators on the hunt in the cooler air. The next morning, why not complete the true safari experience with a bush walk where you will be able to appreciate fully the finer details of this paradise. Your guide (who will carry a rifle whilst walking as a safety precaution) will open your eyes to the science and skill of tracking animals on foot. From game drives, to bush walks, to mokoro safaris, to a relaxed sojourn in the double-tiered boat, your camp has a huge range of activities on offer to allow you to truly soak up the blissful landscapes both on land and on water. There are windy, meandering channels, wide lagoons (for some superb fishing), swaying palm trees, and cool, dark forests to explore. In this private concession, you will be able to traverse sensitively off-road if you are following a predator on the hunt and at night your guide will use a spotlight to illuminate some of the nocturnal beauties of this wilderness. Whether you wish to venture out on these many excursions or stay in the comfortable luxury of camp, the warm and friendly staff will ensure that you have an unforgettable stay."

Within reach of Zambia, Namibia, and Zimbabwe, you will have access to a range of Southern African landmarks and game reserves.

The endless pods of hippo and families of elephants crossing the river provide even more photo opportunities and unforgettable memories! Take a sightseeing cruise to Sedudu Island for more stunning scenery. For all thrill-seeking fishermen, tiger fishing in the Chobe and Kasai rivers is a must-do.

Visit one of the most famous features of this thundering wonder, the Devil’s Pool, which is only accessible to visitors at certain times of year. Enjoy a rather adrenalin-fueled dip in a pool that develops with a current minimal enough to safely swim in, within tantalizing reach of the point where the falls descend into an abyss! There are many and varied activities in and around Victoria Falls. There is white-water rafting, bungee jumping, boat excursions, fishing, craft fairs, and beautiful walks for those keen on one last outdoor experience! Or, enjoy a last pampering at the hotel.

Kgalagadi is so dry that local folklore suggests the rivers only run once a century. It’s desolate and empty, yet the battle for survival makes for fascinating first safari encounters. Elephants dig beneath the withered channels, expertly uncovering underground streams and sharing the bounty with a herd of cute babies and relieved mothers. Thirsty nomads migrate across the evocative landscape, their shapes easily picked out along the horizon. They’re heading for the permanent waterholes, and that’s where you’ll go on your Botswana game drive. A kudu herd look to have timed their arrival perfectly, lapping up the muddy water in peace. But turn around and three prowling lionesses have decided to join the party. When you first arrive in Botswana, a light aircraft will take you from Maun to Kgalagadi, where you're welcomed by a game-filled off-road transfer to the delightfully secluded camp. You’ll see nature’s finest mammals in Kgalagadi, but you won’t see other tourists. Like most of Botswana, these vast national parks are open spaces that are explored by just a handful of visitors. It’s very different from the more famous parks of East Africa or Kruger, where there are often other safari trucks in your line of vision. It’s you, your partner, and a wonderful array of wildlife. As a campfire crackles you dine outside, the table illuminated by moonlight while a few antelope rustle in the nearby bushes. Today sets the tone for the whole trip; serene, sublime, and filled with intimate moments."

        "description": "Kgalagadi is most active in the early mornings, before the sun has risen to domination and the residents must conserve precious energy. Leave at sunrise and stop beside a waterhole for a delightful breakfast in the bush. As you drink coffee, kudu and eland compete for the waterhole, watched from a distance by a hungry leopard. Understanding this desolate ecosystem requires a couple of hours beside the permanent water, slowly taking in the competition for resources and the drama it brings. The kudu and eland spot the danger and wander off, happy to bide their time. But a herd of blue wildebeest aren't as smart, and the leopard’s precise movements don’t alert the sentry. As you tuck into breakfast a battle erupts; hooves kick up dust, the lame get left behind, and the cat also enjoys a breakfast feast. Spend the day in Kgalagadi, relaxing at the camp and taking private game drives to the popular spots across the park."

        "description": "As you soar over the Okavango Delta the elephant herds can be spotted from the air, slowly marching across the floodplains and joining the migration to this luxuriant oasis. So much of Botswana is rugged and raw, yet the lush waterways of the Okavango are fresh and refined. Both have an endless beauty, although it’s difficult to imagine that the Kgalagadi and Okavango are in the same country. Soak up the hippo-filled channels and gaze down on the river from your private verandah. It would be easy to sit back and spend three days watching everything approach your stunning camp. Elephant herds say hello as you kiss on the balcony, giraffe greet you when you open the curtains, a lion roar interrupts an alfresco dinner, and paw prints surround the luxury en-suite tent. The wildlife is everywhere. Zebra and lions battle it out on the verdant floodplains, Nile crocodiles sunbathe on the riverbank, and various antelope species impress with their fantastic array of horns. Private game drives provide a succession of affectionate moments. Hartebeest rest their necks on another’s back, a lion pride seems to take a keen interest in your partner, and there are hundreds of isolated places to stop and share a moment. Back at the camp it feels like you have all of the Okavango to yourself. Again, don’t expect to see more than a handful of other tourists; indulge in the seclusion that Botswana can provide."

        "description": "Most couples can remember a romantic stroll together, a walk through nature that filled a day with enchantment. Today’s walking safari should be no different, although you’re not going to be alone when you wander through the forest of Moremi Game Reserve. Go slow and listen. Rustling suggests that something is nearby, and then an elephant’s bellowing call flickers through the trees and drowns out your footsteps. Keep walking, peering through the branches at a herd of gazelle that hide in the distance. A skilled guide picks the route, weaving a path through forest, grassland, riverbanks, and ancient animal trails. Turn a corner and there he is, a four ton elephant staring you down. Stop. Savor the moment. Admire the astonishing proximity. Eventually the elephant wanders on and you continue your journey, the trail revealing close encounters with giraffe, buffalo, and all the antelope species which you can now distinguish. Your three days in Okavango are easily tailored to suit your mood. Walking safaris can be swapped for game drives, and vise versa, and a charming canoe safari awaits tomorrow. Each activity provides a new angle; from a vehicle you cover more distance and see more animals, while the experience on foot has a marvelous realism and a stunning evocation of nature’s power. After the drama of the safari the camp awaits, and what could be better than sitting on the balcony, wrapping a blanket around each other, and allowing Botswana’s indelible residents to sporadically interrupt the private party."

        "description": "Loud splashing and bellicose grunts sail across the lagoon alerting your gondolier to a hippo fight. He paddles slowly, gently revealing the riverbank and all those who come down for a hearty drink. You’re in a narrow dug-out canoe, feasting your eyes along the luxuriant blue channels and rich grass covered banks. Before you reach the hippos, it’s an elephant herd that fills the channel, youngsters playfully trying to drown each other and trunks occasionally popping out from the water. Distant commotion seems to be putting everyone on edge, and as you gaze across the river your eyes meet the elevated snouts of a full hippo pod. Aggressive males are testing their strength by powering into each other. It’s not a full blown fight, but it will be if neither backs down from these opening exchanges. It’s often the hippos that provide the drama as you go on a canoe safari. Balancing the experience and tilting it towards grace and charm will be the endearing herds that drink from the shallows. Even the hyenas have a certain elegance as they greedily lap up the water as you paddle past. Hippos aside, there’s tranquility in being on the river and soaking up this epic oasis. Every mammal seems to have a smile and each sighting provides another photo opportunity. Yet it’s the sheer inescapable beauty of the Okavango that lingers longest in the memory. A million shades of green juxtapose with the crisp blue water, and a fabulous contrast is provided by the ubiquitous herds."

        "description": "Every great safari itinerary should leave you wanting more. While every couple wants to see everything, Botswana’s greatest trick is to save a surprise and reveal something new every day. Elephants and giraffe will never have left your itinerary, but as you arrive in Chobe it’s hard not to be baffled by their numbers. Imagine the sight of 100 of Africa’s largest wild elephants, weighing in at four tons and towering above any safari truck. Now try and picture what 100,000 would look like. Nobody knows how many wander across Chobe, although recent estimates suggest that six figures is not far off. You won’t be looking for them. Sit on the bed and gaze out at a couple of herds. Come back from the en-suite bathroom and find another three herds plodding along the horizon. When you settle into bed you can’t escape their calls, and when you wake in the morning they’re beside your tent. It’s not just the elephants that come in huge numbers. Giraffe are also seemingly everywhere, poking their heads above the trees and quietly munching on the vegetation. Impala join this abundant party, as do a healthy collection of boisterous hippos. You don’t get bored. Sometimes it’s an old bull wandering lonely out of the forest. At other times you’re bewitched by tiny babies taking their first steps. Occasionally herds face each other down as they approach the water, while few moments can encapsulate the Botswana experience better than checking into your tent and discovering telltale footprints in the nearby sand. From the Okavango a light aircraft will take you into Chobe National Park, dropping you on an isolated airstrip beside the Savuti Marsh. In just 30 minutes you’ve been propelled from one of nature’s great phenomena to another."

        "description": "Chobe isn’t just about the giants and the herds. Resident leopards patrol the rocks and forests nearby, using the outstanding vistas to plot a morning of hunting. Zebras and gazelle are forever on the canter, constantly looking for fresh grazing ground that isn’t dominated by prowling lions. On a game drive you spot a lazy pride, lounging beneath a tree and seemingly uninterested in the playful antics of the cubs. Hold your finger on the shutter and wait for the humongous yawn and then gleefully capture a full mouth of sharpened teeth. But it seems that the lions weren’t happy to have their photo taken. One rises and stretches, staring at the safari truck and then slowly wandering across. Instinct causes you to step backwards and grab each other’s hands. Slowly you force yourself forward to have a closer look at the predator. There was no need to be so worried, the lioness just wanted to sleep beside the back wheel. While the hunting scenes and immense herds imbue a stunning sense of power, Chobe packs in a dazzling enchantment. It’s on display from the splendid comfort of your camp. It elevates the moments of affection you have with each other. And it ensures that you’re constantly comparing moments and discussing your favorite memory from the day. Stop to appreciate the zebras, how they tentatively care for each other and gracefully canter away from danger. Admire the hartebeest and see how their horns indicate power in the herd. Gaze at a slumbering leopard and meet its shining eyes with your own. And find your very own piece of Africa in this pristine section of the world."

        "description": "Everyone dreams of the perfect African wildlife photos. You’ve probably got the zoom lens ready as you arrive in Botswana and feast your eyes on the Central Kalahari Game Reserve. But before the first game drive, it’s worth switching lenses and taking some time to capture the scene. There is your camp, secluded and charming as it sits in the middle of the famed Kalahari. A few kudu and hartebeest dot the dusty landscape, and, well, that’s about it. Botswana offers unrivaled wilderness. There are no roads, very few other tourists, and nothing to interrupt your continual immersion in nature. And as you photograph the camp’s evocative surroundings things begin to move. Perhaps an elephant that gently emerges on the horizon, maybe a carefully camouflaged hyena running through brittle grass, or a herd of wildebeest that were hiding behind your tent. After arriving in Maun you’ll transfer to a light aircraft and land in the heart of Africa’s second largest game reserve. You’ve got three days in an untouched land that covers more than 50,000 square kilometers. Enchanting sights are easily spotted from your bed. Just open the curtains and one of Africa’s greatest theater spaces dazzles in front of your eyes. As you head out on a game drive, a flurry of close-ups require steady hands and sharp shutter speeds. While the Kalahari may sometimes look barren, it’s home to a phenomenal concentration of majestic black-maned lions. Prides lounge beneath the sporadic trees, seemingly sleeping. But zoom in and most of the lions have one eye open, carefully inspecting the land without betraying their slumber. It’s not you that excited them. A gemsbok herd meanders nearby, heading to the waterhole. Capture the change in expression as the lionesses rise and plot their approach. Then follow the scene as it slowly plays out."

        "description": "The Central Kalahari Game Reserve will provide two very distinct collections of photos. There is the raw desolation and ruggedness of the landscape; grass wilts beneath the sun, dead trees rise randomly from rocky ground, and endless bushland changes color with the rains. A tower of giraffe or an antelope herd provides the contrast in the distance, while a wandering herd may require a new focal length as they pass the camp. Documenting the sheer power of the Kalahari is something that will fill these three days. But there’s also the charming close-ups; the melancholy of a lone elephant bull, a kudu’s frightened expression that quickly changes to relief, or the solemn stare of a stealthy leopard. This emotion not only adds spectacular life to the Kalahari’s power, it epitomizes the dynamic nature of an ancient environment. Over these two days you’ll be going on long morning and late afternoon game drives. Not only will you be exploring during prime lighting conditions, these times are also when the wildlife is at its most active. When the blistering midday sun comes down you take a rest or a siesta at the camp. The reserve’s sheer size means that you’ll cover long distances, looping past popular lion hangouts and stopping beside overpopulated waterholes. Such a challenging environment makes for an intense battle for survival, and this is the Central Kalahari’s unrivaled attraction; big cats out on a hunt, desperate herds searching for water, boisterous males fighting for mating rights, and scavengers seeking out a meal. Go exploring and the dramas of Kalahari life will never stop."

        "description": "This unique itinerary combines four very different destinations. The landscapes seem so disparate that it’s almost impossible to believe that they’re all from the same country. Depart from the tiny airstrip and fly over the Kalahari to Makgadikgadi, a vast dried-up lakebed that provides a real challenge for photographers. A blanket of white extends beyond the horizon, the salt pans shimmering and glistening beneath the sun. Levitating above the ground is a misty mirage, blurring the contrast between land and sky into oblivion. Start taking photos. The glare poses one problem, while the intense white adds another. And where do you find contrast to bring the photo to life? Photography isn’t supposed to always be easy. These two days will take you deep into the heart of one of the world’s most surreal landscapes. Experiment, play around, and take your time, because when everything comes together the results are spectacular. On your first afternoon here you’ll be exploring the edges of the pan. Discover meerkat colonies that seem to be awaiting your arrival. They stand and turn their heads with comic timing, before scurrying across the ground and playfully joining others. Go slowly and it’s easy to approach and even shake hands with the meerkats, although any sudden movements and the whole colony humorously waddles off. As your guide walks you into the pan a peculiar cast awaits. Out of nowhere an ostrich appears and skips past. Rare aardwolves and bat-eared foxes scamper to their burrows, while brown hyena leave their prints in the salt. Return to camp and gaze skyward to another white wonderland. It’s hundreds of miles to the nearest settlement and artificial light. So leave the shutter open and get those dreamy shots of stars moving across the night sky."

You’re surrounded by the cracked salt and lost in a lunar-like landscape that baffles both eyes and camera. Evocative dead trees appear from nowhere, adding a poignant contrast to the photos. Elephant prints snake and then disappear, while bird song welcomes you to sporadic sandbanks. As you spend two days here you get used to the conditions. Gradually your shots begin to do the landscape justice, and it almost looks like you’ve been photographing the moon. Makgadikgadi reflects the unrivaled attraction of Botswana, because while many Africa countries can offer excellent photographic wildlife safari, nowhere can combine it with such crisp dazzling landscapes. Spend a whole day getting lost on your quad bike and then return to camp for another night of marveling at stars."

For five days there has been little more than a shriveling waterhole or struggling channel. And now this! Lagoons stretch for as far as the eye can see, flourishing rivers weave through lush grassland, and a lavishly blue world sits in the middle of the desert. Nature’s greatest oasis will be your base for the next three days and you certainly won’t be alone. Wildlife migrates for hundreds of miles to reach the year-round bounty of the Okavango and the sheer abundance of life is unmatched almost anywhere in Southern Africa. Impala skip past the camp, elephants and hippos are counted in their hundreds, and a wonderful cast of Africa’s greats surrounds you at every turn. The Okavango is a place where your camera must be ready at all times. Sit back on your private verandah and out of nowhere a zebra herd approaches. Open the curtains and the nearby waterhole is filled with frolicking elephants. Turn a corner during a game drive and 15 giraffe block the trail. This is a place of nonstop action, continual excitement, and thousands upon thousands of photo opportunities. Sometimes it’s too much to take in. You’re eagerly snapping away at a playful hippo pod and your guide alerts you to the lion pride that’s silently walked to within meters of the vehicle. By spending three days here you have time to relax and soak up all the enchantment. There’s no need to rush. Each safari adventure can be long and customized, allowing you to stop beside a serene scene, or follow paw prints into the wilderness. Settle into your camp and savor the views from the balcony, before a long afternoon game drive begins to reveal the breathtaking wealth of the Okavango."

        "description": "The Okavango River starts its journey in the Angolan Highlands, descending and picking up speed before it bursts and spreads over a huge area in Northern Botswana. When the water level is low everything is still green, and herds congregate for nature’s year-round banquet. When it floods, the delta becomes an almost endless sheet of water; ungulates splash through the shallows, lion prides drink with abandon, and hippo pods fill the channels, eyes and snout poking out from the blue. In the heart of the Okavango Delta is Moremi Game Reserve, a labyrinthine web of waterways, lagoons, and tiny islands. Your base will be Chief’s Island, a permanently dry landmass that couldn’t be any further from modern civilization. Many herds get trapped on the island when the water rises, while thousands of big cats are able to flourish in a relatively small area. This is arguably Botswana’s, if not Southern Africa’s, flagship safari destination, and your camp is idyllically surrounded by everything. Don’t expect much time to carefully plan your shots, as the action will be coming thick and fast. Slither down the winding river channels on a traditional mokoro , a dug-out canoe, an expert gondolier taking you past dozens of hippo pods and the enchanting life that approaches the riverbank. Swap wheels for walking boots and wander across the island, your finger shaking above the shutter as you come face to face with most of Botswana’s wild animals. That includes elephants, although expert guides ensure you never get too close to the big cats. On long game drives it feels like you’re in a wildlife documentary, the nonstop succession of predators and prey unrivaled almost anywhere in Africa. Customize your own program of safari activities and allow this unique spectacle to impress from many different angles."

They plow through the trees, surround your camp, play in the water, and seem to find a way into every photo. Giraffe are similarly omnipresent, as are the cumbersome hippos that fill the river. Almost 100,000 wild elephants roam across Chobe, making this easily the largest concentration of them on the planet. Photograph the cute babies as they try and keep pace with the herd, zoom in on families that play in the water, sometimes nothing but a curled trunk poking out from below. Capture the loneliness of an old male that’s been cast out from the herd. Then zoom out and see just how many elephants you can get into one shot. Linyanti is a private reserve within Chobe National Park and if offers a wonderful degree of privacy and seclusion. Like elsewhere in Botswana, there won’t be other safari trucks ruining the image, or dozens of budding photographer’s shooting the same scene. Particularly when compared to East African safaris, Botswana’s lack of crowds ensures that the untouched world is yours, and only yours to discover. It’s the elephant herds and hippo pods that will likely dominate your first day here, so play around with the camera settings and revel in the endless opportunity to photograph nature’s largest mammals."

And nothing is going to spot you before you turn the corner. There’s no need for the zoom lens as a tower of giraffe stand above the safari truck. Elephants block the path and then stand next to it. These Kalahari elephants are the largest in the world and they dwarf the vehicle, so don’t use the flash and startle them. Return to the camp for a lazy last lunch on your balcony, overlooking a waterhole and watching the assorted cast of characters come for a drink. The final game drive is for going slow and savoring Botswana for one final time. Watch a pair of cheetahs elegantly survey the scene before dipping below the grass. Smile as the hippos waddle into the water and boisterously push each other out of the way. Hide around a corner and wait for the rustling to get closer. What will emerge from the trees? This time it’s a graceful impala herd, but it could easily have been a rampaging elephant. Don’t rush.

Valleys and parched riverbeds slice through the landscape and you're catapulted into a secluded uninhabited plain. There are just a small handful of other guests at the luxury tented camp.

You're continually on a game drive, the guide going slow and winding past popular spots for Africa's big game. Hold each other's hand as you stop alongside a tower of giraffe, their elegant necks framed against a backdrop of red hues. Stop at a shriveled waterhole, sit on the camping chairs, and enjoy a leisurely lunch overlooking the action. Elephants barge and push each other under, kudu point their horns and sip tentatively, then the zebra are scared away by a large herd of buffalo. Your guide understands that this is a romantic vacation and will ensure you have your own space as often as possible. On these remote and barren plains it's rare that you'll come across other safari vehicles. So forget any notions of a dozen trucks surrounding a lion. For most of the time, it's just the two of you alone with nature. Turn away from the sprinting springbok herd and admire the hunters. A pride walks unhurriedly along a sandy trail, black manes flowing on the breeze and argumentative cubs trying to keep pace with their mothers. The Central Kalahari is famed for its lions, the ravenous hunters thriving in a seemingly challenging environment. Cheetahs are also a mainstay of safaris here and four days is a good amount of time to capture elusive leopard sightings. Arrive at the mobile camp in the afternoon and soon redefine your notions of camping. The spacious canvas tent offers uninterrupted immersion with the Kalahari. But it's sprinkled with luxury touches for the discerning couple. Stylish indigenous décor, wooden flooring and deck, en-suite bathroom with ceramic toilets, luxury bedding and thick fluffy pillows, and there is nobody else around for hundreds of square miles."

Exhilaration builds as the rhino moves closer, a lone wanderer in search of water. You want to grab the camera but you can't. The scene is too difficult to leave. That's the final one of the Big Five checked off your list, but by now you'll have learned that Botswanan safari isn't about lists of animals to see; it's about the feeling of being transported in the animals' kingdom. Continue your Kalahari adventure today with another drive heading roughly westward. As always, expect an unhurried pace and the guide occasionally waiting in the vehicle so you have priceless hours of seclusion in these game-filled hinterlands. Every moment of the experience is safari: game drives, sitting around a fire as giraffe necks silhouette against the raw sunset, or following a lion pride for over an hour as they stalk the ungulates at the waterhole. Tonight's luxury tented camp continues the theme from the last two days. So you should both expect the impressions of nature to proceed uninterrupted."

        "description": "As you cross rivers and weave onto the fringes of the Central Kalahari, new colors suddenly arrive like apparitions from a dream. A white wonderland stands before your eyes, the crusted layer of salt stretching far beyond the horizon. The Makgakigadi Salt Pan is one of Africa's most unexplored natural wonders, the carefully preserved wilderness untouched by footprints. Meerkats peek their heads from the chalky mirage, hoof prints suggest zebra are nearby, and a mirage floats just above the ground. Today's experience is one of Africa's most remote and rugged. Leave the safari vehicle and ride a quad bike into the whiteness. It's a 90 minute journey, each mile taking you further into a baffling landscape. Botswana is firmly dedicated to conservation and permanent structures are not permitted on the pan. The quad bike journey must follow a defined route that doesn't harm the landscape. Camp has been set up on a raised platform of grass with 360 degree views over the salt pan. It's very simple, but it's more than worth it. Thick mattresses are rolled out beneath the stars; a crackling fire keeps you company, and the stars shine uninhibited."

        "description": "Rumble out of the salt pan and enjoy a leisurely morning at a camp on the periphery of Makgakidadi. Enjoy a sumptuous breakfast, take a long hot shower, and then board a tiny Cessna aircraft for the next part of your safari adventure. New colors come through the window, vibrant canopies of green surrounding exuberantly blue waterways. You're still in the desert, still in a land that barely receives rain, but water cascades down from the Angolan Highlands and forms the Okavango Delta, an immense oasis and haven for millions of mammals. There are only two seats in the back of the plane and you're flying together over the Okavango. Touch down on Chief's Island, a flourishing green blanket that's inaccessible by road. Your camp is cleverly perched above the river, ensuring that wading mammals are an omnipresent part of the backdrop. It's hard to sit on your secluded veranda and not see something on four legs. Enjoy a late afternoon game drive that explores the forest. It's overgrown and rugged here; the visibility is reduced yet the spine-tingling intimacy is increased. Gaze into the branches and see a leopard lying in silence. Wait. Stay quiet. The leopard elegantly climbs down and begins its evening hunt."

        "description": "An early morning game drive continues the safari adventure. The Okavango Delta and the Central Kalahari are very different destinations; the latter is dry and remote, meaning that animal sightings are usually concentrated around permanent water. But in the Okavango you'll see mammals dappling the landscape at all angles. This afternoon provides a new perspective. Climb into a traditional mokoro canoe and an oarsman takes you along the waterways. Admire the life on the banks, everything coming down for a slurp of goodness. Elephants are particularly impressive on a boat safari. But the longest impression is left by the hippos. Hundreds, perhaps thousands of them can be seen in just one mokoro trip. Large pods rest in the channels, barely leaving a snout above the water. Others rumble across the floodplains, their hefty bulk somehow managing to lend it an air of cuteness. Return to camp for another romantic leisurely evening, a dinner table illuminated by kerosene lanterns and the two of you far away from any other guests."

From Chief's Island you take another unforgettable air safari, the pilot swooping above the waterways and dropping you in an undisturbed corner of Chobe National Park. Views of moving elephant herds are especially impressive from the sky. Touch down and an afternoon game drive brings dazzling encounters with the pachyderms. Giraffe are similarly abundant and as you gaze across the horizon you see multiple necks poking above the treetops."

Like always, enjoy a leisurely pace, lots of privacy, and the safari to continue from your exclusive camp. There's sure to be defining moments that will stay with you for life.

        "description": "The landscape changes but the charm continues on the second part of your Southern Africa escape. Fly over to Mozambique and gaze down at the sapphire waters. You'll be picked up from the airport in a private helicopter and taken over to your own Indian Ocean island. Hundreds of islets and sandbanks form the Bazaruto Archipelago, almost all of them uninhabited. There are only half a dozen private cottages on your island, each tucked into the trees yet elegantly opening out onto the beach and marine blue. You have your own pristine white sand beach, an attentive butler bringing anything you might need, and the absolute bliss you would expect from a tiny Indian Ocean island. Rest, indulge, and decompress in this dreamy combination of sand and indigenous forest. All drinks and meals are included and brought to your wooden cottage. Think cocktails served in freshly dropped coconuts, lobster straight from the ocean, and a chef that tailors the menu to your palate. For five days time stands still. Lie in the hammock, lounge on the sand, splash in the crystal clear shallows and enjoy the languid rhythm. A variety of activities complement the island's utopia. Traditional wooden sailing boats can be chartered to tour the archipelago. This is a UNESCO World Heritage site and the conglomeration of sandbanks hide sheltered lagoons and bays for days of enjoying the sun. Step out from your beach and a vivid marine reef awaits your snorkel. Dolphins regularly swim past and you can swim with whale sharks, the ocean's biggest fish, and a regular visitor to these waters. Go fishing or scuba diving, or simply turn over and reapply the sunscreen."

        "title": "Savuti - Indelible Residents at Savuti",
        "description": "Scorched land welcomes you to Botswana, a sweeping expanse of dusty savanna surrounding the transit hub of Maun. Views from the plane window provide an indication of scale as you transfer to a hopper flight and cross the northern half of the country. First comes the lavish waterways of the Okavango Delta, then swathes of rich green forest, and now a prehistoric landscape as you land in the very west of Chobe National Park and the Savuti Channel area. Dead trees rise from a shriveled lake bed, firmly rooted yet struggling to flourish in such a challenging environment. Savuti epitomizes the dynamism of Africa’s wildlife world. The erratic channel flows for years, and then mysteriously dries up for decades. Very recently, for the first time in almost 30 years, a once dusty lake bed has become a vibrant marsh. Savuti provides a raw and unadulterated safari experience as the competition for natural resources plays out before your eyes. Charming and intimate, your camp overlooks the Savuti Channel, the centerpiece of the region. Private wooden balconies provide platforms that gaze down on the animal world. Your luxury tent is raised off the ground on stilts, so it’s possible to sit on your sumptuous bed and watch a few buffalo wander past. Meals are served under the stars with the unmistakable trumpeting calls of elephants for company. Hidden hides have been built around the channel, providing unforgettable close-ups of the wildlife that approaches the water. Wander down and watch in awe as everything comes seemingly within touching distance. Sometimes you don’t even need the hides to get that close. The camp is perfectly blended into the environment, and elephants are among the inquisitive creatures that take a closer look. If you arrive in time then the afternoon will be spent on a game drive. If not, rest up and get your first glimpses from the balcony."

        "title": "Savuti - Spectacular Safari Around the Savuti Channel",
        "description": "It’s difficult to overstate the importance of water to this region. Since 2010 the channel has been filled with swimming crocodiles and drinking herds. Yet it was parched for decades. An indelible collection of residents has always lived in the area, but the channel’s recent transformation has seen the whole area become an oasis for wandering nomads. Head off into the surrounding hills and gaze down on Savuti from leopard territory. The stealthy cats hide high in the trees, a swinging tail betraying their camouflage. Klipspringer nimbly jump across rocky outcrops while herds of zebra and wildebeest make their irrefutable journeys through the forest. Now descend into the marsh area, tracking the footprints as an abundant cast is magnetically attracted to the water. Three days provide the opportunity to really explore Savuti’s combination of habitats. Go on game drives through the woodland; lone elephant bulls uproot trees, giraffes feed from the high branches, while kudu herds rest in the shade. When the trees rescind you’re out on open expanses of savannah, the grass color dependent on whether you’re here in wet or dry season. When the rains come the wildlife disperses across a large area, meaning that there is never a moment without something to admire. Some of the plains become near deserted during the dry months, nothing but a roaming lion pride on the parched ground. But the animals haven’t disappeared. Just follow the trail to the water. A normal safari day will combine a collection of activities with a few hours of relaxing at camp during the mid-afternoon sun. Drive on rugged trails and watch a surreal world unfold. Lionesses are out on the prowl, inspecting the water and causing a herd of zebra to curtail their morning drink. Elephants and giraffe seem to accompany every turn; endearing babies try and keep pace with the rest, lone males walk with a melancholy air, and herds compete for prime river space. Swap the wheels for a boat and saunter downstream, taking in the collection of wildlife from a new angle. There’s a charming serenity to being on the water, before it’s interrupted by a crocodile snapping at an impala on the banks. Customize your luxury Botswana safari trip with drives and boat trips, and drench yourself in Savuti’s spectacular world."

        "description": "The Savuti Channel snakes and stutters as it marks the western edge of Chobe National Park. It’s not alone. Other channels sporadically flow and become intermittent waterholes. Others have been dry for centuries, leaving behind sandy banks and winding trails. This morning your game drive follows these ancient channels, taking you on a challenging route through the rarely seen wilderness. Elands grace the trees with their majestic horns and impressive size. Buffalo herds appear lost on the open stretches of savannah. Other antelopes find solace in the woodland, knowing that there is less threat of predators here. Your destination is Linyanti in the Northwestern corner of the park, the extended game drive bringing you to a new camp and exhibiting the range of ecosystems that mark Chobe. Settle into your camp and gaze down on the permanent waterhole beside your luxury tent. As always, camp and tent don’t reflect any connotations of budget travel. The canvas walls ensure nature’s soundtrack always plays, and the tents effortlessly demonstrate Botswana’s commitment to ecotourism. Concrete would look extremely out of place. Wooden floors and decking surround the tent, while raised beds and en-suite bathrooms provide an elevated level of comfort in the bush. You’ll have hot showers and Western toilets, as well as a wandering cast of ungulates approaching your balcony."

        "description": "Whereas Savuti provides a demonstration of nature’s challenges, Linyanti reveals what’s possible when water always flows. Cruise along the river and stop beside a playful elephant herd. Young males test their strength by half drowning each other, their trunks rising from the depths like a submarine’s periscope. Adults splash themselves with ongoing jets of water, while babies take first swimming lessons beside a mother’s watchful eye. Open lagoons become havens for hippo pods. They spend all day in the water, and from the land, you get little more than a glimpse at some snouts. Yet a boat safari brings you within meters; males jockey for position and mating rights, huge hulks of flesh appear like stepping stones across the blue, and it’s possible to see pods that number up to 40 individuals. During the dry season, wildlife migrates for hundreds of miles to reach Linyanti’s oasis. Come in the wet season and the whole area becomes a verdant floodplain, the antelopes poetically skipping through miles of shallow water. Such abundance supports an astonishing collection of predators. Lion prides rest beside your eyes, happily allowing the safari truck to stop just meters away. At least, they appear to be resting. But an open eye suggests that a lion never sleeps. They stare provocatively, a hunter’s opportunism symbolized by this eerie scene. Linyanti provides a genuine opportunity to spot the predators out hunting. Three days of safari helps maximize your chances. Perhaps it’s a couple of lions stalking their prey from a distance. Maybe it’s the panicked yelp as a Sable antelope provides the dinner banquet. It’s not limited to lions. Leopards come out in the cool hours, dipping their necks below the grass with solemn precision. Wild dogs hunt with remarkable ingenuity, splitting up and then surrounding an impala they hounded away from the herd. When the predators aren’t your focus a dynamic array of wildlife keeps you company. A dazzling array of colors flutters across the pristine lagoon, while a sporadic soundtrack reaches your tent on the breeze. Your time here is split between game drives and boat safaris. Mornings and late afternoons are the best times to spot the wildlife, although your itinerary is flexible and can be tailored on a day to day basis."

        "description": "Chobe National Park is easily wider than a few European countries. The tracks that cross it are rough and rugged, weaving a route through riverine forests, endless marshland, rolling grassland, and dusty savannah. It’s a full day journey from west to east. Well, if you drove without stopping it might only take a few hours. But these rarely visited stretches of wilderness offer innumerable places to stop. Pull up beside a swamp for a picnic with the hippos. Stop in the trees and photograph rare Roan antelope. You’re driving along and suddenly the guide breaks sharply. Did you hit something? No. The truck reverses. A lion pride is resting in the grass and three tiny cubs are within meters of your camera. Crossing Chobe allows you to not only spot wildlife. It gives a real impression of the park’s scale. Take the elephants. In the last six days, you will have seen thousands; after all, Chobe contains the largest population of wild pachyderms in the world. Some estimates suggest that 100,000 live in this area and herds migrate here from neighboring Namibia, Zimbabwe, and Zambia. Drive across Chobe and you’ll see thousands in just a couple of hours. Just try and imagine what that looks like. Difficult isn't it? Every turn seems to bring another herd and some herds number in the hundreds of individuals. A full supporting cast accompanies the journey, so expect a day of big cats, indelible antelopes, hundreds of giraffe, and nonstop enchantment. Your destination is the banks of the Chobe River and another private verandah overlooking the wildlife."

Beyond the Chobe River is Namibia, the flat grass plains offering a glimpse into Botswana’s mystical neighbor. Spend the day on an elegant river cruise, boarding a luxury barge and serenely exploring everything that comes to the riverbank. In Savuti you will have been on a boat safari in a small dig out mokoro (canoe), yet Chobe’s width and size means that larger boats can effortlessly make the journey. So relax on the top deck, drink in hand, and wait for Chobe to idyllically reveal itself. Elephants and hippos are the most plentiful wildlife attractions; it doesn’t matter how many times you’ve spotted them on this trip, every individual is always an endearing sight. Eagles soar overhead, crocodiles sunbathe on the banks, and a troop of baboons calls from the treetops. However, the highlight of an all-day Chobe cruise is soaking up the landscape. Lavish grass peeks out above the floodplains, sandy banks are covered in hippo prints, and immense trees dominate one bank, while endless savannah rolls out from the other. A delicious buffet lunch is served on board and this day provides a tranquil end to your safari adventure. After disembarking you will transfer by road to Zambia, and Victoria Falls. It’s less than an hour to this natural wonder and your exclusive lodge on the Zambezi River."

It guides your journey, increasing in volume as you approach the largest waterfall in the world. Falls can be wider, or higher, but none dispense as much water as this thunderous natural wonder. As you get closer you see the mist rising above the canyon in thick clouds. Through the trees, you grab a quick glimpse of Victoria Falls before you walk out onto Knife-Edge Bridge and stand in awe at the scale. A mile-wide sheet plummets 328 feet into the abyss. During high water season, the spray rises and then descends onto the bridge, soaking everyone in seconds. Don’t try and avoid it. Getting wet is part of the experience. While high water is best for appreciating the raw power, low water times provide easier photo opportunities and better views. Whenever you visit, you’re going to be inspired. Spend the day appreciating the falls and understanding why its indigenous name means “the smoke that thunders.” A collection of walkways and narrow bridges take you along the length of the falls, before dropping you down into the canyon for a new vista. Even now the safari hasn’t finished as a collection of baboon troops patrol the walkways. The Zambezi River and Victoria Falls provide a seemingly endless array of entrainment. Pump up the adrenalin levels by bungee jumping or white water rafting, or slow down with a luxury dinner cruise. Then there is what Africa offers best; relaxing beside the river and watching an animal world go by."

Iconic Table Mountain towers above the city, providing a dramatic backdrop to the ocean and harbor. Rising almost vertically from the ocean, the Table Mountain chain offers stark shapes and a skyline that any city of skyscrapers would envy. Then a remarkably blue ocean stretches well beyond the horizon. Nestled between ocean and mountain is the city, calmly blending into its natural surroundings and offering a world class tourist experience. You'll be met at Cape Town International Airport and transferred to your hotel. Proudly located on its own private quay, the hotel is perfectly situated for exploring the city and enjoying serenity. It's at the center of the Victoria & Alfred Waterfront, Cape Town's most exclusive area. Gaze out onto the Atlantic Ocean. From here there is a real sense of being on the edge of the world. In fact, set sail from here and the next direct stop would be Antarctica or South America. All the hotel's newly redecorated rooms have breathtaking views. Either of Table Mountain, the ocean, or the harbor.

        "description": "With four days in Cape Town you'll have plenty of opportunity to experience many of the city's unique attractions. History, nature, animals, beaches, mountain, culture, wine farms, museums, markets; Cape Town has one of the most diverse set of attractions on the planet. Included in your itinerary is luxury chauffeur transfers to anywhere within a 10km radius of the hotel from 7am to 11pm. Private transfers can easily be arranged to any of the attractions outside the city. All this lets you tailor every day to your own needs. But with so much on offer where do you start? It's a breathless and challenging two hour hike to the summit of Table Mountain. Fortunately, a revolving cable car also makes the journey, offering a spectacular 360º panorama of the city below. From the top of Table Mountain the whole South Western tip of Africa rolls out in front of your eyes. On one side the blue Atlantic Ocean continues into the distance. On the other, the Table Mountain chain extends and continues until the very tip of the continent. Down below, the city shimmers under the sun, buildings flanked by green forest and the curve of Table Bay. On many days a waterfall of cloud gradually descends over the mountain. This stunning sight is one of the highlights of Cape Town and often occurs in the late afternoon. However, it can quickly ruin the views from the summit. Once the cloud comes it won't disappear until the next day. That's why it's always good to visit the summit at the first chance the mountain is clear. Cape Town's mountain backdrop isn't just about the Table Mountain Summit. Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens offer easy hiking trails and restaurants with peerless views. The Durbenville wine farms lead visitors on a merry tour through exclusivity and winding green valleys. Peering over the ocean, Chapman's Peak Drive is one of the world's most spectacular roads. It clings to the mountain, an engineering marvel that twists and turns its way to the south-western tip of Africa. Viewpoints along the road showcase the peninsula's wonders. Gaze down on the pristine white sand of Noordhoek, admire cute fishing villages that sit in the mountain's shadow, and watch huge swathes of green wilderness unfurl as you reach the very tip of the continent. Driving the Chapman's Peak Drive sometimes feels like driving over the ocean. And it's this ocean that brings more of Cape Town's marvels. At Boulders Beach a huge colony of jackass penguins waddle uninhibitedly, casually jumping into the ocean or playing with their partners. They fill the beach, at times standing and squawking within touching distance of visitors. Arrive in the late afternoon to maximize your chances of paddling in the gentle waves with these incredible birds. Further along the coast, just two hours drive from Cape Town, is the world's best land whale watching spot. From May to November, huge numbers of Southern right and humpback whales migrate along the coast, stopping to nurse their young in the still waters. From the Hermanus cliffs it's possible to spot these 30 foot plus giants in sheltered coves barely 75 feet away away. Boat trips take people even closer. From the town's relaxed waterfront, a local cryer uses a kelp horn to alert people of any passing whales. Ocean also means beaches. Relax on Camps Bay Beach, the upmarket hangout of the city's beautiful residents. Or wander the endless stretches of sand north of the city, gazing back at the mountain skyline. The ocean also holds history. Ex-inmates give tours of Robben Island , telling stories and allowing people to feel just how hard life could be. Imagine a cell little bigger than a bed. Now imagine being incarcerated there for 18 years, receiving a visitor just once a year. Nelson Mandela spent 18 years on Robben Island and this poignant tour only increases your admiration for the man. Then see another side of the city's history by wandering the colorful streets of Bo Kaap, the former slave quarter where every house is painted a different bold shade of paint. Cape Town is shaped by its history and its residents. Each culture brings their own styles, diminutive fragments harmoniously coming together to create a unique atmosphere that's hard to find anywhere else on the continent. Fine dining restaurants combine the best of disparate cuisines, local markets showcase centuries old tradition, while the city center reveals influences from all over the continent. This is a city of diverse experiences and the relaxed vibe perforates through it all. Savor fresh barbecued seafood from a restaurant overlooking the bay, meet colorful traders with fascinating stories to tell, then enjoy a local glass of wine as the sunset paints a vibrant picture. With four days you've got an opportunity to sample all of Cape Town."

You'll be transferred to Cape Town International for your flight to Maun. You'll be met in Maun and assisted with your hopper flight to your camp. From this tiny plane the views are unforgettable. Thick swathes of vivid forest contrast with brown dusty desert, while the great waterways of the Okavango Delta meander and then expand into huge lakes. This is a world that few people inhabit and you'll be landing in a sweeping expanse of savannah. Just west of the heart of Chobe National Park, this is a wild area marked by its unpredictable wet and dry cycles. It's home to a full assortment of nature's great mammals, and offers one of the world's most sublime game viewing experiences. The unique combination of habitats attracts a diverse collection of wildlife and offers a variety of Botswana safari experiences. Let's start with the surrounding Gubatsa Hills, where ancient rock paintings tell a story of when early man first viewed wildlife in this area. Leopards sleep high in the trees, coming down to hunt any passing migrants. Klipspringer camouflage into the stone, nimbly clinging to tiny ridges and then agilely jumping between rocks. During the summer rains, great herds of zebra and wildebeest migrate to the fresh marshlands, raising the eyebrows of resident predators. Cape buffalo and elephants also arrive in their thousands, large herds marching onto the savanna. Black-backed jackal scurry around, while thousands of kudu and other antelope graze with a mindful ear. Lion prides dominate the eco-system, taking their pick from innumerable prey that feeds on the lush grass. Cheetahs are a spectacular spot, the speedy predator always finding a meal on the savannah. Hyenas roam for miles, looking for easy targets or leftover scraps, while African wild dogs hunt in intelligent packs. Savute is a pristine and untouched environment, where the animal interactions have not been affected or altered by man. Water dictates life in Savute. For many recent years the riverbeds were dry, and for many years before that they were swarming with swimming crocodiles. Now the water has returned and the stunning transformation of the landscape has attracted more and more wildlife to the Savuti Channel and the Zibadianja Lagoon. Located on an isolated part of the famous Savuti Channel, your camp offers front row seats for game viewing. Charming and intimate, this camp has five luxury walk-in tents with en-suite facilities. Polished wooden decking provides large balconies where the daily animal world plays out in front of your eyes. Raised off the ground on stilts, it's possible to gaze out from the tent onto the grasslands and spot playful elephants, lions, and unmistakable herds of buffalo. Luxurious and perfectly blending into the environment, this is 5* ecotourism at its best. A thatched dining area, bar, and plunge pool, are all available on site. Meals are usually served under the stars, with wine and beer included. Dotted around the camp are well positioned hides that offer incredible close-up wildlife viewing. These safe sanctuaries allow you to appreciate a world that is scarcely believable. Unlike other wilderness areas, this region offers numerous different ways to experience the wildlife on offer. Game drives take you onto the savanna in Land Rovers, bringing you unbelievably close to the wildlife residents. Lone bull elephants stare at the vehicle, while over 300 species of resident birds thrill you with their spectacular antics. Then a night drive reveals a different side to the environment. Aardvarks, servals and porcupines, come out under the cover of darkness, and your experienced guide knows just how to track them. Now saunter downstream, taking in the wilderness from a boat and spotting the wildlife lazing along the embankments. Finally, get even closer with a thrilling walking safari, guided by experienced animal trackers."

        "title": "Okavango Delta – Nature's Great Phenomenon",
        "description": "The largest inland water system in the world completes your unique Southern Africa itinerary. The Okavango Delta is a meandering series of waterways that support an inimitable array of animal and plant life. Technically this area is semi-desert, and without the delta it would be dry Kalahari savannah. Rains fall in Angola's western highlands, flowing into Namibia before entering Botswana and spreading out over an immense area that is the Okavango Delta. This natural wonder is visible from space and has been chosen as one of the seven natural wonders of Africa. Animals descend on the Okavango, coming for the life-giving source of water that flows all year round. A diverse assortment of birds and plants have evolved to maximize the Delta's bounty, and great numbers of hippos and crocodiles thrive. Little Tubu camp offers a perfect opportunity to immerse yourself in an ecosystem that cannot be found anywhere else. Situated on Hunda Island, its isolated location is ideal for enjoying the diverse species that call Okavango home. An elevated dining area and pool deck stand in the shade of a riverine tree canopy, overlooking a seasonal riverbed which flows with the constant wanderings of a variety of game. With a maximum of six guests, Little Tubu offers an exclusive and intimate experience. Each traditional style en-suite tent has a private deck, ensuring the spectacular views of the Delta are maximized. This unique environment can be enjoyed in many different ways. Daytime and nighttime safari drives explore the acacia woodlands, each turn through the trees bringing a new delight. Elephants lurk around the corner, lion prides can be found in the clearings, while springbok, lechwe and kudu vigilantly drink from the water. Warthogs scurry across the ground, while zebra and Sable antelope adds their distinct colors to the cast of regularly spotted wildlife. At daytime the spots are easier, but under the thrilling blanket of darkness it's possible to get very close to the animals. During the winter season, usually from May to September, it's possible to explore the delta by boat or traditional wooden mokoro. Hippos bathe barely meters from the boat, Nile crocodiles cover the embankments, while every river turn reveals another animal tentatively taking a drink. After the savanna, the Okavango Delta offers an entirely different and equally inspiring wildlife experience."

        "description": "Welcome to the shimmering swamps of the Okavango Delta. From Maun, the gateway to paradise, you will fly by light aircraft over the glistening channels of this oasis towards your first destination on the western edge of the Moremi Game Reserve. As you fly over one of the world’s most extraordinary ecosystems, you will be able to see the expanding wetlands as you cross from Maun into the heart of the Delta. The water seeps into the Kalahari sand to create striking contrasts of clear blue lagoons and dry, dusty bush. This landscape has attracted abundant wildlife, and the animals and birds of the Delta can flourish uninterrupted in this world of plentiful water, fertile soils and, of course, that famous African sun. Whilst staying in this wilderness, you will experience unparalleled beauty and adventure. Wake up to the sound of lions roaring through the early morning mist, or hippo grunting contentedly amongst the reeds. Your camp is situated in a tranquil and remote location on its own island (aptly named “Paradise Island”). You will find yourself in a picturesque spot, where watery channels seep into the grassy plains and the large ears of elephants can be seen dotted around the palm islands, flapping gently to cool the grey giants hidden by the reeds. Climb aboard an open Land Rover and head off in search of leopard and lion; glide soundlessly through the channels by mokoro to spot kingfishers and herons and walk in the footsteps of giants on a guided walk. With a hat, camera and binoculars, you are ready to take on any adventure! These lodges pride themselves on their minimal impact on the environment; your hosts will proudly show you the solar panels installed to minimize fuel usage in the camps, and the camp’s gorgeous wooden structures that mimic the stunning natural surroundings."

This huge concession consists of a mosaic of habitats stretching from the permanent waters of the Ngoga Channel, surrounded by papyrus, through open grassy plains, to forested tree islands and dry mopane woodland. Your safari lodge has a unique and contemporary design, with star-decks and sunken lounges to allow you to absorb the starry Botswana skies with a gin and tonic in hand after a long day of gallivanting. This area is abundant with a huge variety of species, from the famous golden wild dogs, to handsome sable and roan antelope. Duba Plains is set about with vast, seasonally inundated floodplains, and it is here that the lion population has really come into its own. This area has become famous for interactions between the great buffalo herds and the resident lions that have adapted to the watery territory and hunt during the day, their strategies being centered around the manipulation of the buffalo across the grassy floodplains. At either camp, you can look forward to a range of adventures and expeditions in new terrains, on game drives or bush walks for a more peaceful and intimate experience in the bush. When water levels allow, you may leap aboard a motorboat or a mokoro and head into the lagoons and watery channels for a relaxed cruise or for some fishing. The area is teeming with a vast array of predator and plains’ species just waiting to be discovered."

This area is home to vast herds of elephants, particularly during the winter months, and the area is teeming with wildlife from predators to general game. During your three days here, walk in the footsteps of King Gustaf and Queen Silvia of Sweden, who fell in love with the famed banks of the Linyanti River in the 1970s. Your camp is named after this royal pair, and its setting along an oxbow-shaped lagoon is appropriately regal. The double-tiered barge named The Queen Silvia offers you the chance for a sunset sojourn along the Linyanti, with stunning views, a convenient bar on deck and comfortable couches to recline on!

Upon leaving Botswana, fly over the Kazangula border, a point where the four countries of Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Zambia meet. As you approach Livingstone, keep your eyes peeled for the spray of the epic Victoria Falls! Your destination will be one of two spectacular lodges. No matter where you stay, there will be time for a gorgeous sunset cruise before dinner on your first night. There are game drives to be enjoyed throughout the Mosi-Oa-Tunya National Park, or if you prefer to keep to the water, there are more river cruises, and for the fishermen among you there are several excursions for you to partake in! If you’d prefer a peaceful meander through the stunning surrounding area, you can join an expert guide on a nature walk. If you’d like to learn about the fascinating local culture of this part of Zambia there are museums and tours around Livingstone itself and there are craft markets and village tours on offer as well. Your guide will discuss the options with you upon arrival so that you can choose what interests you most. Get the heart racing a little with a view that’s hard to beat, from helicopter or micro-light aircraft. Meander in a canoe, zip around in a jet boat; take a unique safari from the back of an elephant or, for the really brave, try the white-water rafting! Of course, you may just as easily lie back on your deck and just watch the world go by; if you need to take it slowly after the last few days of adventure, there is no better place to kick back and let the sounds of Africa soothe you to sleep."

The charm of the morning is in the cooler air when most animals, the nocturnal searchers and daytime hunters, wander through the brush; the night-dwellers ready to settle in, while the diurnals are ready to come alive. With the light of dawn you will venture out along the floodplains of the river, meandering through the woodlands, and finding the splendor of the landscape every step of the way. On your first game drive in Africa you will climb aboard an open-air vehicle and find the teak buildings of your lodge quickly fading behind the trees. The cold, early ambiance is speckled with light. Whether winding along the wetlands or sifting through the trees, the animals are apparent and abundant. You can see the pale, creamy fur from collections of impala through the trees in almost every direction. The adolescent males’ horns proudly point in long strides. They are able to leap up to 10 feet in the air when scared or defending themselves. You can hear a thumping in the distance combined with the tearing of wood. You come across a herd of elephants brushing against the trees and marking their pathway. The Kalahari elephants are the largest of any elephant population, while their tusks are shorter due to the brittleness of their ivory caused by a calcium deficiency in the soil. They break branches and eat the leaves and rip through smaller saplings. Your guide points out the matriarch and you spot a baby elephant following her lead, tearing where she tears, stepping where she steps. In the heat of the afternoon you can make your way back to the lodge or venture out onto the river to enjoy the cool edges of the water and the calm ripple beneath the sky."

Whether a lone bull or a collection of females and adolescents, the elephants’ presence is breathtaking as they meander away from the tree line and stomp through the knee-high water, splashing along as they turn away from the island."

        "description": "The floodplains are yours throughout the day where you can listen to the sensational sounds of the morning delta beneath the African dawn. After a delicious breakfast you will step into a traditional dugout canoe called a mokoro ; the strong wood and dedicated craftsmanship of your vessel is apparent. The canoe winds you along the delta within the sweet scent of fresh grass before arriving at your new accommodation, Moremi Crossing. Within the heart of the delta is the palm-fringed islet that overlooks the endless game of Chief’s Island, creating a friendly and secluded atmosphere from which you can enjoy the floodplains. Sit on the deck beside the pool beneath the shade of the trees and relax under the thatched dome roof of the main deck overlooking the marshland. Whether you choose to venture once more through the delta on a mokoro or search for tiger fish on a fishing boat in a lagoon, the afternoon is yours to experience the sensational surroundings at your whim and pleasure. Once aboard the peaceful, drifting canoe you can quietly come across the deluge of animals that sip at the shores of the grassland. The view of the landscape is extraordinary, offering sensual tranquility and displaying the vastness of the delta, which reaches as far as the eye can see."

        "description": "When the morning dawn peeks over the horizon it brings the rising birdcalls echoing in the trees like a chorus. Time has slowed into that which has come to soothe you: the rich colors of the day, the gentle calls of the wildlife, the elegant breeze that ruffles the trees. With another day, you can venture out to witness the grandeur of nature in a variety of ways; your guide will lead the way. It is easy to be mesmerized by the surrounding marshlands, which range from green to gold depending on the season. As you search for the Big Five, elephant, rhinoceros, leopard, Cape buffalo, and lions, known as the deadliest animals in Africa, you are in awe. A roar flairs into the air, the power is palpable; a lion’s roar can be heard from around three miles away. Looking into the trees you can sometimes find lions looking out over the delta, away from the water and into the tall grass in search of prey. The remarkable display of the lion pride’s fortitude and imagination has these animals resilient within the changing wetlands of the region and displays for you an incredible side of the animal not often seen by visitors. Their golden fur glints in the sunlight as they laze in the afternoon heat letting the trees provide a shady respite. Lions are known to sleep approximately 20 hours per day but are quite opportunistic about their hunting despite this schedule, often letting the situation dictate their actions. In the stunning landscape, surrounded by the wonders of the wild you can only feel a relief and awe at the beauty of the lazing pride."

You look out over the deck and can see the clear, open sky spread over the delta. The colors of the early light paint the horizon a frenzied rainbow as the rhythms of the evening ascend into the calls of the day. The serenity of the moment comes as much from sharing the seclusion with your loved one as from the natural wonderment that hasn’t ceased to mesmerize you every step of the way. After breakfast you will transfer to Maun and make your way to Johannesburg en route towards home. If you'd like to spend more time in Botswana, browse the Botswana safari page for additional ideas on how you can extend your custom trip. Or, consider extending your time beneath the endless expanse of horizon, enjoying time in South Africa, Zambia, Namibia, and more.

        "description": "Wake to a chorus of birdsong and emerge onto the deck to find a flutter of tropical birds. Red wings merge with green beaks and there's always an exotic winged sight around the camp. Grunts alert you to hippos wading across the channel, while echoed shouts suggest elephants are nearby. Relax, take your time, slowly allow your rhythm to slow down to Okavango levels. Nothing is rushed here and a great appeal of the safari is being able to fully disconnect from the rest of the world. A plunge pool overlooks the channel – a great place to watch the hippos – while your private verandah offers a wonderfully tropical panorama. While Xigera is perched on the edge of an island, the vegetation is thick and swampy, providing a hiding place for an assortment of wildlife. Rather than go by land, these two days are all about exploring by boat. Travel in a wooden mokoro (traditional canoe), the guide paddling along the channels that hug the western fringes of the Delta. The Okavango River spills from the west, and it's this area that offers the wildest green colors and most resplendent channels. Paddle slowly, past the hippos that quarrel. Watch them interact, size dictating dominance in the pod. Turn a corner and the huge grasses rescind, revealing an elephant herd bashing their rumps against palm trees. Seeds rain down from the trees and the pachyderms eagerly gobble them in mid-flight. Another turn and a very rare sitatunga fills your vision, grazing elegantly on the banks. With a mokoro safari, you're virtually silent, which helps to get you exceptionally close to wildlife. Motorboat safaris provide a greater range, enabling you to travel towards the most game-rich areas of Moremi Game Reserve in the Delta. It's not quite as charming, but then you turn a corner, and a tower of giraffe are juxtaposed with zebras' stripes. Or a lion pride lurks silently, glimpsed through the flickering of the grass. Xigera doesn't offer high densities of predators, but it provides a genuine water experience and an indelible introduction to this inspiring wilderness. A flexible program of motorboat and mokoro trips are offered, and the camp is a serene base to start taking it all in."

Hippos fighting on the banks, lionesses jumping after red lechwe, a buffalo herd barreling its way across the water, then turning around when it gets too deep. It takes half a day to arrive at your luxury accommodation and what an arrival there is! Three lion prides inhabit the camp's immediate surroundings, along with resident leopards and the prowling of a hyena pack. It's often possible to see the predators from your private tented suite. Raised on stilts above the ground, your luxurious suite provides a confluence of natural immersion and modern opulence. It's at one of Botswana's most exclusive and popular camps, where there are just nine suites offering wonderful views over the floodplain; expect big game sightings from your bed. After lunch at the camp, you head out on a game drive across Chief's Island, getting intimate with the exceptional abundance of predators that lurk nearby. Over these three days, there are multiple opportunities to see some of these breathtaking animals on a hunt."

        "description": "Chief's Island provides drama, the green enclave providing a bounty of food for almost all Africa's large mammals. Ungulates come here in their droves, supporting the myriad of predatory cats. On an early morning game drive, you see them in action. A vervet monkey hangs limply from a leopard's jaws, the spotted hunter taking to the trees for a morning meal. A racket of protest comes from neighboring trees, the rest of the troop voicing disapproval but unable to challenge the leopard. Lions crunch noisily on an impala carcass, tossing bones aside to reveal bloodstained teeth. Looping through the forest, you find nomadic hyenas, on the prowl for the weak and sick. They snarl, then turn, scampering away towards the squawking of a vulture flock. For big game safari, Chief's Island is one of the finest destinations in the whole of Africa. Game drives are the only realistic means of exploring, partly because of the sheer abundance of big cats. Elephants, hippos, giraffe, baboons, big antelopes like hartebeest; every turn seems to bring another giant. Black and white rhino might also be spotted; there's only a handful of these elusive mammals in Botswana, and they inhabit this area, although sightings remain rare. Chief's Island is the game-rich heart of the Okavango, and the island's northern tip is where life is most concentrated. Morning and afternoon game drives take you through the wilderness, with a focus on predatory scenes. During the middle of the day, you can slumber at the camp, watching the inevitable procession of life along the water. Dawn and dusk maximize opportunities to see fabled scenes. A female hyena calls in the last light of day, alerting the scattered pack to the remains of a zebra carcass. Lionesses slowly stalk the fertile plains, tracking a herd of red lechwe that skillfully avoid the predators' clutches. The same female leopard continues to lurk close to camp, hunting on the ground and in the trees. While most of the game drives head into the wider Chief's Island landscape, your camp also has its own small private concession. So encounters with its resident predators are enhanced by their exclusivity."

        "description": "Fly across the Delta in a small plane, casting your eyes on the complexities of the landscape. Lush blue channels sweep out in many directions, encircling lost islets and sandbanks. Forests hang over open floodplains while Chief's Island lingers like a sentinel, always maintaining its position in the Delta's heart. As you fly east, the water becomes less apparent; its tone muted as the Okavango cascades out into the raw Kalahari Desert. But it's still green and abundant, a landscape that holds many secrets and delights. From the airstrip, a short drive brings you to Footsteps Across the Delta, a mobile tented camp that caters for a maximum of nine guests. Unlike the other camps on this itinerary, there isn't a plunge pool or opulent fittings. Instead, the rustic camp provides a comfortable base that is completely enveloped by nature. You become a part of the bush, hidden beneath a woodland awning. And while it's a mobile camp, you still enjoy en-suite flushing toilets, hot showers, and a private bathtub for a tranquil evening beneath the stars. For these two days, the experience is focused on the tranquillity of the camp and thrill of walking safaris, with expert trackers taking you along the trails of the plains game. While lion and hyena occupy this area, local trackers follow the clues, and you step towards inspiring encounters with a great diversity of other life. Emerge from the trees and come face to face with a kudu herd. Stand just ten meters away from a tower of giraffe, then follow the tracker to find tsessebe and red lechwe, unique antelopes of captivating color. Move quietly, footsteps bringing astonishing proximity to large elephant bulls. Each walk lasts around three hours, and you're usually driven to a start point away from the camp, helping you explore a wide area during these two days. Next, you take a longer afternoon walk before two walking safaris. A good level of fitness is not required, just a sense of adventure. It's not a march through the bush. It's a slow journey that completes your connection with nature, focusing on the subtle sights rather than the predatory giants."

This is one of Botswana's most exclusive camps, an exceptional and exclusive base to complete the safari experience. Every day is personally tailored. It could be about relaxing and watching the world rumble by. Or it could be all about exploring. Your luxury camp's location enables the complete suite of safari activities; big game walks, motorboat and mokoro safaris through the channels, game drives across the grasslands and woodland, plus the bonus of nighttime drives. It's spooky after dark, the atmosphere enhanced by a layer of mystique. Wildebeest are galloping, and you hear their rumble. The guide flicks on the spotlight, and you spot the chasing cheetah. Impala and kudu graze tentatively and as the light swings around, you see a lion pride draped across the distant grass. Get closer. It is a private concession so you can travel off the trail and get as close as possible to the iconic sights. After the light aircraft flight, these three days enable you to create your own safari itinerary, selecting from the variety of activities. It's all done amongst a habitat that excels in both diversity and abundance. Packs of wild dog hunt on the plains, hyenas make dens close to the camp, elephants and giraffe are found in huge numbers. Pink pelicans and baby crocodiles fill the water while rare antelopes drink from the banks. Think of a dreamy African safari and there's a good chance Vumbura can deliver it, right up to a herd of impala grazing on the grass directly beneath your suite."

        "description": "Wildlife sightings move from the charming to the dramatic, and sometimes the tracker indicates that it's not safe to explore on foot. You might find a cheetah lurking in the high grass, snoozing with one eye open as it settles in for the day's vigil. Laying silently, it's waiting for an antelope to make a mistake and get too comfortable when it’s too close. Lions often drink in the open, a whole pride scattered across the bank, sipping away and then falling asleep in the cool mud. High in the trees, the tracker keeps watch for a leopard, only a sporadically flicking tail betraying its camouflage. Moremi Game Reserve is where the predators are found in abundance and these two days offer good opportunities to see them stalking their prey."

        "description": "The Okavango Panhandle brings the rain of the Angolan Highlands to the desert. Broad and beautiful, this stretch of the river creates the Delta, transferring the distant rainfall down to the floodplains. It's thick and bountiful throughout the year and is a great place to find animals hiding down narrow channels. Buffalo mark the open plains, sitatunga skip between last vestiges of grass, and you're never too far from the hippos and elephants. Traveling north, you start to encounter fewer predators and the ambiance moves from wildlife drama to pure charm. This is where you sit back and enjoy the show, wallowing in the remote splendor of the Okavango. Most of this area is inaccessible by road, making it really feel like you're alone in Africa."

Larger mammals can be seen on the move, the likes of elephant, buffalo, and hippo all visible from the air. The flow of water is appreciated as you admire the floodplains, as they creep eastward and split into narrower and narrower channels. And on the two-hour flight, you come to appreciate just how far you had traveled in the boat. Touch down in Maun and a representative assists you in connecting you with your international departure."

        "description": "Whether it's your first and fiftieth time, there's always something special about flying into Africa. Perhaps it's the raw landscapes that roll beneath the wingtips. Maybe it's the vast space that surrounds the runway. Most likely it's the exquisite sense of touching down on a land untouched and unchanged. There's the immediate feeling that this is a destination unlike any you have seen before. Botswana and the Okavango excel with these first impressions, enhancing them with the raw scent of adventure. Your international flight lands in Maun, where you transfer onto a light aircraft bound for the Shinde Concession. This domestic flight maximizes the impression of nature's untouched bounty; touch down and it's common to find animals like elephants and buffalo within a few meters of the airstrip. The camp you will be staying at there is built into the trees, essentially a handful of tented chalets that feel like luxurious tree houses. It's a traditional camp with a variety of extras, like a swimming pool that's regularly visited by elephants. From a private shaded porch, you can gaze over the Okavango, filling your camera roll with shots of elephants, zebras, and giraffes. Check in, check out these views, then spend the afternoon on a leisurely game drive. It's an easy journey, looping through the concession for close encounters with the big game. As it's the first excursion, the focus is on going slow and starting the connection with nature. You'll return to the camp around sunset, where dinner is served beneath the Okavango stars."

But then there's a strangled cry from the grass. The gondolier takes you closer, revealing a lion pride that's chomping into a breakfast impala. The drama continues up ahead, where rival male hippos are barging across the channel, pushing and grunting to the approval of the pod's females. Then the charm returns as you turn a corner, and a vast floodplain extends, half a dozen different antelope visible in a single vista. By traveling in a mokoro, you go slowly, gliding past the extremities of life in the Okavango, from mammals clashing to those that gently graze. Early afternoon is quiet time at the camp, a chance to relax in the tree house and listen to the elephants that trumpet from the trees. Then a late afternoon game drive continues yesterday's experience, focusing on encounters with the big cats. Move slowly and follow the clues, the faintest flicker in the grass the chance at spotting one of the great hunters. Stop and watch. Another flicker in the green. Move closer. Grass moves but still you don't see. Hornbills suddenly erupt in a chorus of shouts, further evidence that the predator lurks nearby. Their warning cry brings the leopard out, and your patience is rewarded, the clandestine hunter wandering slowly past the vehicle on her way back to the trees."

        "title": "Shinde Concession – Intimate Walking Safaris",
        "description": "A walking safari isn't a race. It's not a charge through the bush. Move slowly, leaving light footprints as you head deeper into the wilderness. Sounds dictate the direction of travel, distant clues indicating what moves where. Clues are everywhere, and the trackers introduce you to their importance. Some are obvious: fresh dung, prints in the sand, felled trees. Others are equally useful; a trail of fruit ripped from trees, branches eaten clean of their foliage, the consistency of each piece of dung. Indigenous tribes have been following these clues for thousands of years, dissecting each piece of the landscape to create a safe journey, and over the next five days, you'll learn to track animals like they do. On this first day, it's easy to be in awe of the local trackers, how they take one glance at the landscape and build an accurate picture of which animals reside where. Over these two days, you enjoy twice-daily game walks. Safari vehicles bring you to and from different parts of the concession, enabling each walk to explore a new part of the Okavango. Wander onto the floodplains and kudu are grazing. Walk slowly, quietly, a few more steps and you're just a few meters from these majestic antelope. Further along, you encounter zebra, a whole herd eying you with intrigue. Now sitatunga, small and beautiful antelope that bounce away. Impala approach you before skipping onwards. You're just another mammal, another piece of the Okavango landscape, a wandering creature in search of bounty. Accompanying the local tracker is an armed ranger, extra security in case anything comes too close. Because it's not just the ungulates that provide the wildlife experience. Trackers bring you towards elephants, and you watch from a safe distance, feeling the awe they impose on the landscape. Giraffes are equally inspiring, graceful sights that lope past barely 15 meters away. Understanding behavior is essential to encounters with the giants. For example, a 100-strong herd of female buffalo and their calves are relatively safe to be around; yet a bachelor herd has a testosterone level that shouldn't be challenged. In contrast, female elephants can be skittish when with their young, yet a giant old elephant bull could be the most tranquil animal you see in five days. All these walks are private and tailored to your energy levels and interests. Each is typically three to four hours, but this could be shorter or longer dependent on the mood. Accommodation is in a small tented camp, with your tent featuring an en-suite bathroom with hot showers and flushing toilet. The camp effortlessly blurs into nature, enhancing the sense of being alone in the heart of the Okavango. In the evenings, you sit on the camping chairs outside the camp, besides the crackling fire, filling your senses with the Delta's charms."

        "title": "Linyanti Concession – Charming Flight Into the Riverine Woodland",
        "description": "This morning starts with a flight across the Okavango, the flooded landscape spilling out to the west as you cruise north. As the Delta extends from the river in the west, it slowly spills onto the savannah and spillways of Linyanti Concession. In good years, the water flows all the way into this concession. In other years, the channels stay dry. This concession also borders Chobe National Park even further to the east, making Linyanti somewhat of a meeting place for mammals moving in both directions. The flight provides an excellent aerial overview of how these ecosystems are slowly blurring into each other. Touch down and a new walking safari starts, another private journey through a wild and untouched piece of Botswana. Sounds and smells guide the way, local trackers continue to teach lessons of bushcraft and animal behavior. More giants are encountered. Hold your breath as an elephant herd passes by, spot a big buffalo herd emerging from the trees, then follow the trail to the water, where dozens of hippos roll in the mud. A couple of them yawn, revealing phenomenal jaws before disappearing back into the water. Then a young hippo calf slowly walks from the channel and by sticking close to the trackers, it's a very safe sight. Your overnight camp is very similar to that in Shinde, comfortable yet elegant accommodation that continues the sense of not interrupting life in the bush."

        "description": "By now you'll be attuned to the clues of the bush. You'll recognize the dung, the indentations in the trees, the animals that are happy for you to approach. On these walking safaris, you'll continue to savor delightful encounters with the ungulates. Approach a zebra herd and read the emotion, two calves jumping at the sound of an approaching baboon troop. Wildebeest come past. They stop and glare, inspecting the unusual mammals (i.e. you). Then they're off, galloping into the distance with their comical antics. Next, you come across red lechwe, beautiful antelopes who regularly run from safari vehicles. By approaching on foot there is little sound, so you can really appreciate their majestic coats. It's not uncommon to even see lions or cheetah in the distance. Obviously, it's important to respect space and veer well clear. But like the antelopes, trackers understand when the predators are hungry, and when they rest with bulging bellies. Exhilarating and exclusive, the Botswanan landscape offers one of Africa's most compelling walking safari opportunities. You're not just tracking the myriad of ungulates. You're coming in contact with the kings of the land and the giants of their habitat. The program is flexible here, with a choice of twice-daily walks or longer full-day walks. In addition, game drives and mokoro safaris can provide a change of pace in the afternoon. Then it's evening, the fire illuminates the night, and the evocative soundtrack comes from the trees."

        "description": "The safari continues, game drives taking you deeper and deeper through an unseen land. Almost half of Botswana is a protected area, endless miles of untamed landscape that are barely accessible by vehicle. It's a bumpy journey when you switch to game drives, the rugged trails meaning travel is almost the same speed as the walking safari, which keeps you tuned in. Elephants surround the vehicle, baby calves fighting playfully as they pass. Hippos emerge from the water, and you watch as their bulky frames graze. Buffalos gallop together, and you follow their rumblings, approaching to find a pride of lions upsetting the herd. Clashes turn violent, and the safari vehicle provides a safe space to watch it all unfold, a lioness going beneath the relentless trampling of hooves. You drive into Chobe National Park where you spend two days at mobile tented camps. These camps move each day, guides picking a safe space to erect the tents and toilets. Each morning they're packed up, and the evidence of human presence is gone. After a predominantly walking itinerary, these two days of game drives will focus on animals that are difficult to intimately encounter on foot. Lion prides are plentiful here, and you find them in an array of modes. Leopards are equally abundant, but you must look closely as their spots are often concealed by the trees. Two animals don't require you to look. Elephants are everywhere, tens of thousands filling Chobe. And it's impossible to find a vista without the neck of a giraffe."

        "description": "As you arrive on a small plane, you will immediately grasp the scale of Mashatu. Expanding across the boundaries of Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe, Southern Africa's largest private game reserve is surrounded by unbroken miles of wilderness. The Mashatu is a remote desert and savannah, scorched and dusty throughout most of the year. Waterholes are dotted across the reserve, permanent places of bounty that brings wandering life from across the Kalahari region. Elephants, giraffe, lions, zebra herds, and whatever you are dreaming of, there's a strong probability that it lurks in this reserve. You will land first at O. R. Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg and then transfer onto a small charter flight that will take you into the untouched promise of your African safari. Touch down and the aerial expressions of scale will be replaced by impressions of intimacy. A luxurious camp overlooks the water, and it is here that your safari begins. Lounge on your verandah as a giraffe wanders along the horizon and then dine beneath the stars as elephant silhouettes come in to drink. Wake to the rustling sounds of zebra grazing just a few meters from your room. Effortlessly blending into nature, your luxury lodge regularly see wildlife frequent. It's not that unusual for big cats to be spotted from the sanctuary of your room. After a relaxed lunch, you will enjoy an introductory game drive for a chance to explore your first safari sights and take those first adoring photos of Botswana's great mammals."

Picnic above a pod of hippos before you follow the giraffe as they graciously roam. When you spot a lion, the safari vehicle can get closer to take you alongside pride as they feast on a bloodied carcass. When vultures swirl ahead, you are guided into the savannah to discover what's just fallen. The lodge provides an immersive safari program as you mix game drives with walking safaris and adventures on horseback. The focus is on flexibility to give you the chance to try it all and tailor your own itinerary of activities. Skilled bushmen guides take you through the savannah to piece together subtle clues as you are led into a realm of atmospheric sounds and smells. Distant calls ring out, and a jackal may poke up its head before disappearing into the grass. On a horse-riding safari, you will also become part of the landscape, just another animal amongst tens of thousands. Springbok will stop to inspect your mount, rather than running off. Zebra is intrigued, and experienced riders can get close to the black and white herds. When you gallop across the savannah, you will become the center of wildlife attention as the other ungulates are stirred into action. In Mashatu Game Reserve it is not just the wildlife you get to see; it is how you can see it. Activities can last all day or be customized into a program that includes peaceful hours at the lodge."

Rusty reds merge into flowing yellows with the landscape occasionally interrupted by a dried-up river bed or zigzagging canyon. Looking down on the earth below, it is hard to imagine that anything could survive here yet wildlife thrives in this place of seeming desolation. A swathe of bushes and trees surround your camp to draw their water from underground to attract large numbers of springbok and oryx. Zebra and wildebeest herds roam past to pick from the bounty before continuing their nomadic journeys. Such an array of plains game attracts the predators, and the reverberating sound of lion roars are experienced on many evenings here. Your safari lodge remains one of few places to stay in the reserve that covers over 50,000 square kilometers. Such space and scale ensure that the safari experience is predominantly a private one; you could spend a whole day exploring and not see another vehicle. After landing, you can lounge by the pool and watch the ungulates skip across the horizon and then head out on a short afternoon game drive for an introduction to the area around your accomodation. Return to the camp, and then sit back on your enormous viewing deck to admire the animals that visit the permanent waterhole beneath the camp."

It's just desert, scorched and barren, stretching out in every direction. But look a little closer, and there are clues everywhere. Perhaps a leopard's prints softly embedded in the sand, or maybe an elephant appearing in silhouette along the horizon, or a bush that hides a small herd of gemsbok. This is a landscape of clues and following them brings intimate safari encounters. Trace the leopard prints towards an area of bushland and find the cat in his hideout. Drive close to the gemsbok herd and discover an accompanying band of steenbok. Continue to another waterhole and there may be a pride of lions ruling the water, including two with flowing black manes, a distinctive specialty of the Kalahari. Over these two days, your safari itinerary is flexible although it's the full-day game drives that reveal the beauty of what is Africa's largest desert safari destination. Bushman trackers can also lead walking safaris, which are imbued with thrills as various animals are attracted to the camp's waterhole. The desert's lack of water means it can't support the same quantity of animals as the delta. However, the quality of the sightings is exceptional. Rare animals like black-backed jackals are just two meters from the safari vehicle. Lion chase gemsbok beneath the veil of sunrise. Zebra congregates in the hundreds, and there is emotion on every face. For awhile, one glance will suggest that there is little to see in the desert, but two full days reveal that no two angles are ever the same."

But the thick bushes and reeds of the delta make it hard to see beyond a few meters so the antelopes must be fast and nimble to avoid the predators. For where they are water and ungulates, there's often a profusion of predators waiting to pounce. The game viewing also changes in the Delta. In the desert, you followed clues over large areas while in the delta, you will travel slowly on the lookout for the animals as they hide in their haven. Turn a corner, and large lionesses are seen in the reeds with only their faces visible from a few meters away. As you're watching, a flock of spur-winged geese may flicker in your periphery. Refocus, and you will find the leopard as she descends from the tree and then drops into the grass that hides her from a herd of impala.

Situated in the north of the Okavango Delta, this reserve offers one of Botswana's most unashamedly luxurious experiences, with the rich local game complemented by a thrilling array of resident game.

Head out along the channels in a traditional wooden canoe ( mokoro ) to paddle alongside the large pods of hippos.

        "description": "Anticipation merges with excitement as you cross the quiet runway and stand before the Cessna 210. The pilot is all smiles as he gives you the tour. There are two seats together in the back and a passenger seat in the cockpit. You're the only two passengers so sit wherever you want. Scale and detail leave lingering impressions as you ascend above Botswana, the pilot cruising low over vast tracts of forest, desert, and waterways. You're high enough to revel in the vastness of the wilderness, yet close enough to pick out individual details. Elephant herds clump together, migrating antelopes dot the singed plains, and individual giraffe are easily spotted beside the river. Touch down in Chobe National Park and witness these scenes in close-up detail. A local safari guide takes you on a game drive through the forests, each turn revealing another elephant herd or giraffe tower. Local estimates for the elephant population vary between 60,000 and 120,000. Either way, it's easily the largest collection of wild elephants on the planet. Their calls resonate through the trees, their trunks spray water at waterholes, and the four-ton pachyderms virtually surround your camp. Tonight's accommodation is a taste of what's to come. Nature's soundtrack runs on through the night, a crackling fire keeps the big cats at a safe distance, and glorious panoramas extend from your king sized bed. An en-suite bathroom has been erected in the bush, complete with hot showers and ceramic toilet, and comfy lounge chairs are perfect for uncorking a bottle and being alone with nature. There isn't another camp in sight."

        "description": "Vibrant expanses of green and blue mark today's journey above the Okavango Delta, nature's greatest oasis admired from a premier vantage point. Gaze towards the horizon and the seared desert landscape is clearly apparent. But meandering waterways roll beneath the wingtips and your pilot cruises low for some intimate detail; zebra splashing through the shallows, hippos wading around, and large herds arriving in search of water. Trade out the wings for a traditional mokoro boat and tour the blue channels, a skilled gondolier bringing you remarkably close encounters to large pods of hippos. Today's camp is situated on Chief's Island, a remote haven inaccessible by land for most of the year. A private veranda is perched above the river. So sit back and watch the conveyor belt of thirsty mammals coming to drink. Some wait patiently, the smaller antelopes only approaching when all is clear. An elephant herd arrives and the rest disperse. But another pachyderm herd wants to drink and a showdown slowly evolves before your eyes. Lion roars reverberate through the camp come sundown, evocative reminders of just how far you've been transported into the animal kingdom."

        "description": "Blue and green hues are replaced by mystical whiteness as you soar above the Makgadikgadi Salt Pans. Ethereal tones gradually increase with each day of this air safari, today's white mirage shimmering with primitive beauty. The pilot and itinerary are always flexible, so each day's flight will leave at a time that suits you and your partner. Routes are also fluid. A myriad of remote airstrips provide opportunities to land in disparate parts of the wilderness. Touch down, spend an hour exploring and admiring, and then cruise above the salt pans once more. Zebras leave swirling trails of dust as they charge across the snow-like mirage; the odd bull elephant provides juxtaposition to the white wonderland, and tonight's camp offers uninterrupted 360 degree panoramas of the salt pans. You're hundreds of miles from the nearest road, and much further from any settlement."

This is prime lion country. Skilled predators lie in wait beside permanent water sources, knowing that all the Kalahari's ungulates must drink at some time. Today's aerial flight brings fabulous impressions of scale, the rugged landscape crossed by parched riverbeds, colorful canyons, and sun dappled rocky outcrops. A wide selection of airstrips can be used over the next two days, some of them having to be cleared of mammals before you touch down. From the air all seems deserted. A kaleidoscopic range of browns and reds dance beneath your eyes, yet the wildlife is difficult to find from the sky. But touch down and you’re in the heart of big game wilderness. Settle into the luxury camp and marvel at the view. All seems quiet. Keep watching. Ten minutes later a buffalo herd wanders past. Now a giraffe. Next comes a distance shot of black-maned lions. Your guide is on hand and drives you closer, the ferocious teeth and dazzling fur admired at close quarters. Once again, you're the only guests at the mobile camp and the sounds of the wild continue long into the night."

These inaccessible animal havens rarely see human eyes and you join an elite group who has journeyed into such secluded animal space. Leopards and cheetahs mix with the lion prides and hyenas regularly scuttle past. The day's itinerary is very flexible but it's worth getting an early start to admire the landscape's evocative journey from black to orange and then charred red. Like the rest of this itinerary, all meals are included and you're treated to a sumptuous menu of local and international cuisine. Picnics are packed in the plane each day, lavish breakfasts are served with enduring views over the wilderness, and dinners are slow, languid affairs. A table for two is erected in the bush, complete with candle light or kerosene lantern. Multiple courses are served, each complimented by a varied wine menu and champagne on ice."

        "description": "Botswana and Namibia provide very different air safari experiences. Botswana's hinterlands showcase greater animal abundance and shorter flights. The flights are longer in Namibia and there's less chance of spotting mammals from the sky. However, the landscapes are arguably the most compelling on the planet. Your Namibian adventure begins in the north. Cross the last fringes of the Kalahari and cruise above the vast Etosha Pan. During wet season, this pan flourishes into a flood plain of animal superfluity. In dry season months, the waterholes diminish and make Big Five spotting relatively easy. Your luxury camp stands on the edge of the pan, offering seemingly endless vistas marked by giraffe necks and dangling elephant trunks. A late afternoon game safari brings new delights, your guide driving to popular rhino spots, providing intimate encounters with these endangered greats."

It's rare that you'll see people, other than your pilot and local safari guides. Tranquil, unperturbed, uninterrupted; there's nothing breaking your togetherness and immersion in nature. A long morning game drive provides additional Big Five moments before an afternoon flight enables you to explore dramatic Damaraland. Bizarre rock formations ripple with color, rugged mountains stand above gaping valleys, and there's a primitive brilliance that leaves lasting impressions. This is a landscape with unique character, every square mile bringing fresh nuances and subtle shades. Tonight's camp is inescapably lost in the Damaraland wilderness, overlooking a canyon occasionally crossed by rhino and elephant."

Over the next two days you traverse the length of these dunes, soaring over burning orange ridges and dunes that rise over 400 meters. Colonial explorers couldn't pierce this barrier and their shipwrecks, half consumed by sand, litter the Skeleton Coast. Cruise low above these shipwrecks, gaping at how nature has overtaken man's creation. Masts peer out above the dunes, whole wooden ships stand stranded in the red, and the Atlantic Ocean shimmers blue just to your right. Today's is the longest of all your flights and there will be a couple of stops en route before you camp beside the renowned dunes of Sossusvlei."

        "description": "Sossusvlei is hypnotic at sunrise, the layers of dunes slowly illuminated until they burn like orange flames beneath the sky. An early start provides staggering views; little but sand dunes and dazzling ocean fill your endless panoramas. Wide clay pans break the ridges, but then you settle back into row after row of snaking lines that rise and fall across the desert. Follow a ridge. It weaves and dips, rises and curls, eventually spitting out in the ocean. These vistas continue for almost two hours, the desert unveiled for just the two of you in the back of the Cessna. Today's destination is equally mesmeric. Everyone knows the Grand Canyon as the world's largest but did you know that Namibia's Fish River Canyon comes second on the list? A dramatic scar opens up the landscape, cutting rugged lines down to a parched riverbed and dominating the landscape for over 50 miles. You spot it from a distance and then the pilot skillfully cruises down and hovers just above the canyon. Helicopter rides in Nevada's Grand Canyon are idolized and popular, but there will be few other couples in the world that have flown above and through Fish River Canyon. Tonight's camp is situated near the canyon in a clearing of classic African bushland."

Impressions of scale continue to come through the window and the camera eagerly snaps away at the final shots of aesthetic wonder. It's around 400 miles to Windhoek and the pilot touches down in the capital city. Namibia's premier luxury hotel brings a change of pace to the night's accommodation.

As the Okavango floods, it will create isolated strips of lands and hidden paradises where animals either find bliss or find themselves marooned. A gondolier will paddle you past forests dominated by elephant trunks, onwards to grasslands where gazelle ears are alerted to a moving cheetah, and then beneath trees where monkeys swing. As you travel slowly and silently, it is as if you are in a movie backdrop as the wildlife world gracefully continues without interruption. A kudu herd drinks along the shore and then gallops off as a boisterous male hippo charges towards the river. Giraffe watches carefully as the gondolier passes, and a hyena may eye you with an air of suspicion. Mokoro safaris are the highlight of the Okavango, and your itinerary will allow for as many as you would like. Game drives can take you in further as the Vumbura Reserve spills into the Moremi Game Reserve with a patchwork of habitats in close proximity. Water brings life, and the Okavango offers a suite of landscapes with each a haven for a new collection of characters. In the woodland, you may see something move and then see the clear eyes as the leopard watches you intently while you have been searching for her. Move slightly, and her grace is fully revealed as the shimmering fur of her young comes into view. Predators are a real specialty of Vumbura, and the safari itinerary is often centered around intimate encounters with a focus on the dusk and dawn activities that maximize the chance of spotting them in hunting mode. During the day, the opulent lodge provides a place to lounge around and absorb the excellent views."

        "description": "Selinda has had a checkered past as for years this was a dedicated hunting concession. But it has been revamped recently and transformed into a private reserve that celebrates the authenticity of nature. There is something very beautiful about how the landscape has responded as an ancient riverbed long dormant through the reserve has started to flow with permanent water for the first time in many decades. Life flourishes as the migrant herds are feasting to allow larger groups of zebra, gazelle, elephants, buffalo and giraffe to expand. Young predators are thriving as they mark out territory as they prosper to form new pride. The long-distance ramblers are staying as hyenas and vultures pick up the leftovers from nature's new bounty. The Selinda is a landscape that few people know about, and even fewer have explored as a private concession that offers an exclusive look akin to going behind the scenes. Elephants are everywhere. The Selinda is part of a wider ecosystem where some 100,000 pachyderms roam. Giraffe is similarly plentiful, clustered in small towers and raising their colors above the green. On a walking safari, you may cross a herd of buffalo, 40-strong, which graze slowly as they explore a floodplain. River safaris wind past large hippo pods with disagreements settled by barging contests in the water. Back at the camp, trunks squirt water and hooves kick up spray as you gaze over the river. Vumbura often reflects the brutality of nature's rhythm and competition, but at Selinda, it feels as if all the animals are part of a celebration."

Safari is always unpredictable, and that fact is elevated here with a developing landscape that is full of surprise and treats for those who take their time. Move slowly, embrace it all, and complement the activities with an authentic wild bush experience at the camp. Nighttime drives are a particular specialty as two new predators have appeared in Selinda. Wild dogs now move in packs with over a dozen that rove together, and they communicate with intelligence that cannot be understood at first glance. Over your safari days on this itinerary, there is a strong probability that you will have seen a hunting scene with a dramatic explosion of power as jaws lock onto necks. These wild dogs hunt differently by exhausting their prey as they chase them far across the landscape. At nighttime, you may hear the yelps and follow the theater as the drama begin. Tiny aardwolves also appear to scuttle around in the moonlight as a spotlight guides your journey. Return to your camp after a nighttime drive, and the experience continues like it has every night in Botswana.

Just two camps are found in this 2,300 square kilometer reserve, and both excel in providing a safari under canvas experience so you will have the necessary contemporary comforts and continue within the luxury band. A great procession of wildlife roams past the camp at all times of the day and night to bring with it a succession of evocative calls and a strong sense of being surrounded by the best of Botswana's wildlife. Like always, the safari program is flexible and private."

        "title": "Kwando Reserve – Exquisite Predator Abundance and a Private Safari Playground",
        "description": "Diverse habitats provide different safari encounters in Kwando. Two male giraffes collide in the riverine forest and swing their necks to determine dominance. Wild dogs rove across the open grasslands as a pack on the move. Tsessebe gallops from the pack's clutches, Africa's fastest antelope disappearing in a cloud of dust. A cheetah could chase them, but it doesn't, preferring to rest in the grass as you drive past in the safari vehicle. Game drives connect the habitats here, and a single drive can encounter over 20 different species from the array of monkeys in the woodland to the small antelopes feasting on the open grassland. Walking safaris are also possible and daily nighttime game drives are usually a fixture on the itinerary. Like always, the action is defined by water but this time, it is the Kwando River, where thick riverine forest provides an excellent place for a predatory ambush. Sometimes the experience is about parking the vehicle to gaze out and wait for the drama to unfold at the water. At other times, you will be on the move and follow the tracks to enjoy one of Botswana's greatest concentrations of predators. Then again, safari here may be about lounging outside of your tented suite to watch the wilderness unfold without another person or vehicle to interrupt your view. Instead, it will feel like Africa's epic landscapes have become your own personal adventure playgrounds."

        "description": "Beneath the canopy, you will go to follow sandy trails as you bump into the woodland. An elephant will block the trail, the large tusks forcing you to stop. Soon the rest of the herd will emerge as nearly 30 of them will slowly amble past, including two babies that swing their trunk with near comical curiosity. Inch a little further, and the scene will repeat itself with a big male hooting as the rest of the herd bulldozes their way through the trees. Giraffe is seen equally regularly with their heads above the high branches. As the sandy trail reaches the river, you will get your first glimpse of hippos, along with a buffalo herd chewing and chomping their way across the high grasses. Within an hour or so, some of the animals become so commonplace that you will not even point them out: elephants, giraffe, buffalo, zebra, lechwe, impala. As you continue, much more will continue to surprise, like tsessebe that skips out from the trees or a troop of baboons creating a riot of noise. After touching down in Maun, you will transfer to a chartered light aircraft and a flight over the Okavango. Beneath the wingtips, the landscapes will transform from desert to delta, and then to the thick awning of the Chobe woodland. Touch down, and you will already be deep in the wilderness. The game drive will take you further in to bring these inspiring first safari impressions as you travel to your lodge, nestled on the Chobe River. Resident buffalo and lion pride create dramatic scenes close to the lodge, while any number of animals could come down to the river for a drink. Over these first two days, you will combine game drives with cruises along the Chobe River. The latter will take you past hundreds of hippos, an even more evocative sight when you cruise at sunset, and they are seen emerging from the water. You will be staying in one of Botswana's original luxury lodges, a place of opulence that blends seamlessly with the natural environment. Accommodation later on the safari will be a bit more rustic, particularly in revealing how the wildlife roams freely amongst the camps. As a starting point, this lodge eases you into the wilds of Africa, with the salubrious fittings helping to soothe any aches from travel."

        "title": "Savute Channel – Mysterious Safari Landscape",
        "description": "Chobe National Park stretches south from the Chobe River, a vast stretch of woodland that's home to Africa's largest collection of elephants. Some conservationists believe there are 100,000 elephants found within the ecosystem and the evidence is everywhere. Great paths are cleared as the pachyderms barge and bump against trees, and large clumps of dung dot the river banks as echoed hoots dominate the evening lullaby. In the southwest corner of the Chobe is the Savute Channel, a permanent water source where the elephants are always meeting. It will feel as though you are deeper in the wilderness as the canopy closes in and the mystical sounds are constant throughout the day. Savute can sometimes be accessed by the four-wheel drive trails, although even these become impassable at points during the year and it's a full day of travel from the north of the national park. Instead, you will take the direct route, a 20-minute flight between remote airstrips, a sublime journey as you look down at the roaming elephant herds. Bachelor elephant herds meet in the waters beneath your accommodation, and the concentration of testosterone brings some haunting evening scenes. The river blurs into a marsh that cascades out onto fertile plains. Antelope are seen in much larger numbers, along with zebra and wildebeest that enjoy such fresh pastures. While the low grass is ideal for grazing, the high grass is inviting for predators. So when the grazers come to drink in the river, there are scenes of raw drama. Sometimes the clashes involve lions and buffalos, other times it's a leopard tearing apart an impala. Your game drives will focus on the predators, seeking to find them in hunting mode. However, like everywhere on this safari, the experience is not about seeing the animals as much as it is about surrounding yourself with the rhythms of pristine wilderness."

        "title": "Shinde Concession – Classic Okavango Water Safari",
        "description": "Touch down after your next charter flight and the visuals will have changed. Your views extend for miles as the lush floodplains spill beyond the horizon. Palm islands rise sporadically as silhouetted elephant and giraffe grace the landscape, and in a single glance, you can spot half a dozen different antelope. You will be marooned on Nxaragha Island, surrounded by a year-round water wilderness, engrossed in the grunting hippos and skipping antelope. Tsessebe are on the move, grazing and jumping almost in the same movement as sitatunga hide beneath the water, just nostrils poking out from the lagoon as wildebeest gallop comically, the males rutting in shows of virility. There is almost no land here, just a few rising palms and the sandy banks of the island. Effortlessly blending into these lush surroundings is your safari camp, with tented suites rising on wooden platforms above the delta. Canvas walls ensure the sounds of the wilderness continue at all times, yet this is no traditional camping experience. Stand up in the spacious tents, sleep on beds raised on wooden platforms, and enjoy an en-suite bathroom with hot showers and flushing toilets. You will enjoy the complete immersion in the Okavango while still keeping necessary creature comforts. Safari is by water as the camp presents a quintessential Okavango experience. Travel in narrow wooden canoes ( mokoros ) with a local guide to paddling you down the channels lined by reeds and furtive antelopes. Hundreds of bird species grace the banks and the proximity to the hippo pods is unfathomable. Motorboat safaris allow you to explore large lagoons and hidden islands as zebra are aroused from slumber and monkeys yelp from the trees. Shinde is a private concession, and only guests staying in the concession can explore it so other visitors will not ruin your safari photos and animals are not surrounded by boats. Shinde and the fly-in style illustrate how Botswana is an unashamedly high-end safari destination as the country prefers to offer quality experiences to a few rather than attract large numbers of tourists."

        "description": "On safari in the Okavango, your flights are a major part of the safari experience as they give you a chance to appreciate the phenomenal scale of Botswana. Landscapes collide on these flights with the delta's rainbow of blues spilling out in the distance. Palm islands stand isolated while the patterns of migratory elephants can be understood. Giraffe and buffalo are also visible from the air, along with a mazy stretch of channels. These are short flights, but there is no other way as 20 minutes in the air bring you from one island to the next. You will land in the Xakanaxa area, a sanctuary of contrasting habitats in the heart of the delta. Open grasslands spill into riverine woodland and stretches of mopane forest. Such diversity makes it a welcoming place, and the surrounding area is home to both migratory herds and permanent four-legged residents. Now your Okavango Safari will continue on land and water as the mokoro and motorboat trips are combined with game drives, exquisite journeys across the trails of the islands. Buffalo march in the hundreds as giraffe lope in front of the vehicle, and high in the trees, you will find a leopard hiding out. As it is each day, your safari program is customizable, and you can create a personal program using the recommendation of the guides and trackers. Adding another exclusive angle is a walking safari, a chance to step across the fertile open plains and come side by side with zebra and lechwe herds. Move slowly and silently, keeping your distance until you can move closer as the animals realize you're not a threat. Shaded beneath ebony trees is your next camp, a haven of luxury that overlooks the lagoon. Natural wooden features give the impression that the camp is a seamless part of the landscape, although it hides some salubrious extras, including a swimming pool and elevated sundeck. New animals join the collection of sights, like packs of endangered wild dog and both spotted and brown hyenas seen together. Moremi Game Reserve is the big-game heart of the delta, and these two days of safari are all about the continual mammal sightings."

        "description": "Chobe and Okavango are places of abundance. There is plenty to eat and drink, which helps to maintain its large populations of animals. A scorched desert like the Makgadikgadi could not attract such numbers, but the safari encounters are equally enchanting. Everything must come to drink, so by staying close to water, you are continually admiring the animals. And in a place of scarcity, there is always tension. Springbok must approach the river even though they know lions are hiding nearby. Zebra always drinks on high alert, and every sound will startle them. A cheetah will snatch unsuccessfully at prey as hunger will cause the cat to accelerate too early. The Boteti River is often the only water to be found in the Makgadikgadi, so wildlife rarely strays more than half a day's travel from it. Zebra and other migratory herds congregate here, seeing out the dry season before the rains return. Resident lions and leopards must take advantage and fatten up. Your residence is an opulent camp that brings safari straight to your verandah. At the end of a fly-in safari adventure, this camp enables you to sit back and watch the drama unfold. Daytime and nighttime game drives wind along the river, while a boat safari can continue to unravel the theater of the desert. It is also possible to make excursions into the enormity of the Makgadikgadi Salt Pans, where you will not find wildlife, but you will be baffled by the landscape. As another option, visit Khumaga Village and gain an understanding of local life in the desert."

It has since evaporated into a series of mystical salt pans. Everywhere you look is white, the crusted salt topped by a shimmering mirage that blurs along the horizon. Baobabs punctuate the pans, as do nomadic elephants and colonies of meerkats. It’s as surreal a setting as any, and that’s before you spot the wildlife that comes to drink from the four waterholes outside your camp. You land in Maun and transfer onto a short local flight to Makgadikgadi, then onwards across the salt to your safari camp. It’s an escapist destination, where the silence penetrates and traditional lanterns illuminate the walkways. Evoking an old-world safari atmosphere, the camp has all the necessary comforts, including a beautiful deck overlooking the waterholes. Brown hyenas howl at night; aardwolves drink surreptitiously, and the water attracts an evocative collection of four-legged nomads. Check in, appreciate the solitude, and soak up the magical atmosphere of the pans."

They’re your guides throughout the morning, teaching you all about hunting and gathering on a very wild landscape. You’ll follow prints left in the dust, discover a use for everything that grows, and be warmly invited into their community. Although their English is limited, their knowledge is staggering and is communicated through concise gestures; you’ll soon realize that their laconic style suits the serenity of the environment.

The natural splendor goes beyond the imagination, especially when a meerkat pops up then disappears into its hole. After visiting a series of splendid baobabs, you return for lunch and spend another afternoon on a game drive, this time seeking out the zebra migration. Some 50,000 make an annual journey across these pans, joined by wildebeests and a snapping collection of hyenas. From January to May, you can see them in their wild roving herds, while for the rest of the year, you can glimpse smaller herds on their journey back towards the Okavango."

In the light aircraft, you have supreme views, especially of the Kalahari Desert giving way to the relentless flooding of the Okavango River, dusty yellow replaced by strips of lush green and blue. Once you touch down, the Delta is as mystical and mysterious as the preconceptions. A leopard descends from a tree and disappears into the grass; buffalos clash horns on a floodplain; antelope hooves splash up flumes of water. The scale is replaced by the detail, and it’s hard to go a few moments without seeing another four-legged giant. Chief’s Island in Moremi Game Reserve is widely considered to have the densest concentration of wildlife in the Okavango. Chitabe Concession shares an unfenced border with Moremi on three sides and wildlife moves freely. But it’s exclusive to guests staying at one of the two camps, so the game drives come with an added exclusivity. Discover lion prides that battle with buffalo, follow hundreds of lechwes as they escape the clutches of a cheetah, and come to love the antics of wild hippo pods. Perched on an elevated island, Chitabe Lediba Camp is the perfect base for watching the show, with so much wildlife roaming straight past your tented chalet; the day’s flexible game drives provide a chance to get spine-tinglingly close to dreamy safari scenes."

Chitabe is a great place to see the big cats on the hunt, and by going off the trail, you might see jaws snapping through fur, or scavengers seeking to steal a kill. Like all your days in the Okavango and Chobe, the daily program has a high degree of flexibility. Nighttime drives often bring drama, the roving spotlight revealing a nocturnal world of bizarre mammals and cats searching for their dinner. Spend the full day exploring or head out on three separate drives; early morning, late afternoon, then nighttime."

Animals graze beneath your chalet, then pass under the wooden walkways that connect different areas of the camp. Stunning concentrations of ungulates mean there’s almost always something to admire in and around the camp, notably red lechwes, buffalos, zebras, and wildebeests. Jao Concession provides a wonderfully diverse safari experience, incorporating the big game of Hunda Island with the permanent waters of the Delta. After the short flight west, you have the time to relax in your camouflaged treehouse. Spend the rest of the day creating a personal program of game drives and mokoro canoe safaris. From June to September, the plains are flooded, a watery expanse that glistens beneath the desert sun. Then it transforms into muddy swamps full of nutrients before the water evaporates further and the grass brings nomadic grazers. Regardless of when you visit, you’ll be able to discover a unique snapshot of Delta life."

With this traditional mokoro canoe safari, you can take in all the hidden secrets of the land, the slow and serene means of travel getting you close to all the little details.

        "description": "There’s something very special about opening your tent to a herd of elephants. It’s not just their size or their means of communicating through gestures. It’s not even the baby elephants that swing their trunks wildly when walking past. What’s most special is the intimacy of the experience. The elephants recognize your presence, and it’s as if they’re welcoming you in their own unique way. Sometimes they pass just ten meters from the camp, wandering by without a care in the world. And it’s not just one. It’s hundreds, thousands; the world’s largest elephant population inhabiting the forest where you are camping. While it sounds a little dangerous, mobile tented camps are very safe. Remembering the lessons from the San Bushmen, you’ll notice how traditional techniques are being used to keep the elephants from trampling the camp. Hidden amongst the trees, the tented camp moves every few days, giving every visitor a new wildlife experience. It’s surprising how much luxury there is, with spacious stand-up tents that feature an en-suite bathroom with hot water and a Western-style toilet. You’ll dine under the stars, spend the evenings around a roaring campfire, and enjoy one of Botswana’s most exhilarating safaris under canvas. Nature sings a lullaby, animals wander through the camp, and there’s never any interruption to the magic of the wilderness. After the flight from the Okavango, you’ll spend three nights under canvas in the Savute area of Chobe National Park. This woodland landscape is home to so many elephants and giraffes that you’ll stop counting after the first ten minutes (conservationists estimate the elephant population to be upwards of 100,000). Wild dogs move in packs while leopards lurk on the highest tree branches. Buffalo herds graze beside thousands of impala, joined by zebra, wildebeest, and a stunning cast of other antelopes. There are also plenty of lions, although the predators are a little harder to spot than in the Okavango, due to the density of the trees. During these three days, you combine game drives in the Savute area with the option of Chobe River cruises. It takes you to the heart of Botswana’s natural experience, with the activities exploring the scale of the park and the camp immersing you in its intimacy."

You enter Zambia and follow another famous river, the gushing waters of the Zambezi far faster than those of the Chobe. The river broadens, growling menacingly and then disappearing with an almighty roar. You’ve reached Victoria Falls, and the first impressions are always of the sound, of the stunning rumble created by the world’s most powerful waterhole. The Cascades can be higher and wider, but none are able to send as much water over the edge. To view the falls, you pass troops of baboons, taking a trail that leads across Knife-Edge Bridge to cataracts in the lower Zambezi. From here, the spectacle is intense, some 1,000 tons of water tumbling down into a narrow canyon, and then rising back up as clouds of spray every second. From April to July, it’s almost impossible to avoid being soaked by the spray, which is an indelible part of the Victoria Falls experience.

Your first camp will be located on a small island that is accessed by speed boat from the larger island, which is where you landed. Here, you will be surrounded by water where you can gaze out across a landscape of azure blue and green. Hippos will wade close to the lodge, and elephants will splash past or use their trunks as snorkels. You will be cut off from the modern world, and it will be immensely peaceful to look out at wildlife from a private deck. This wetland part of the delta will be as perfect as your first stop in Botswana, and it will help you recover from your flight and settle into the animal kingdom."

        "description": "The Okavango Delta floods westwards and northwards, so it is the west and northwest where you experience a water-based safari. Towards the east and south more of your experience will be on land; however, this morning, you will explore in a traditional wooden canoe that is known as a mokoro. A gondolier will propel you down narrow waterways, accessing seasonal channels that very few people ever get to see. It will be a slow and silent exploration, so you do not frighten any of the wildlife. In your mokoro, you will drift past pods of hippos and gaze at everything that drinks from the banks. You will have the opportunity to see many animals like the spectacular antelope, Beisa Oryx, or a herd of buffalo or elephant. If you are really fortunate, then you may witness a pride of lions. In the afternoon, you will try a motorboat safari, which is the substitute for a game drive on land without roads. On a motorboat, you can be noisy, so it is not possible to get quite as close to the banks. Still, wildlife will not be scared off as it would be from a vehicle. It will remain at the riverbank to drink, so you will literally be looking up at elephant trunks. Motorboats allow you to cross a relatively large area, so you can get a good feel for the size of the Delta, notably the many islands and secrets that it hides. Trackers and other guides will radio wildlife locations to you, helping you cruise through the bounty of this oasis."

        "description": "You will travel by motorboat across the Okavango, which is a safari transfer to Chief’s Island and Moremi Game Reserve. This is the heart of the Delta, and it supports a staggering abundance of life all year around. Your camp will be perched on the waterfront, providing a dreamy view of hippos and wandering wildlife. Behind the camp will lie a lush island interior, which is made up of open floodplains, inaccessible marshes, and thick woodland. This is what you will explore on a game drive. Crossing the plains, you will be able to see the antelope graze as the Okavango home to a superb variety of species, including some that you may struggle to see elsewhere like red lechwe, nyala, and sitatunga. These water-adapted animals escape to water to evade predators, yet they must graze as well. Surrounding the marshes is a savanna, which is a perfect place for predators to hide. Lions lounge here in the shade of giant trees and leopards will appear on branches, lazing away hours with their alert eyes. On this island, these predators can survive in small territories. Game drivers search for these predators, and you can often get exceptionally close. Sometimes, you will even be able to witness them prowling or chomping into a fresh carcass. On game walks, you cannot go in search of such dangerous animals. Instead, trackers will lead you across the open plains and through areas that are favored by grazing antelopes. It will be exhilarating on foot as red lechwe look up to watch you pass where buffalo and zebra roam just meters away. These land-based activities can also be complemented by mokoro and motorboat rides with the daily program often being dictated by what is going on in the local area. For example, a tracker may radio in the sighting of a fresh carcass on a riverbank, so you will start the day in a boat, or you may track a pack of hyena in a game drive after the guide learns that they are hunting an injured sitatunga."

        "description": "As you travel further north, the waterways will slowly give way, morphing into swamps, marshes, and open plains. Trees will appear along muddy channels, which is suggestive of how this landscape will soon morph into thick woodland. Nestled between the Okavango and Chobe are some of Africa’s ultimate safari destinations, which are exclusive, private concessions on natural migratory routes. Only a handful of guests can visit Selinda Game Reserve at any one time, and these patrons must be staying at a camp on the reserve. It means this safari is very private and uninterrupted by other vehicles or people. Such few visitors traverse this landscape, keeping it quiet and more attractive to wildlife. Now in Selinda, your exploration is restricted to land. Game drives will make up most of the day, and game walks are often possible but depend on whether dangerous animals are near the camp. Added to these, you will also enjoy nighttime game drives. It can be spooky and surreal after dark with only a spotlight to illuminate the animals. You will stop regularly, and the driver will stop the engine so you can listen to the land and animals. Huffing and puffing can be heard as an elephant blows his trumpet-like trunk. Then, the light turns on, and everything is much closer than you could have ever pictured."

Selinda is also home to a large population of wild dogs, which are remarkable animals that den in the woodland and chase their quarry over great distances. By now, you will know that animals are not seen in isolation. It is not just a wild dog, but a landscape that is populated by predator and prey. You will not only encounter lions, but you will also appreciate how these other animals graze so tentatively in their presence. Most of the drives will take place around the Selinda Spillway, which is a waterway that attracts large congregations of life. Ungulates drink in the safety of numbers, but almost every evening something dramatic will occur along the spillway."

        "description": "You will continue your journey north, this time traveling on a muddy trail. After six days on your safari, you will have grown used to seeing hippos and elephants. In Chobe, their abundance will be magnified. It is not a huge stretch of the imagination to think of two elephants or even two elephant herds, but try to imagine hundreds and even thousands of elephants. Almost every turn you make, there will be another pachyderm. Babies will run past, swinging their trunks, and lone bulls will crash new paths through the trees. Giraffes are also seen in large numbers in addition to hippos. Nowhere in the world has as many elephants as Chobe, and from June to September, it is estimated that over 100,000 of them are in the park at one time. Such thick woodland makes it more challenging to spot predators and some of the smaller animals. The experience in Chobe will be all about the giants. They will sound like an orchestra after dark with different horn and trumpet sounds that originate from their trunks. Your camp will be thrillingly deep within the woodland, and its location will rotate every few days, helping you stay far enough away from the giants. After the waterways and plains, you will also enjoy a different safari atmosphere. Woodlands are mystical and secretive, so you must explore with your nose and ears. Often, you can get extremely close as wildlife does not usually see you coming. However, sometimes you must retreat because this is elephant country, and the four-legged giants rule the trails."

Your lodge will be located along the Zambezi River, which is close enough to hear the thunderous rumble of the falls. Check-in and the afternoon will be at your leisure with complimentary transfers to the falls available should you wish. Most of Victoria Falls is on the Zimbabwean side, and you will get soaked by the spray of the waterfall, which is visible almost every month of the year.

Soar over the flooded plains and touch down in big-game country, where lions battle with buffalos and there’s a dreamy collection of resident leopards. Selinda blends different habitats, attracting a diversity of wildlife to a compact area. What you won’t see very often are other visitors. This is a private unfenced concession, only accessible to those staying at one of the few camps within it. So even though you’re positioned on the migration route between the Chobe forests and central Okavango floodplains, other vehicles or visitors won’t interrupt the animal abundance. The stylish camp you will stay at hides amongst the trees, blending into nature in the exclusive Selinda Concession. Your spacious suite feels like what you’d find in a boutique five-star hotel, with opulent fittings and an en-suite bathroom with a lavish copper bathtub. Head out onto the deck, and there’s a private plunge pool, an ideal place to start watching the wildlife that roams beneath the camp. Nature’s lullaby comes uninterrupted, filtering through the canvas walls throughout the day and night. It’s a lullaby of tweeting birds, roaring lions, grazing ungulates, and the sporadic calls that echo across the floodplains. After arriving in the late afternoon, the rest of the day is at your leisure, with a dinner enjoyed beneath the stars as elephants and hippos are scattered across the panorama."

Walking safaris with armed rangers provide a new perspective, especially when you listen to the landscape’s clues and follow a herd of zebras or kudus. Every afternoon, you can cruise along the river on a pontoon boat, another journey that brings intimate moments with a full array of Selinda’s wildlife. Elephants occupy the forest, thousands of them marching a path through the trees. Giraffes poke their heads up high, displaying an elegance and serenity that an escapist safari is all about. Lions laze on the plains, their manes flowing gently in the breeze. Soon, you’re enveloped by nature’s documentary, settled into the charms of a destination that has nothing artificial. This is nature as it’s always been, a journey through the sights, sounds, and smells, of a land untouched by man. Start out on such a journey, and you soon discover it’s a wonderful way to soothe the mind and relax the body. Even when you’re drifting off in the plunge pool, there’s likely to be a four-legged resident making you smile."

This is one of Botswana’s flagship camps, and there’s grandeur to everything, especially in the density of wildlife seen in the vicinity. You’re now in the Jao Concession, which blends a land and water-based Okavango safari. Mokoro and motorboat safaris are added to your flexible program, choices that help you discover new collections of wildlife. As always, everything is tailored to your interests.

For something different this evening, head up the stairs to a private star bed beneath the stars. The immersion in nature is very special, every sound and smell floating up to the four-poster mosquito-net-bound bed that’s located on the roof of your suite.

By flying over the landscapes, you get to appreciate just how remote and untouched the country is. You lose your eyes in the vibrancy of nature, admiring how the colors swirl as if painted by brushes of oil. First, you fly back to Maun, the Okavango delivering captivating swathes of blue and green. These fade away gradually, replaced by the dusty ochre of the Kalahari Desert. Change planes in Maun and discover the enormity of the Kalahari, how it continues uninterrupted for endless miles, and then suddenly transforms into a mirage of salt pans. This is the Makgadikgadi, an area that’s bigger than most countries and one that doesn’t have a single road. Leroo La Tau stands in the west of the pans, perched above the Boteti River. It’s the only permanent water source for hundreds of square miles, attracting thousands of animals as the scarcity of the winter’s dry season takes hold. Among them are the 50,000 or so zebras and wildebeests that arrive every June, after making an epic migration across the pans. While this landscape doesn’t offer the Okavango’s intense concentration of big game, there’s a wonderful charm to discovering how the river brings life to the heart of the dusty desert and deserted salt pans. Like always, sit back on your deck and watch the show, including the myriad of colorful birds that flutter above the herds.

Stop for lunch beneath baobab trees that randomly punctuate the pans, drive across the endless mirage of white, and spot the odd meerkat colony poking their heads above the ground. It’s a journey that showcases the enormity of the Kalahari and the evocative mystique of an untouched world.

Zebras will splash around as they drink, and acacia trees will lie above the water. Kudu and springbok will also be at the river, drinking during the hottest part of the day. The safari will have already started, yet you will be sitting around a pool, sipping on drinks. That will be the style in the Sabi Sands where there is a contemporary luxury in the bush. While you will be going on game drives, the animal experience always continues for 24 hours a day. There are three game drives a day: early morning, late afternoon, and after dark in the evening. These reflect when the animals are most active. Game drives do not need to travel far. They tend to stick close to the Sabi River, which is a permanent water source that snakes through Greater Kruger National Park. There are no fences, and the reserve is a jigsaw piece of the larger Great Limpopo Transfrontier Conservation Area, which is a protected wilderness area that is spread across three countries and some 100,000 square kilometers. Wildlife will move freely around the Sabi River, and you never need to travel far in order to see it. As dawn breaks, the tracker may see a lioness on the move. Up ahead, you can see the zebra, and the guide will position you beyond them, so you do not interrupt the hunt. Monkeys will howl from above as the zebra become increasingly alert. If one runs, the others will follow. There is no telling whether they run into an ambush or not as every game drive is different. Sometimes, you will encounter these dramatic scenes, perhaps even lions feasting on a carcass, and at other times you will find more charm than drama. Leopards are a particular highlight of this reserve and can be wonderfully followed on a nighttime game drive. The area supports great numbers of elephants and rhinos as well, along with buffalo herds that are sometimes 60 or 70 strong. The famous Big Five are just the start. The Sabi Sands supports over 100 large mammal species, helping to provide a diverse overview of African wildlife in its natural habitat. Think wildebeest, springbok, kudu, eland, giraffe, hippo, baboon, peculiar antelope, and small nocturnal predators. Most poignantly, these three days on your safari will reveal how the species interact with each other, highlighting behavior in a way that is only possible in the wild like watching a baby elephant chase a warthog from the river."

        "description": "Hippos will grunt, and their calls will sound a lot like burps. Elephants are more harmonic, which sound much like a chorus of horns and trumpets. Lion calls echo in a sonorous and surreal way as they stretch across the landscape. There will be more immediate sounds as well: red lechwe wading, exotic birds above your suite, and oryx nibbling around the reeds. Smells will also entice, slowly impressing the life that surrounds you. You will explore in a mokoro canoe, and the safari will continue to be a multi-sensory experience. These traditional canoes are constructed from a single tree trunk. A gondolier will push you down narrow channels, taking you silently alongside everything around the banks. With a mokoro you can get incredibly close to the wildlife, often being able to look up at the four-legged giants. A motorboat is the equivalent of a safari vehicle here as traveling by water is the easiest way to get around. You will travel slowly, going around islands, across lagoons, and through the heart of the Delta. In a water world, you never know what animals have been marooned somewhere. Buffalo and elephants will swim across while hippos dip their heads under the water. Game drives and game walks will also be a part of your safari program with the exact itinerary being planned on a day to day basis. Your camp is to the west of the Delta, which is the area that floods first and has water all year around. This side of the Okavango is recommended for a multi-destination safari, as it proves to be a massive contrast from Sabi Sands and Linyanti. Hippos will become your neighbors, elephants will wander past your camp each evening, and wildlife will thrive in this bountiful space. By using all your senses, you will pick up on more of the details, learning what different animals do at different times of the day, and appreciating the daily battles between and within species."

        "title": "Linyanti Reserve – Drama and Charm in an Atmospheric Safari Wilderness",
        "description": "The short flight to Linyanti will be spectacular, providing a scenic impression of how the Okavango Delta spills eastwards. You will cruise above snake-shaped channels, islets, and floodplains, spotting elephants and giraffes that are on the move. Landing in Linyanti, you will immediately grasp a mix of habitats. There will be water here along with open plains and thick swathes of forest. To the north is Chobe, which is a woodland that is home to the world’s largest elephant population. To the south, you will have the Okavango Delta, which is a seasonal wildlife haven. Linyanti is on the migratory path between them, and it is a reserve that has been made even more special during the last few years. For decades, the Savuti Channel was dry, but now it runs strong and clear, making the reserve a popular place for year-round residents. Massive herds of buffalo will graze on the open plains, joined by zebra, wildebeest, oryx, and, clusters of more bashful antelope. Giraffes poke their heads above the trees, and you will quickly lose count of the elephants with herds roaming past at all hours of the day. Most of all, this is a place for predators. Deep in the trees, you will find a leopard that is draped along an acacia branch, and around the savannah fringes, you will discover lion prides that are learning how small their territories. Across the savanna, you will see something move as figures move their heads in and out of the grass. You may be lucky and witness a pack of wild dogs that are out on their afternoon hunt. They move with tact at first but quickly pick up the chase. In comparison, the big cats must get really close in order to pounce. Working as a pack, the dogs chase their prey, trying to isolate a target. Once isolated, the animals run and run as the wild dogs work their prey to exertion. This wildlife drama will be complemented by daily charm. Not every sighting will be thrilling and exciting. Soon, you will find that many animals are so numerous that they begin to blur into the landscape. After nine days on your safari, it will be hard to picture a land that is not populated by hippos and elephants. Walking safaris will bring a new impression. Now, you will be sharing the land with these giants, looking up and across at them. You will be just another mammal, and the herds will look at you inquisitively and unsure of what to make of such two-legged visitors. Walking safaris can be incorporated into your safari program along with nighttime drives as well."

The incredible display seems to come from nowhere as a thunderous sheet of water disappears into the chasm below. Victoria Falls has been declared one of the natural wonders of the world, and it remains completely natural. There are no flashing lights or big-brand advertising signs, no chain coffee houses or buildings crowding around the precipice. Instead, baboons scamper along the trails, narrow bridges run alongside the mile-wide falls, and there are countless places to be completely alone with the falls. You will want to bring your raincoat as the vast clouds of spray emerge from the abyss to quickly soak every visitor. You will be greeted at Livingstone International Airport and transferred directly to Victoria Falls, where a guide will lead you along the trails on the Zambian side of the falls. Take your time to allow the falls to engage all of your senses softly and then enjoy lunch at a small café. From here, you will be driven into Mosi oa Tunya National Park, where a savannah stretches out from the Zambezi River. Your camp there provides the first night of luxury under canvas with zebra and elephant that wander past as you continue to absorb the untrammeled beauty of Southern Africa."

Most of Botswana is not accessible by road, and the only way onward is to traverse the waterways or wander across the floodplains. On a luxury boat cruise, you will quickly encounter elephants as large herds of them play at the river. Hippos fill the water in the hundreds with the odd pair of rumbustious males solving a disagreement with shows of force. Zebra and impala dot the banks of the Chobe River as half of the herd remain on guard as the rest bends down to drink. You will enjoy a light lunch on the boat before you return to the Kasane airstrip to fly further south to Linyanti Concession, where your beautiful camp occupies a sublime location above the waterways."

        "description": "A portfolio of predators makes the Linyanti a thrilling introduction to safari. A pack of wild dogs runs across the savannah grasslands and then split up to converge with silent communication. Down at the river, there is a clash between crocodiles and buffalos, leaving the large herd unable to drink in peace. Hidden high in the trees are leopards, the spotted cats that are easy to miss if you travel too fast. As you explore the woodland, the profusion of elephants is remarkable as thousands upon thousands barge a path through the thick trees. They are joined by giraffe, who lope away in a few long strides when a lion pride enters beneath the canopy. The Linyanti a land of the giants and the hunters and the juxtaposition of ecosystems providing ample food for the largest and most ravenous of Botswana. Woodland blurs into grassland savannah, which often disappears and becomes classic delta scenery when the Okavango is flooding. Exquisite and exclusive, Linyanti is a private concession and can only be visited by those staying at one of the luxury camps within the concession. There are strict rules about encountering the wildlife, so there will never be more than three vehicles that approach any animal. Often there will only be yours, even when it's the sight of a lion pride tearing into a zebra carcass. Game drives are about the discovery of a full range of habitats to find the predators while walking safaris take you onto the savannah and into the realm of the grazers, where it's possible to approach to just a few meters from large herds. Nighttime game drives continue the adventure as the silence of the wilderness is pierced only by harrowing calls. Listen, get closer, turn on the spotlight and the culmination of a hunt is taking place just a few meters from the vehicle. As with most days on this safari itinerary, the daily program is flexible, and you'll be able to choose between different activities."

        "description": "Hippos watch on as you cross the Okavango Delta, first by plane and then in a small motorboat. Palm islands are isolated amongst the blue, where baboon troops and kudu herds have been marooned. Knobthorn acacia trees are shoulder-deep in water to soak up the seasonal abundance. From June to November, the Okavango is flooded to form nature's greatest oasis. But certain channels and waterways flow all year, which helps to maintain a rich diversity and profusion of wildlife. Kanana Reserve is centered on some of these permanent channels, with its lush flood meadows transforming when the Delta's waters rise. Check into your next marvelous camp and admire the scene from your wooden verandah as nothing artificial will break the spell of the natural wilderness. A resident hippo pod bathing in the river will be a permanent fixture for these next three days. It will not be long before you see one open its humongous jaw. Various antelope will skip past to drink from the channel before returning to the fresh meadows. Above your head are the branches of jackal berry and sausage trees, where an array of monkey species provide regular entertainment. Check into the camp and enjoy an afternoon of exploration. You will head out in a motorboat to get a sense of just how big and diverse the Delta is. Dozens of different species are encountered, and there's always a surprise to discover."

        "description": "Like Linyanti, Kanana is a private reserve, an exclusive enclave amongst a world-famous destination. You have the Okavango Delta at your fingertips, a whole playground of opportunity with hardly another visitor in sight. Much like Linyanti, Kanana also showcases a variety of habitats that brings a variety of wildlife. These two days are made up of both land and water activities that unravel the subtleties of the Okavango Delta. Create your own itinerary, with morning and afternoon excursions punctuated by a few relaxed hours at the camp. Safari never stops of course, as even when it's midday, and you are reading a book on the verandah, there is likely to be hippos or elephants dominating the panorama. Barefooted, indigenous guides take you onto the savannah. Walk slowly as a buffalo herd is up ahead before you stop, take some photos, and then analyze the herd's reaction. They seem unthreatened, so walk ten meters closer. With many of the animals, you can follow this pattern as the guides can bring you into a thrilling proximity. On game drives, you can't be silent, but by traversing large areas of the reserve, you can encounter all of its residents. Guides know where the resident cheetahs like to hide, or where to find pride of lions. Sometimes the experience involves stopping the vehicle and waiting. Elephants will roam past from multiple directions, the giraffe will curiously say hello, and half a dozen antelope species may quickly scamper past. These land safaris are complimented by motorboat journeys and mokoro safaris, where you explore in traditional canoes."

        "title": "Moremi Game Reserve – The Complete Delta Wilderness Experience",
        "description": "Exploring the Okavango is not possible by road, so light aircraft hop above the wilderness to touch down at remote airstrips that sometimes have to be cleared of giant mammals to allow for landing. Motorboats cruise along the water to piece together the distinctive areas of an oasis that is clearly visible from space. For your final three nights, your safari is in Moremi Game Reserve, the game-rich heart of the Okavango Delta. Choose to arrive by flight or boat (both options offer a safari experience), and then settle into the next camp, set on a lush island that's surrounded by water throughout the year. Moremi provides the quintessence of the Delta, where water abounds, exotic birds flutter past, and it's hard to go a few minutes without hearing the hippos. After checking in, you will spend an afternoon on a mokoro safari. These traditional wooden canoes have been the local means of transportation for generations, a serene and silent way of moving through the flooded landscape. A guide paddles you down narrow channels, where there's barely ten meters of water between the lush reeds on either side. It's thick, and the visibility is low but with the mokoro's speed, you can follow all of the clues. Perhaps you will see a pair of eyes in the grass, that of a hyena hiding amidst the green. Or maybe a trampled route that leads to a herd of elephants. Paddle along the banks, and you will encounter everything that comes to drink from the channels including the kudu, springbok, oryx, impala, zebra, giraffe, baboons, and more, all seen from water level barely five meters away. Turn another corner in the mokoro , and there will be a herd of tsessebe, small antelope that gallop away quickly because a lion pride wants to drink from the same spot. The adventures on land also continue and you will enjoy game drives across Chief's Island, the lavish green center of the Okavango Delta. Surrounded by water all year around, the island has a remarkable density of life, including four of the Big Five and the roving herds of pachyderms. Walking safaris can be limited here (due to the abundance of predators), but you will still have the opportunity to explore certain areas safely on foot. Then there's the camp safari as you watch hippos while sitting on your bed or glance up from a book to see a giraffe tower wandering past. Or you may wake up to a herd of red lechwe grazing directly beneath your luxury-tented suite. Moremi offers the complete Okavango wilderness experience and three days lets you explore it all at a relaxed speed."

Lion prides roam, elephants wander in search of water, antelope graze on brittle grass, and there isn't a building for thousands of square miles. It's an idyllic escape and an indelible jump into the animal kingdom. But how do you get there? After your international flight lands in Maun, central Botswana, a light aircraft takes you out into remote Kalahari, landing on a rarely used airstrip.

        "description": "When couples think of romantic escapes they're perhaps thinking of opening the curtains to white sand and palm trees. This morning's view is a little different. You've got a few wandering giraffe, a nomadic elephant herd, and a sprinkling of antelope inspecting the camp. There's no need to rise from the luxurious king sized bed to enjoy the action. With a mobile camp in the Kalahari you can just marvel at the animals coming to you. Your personal chef cooks up breakfast, dazzling panoramas extend in all directions, and the camp comes with some fabulous little touches. This might be camping, but it's camping Botswana style; think hot showers overlooking the elephants, thick lounge chairs with a view, and wooden flooring that raises the spacious tent above the landscape. A small and discreet team attends to your every need. So if you want to eat dinner beside a hippo pool then the table will be quickly arranged, complete with wine glasses and candles. This first stop sets the tone for the whole vacation. The exact location of the camp is dependent on the abundance of wildlife, distance to other visitors, and animal migratory patterns. It effortlessly blends into the landscape and attracts lots of curious attention from four-legged visitors. An ungulate herd might be scared of a lodge. The same herd will be intrigued by a small camp on the horizon. Safari starts from the camp and it continues into the night. Lions slumber in the dusty plains, ever searching for a shaded space to rest their heads. Drive alongside them and they hardly seem to move. But a half open eye suggests that a lion is never completely asleep. Cheetahs stand on protruding rocks, gazing out at the potential dinner menu. Red hartebeest gather and gallop, ever hoping for signs of flourishing grass to graze upon. The Kalahari is often barren and desolate, so the nomadic wildlife moves great distances in search of food. You could look out and see nothing, apart from the mesmeric red beauty of scorched plains. But you could also look out and see everything. Like everywhere on this vacation, the daily itinerary is completely flexible and dictated by the two of you. A complete range of safari activities are included and an expert guide will craft an adventure that suits your mood. That might be an epic six hour game drive across the Kalahari. Or it could be a one hour walk on the trail of giraffe. The guide's intimate knowledge of the environment helps satisfy demanding preferences. African safari is inherently unpredictable and that's epitomized by the Kalahari. Sometimes you may drive for 30 minutes and only admire singed plains. Then an elephant grabs your attention. Get closer and a whole kudu herd follows the pachyderm's footsteps. Keep approaching and there's a camouflaged leopard tracking the nomads. This is African safari at its most authentic, and probably, its most romantic."

And slowly they become sharp defined images, a patchwork of stripes emerging from the arid landscape. Almost everyone has heard of the great wildebeest migration. Botswana's zebra migration is Africa's second largest mass movement of animals. 30,000 sets of zebra hooves are kicking up dust as they maraud south in the early months of the year. Blue wildebeest join the search for fresh grazing land and a smorgasbord of predators provide chaperoning services. Your camp will be erected with a view of the migration and the location may only be decided a week or so before you arrive. This provides maximum flexibility for responding to the natural phenomenon. Nxai Pan gets the action during the early months, the herds multiplying in size as they maraud onwards. Makgadikgadi is better in March and April. By then, the zebra start to scatter before completing their migration at the Boteti River. As always, a range of inimitable safari experiences get you even closer. Walk out onto the plains and wait for the rush of a thousand zebra galloping past. Experienced horse riders can sit in the saddle and actually ride along the fringes of the herds. Or you could uncork the wine and soak up the surroundings of your private playground. It's not just about the zebra and their predators. These pans burst with the rare and inimitable. Meerkat mobs stick up their heads on crusted white salt pans. Aardwolves and bat-eared foxes emerge at sundown, and the endemic bird species provide both color and music. It's a very different world than the Kalahari. There are few permanent residents; this land is a stopover for a mass transient population in search of fresh pastures. And you'll be smack in the middle of their route."

Join your partner on the raised balcony for morning coffee, a baby elephant splashing in the nearby water and a herd of kudu trying to avoid the dangling trunk. Breakfast is served, poached eggs on toast as requested, and your guide explains all the possible options for today. You may wish to stay and watch the animal party developing beside your balcony. Or today might be a day for exploring. A traditional mokoro traverses the waterways, the skilled gondolier picking a careful route through raised snouts. Large hippo pods cover the blue channels; males bicker and push their way up the hierarchy, youngsters rampage into the water with comic maneuvers, and females aren't shy about leaving their scent. Crocodiles also patrol the water, occasionally snapping their jaws around the hind leg of something that splashed around a little too closely. Land safaris are equally hypnotic. Game drive through dense forests, weaving into eerie quietude and spot a pair of eyes in the branches. What is it? Even with binoculars the camouflage remains faithful. But then a tail flicks and a yawn reveals ferocious teeth. It's one of many leopards preparing to feast on the arriving migrating herds. Step, step, step, you traverse the forest edges on a walking safari. Giraffe are tall and elephants are huge. But that can only be truly appreciated when you're also standing at ground level. Quaint picnic spots offer lunch for two with a view and you return to camp to see a mischievous monkey hanging out on your chair. Don't worry, he's quick to move and you've nothing to be fearful of. Even when camping in the heart of lion country you're very safe. The locals have harmoniously lived with the Big Five for many, many centuries, so your guides know exactly how to pick up on animal behavior and clues. If there's evidence of exploratory leopards then the camp's location may be moved just a day before your arrival. A nighttime fire keeps the hyenas away. Other small tricks ensure your safety. So while this private escape is all about surrounding yourself with Botswana's wild nature, there isn't going to be any mishaps interrupting the romance."

The Okavango always provides a dramatic safari introduction. You will transfer here by light aircraft from Maun, and it will be amazing how much wildlife you see just on the transfer to the camp. While safaris are considered adventurous vacations, they are also very relaxing. After a long flight to Botswana, there will be nothing better than lounging around the camp, watching wildlife at the river down below. By heading deep into the wilderness, you will not always need game drives or other safari activities. In the Okavango, you can safari from your camp. So, rest up after the flight and start tuning your senses into this wildlife world."

        "title": "Moremi Game Reserve – Safari On Water and Land in Africa’s Oasis",
        "description": "Moremi Game Reserve is the game-rich heart of the Okavango Delta. Here, there is permanent water as well as Chief’s Island, which is the largest of all the Okavango islands. Resident wildlife is legendary, and it features four of the famous five, not including rhinos, along with large ungulate herds and many rare species such as the Sable antelope. This wildlife population is swelled by migratory arrivals from May to October and animals that follow the seasonal delta feast into Moremi. You will be staying on the northern tip of Chief’s Island, which is in an exclusive area with very few visitors. From here, you can fully explore both land and water. On a game drive, you will bump along sandy trails and lurch in and out of the mud. Elephants will block the way, and you must wait for them to pass. Giraffes will trek elegantly across floodplains. Deep in the grass, the guide will spot movement, so you drive closer. You will witness lions playfully rolling around with content stomachs. Later in the drive, you may see another pride. This time the lionesses will be prowling. Sticking close to the ground, they creep around the riverbanks in the stalk of prey. Baboons will shout out, betraying the lions, and alerting the zebra who quickly gallop off. Game drives can explore large tracts of Chief’s Island, and they are mostly about big and dangerous animals, which are the most sought-after species on a Botswana safari. It is very different in a mokoro canoe. A gondolier will guide you down narrow channels as lush hues dominate the scene. Reeds and high grass will provide hiding places, but if you look closely, you will be able to spot leopards that are hiding among the green. When these reeds clear, it is safer for animals to drink. You will travel past the open banks, looking up and across at gathering herds. Sometimes it will be buffalo, and at other times, giraffe or wildebeest. Hippos will dominate the channels, and the guide will skillfully steer around them. Mokoro canoes are the traditional means of getting around the Okavango, and as you travel in silence, they allow you to get very close to the wildlife. Motorboat safaris are like game drives on water. They cover large distances, traveling to different islands, and exploring where the rivers split. You will see zebra splashing in the shallows, and dazzling horns will distinguish the Sable antelope along the banks. Vultures and sea eagles will soar overhead, and red lechwe will be everywhere as large herds of them wade across the water. Sitatunga is usually a very difficult safari sighting, but they are another of the semi-aquatic species that thrive here and can be regularly encountered from a motorboat. During these two days, the program can be adapted to your interests, including all three of these activities. Even when you see the same animal species, it will be a very different experience depending on the activity, which is why the Okavango Delta is so unique."

        "title": "Kwando Concession – Intimate Connections in Northern Botswana",
        "description": "From the Okavango, you will fly north. Beneath you, there will be glimpses of arid plains, which are signs of the Kalahari Desert’s dry rule. Islands and waterways will slowly give way to floodplains and hints of woodland. Colors will change, and there will be nothing artificial down below with not a single road between the Okavango Delta and Kwando. Most of Southern Africa is wilderness, and Kwando is about as deep as you can get into this wilderness. Flying is the only way in from Chief’s Island, and you can sense exclusivity from the moment you land. At first, everything will seem silent, but your senses will be tuned to the wild, and tiny clues will alert you to wildlife. You may even have the pleasure of witnessing a herd of tsessebe, which will be a new species to add to your safari memories. Kwando is a private concession on a natural migratory route with elephants among those regularly traveling past the camps. Ecosystems blur together here, and floodplains attract the grazers, notably zebra, buffalo, and wildebeest. Waterways are populated by hippos and red lechwe, and swathes of woodland provide food for elephant and giraffe, including giant herds that arrive from Chobe. Out on a game drive, you will spot a Roan antelope with dramatic horns that point skywards and a black and white face that shimmers beneath the sun. Predators do extremely well here as the food menu is so diverse. Moving in large packs, these painted hunters cross the savanna. Kwando uses animal trackers who are local experts that radio in specific animal sightings. This means that you will not lose any time, and the guides can take you straight to the most impressive sightings. Trackers also know where wild dogs den, so encounters with these endangered predators are almost guaranteed. Another important aspect of the private concession is the opportunity to drive off the trail. This is essential for tracking predators, especially if they are on the move. So, when the wild dogs or lions move off into high grass, you will be able to follow the hunt and watch all the drama unfold."

        "title": "Kwando Concession – Walking With Giants and Nighttime Safari",
        "description": "With two days in Kwando, the safari program will be flexible. Game drives mostly focus on the predators, which is something for which the concession is famous. Nighttime game drives will add to the excitement. You may stop in a clearing where the driver cuts the engine. It will be still and silent as your eyes adjust to grazers nearby. Suddenly, a troop of baboons starts shouting. Red lechwe panic and start galloping in all directions. The guide will turn a torch on now, and you will see the lions causing havoc as they hunt in the dark. Walking safaris can be just as thrilling as the game drives. Yes, this is a land that is populated by big cats and elephants, but it will be safe to walk on the open floodplains. Remember, guides have grown up here, and local tribes have always coexisted with potentially dangerous animals. They will lead the way, and nearby trackers will also radio in any signs of danger. With these walks, the focus will be on the ungulates and smaller animals. Just like in a mokoro, you are able to get close to these animals, and they will not see you as a threat and run away. So, one minute you will be walking, and the next minute you will realize that you are surrounded by zebra or wildebeest."

        "description": "You will complete your safari with a long game drive through Chobe where you will travel east into denser and denser woodland. Elephants have bulldozed paths through the trees, and you will quickly lose count of these giants. During the dry season, there are around 100,000 elephants here, more than anywhere else in the world. Youngsters will march past with their trunks draggling along the ground, and adolescent males will lock their tusks in playful shows of power. Giraffes are impossible to miss here as they lean over the trees to eat from high branches, loping through gaps in the woodland. Hippos will also be a regular part of your journey, and you will see them out of the water, especially along the Chobe River. This landscape is dense and tangled with lots of undergrowth for animals to hide. It will be rare to encounter the predators. This will bring extreme close-up encounters with the giants. Often times, you will have to stop for ten minutes as herds cover the trail, blocking the way past. After a day of driving, you will rest at a lodge on the Chobe River, watching the raw, African sunset turn pachyderms into silhouetted figures."

This is the translation of Mosi-oa-Tunya, which was that the locals gave to the falls. In just 90 minutes, you will have left Chobe, crossed the border, and settled into a lodge on the Zambezi River. You will have lunch and rest before an afternoon with the world’s largest continuous sheet of falling water. You will certainly hear it before you see it. A trail runs parallel to the falls on the Zimbabwean side. First, you will marvel at the chasm, watching rainbows spiral in the mist. Then, beneath the trees, you will see how the waterfall tumbles as great a surge of water that disappears into a narrow gorge. Much of the water returns as mist, raining down on the trail with the potential to drench you in seconds. At first, the trail is beneath rainforest, but when it opens out around the main falls, it will be impossible to stay dry. This is part of the experience, and there will be no questioning that Mosi-oa-Tunya is more appropriate than the English name."

Great rolling dunes and immense expanses of land with no other person in sight await you. There are dry valleys and seasonally inundated pans, as well as the larger salt pans of the Makgadikgadi Pan, but the only permanent river, the Okavango, is trapped in a delta in the northwest. Omuramba , ancient dry riverbeds, cross the Central Northern reaches of the Kalahari and provide standing pools of water during the rainy season. Despite its apparent aridity, the Kalahari supports a variety of flora. Acacia trees and other herbs and grasses are dotted about the sandy plains, and there are wondrous fruits such as the African horned cucumber, or jelly melon, which is endemic to the Kalahari. Your first evening will be spent around the campfire admiring the bright stars of the southern hemisphere and soaking in the majesty of your surroundings here in the desert."

Over the next few days you will explore two areas of a pristine wilderness in the Moremi Wildlife Reserve. The reserve comprises land that was selected for protection by the BaTawana community in 1962, and it was named after Chief Moremi. The area comprises a large expanse of the wetlands of the Okavango as well as a section known as the Mopane Tongue, and it is known for its beauty and diversity. There are sprawling floodplains, lagoons, fields of swaying papyrus, forests of mopane trees, clambering figs and knotted jackalberries, and the only thing more famous than the landscape is the abundance of wildlife. This luscious oasis has attracted herds of general game, along with the great predators that hunt them, and in this protected environment, where humans pose no risk to the animals, the wildlife are relaxed and unperturbed by the few lucky visitors who come armed only with their cameras. As you head out on morning and afternoon game drives in open 4x4 vehicles, keep your eyes peeled for some of the Okavango’s stars. There are red lechwe antelope to be found leaping across the watery channels, majestic herds of elephant making their unstoppable journeys from island to island with their infants trailing in their wake. You might see sleepy prides of lion that begin to stretch out and flex their muscles as they hungrily eye a nearby herd of impala, and a pack of wild dog sprinting through the undergrowth on a hunt for food. The combination of scenery and wildlife will leave you speechless. Back in camp you will be helping the team put together your home each night. Enjoy the camaraderie of the campsite by sitting around the fire, sharing stories and listening to the sounds of the bush."

Nighttime is also a good time to see cats on a hunt with leopards and lions prowling across the land. For days five and six, the safari program is flexible. Typically, you will be exploring in the early morning, late afternoon, and after dark. Photography hides provide secretive places to hang out, bringing dreamy close-ups with various animals. Elephants and giraffes still dominate, but you can feel how Linyanti is on a migratory route, especially when exploring around the Savuti Channel. Red lechwe will skip past in their hundreds, and beisa oryx will greet your eye. Buffalos will huff and puff throughout the evening, and zebra will gather in a blur of white and black stripes. All of this means food for the predators and Linyanti has one extra special highlight: wild dogs. Although increasingly endangered, these predators have a refuge in Linyanti. Guides know where multiple packs den, so it is easy to enjoy encounters. Trying to keep pace with the hunters, following a pack on a hunt will be magical. Here lies another advantage of safaris in private concession: you are permitted to travel off the trails. Going off-trail is essential for tracking the predators, both before and after a hunt. So, the guide will take you within a few meters of lions or close enough so you can spot leopard cubs that are high in a tree. Linyanti is one of Africa’s ultimate private concessions, and by going off the trails, it will be one of your most memorable animal encounters."

        "description": "Travel further south, and you will not be able to travel by land anymore. Water will take over as the Okavango Delta spills its bounty across the desert. Trails are washed away every year, so you must fly with dreamy views from the window as you transfer to the Moremi Game Reserve. Your camp will be located on the northern tip of Chief’s Island, which is the largest of all the Okavango islands. This central piece of the Delta offers food and water every month of the year, resulting in a remarkable wildlife density. The giants are here in vast numbers, and there are other mass populations as well, notably red lechwe and zebra. Year-round residents are joined by migratory arrivals, including herds that swim across channels to reach the island. From your camp, you can gaze out across the water. Wildlife hides in the surrounding trees. Nature sings a lullaby each evening, and there is nothing artificial here, and nothing to distort your connection to both the wilderness and wildlife. In Moremi, the safari will be adjusted to your preferences and interests. Game drives can be accompanied by short game walks, providing the trackers think it is safe enough. Motorboat and mokoro canoes will then bring a new angle. Over these two days, you will explore the land and waterways, piecing together both sides of the Okavango experience. By now, you will appreciate how each activity brings a different perspective. Game drives are a little noisy, so many animals will retreat from an approaching vehicle. This is not the case on walks or in a canoe as these activities often take you among herds, creating a 360-degree panorama of life. You will also appreciate how the safari always continues back at your camp. Each evening, you will sit around a fire, listening to the sounds, and watching animals drink from the river below."

        "description": "Another short flight will bring more views across the Delta as channels snake out around palm-fringed islands. Seasonal flooding makes the landscape even more iconic, forming a labyrinth of narrow channels. There are no roads, and there is hardly even any land, just a handful of small islands that are populated by grazers and monkeys. This is the classic Okavango Delta landscape and safari experience with all the activities taking place on or in the water. New animals like sitatunga will now begin to blur into the landscape, and hippos can be seen more regularly, but in smaller pods. Motorboat rides are the equivalent to game drives, covering relatively large areas while following locations that have been radioed by trackers. Mokoro canoes are how indigenous people travel. Constructed from a single tree, these canoes are pushed down the channels by gondoliers. They are incredibly silent and serene, drifting past lush reeds and beneath palm trees. Such peaceful travel does not have an impact on animals. Sometimes, you will be just five meters away from all kinds of animals. Sometimes a lioness will peer at you with one open eye as she lounges on the bank. With water as a barrier, a mokoro means real intimacy, especially as you have no idea what will be hiding around each bend in the delta."

Lush waterways are replaced by the Kalahari’s arid dust, and soon there will be nothing except the changing brown hues of an enormous desert. Out of this nothingness, something new will emerge. The landscape will turn white as you touch down beside the pans. There was once a lake the size of Switzerland here, and today, there is no longer any water, just a mirage of shimmering salt. In such a barren place, it is difficult for animals to thrive, but you do not come here for wildlife, you come to Nxai Pan for silence and solitude. This incredibly peaceful experience will give you the opportunity to reflect on all the safari excursions that you have experienced so far. The camp peers across the plains and the mirage will seem endless. You can explore on an all-terrain vehicle, following a handful of paths that separate the pans. Occasionally, a lone elephant will wander past. Out in the salt, you will come across meerkats, poking their heads from the ground. Mostly, there will be nothing, and such a space will produce a unique state of mind. Space dominates at nighttime as well, and the desert stars extend above you as your campfire crackles. After ten days on your safari, it will always seem like a shame to return to the modern world. Staying on Nxai Pan will keep you firmly in the wilderness, ensuring that you have some alone time before returning home."

As you set out on your safari, experience the harmony of the biodiversity with ebonies and baobab trees, wild figs, and mahogany flanking the river frontage and pools. You may find a herd of cape buffalo grazing on the verdant grasses, the largest of Africa’s wild bovid species. They can grow to over 11 feet long and weigh around 2,200 pounds. Their unpredictable temperament makes them a formidable opponent on the open plains, while their heard size could grow up to 500 individuals making them one of the most dangerous animals in the African bush."

        "title": "Khwai Concession – Introductions to the Okavango Floodplains",
        "description": "The iconic Okavango impression is of flooded channels and marooned islands, of a landscape where hippos barge past elephants on the banks. It's this postcard image that you find at the Khwai Concession, one of the oldest gazetted areas within the Delta ecosystem. For over 30 years, your river lodge has provided a luxurious base within its local concession, with canvas chalets dotted amongst leadwood trees. Space is paramount here, with each chalet linked by a long wooden walkway above the floodplain. Delightful views come from your private verandah, an opulent en-suite bathroom is nothing like preconceptions of Africa, and the central area includes a lounge, bar, and stylish dining area. Today you land at Maun International Airport, where you're assisted in transferring to a light aircraft. Part of your camp's exclusivity is its inaccessibility. You cruise above the channels, taking in surreal expressions of nature. Even from the air, the Delta extends beyond the horizon in every direction. Land at your lodge in the late afternoon, where you enjoy a spa treatment on your verandah. As a masseuse alleviates any travel aches, you're getting introduced to the Okavango floodplains, gazing out at passing elephant herds and congregations of wild antelopes. The evening is at your leisure, with dinner beneath the stars in the main part of the camp."

        "description": "After a light breakfast, you're out on a game drive in an open-sided vehicle. Buffalo graze beside the track, a mass of black staring you right back in the eye. Beneath a tree, you spot a lion pride, complete with playful cubs interrupting their mother's sleep. Drive along the riverbank and hippos are everywhere, some opening their jaws with an iconic yawn. Next, it's a zebra herd, cantering beneath trees where giraffes feed. A first game drive is packed with new impressions and today is all about trying to take them all in. You return to the lodge by late morning, enjoying a hearty brunch before a serene few hours resting. Then a second game drive leaves after afternoon tea, staying out until the last light of the day is fading away. These game drives will explore both Khwai Concession and the adjacent Moremi Game Reserve."

        "title": "Moremi Game Reserve – Luxury in the Wild Heart of the Okavango",
        "description": "Fly above the Delta, following the serpentine curves of the water. Channels wind past marooned sandbanks while large herds dot the landscape. It's a short flight to the northwestern edge of Chief's Island, where another of Botswana's flagship lodges awaits. Elevated wooden walkways lead you to a delightful suite, where comfy sofas are perfect for sitting back and watching the wildlife pass by. Plunge pools offer a unique place to view the big game and your suite is raised far off the ground, providing an extra layer of reassurance given the density of wild animals found nearby. Located on the Moremi Game Reserve, rather than its own concession, but the remarkable abundance of wildlife helps it maintain an exclusive feel: with so much to see, visitors are widely spread. This is one of the Okavango's most fertile stretches, and the game drives provide insatiable encounters with predators, especially lions. On an afternoon excursion, you approach a pride. The male yawns, then drifts to sleep with one eye open. Three lionesses elegantly wake up, wandering slowly to the safari vehicle before stretching out in the shade of the back wheel. At the channel, you see another pride drinking, the males' flowing manes gently reflected in the water. Then the iconic sight, lionesses lurking in the grass as they stalk a small herd of red sitatunga. Stop. Be patient. And watch the scene slowly unfold: lions stalking with menace, antelope grazing with trepidation, an explosion of dust as the hunt takes place and a young calf is separated from the herd. After the drama of the wild, your lodge provides an indelible base to bring the heartbeat down."

        "description": "An opulent lodge-style accommodation offers a serene counterpoint to the wilderness. For example, this morning you head off at dawn, exploring when the Okavango is at its most vibrant. Hippos are out of the water, munching across the grasslands. Vervet monkeys are squawking, alerting everyone to a leopard that's hiding nearby. Very rare black rhinos might be seen, the bashful mammals grazing openly in the sunrise light. These sights are never standalone. Everything is interacting, creating a theater that's defined by drama. But return to the lodge and all is calm. Animals still flicker past, but the theater is one of elegance and tranquility. You get to rest and relax, savoring the escapism of the Okavango. Contemporary luxury ensures you have every possible comfort. And then a zebra herd grazes beneath your suite, a reminder that you are charmingly immersed in the wilderness. In the afternoon, you head out on a second game drive, which is followed by another relaxed dinner at the lodge."

        "title": "Vumbura Reserve – Crossing the Okavango By Boat",
        "description": "The Okavango Delta can be seen from space, its lush blue floodplains stretching far across the Kalahari Desert. Most of it is inaccessible. Sandbanks are isolated, leaving behind marooned herds. Palm islands are created, while wild palm plantations are slowly submerged. It's majestic when seen from the air; it's bafflingly complex when discovered from the water. Today, you travel by motorboat to the Duba Plains, crossing the water to the northern fringes of the Okavango. Zebra spray up water as they gallop on the banks, hippo pods fill the channels with their boisterous antics, and wandering nomads rise above the surrounding grasslands. You get a true sense of how big and expressive the Okavango really is. It's roughly a three-hour journey, but don't think of this as a transfer. Instead, it's a vivid Okavango motorboat safari. Your next property is located in the private Vumbura Reserve, amidst a landscape of floodplains, woodland, and tiny palm islands. A modern luxury tent lodge that evokes classic African safari styles of the 1920s, all is designed to blend with the surrounding trees, each tent has a private plunge pool, large wooden deck, and a covered sala (pavilion) for private dining. There are only five luxury tents, so an air of exclusivity and service is always maintained, especially when drinks are served as the sun disappears over the Okavango. You should arrive at lunchtime before the afternoon provides a game drive through the private reserve."

        "title": "Vumbura Reserve – Luxury Safari and Diverse Activities",
        "description": "Wildlife is everything in Vumbura. Lionesses hide away their cubs before hunting for buffalo. Impala and tsessebe elegantly grace the plains. Pink pelicans and red-billed hornbills provide additional color. The open plains are ideal for cheetah and wild dogs, relatively rare hunters that provide some of safari's most hypnotic sights. Spotted hyenas scurry past while leopards drape their spots across the woodland. Elephants, giraffe, crocodiles, kudu, wildebeest; Vumbura always impresses with its variety and density of wildlife. After six days on safari, coming here ensures that you're constantly enjoying fresh sights. This is complemented by the variety of activities. There are few restrictions in a private reserve, so you can create a personal program from the menu of excursions. Short game walks are accompanied by armed trackers, getting you thrillingly close to the plains' antelopes. Silently explore in a mokoro , a traditional wooden canoe that's paddled along the channels. Or continue yesterday's experience with a motorboat safari. Or you can stay out into the evening on a nighttime game drive, admiring nocturnal animals that emerge from their dens. At this camp, you get to try it all, each activity offering a new atmosphere and experience in the same landscape."

        "description": "After the flight, you take an afternoon game drive through the concession, aquatinting yourself with a new landscape, one that's dominated by giants. Elephant and giraffe are everywhere while lions continue to provide their daily charm. Towards the late afternoon, you cruise ona private pontoon, a relaxed sunset boat journey that brings intimacy with hippos, elephants, and a wide variety of birdlife. A bateleur eagle swoops overhead while guineafowl roost in jackalberry trees. This sunset boat cruise is available on each of your days in Selinda and the camp only has eight guests, so the activities always have an air of exclusivity.

        "title": "Selinda Concession – Game Drives and Game Walks",
        "description": "The Selinda Concession is at a crossroads, connecting the diverse realms of the Okavango and Chobe. After eight days on safari, you already know a lot about the Delta, about how the water brings diverse life to the Kalahari Desert. To the south and west of Selinda lies the Okavango Delta, while to the north and east is Chobe National Park, a thick woodland ecosystem that's a favorite of the pachyderms. Chobe is home to Africa's largest elephant population, along with vast numbers of other forest dwellers. Connecting these two ecosystems is the Magwegqana Spillway, a sunken landscape of savannah, sporadic islands, and diverse vegetation. It's a natural migration route, while also a bountiful home for a wide number of species. And it's the heart of the Selinda Concession. So even after nine or ten days of safari, you'll keep seeing new sights. Just like in Vumbura, the private concession enables you to create a flexible itinerary, with private game walks and drives in the day and night. Epic predator-prey encounters play out, particularly between lion prides and buffalo. The lions attack but the herd responds, charging in unison, their rumbling hooves scaring off the hunters. Resident leopards provide daily delight while two wild dog packs chase down large herds of zebra. Elephant calves are everywhere, swinging their trunks as they surround the safari vehicle with charm. Sometimes it's hard to keep track, with so many giants in a relatively compact area. Safari here also provides a contrast to your other Okavango stops as you can head deep into vast woodland. The thrills increase as the visibility decreases. Sounds echo through the trees and then you turn a corner to find their origin: a 50-strong elephant herd bashing their rumps against the trunks, trying to dislodge the fruit."
