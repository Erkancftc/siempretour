    "generalInfo": "Ethiopia is one of the world's hotspots of endemism; meaning that a high percentage of wildlife that is found in the country is only found in this country. This is because of its highland terrain and rugged landscape isolating the animals from other parts of Africa; this tour focuses on the rare and endemic mammals of Ethiopia. So just specialist guides and visit some of the seldom visited and incredible wildlife destinations off the beaten track.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of specific mammal watching trips. These specialist mammal watching tours focus on rare and endemic species of mammals, as well as other wildlife in the area. <br/>There are not the huge numbers of large mammals to be found here as in other parts of Africa, but the species that do live here are cleverly adapted to their unique surroundings and very special indeed. The highlights of this tour will undoubtedly be the wonderful long-haired Gelada Baboons with their red 'hearts', the beautifully coloured Ethiopian Wolf and the strange but endearing Giant Mole Rat! <br/>All of these and several other mammals found nowhere else but Ethiopia, will be viewed on this tour, along with general natural history, cultural and birdwatching attractions.<br/>The scenery of the country is also stunning, there are masses of lakes surrounded by mountainous peaks, dusty valleys dotted with acacia trees and pretty little thatched huts in well kept villages. The people of this country are proud and happy and for the most part self sufficient. Traditionally decorated ponies and their riders will be seen throughout the moorlands, plus donkeys carrying their mixed cargo all round the country, together providing an interesting cultural backdrop to a week of viewing most of the countries endemic mammal species and some birdwatching. <br/>The culture of Ethiopia is as unique as well as the wildlife and this tour will aim to showcase both and give a real insight into the real Ethiopia. Because the wildlife watching destinations in Ethiopia are widely dispersed in the country, there is quite a bit of travelling from site to site. This is the only way of doing this tour however. And whilst most itineraries only focus on either the Bale Mountains or the Simien Mountains I have included both into this itinerary as well as including the other best wildlife watching destinations in Ethiopia. This will give you increased time with Gelada baboons, more chance of seeing Ethiopian wolves well and also visiting the only place where the last 200 or so Walia ibex live.<br/>throughout the trip you will be guided by expert naturalist guides, people with an intimate knowledge of the wildlife and habitats you will be visiting. <br/>Whilst the route is well established to visit all of the locations that are best for the targeted species, this trip is also tailorable as there are other wildlife locations in Ethiopia, as well as cultural attractions that we can also add into this itinerary. <br/>All you have to do is to get in touch with your budget and your group size and where you would like to go and we will come back to you with an itinerary and quote for your perfect Ethiopian mammal watching tour.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Addis Ababa. There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Ethiopia. Your naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, cruises, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the Ethiopian countryside. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>The best time to visit the Ethiopian Highlands for mammals is the Northern Hemisphere winter (November - March). <br/>This is the dry season and the temperatures are around 25C on averages with highs of around 30C. There is very little rain during this period and many hours of sunlight every day.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it.<br/>• We will stay in a variety of accommodation when on this tour, from quaint boutique style guest houses, to more familiar African safari lodges.<br/>• Spend all the daylight hours searching for wildlife, either at the specific wildlife locations or driving / hiking around looking for more wildlife.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our photography tour of Ethiopian Endemic Mammals tour a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Ethiopia so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the Ethiopian wolves, Gelada baboons, Hamadryas baboons, Mountain nyalas, Walia ibex, Bale monkeys and many more species. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Ethiopia at other times of year and focusing on other aspects of this wonderful country such as the different tribal peoples and stone churches. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour visit various locations in Ethiopia, we focus mostly in the highlands and the large high altitude grasslands of Awash National Park and the Bale &amp; Simien Mountains.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from a vehicle or whilst hiking around the grasslands. These are relatively and last around 1-2 hours with regular breaks in between. <br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 Years Old",
