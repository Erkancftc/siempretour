    "placesVisited": "See wild orangutans, gibbons and proboscis monkeys, Tanjung Puting National Park, central Kalimantan, Stay aboard a klotok river boat, Visit orangutan research facility at Camp Leakey, Spend a day helping at a reforestation project, Tour Komodo National Park on a private liveaboard boat, See thousands of bats on a sunset boat ride, Join a park ranger to learn about Komodo dragons, Rinca village visit, Padar Island hike, Snorkel off Pink Beach, Swim with manta rays",
    "generalInfo": "This wildlife watching holiday across Indonesia’s Tanjung Puting National Park and Komodo National Park is absolutely thrilling, packed with memorable animal encounters and immersing you in the natural world. Join a fully escorted small group as you travel from Kalimantan to Komodo via Bali, to see orangutans, Komodo dragons, bats, manta rays and more. <br/><br/>Indonesian Kalimantan is the larger, wilder portion of Borneo. Its forests have been depleted by logging and palm oil plantations, putting wildlife such as orangutans and probiscis monkeys at risk of extinction. Our holiday makes a financial donation to an organisation fighting deforestation and poaching, and you’ll be able to spend a day volunteering at a reforestation project. <br/><br/>Spend two nights in Tanjung Puting on a traditional riverboat known as a klotok. The amenities are basic but comfortable, and if you choose you can sleep on deck surrounded by the sounds of the rainforest. You’ll enjoy multiple opportunities to see wild orangutans as they swing down from the trees to their feeding stations – and just your presence here as tourists proves to authorities that there is value in protecting this endangered habitat.<br/><br/>Next, fly via Bali to Labuan Bajo where you’ll board a private boat to spend a few days touring the legendary Komodo National Park. Walk with a park ranger to learn about the giant lizards that call this place home. You’ll also share a meal with a local family here, finding out about how they manage life in close proximity to these fearsome creatures. Other absorbing experiences during this portion of your trip include the chance to snorkel with manta rays, and watch as thousands of bats swoop into the evening sky to feed. If you’re a wildlife lover, Indonesia will captivate you.<br/>",

    "tourName": "Indonesia wildlife holiday, mammals of Java",
    "placesVisited": "",
    "generalInfo": "Indonesia is the world's largest archipelago and with over 20,000 islands the country is full of life, many of the species are endemic to Indonesia and many still endemic to an island within Indonesia. This trip focuses on one of the largest islands in Indonesia. In fact it is the most populated island in the world; Java. As a result of booming human population there is a not extensive wilderness areas left on the island, but there are still many places were a large diversity of wildlife can be seen. This tour takes you to some of these locations as we go in search of some of Java's endemic mammals.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>Java is also home to many endemic species of mammals and like many parts of South East Asia the forests and other protected areas here are under huge pressure from increasing human populations. This is not a good combination and we aim to showcase some of the lesser visited forests on Java to increase eco-tourism and try and provide a means for these species and forests to be protected. <br/><br/>This trip is run in conjunction with our popular and unique Javan Rhino Expedition, combining these two trips can result (with a little good luck) in a 2 week trip that could produce all of the endemic mammals of the island. Our Javan rhino tour will focus on the rhino obviously and will be based solely in Ujong Kulon National Park. Our Endemic Mammals of Java tour is run at the start and finish of the Javan Rhino tour and so are easily combined. This trip will explore forests in and around two other national parks, the mountainous and rugged Gunung Gede Pangrango National Park. Here many of the species we are targeting are present. We also have some other locations nearby for other animals which may prove a little hard inside the thickly forested park (such as the Javan slow loris), so we remain flexible on this trip so we can move from location to location and get to the best and most reliable locations for the endemic mammals based on recent movements. <br/><br/>This is a short extension trip that focuses on the wonderful and endemic species to Java, these include the Javan lutung, Javan gibbon, Javan warty-pig, Javan slow loris, Javan small-toothed civet, Javan mongoose, Javan ferret-badger, Javan treeshrew and Grizzled leaf monkey. Of course we cannot guarantee any or all of these species but we will do our very best to get all of them and other species<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Jakarta. There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Java and other parts of Indonesia. Your naturalist escort is an expert in mammals including their conservation and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. <br/><br/>The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, river safaris, spotlighting, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the park. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>We visit Java on this tour during the dry season months of June and July. This increases our chances of seeing targeted species. This trip has scheduled dates for the start and end of our Javan Rhino Expedition tour which can be added onto this tour as a extension easily.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• Our local Indonesian guides in Java have a good relationship with the park officials and because of this we get a heads up when animals are sighted and this can guide us in where to focus and thus increasing our chances of seeing our targeted species. In fact some of the places we will be visiting are community run reserves and only with our local guides are we able to explore them.<br/>• All of the wildlife watching activities are done on your own (or in your own group) with your own private guide only.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our wildlife tours and specialist mammal watching tours of Indonesia a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Indonesia so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the all of the Javan endemic mammals. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Indonesia at other times of year and focusing on other species such as Javan rhinos, babirusas, cuscuses, orangutans, Asiatic elephants, clouded leopards, manta rays, komodo dragons as well as the range of endemic and wonderful bird species in Indonesia. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour is based solely on the island of Java, Indonesia. But more specifically the western section of Java.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from a vehicle. So no physical fitness for hiking or anything like that is needed. This is a very easy trip to undertake.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 16 Years Old",

    "generalInfo": "‘Here be dragons…’ as quoted on many antique maps when Europeans were describing the unexplored countries and islands of Asia. But it was not all make-believe and fantasy as this phrase probably stems from the tales heard by pirates, buccaneers and early explorers from local people in relation to the large lizards that inhabited the islands of Eastern Indonesia. <br/><br/>We now know these lizards to be Komodo dragons, not fire-breathing but venomous, not winged but social and intelligent and not gigantic but still over 3m long. However the Komodo dragons are not the only giant we will be focusing on during this trip. We will also be visiting some hot spots for the gentle giant of the seas, the wonderful Manta ray. <br/><br/>Snorkelling with these beautiful animals is one of the greatest wildlife experiences you can have. This tour is a great tour on its own or to be combined with a longer tour of Indonesia such as our other wildlife watching holidays of this incredible archipelago.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife tours which focus on some of the world’s rarest wildlife. These trips are specialist and are run more like expeditions than your conventional wildlife holiday. <br/><br/>This particular trip heads to the lesser Sundas which are a group of islands east of Bali in the Indonesian archipelago and include the famous island of Komodo. The dragons of course grab all of the headlines here but there are more species found on these islands but the real wealth of life lies under the surface. <br/><br/>The dry rocky scrub habitat of the islands gives way to rich coral reefs and incredibly diverse marine ecosystems just offshore and this trip combines the best of land based wildlife watching as well as snorkelling around the wonderful Komodo Islands National Park.<br/><br/>Throughout the trip you will be guided by local park rangers and a zoologist guide (where available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us), and people with an intimate knowledge of the wildlife and habitats you will be visiting. For anyone who wants a chance of seeing this incredibly rare species you have to get in touch with us and we can provide more information about our group tour.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned. There will be boiled or bottled water available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable local rangers who have many years of experience working and guiding in Indonesia. Your naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local rangers have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit in order to maximise our chances of seeing all of our targeted species. We also include all park entrance fees and the special permits needed to enter the core area of the park. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us). <br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>The best season is the dry season which runs from May - September, this is also the time of year when the temperatures are lower and more comfortable. The sea temperatures remain constant and between 27-30C throughout the year which is excellent for snorkelling.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local rangers, drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it. <br/>• We will bring some specialist equipment with us to help us find wildlife, including thermal imaging equipment which help find nocturnal mammals.<br/>• Spend as much time as you wish to looking for wildlife throughout the day, with special focus in the early morning and late afternoon as these are the peak activity periods for many mammals - we will also head out after dark for spotlighting at every possible opportunity as many mammals are nocturnal.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our expedition for the endemic mammals of Sulawesi a great success rate in seeing many unique species. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Indonesia so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the Komodo dragons, manta rays and spinner dolphins and other terrestrial and marine wildlife as well as many more species throughout the rest of the Indonesian archipelago. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Indonesia at other times of year and focusing on other species such as orangutans, gibbons, clouded leopards, Javan rhinos, babirusas, birds of paradise and many incredible species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour visits no less than 7 islands of the Indonesian archipelago, with the majority of the trip spend around the Lesser Sundas. Islands such as Bali, Flores, Komodo and Rinca are the main islands with smaller islands such as Sebayur and Kanawa providing the snorkelling locations. The trip will start and end in Jakarta on the island of Java.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The activities on this trip are split between walking (mostly on flat ground) and snorkelling, so being able to swim is essential. <br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 Years Old<br/><br/>Photo Credits:<br/><br/>Siharaditia, CC BY-SA 4.0 <br/>Gordon Flood from Trim, Ireland, CC BY 2.0 <br/>Charles J.

From here you will be met by our local Komodo Islands guide and taken to the harbour, here we will board our boat that we will be travelling, eating and sleeping on for the next couple of days. The boat will then cruise along to Kelor island for your fist snorkeling, after enjoying the beautiful underwater of Kelor island and white beaches, you will be taken to Loh Buaya (Crocodile Bay) Ranger Station in Rinca Island. Once we arrive at Rinca Island we will begin a trek into the heart of the island searching for the legendary and enormous Komodo dragons. Komodo dragons are the largest extant species of lizard and growing up to 3m long they are the top predator on Rinca and the other 5 islands they still inhabit. They once ranged over a larger area but they have been hunted to extinction on all but the 5 islands (Komodo, Rinca, Flores (only small pockets), Gili Motang and Padar) that make up the Komodo Islands National Park. Rinca differs from Komodo Island in being a small island with a small human population, it is less busy and shows you the pristine dry scrub ecosystem that used to cover most of the islands in the Lesser Sunda Archipelago. As well as the iconic Komodo dragons we will also search for water buffalo, wild boar, Timor rusa deer, long-tailed macaques, orange-footed scrubfowl, zebra doves, green imperial pigeons, Javan spitting cobras, Asian bullfrogs and the endemic (to Rinca Island only) Rinca rat. We will explore the island in full today and then in the afternoon we will head to a small nearby island that has a large colony of flying foxes. As the flying foxes begin to leave their roosts to feed the sight is spectacular. There are three species here including Sunda flying fox, Island flying fox and the large flying fox. We will then have dinner on board the boat and sleep offshore. Tomorrow we will explore the iconic island of Komodo where the truly huge dragons can be found. (all meals included)."

The ecosystem of this island and the other Lesser Sundas is significantly different to nearby islands so many of the species found here will not be found in other islands we visit on this tour. We will spend the morning on the island and also visit the ranger station and local villages along the coast, here the dragons have got very used to people and more importantly food that is left for them and it is here that we are most likely to see many dragons together and interacting with each-other. The only other occasions when large numbers of adult Komodo dragons are found together are when they are in the breeding season (which is January) and at a large carcass such as a water buffalo, horse or deer, however these are very rare and hard to come across as they tend to occur deep in the interior of the island. On your return to your boat after hiking around Komodo Island and seeing the plentiful Komodo dragon here you will sail to Sabita Bay near Karang Makassar (Manta Point) for tomorrow’s snorkelling.

    "generalInfo": "This wildlife tour explores some of Indonesia’s most iconic wildlife destinations, first heading to both north and south Sumatra and then onto the famous Komodo National Park. <br/><br/>By visiting the national parks of Gunung Leuser, Way Kambas and Komodo Islands you will experience a wide range of ecosystems, as well as having the chance to see a huge range of wildlife. Many species will be endemic to the islands we see them on. <br/><br/>The first port of call will be the Sumatran orangutan’s last stronghold in the north of Sumatra, Gunung Leuser National Park. Next is a trip around Komodo and Rinca Islands where we go in search of the world’s largest lizard and aptly named Komodo dragon. Your final stop will be to head to the southern tip of Sumatra and to the mammal rich forests of Way Kambas National Park, this is the only place left in Indonesia where rhinos, elephants, tigers, sun bears and tapirs all still coexist. <br/><br/>Add to these species a vast range of smaller mammals and you have one of the world’s most mammal diverse forests. As well as spending most of your time on Sumatra, Komodo and Rinca you will also visit the islands of Java, Flores and Bali making this a great overview of some of Indonesia’s most iconic islands.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife tours which focus on some of the world’s rarest wildlife. These trips are specialist and are run more like expeditions than your conventional wildlife holiday. <br/><br/>This particular trip heads to the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Komodo as well as also visiting Java, Flores, Bali and Rinca along the way. This is a unique trip that aims to showcase a vast range of wildlife known from the amazing island nation of Indonesia including some of its most iconic and world famous such as the Sumatran orangutan and Komodo dragon. <br/><br/>From hiking the steep, dense and wonderful forests of Gunung Leuser in search of orangutans to cruising along the Way Kanan river in Way Kambas checking the river banks for signs of wildlife including the incredibly rare Sumatran rhino and walking among the giant dinosaur like Komodo dragons. This is a unique wildlife watching tour of one of the best wildlife watching destinations in the world.<br/><br/>Throughout the trip you will be guided by local park rangers and a zoologist guide (where available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us), and people with an intimate knowledge of the wildlife and habitats you will be visiting. This is a ground breaking tour that is unique in the world, we have negotiated special rates for the scientific permits that are needed to access the core area of the forest. For anyone who wants a chance of seeing this incredibly rare species you have to get in touch with us and we can provide more information about our group tour.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned. There will be boiled or bottled water available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable local rangers who have many years of experience working and guiding in Sumatra. Your naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local rangers have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit in order to maximise our chances of seeing all of our targeted species. We also include all park entrance fees and the special permits needed to enter the core area of the park. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us). We will also bring thermal imaging equipment to help us find wildlife after dark and go spotlighting as often as the local conditions allow.<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>There are two drier parts of the year when visiting Sumatra for wildlife, the first being December - April and the second being June - September. However rain is expected in nearly every moth of year. so There is no real bad time visit. This is also a good time of year to visit Komodo.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local rangers, drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it. The main wildlife activities on this trip will be early morning and evening trips into the forests as well as spotlighting after dark (in Way Kambas) looking for nocturnal wildlife.<br/>• We will bring some specialist equipment with us to help us find wildlife, including thermal imaging equipment which help find nocturnal mammals.<br/>• Spend as much time as you wish to looking for wildlife throughout the day, with special focus in the early morning and late afternoon as these are the peak activity periods for many mammals - we will also head out after dark for spotlighting at every possible opportunity as many mammals are nocturnal.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our expedition for the wildlife of Sumatra and Komodo a great success rate in seeing many unique species. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Indonesia so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the Sumatran orangutans, Siamang, Sunda leopard cat and banded civets and other endemics on the island as well as many more species throughout the rest of the Indonesian archipelago. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Indonesia at other times of year and focusing on other species such as Javan rhinos, babirusa, cuscus, crested macaques, birds of paradise and many incredible species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour starts and ends in Jakarta on the island of Java as well as visiting Sumatra and in particular the northern and southern parks of Gunung Leuser and Way Kambas and also visiting the Lesser Sundas of Bali, Flores, Komodo and Rinca.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>Whilst most of this trip is done with hiking in the forests you will need to be used to hiking. The terrain in Gunung Leuser can be very steep in places as the park is mountainous.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 Years Old<br/><br/>Photo Credits:<br/><br/>Charles J.

Once we arrive in Medan we will be met by a local driver and transferred inland towards the forests of Gunung Leuser National Park (4.5 hours). Gunung Leuser National Park is a mountainous area of protected forest that is home to the largest population of wild Sumatran orangutans remaining in the world. Over the next 2.5 days we will explore the park and hope to come across some of these orangutans. We have a great chance as the Ketambe Research Station was set up in 1971 (which in 1973 led to the establishment of Bohorok Orangutan Centre) to specifically help protect, rehabilitate and research orangutan. This has lead to numerous orangutans being re-wilded and reintroduced to the forest, for newly introduced individuals food is left on platforms to help supplement their diet. This is also utilised by older orangutans and completely wild (never been hand reared) orangutans also come to take advantage of the free food. The forest is also home to Sumatran rhinos, Sumatran tigers, Asiatic elephants, Sumatran serow, leopard cats, saimangs and sambar deer however most of these species are very elusive here. We will however have a good chance of seeing orangutans, Thomas’s langur, white-handed gibbons, long-tailed macaques, southern pig-tailed macaques as well as a variety of birds, reptiles and insects. This morning we will be driven to our accommodation in the village of Bukit Lawang, since 1987 the Jungle Inn here has welcomed people who wish to explore the forest and whilst the rooms may lack AC they have fans and a great view out over the river and the national park beyond. After settling into the lodge we will have some lunch. You can discuss with your local guide if you wish to have an afternoon hike around the forest here or just rest this afternoon (that is your decision). (breakfast and dinner are included today)."

Once in Labuan Bajo we will be met by our local Komodo Islands guide and taken to the harbour, here we will board our boat that we will be travelling, eating and sleeping on for the next couple of days. Once we arrive at Rinca Island we will begin a trek into the heart of the island searching for the legendary and enormous Komodo dragons. Komodo dragons are the largest extant species of lizard and growing up to 3m long they are the top predator on Rinca and the other 5 islands they still inhabit. They once ranged over a larger area but they have been hunted to extinction on all but the 5 islands (Komodo, Rinca, Flores (only small pockets), Gili Motang and Padar) that make up the Komodo Islands National Park. Rinca differs from Komodo Island in being a small island with a small human population, it is less busy and shows you the pristine dry scrub ecosystem that used to cover most of the islands in the Lesser Sunda Archipelago. As well as the iconic Komodo dragons we will also search for water buffalo, wild boar, Timor rusa deer, long-tailed macaques, orange-footed scrubfowl, zebra doves, green imperial pigeons, Javan spitting cobras, Asian bullfrogs and the endemic (to Rinca Island only) Rinca rat. We will explore the island in full today and then in the afternoon we will head to a small nearby island that has a large colony of flying foxes. As the flying foxes begin to leave their roosts to feed the sight is spectacular. There are three species here including Sunda flying fox, Island flying fox and the large flying fox. We will then have dinner on board the boat and sleep offshore. Tomorrow we will explore the iconic island of Komodo where the truly huge dragons can be found. (all meals included today)."

This boat trip will take round 2.5 hours and we will have lunch on board the boat. We will travel by the boat to Taman Jaya and then land at Laban in the park. Were we will explore once in the park may well vary from what is documented in the next few days and will be dependant on what the local guides and rangers recommend based on their experience and the recent movements of the rhinos. Being an expedition style trip a great amount of flexibility is needed and we will do everything we can to make sure we are in the right place at the right time to try and see one. We will hike south towards Karang Ranjang, searching for signs of the rhinos along the way, we will have the camp close but not too close to where we focus most of our efforts. Todays hike could be around 3 hours long, on arrival at the camp we will set up and settle in with some dinner. If the light is still good and people still have some energy we can take a little walk around. However we recommend that we are up and ready for the morning canoe along the Cikeusik River at dawn (or pre-dawn) so a good nights rest is a good idea tonight. (Lunch will be served en route to the park and then dinner will be prepared by the camp staff)."

These trips are specialist and are run more like expeditions than your conventional wildlife holiday. <br/><br/>This particular trip heads to the far western tip of Java, Indonesia and the forested park of Ujong Kulon. This is the last home of the critically endangered Javan Rhino, which is the rarest large mammal anywhere in the world. <br/><br/>The park is very dense and we will hike from the entrance to a little known river deep inside the park. The rhinos are mostly seen in this river and so most of the wildlife activities will be canoeing silently up and down this river in the early morning and late evening. We head into the park with a team of porters and spend the entire time camping in the forest. <br/><br/>Throughout the trip you will be guided by local park rangers and a zoologist guide (where available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us), and people with an intimate knowledge of the wildlife and habitats you will be visiting. This is a ground breaking tour that is unique in the world, we have negotiated special rates for the scientific permits that are needed to access the core area of the forest. For anyone who wants a chance of seeing this incredibly rare species you have to get in touch with us and we can provide more information about our group tour.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned (all cooked in our camp in the forest). There will be boiled or bottled water available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers and porters to carry our food, camping equipment and personal baggage to and from the campsite and entrance to the park. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable local rangers who have many years of experience working and guiding in Ujong Kulon National Park.

The local rangers have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit in order to maximise our chances of seeing Javan Rhinos. We also include all park entrance fees and the special Simaksi permit needed to enter the core area of the park. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>We focus this trip during the dry season (June – August) each year as this is when the rhinos spend more time around the river and any of their mud wallows are easier to find and more commonly used.<br/>The weather at this time of year will be hot and humid, with temperatures around 22-32oC in the day and night. There should be little rainfall at this time of year, however being a rainforest there is always the chance of rain at any time of year. <br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local rangers, drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it. The main wildlife activities on this trip will be early morning and evening canoe trips up and down a commonly used river by rhinos. We will also have a hide where we can set this up nearby a mud wallow or along a trail and see if a rhino comes by.<br/>• Other than a basic forest guest house on the final day of the trip as we have left the forest and where you can shower and freshen up before the journey back to the city of Jakarta; we will be camping throughout the rest of the trip.<br/>• Spend as much time as you wish to looking for Javan rhinos throughout the day, with special focus in the early morning and late afternoon as these are the peak activity periods for Javan rhinos.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our expedition for Javan Rhinos a great success rate. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Indonesia so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the Javan Rhinos and other endemics on the island as well as many more species throughout the rest of the Indonesian archipelago. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Indonesia at other times of year and focusing on other species such as orangutans, gibbons, clouded leopards, tarsiers, komodo dragons, black macaques and many incredible species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour starts and finishes in Jakarta but the majority of the trip is located inside the core-zone of Ujong Kulon National Park, which is a national park in the far west of Java, Indonesia.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>Whilst the long hike to and from the campsite in the forest will be with porters who will carry the bulk of our food, camping equipment and personal baggage and therefore is not overly strenuous; the temperature and humidity can make hiking hard for people who are not used to walking in the heat. The forest is very thick and the trails are poor or non-existent. We also require some canoeing, which is done at a slow and steady pace along a still and calm river. All in all we would require a reasonable level of fitness but it is not an overly demanding trip.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 Years Old",

For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it. The main wildlife activities on this trip will be early morning and evening trips intoo the forests as well as spotlighting after dark (in Way Kambas) looking for nocturnal wildlife.<br/>• We will bring some specialist equipment with us to help us find wildlife, including thermal imaging equipment which help find nocturnal mammals.<br/>• Spend as much time as you wish to looking for wildlife throughout the day, with special focus in the early morning and late afternoon as these are the peak activity periods for many mammals - we will also head out after dark for spotlighting at every possible opportunity as many mammals are nocturnal.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our expedition for the wildlife of Sumatra a great success rate in seeing many unique species. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Indonesia so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the Sumatran orangutans, Siamang, Sunda leopard cat and banded civets and other endemics on the island as well as many more species throughout the rest of the Indonesian archipelago. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Indonesia at other times of year and focusing on other species such as Javan rhinos, babirusa, cuscus, komodo dragons, birds of paradise and many incredible species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour explores two very different forests in Sumatra. One in the north (Gunung Leuser) and one in the south (Way Kambas). We will arrive and depart from Jakarta.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>Whilst most of this trip is done with hiking in the forests you will need to be used to hiking. The terrain in Gunung Leuser can be very steep in places as the park is mountainous.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 Years Old",

        "description": "Gunung Leuser National Park - Travelling & Wildlife Watching This morning you will leave your hotel and be taken to the airport to catch your flight to the north east of Sumatra. Once we arrive in Medan you will be met by a local driver and transferred inland towards the forests of Gunung Leuser National Park (4.5 hours). Gunung Leuser National Park is a mountainous area of protected forest that is home to the largest population of wild Sumatran orangutans remaining in the world. Over the next 2.5 days we will explore the park and hope to come across some of these orangutans. We have a great chance as the Ketambe Research Station was set up in 1971 (which in 1973 led to the establishment of Bohorok Orangutan Centre) to specifically help protect, rehabilitate and research orangutan. This has lead to numerous orangutans being re-wilded and reintroduced to the forest, for newly introduced individuals food is left on platforms to help supplement their diet. The forest is also home to Sumatran rhinos, Sumatran tigers, Asiatic elephants, Sumatran serow, Sunda leopard cats, saimangs and sambar deer however most of these species are very elusive here. We will however have a good chance of seeing orangutans, Thomas’s langur, white-handed gibbons among other mammals, birds, reptiles and insects. This morning we will be driven to our accommodation in the village of Bukit Lawang after flying into Medan. After settling into the lodge we will have some lunch, either here or at one of the restaurants in the village. In the afternoon you will have your first guided walk through some of the forest here, the mornings are best for orangutans but you may see other primates and many species of birds in the afternoon. (breakfast and dinner included today)."

So today we will have to depart from Gunung Leuser early and catch a flight back to the capital Jakarta. As we cannot guarantee the traffic we will have the night here and then head back to Sumatra tomorrow. On arrival back in Jakarta you will be taken back to the hotel nearby the airport and the rest of the day is free for you to rest. (breakfast is the only meal included today)."

        "description": "Way Kambas National Park - Travelling & Wildlife Watching This morning we will leave the airport and catch your flight to Bandar Lampung in southern Sumatra. We will then be met by a local driver and transported to the accommodation near the park (3-4 hours). Once we arrive at the lodge we will check in and if time allows we will have an afternoon / evening jeep drive. The lodge is located on the outskirts of the Way Kambas National Park that is home to many species of mammals and birds that are on the brink of extinction and this protected forest (1,300km2) is the last stronghold of many, including the Sumatran tiger, Sumatran rhino and Malayan tapir. If we have time to head out this afternoon / evening we will most likely head along the jeep track that connects the lodge to the Rhino Centre, Elephant Sanctuary and Way Batin Bridge. Along the various sections of this road many of the areas rare and elusive mammals and nocturnal birds can be seen. (breakfast and dinner included today)."
