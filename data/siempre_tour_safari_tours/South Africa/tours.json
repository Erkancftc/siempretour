This seven day Big Five safari in South Africa includes both game viewing and conservation activities.

Klaserie provides a sedate bush atmosphere, with personal and friendly service. Here you’ll go on safari in search of the big five, and there will be further opportunity to track leopards with our research team. <br/><br/>We know that it’s important to be able to plan your safari costs and avoid any hidden extras. Where possible we provide an all-inclusive price and any additions to that one off price are clearly shown on your itinerary.<br/>",

Eastgate Airport is the established gateway to the heartland of South Africas wildlife game viewing reserves and has three daytime flights arriving each day from Johannesburg, that are scheduled to assist international visitors to easily connect with Hoedspruit.. Many of our guests prefer us to arrange for their internal flight from Johannesburg to Hoedspruit (50 mins), or alternately for a scenic road transfer (approx 5 hours) which takes the hassle out of arranging the final leg of your journey and is a service that we offer our guests at cost price. Whether you choose to transfer by air or road the price is the same for singles or couples, however a road transfer is more cost effective for a small group or family travelling together. Whichever transfer you prefer you will arrive at Rukiya Safari Camp in time to settle in and rest and relax. Rukiya is a small luxury tented camp within the Wild Rivers Reserve and is a key area for our leopard research team. The camp nestles along the banks of the Blyde River among age old tress, a truly stunning location. Later in thew day, before the sun sets we’ll take a short stroll along the river bank and enjoy a sundowner, returning to the lodge for dinner."

On your first full day on safari we will include our unique bush senses experience. This is an activity that we have developed over many years and has proven to be very popular with our safari guests. In a fun way it encourages you to use all of your senses when in the bush. Not just sight, but also smell, hearing and touch. Some of our senses are dulled by modern living, but this simple and fun exercise quickly hones one’s bush senses, ideal preparation for any safari."

A garden that is filled with natural and cultural highlights, wildlife and wild coasts, wine and a wonderful South African welcome, staying in charming and small, locally owned guesthouses along the way. <br/><br/>After settling in to Port Elizabeth, our first trip to Addo Elephant National Park is one of the finest introductions to South Africa’s incredible wildlife. Just a stone’s throw from the city you can take a game drive to see not only elephants but all of the Big Five. Another great national park exists further west, this time the coastal Tsitsikamma NP where the rugged bays, forests that line them and waterfalls that tumble down through them are worthy of national protection. <br/><br/>As well as the spectacular sandstone cliffs at Knysna Heads, other coastal crowning glories on this Garden Route holiday include Mossel Bay and Hermanus, both famously beautiful beach bliss but also for great for wildlife watching, with whales visible from land here during the migratory season August until November, and sometimes earlier if you are lucky. It is also one of South Africa’s most famous regions for wineries, and tastings of the Garden Route’s most famous produce are a must on this itinerary. <br/><br/>Cape Town is the last port of call on this holiday, with two full days to explore its culture, history and contemporary cool spots too. Sometimes referred to as the Mother City, she proffers an eclectic mix of places to see from the brightly coloured Cape Malay houses to the much more grim reality of Robben Island, now a fascinating museum. There is plenty of beach life too of course where you can watch the sun set over the ocean. And you can take your pick of those, with Cape Point being the end of the peninsula that separates the Indian Ocean from the Atlantic. <br/>",

Our activities in Cape Town will, to some extent, be dictated by the weather as visits to the top of Table Mountain, which has its own micro-climate, are determined by cloud cover and wind. Because of this often-temperamental weather, it is best not to prebook the cable car but to buy tickets on the spot (not included). Those staying in Cape Town post-tour may opt to visit Table Mountain later if the weather looks as though it may improve. There is also the option of visiting Robben Island on one of the days; however, we recommend you prebook Robben Island with us before the trip (but pay the tour leader locally). On one of the days, we head down the Cape Peninsula. We follow the Atlantic Seaboard past the areas of Camps Bay, Llandudno and Hout Bay to the Cape Point via Chapman’s Peak drive, if it is open. The highlight is our visit to the Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve, home to elands, bonteboks, springboks, wildebeest, baboons and ostriches. Rugged cliffs, unspoiled beaches, shipwrecks and beautiful flora are the main features of the reserve. We walk through the reserve for approximately two hours. We first head to the new lighthouse for the panoramic views, before following the pathway to the old lighthouse, which offers spectacular cliff views. Once we leave the park, we stop at the former Royal Navy base at Simon’s Town and visit the resident penguin colony at Boulders Beach.

The animals know there is a structure, but as you are inside, and hidden from their view this is one of the most natural settings to watch them come to drink. Another option for a more adventurous exploration of the bush is to go out on foot with the camp’s guides and learn about tracks, spotting smaller animals like birds, insects and rodents. See the different prints and scat left behind by visitors of the bush and feel the heat, dust and sand while walking through this landscape. Bushwalking is always done in single file, guided by 2 armed rangers and only when they deem the situation safe. If you are an experienced horseback rider, this is also a way to see the bush up close and away from the usual open cars. Lastly, dirt bikes are an option in the dry season to cover some ground: again this will be guided by expert rangers and only when safe.

    "generalInfo": "This is a great opportunity to join up with resident naturalists in South Africa and track down some of the Northern Cape's most elusive species including: aardvarks, aardwolves, bat-eared foxes, pangolins and black-footed cats.<br/><br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching and especially mammal watching safari holidays all over the world. To develop our range of fantastic mammal watching holidays we have spent years searching the world’s best wildlife watching locations as well as visiting some seldom visited areas. As a result we have created some great itineraries with the combined help of our guides, local experts and scientists (who have helped develop the itineraries) studying various rare mammals. <br/><br/>When it comes to wildlife watching there are very few better destinations than South Africa with the lesser-visited Kalahari region, in the northwest, being absolutely no exception.<br/><br/>The Kalahari Desert is one of the largest semi-arid regions in the world and home to a variety of birds and mammals including many of the continent’s rarest species. The region is sectioned into national parks, private reserves and working game ranches. The low density of humans allows for a greater abundance of wildlife and because the land is so arid there is little vegetation to support the huge numbers of large herbivores that dominate South Africa's better known national parks. Without the large herds of antelope, zebra and gazelles there are less large predators which has led to bigger numbers of bizarre and unique species such as: aardvarks, aardwolves, brown hyenas and elephant shrews. <br/><br/>The suggested tour below will be guided by our professional local guides. We also have a great network of local guides in South Africa who have developed a great range of wildlife watching locations where the rarest species are commonly seen. To make the most of our time away we will spend many hours during the early morning and late afternoon on jeep safaris and guided walks. We will also explore after dark with high powered spotlights in order to catch a glimpse of animals that only come out at night. <br/><br/>Best time to visit:<br/><br/>Early August to late October, which is the dry season in the Kalahari, is the best time to go for wildlife watching. Temperatures can get hot however, you will have the best chance of watching wildlife congregating around watering holes as well as less vegetation blocking the view. <br/><br/>Accommodation:<br/><br/>Most of the accommodation that we use are privately owned bed and breakfasts and working ranches that are seldom visited by tourists. Many of these ranches have resident animals which are very hard to see elsewhere. For example we know of a location where a family of aardvarks have been living for some years now and offer an exceptional opportunity to watch this elusive animal in the least intrusive way possible.<br/><br/>Fitness level required:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from 4x4 safari vehicle. We can also include guided walks which can be for as long or as short as you wish; it's entirely up to you.<br/><br/>Minimum age: 18",

So as long as the studies are still on going we will be able to get extra help in finding the unusual ground pangolin. (Breakfast, Lunch & Dinner included)"

    "generalInfo": "Most people travel to South Africa for safaris only visit Kruger National Park, but South Africa has so much more to offer wildlife enthusiasts. This tour explores two of the little known gems of South African wildlife watching. Firstly we will visit the massive Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, being twice the size of Kruger (about the size of Switzerland) it is one of the largest protected areas in the world and home to some of Africa's best wildlife. After the lions, leopards, cheetah, eland and other large mammals of Kgalagadi we will explore some of the Kalahari. <br/><br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching and especially mammal watching safari holidays all over the world. To develop our range of fantastic mammal watching holidays we have spent years searching the world’s best wildlife watching locations as well as visiting some seldom visited areas. As a result we have created some great itineraries with the combined help of our guides, local experts and scientists studying various rare mammals.<br/><br/>When it comes to wildlife watching there are very few better destinations than South Africa with the lesser-visited Kalahari region, in the northwest, being absolutely no exception.<br/><br/>The Kgalagadi Transfrontier National Park is one of the largest wilderness national parks in the world and is home to a variety of birds and mammals including many of the continent’s rarest species. As well as safaris through the park you will also be taken to private reserves in the Kalahari. One of the best reasons the wildlife watching is great here is due to the low density of humans in the whole Kalahari. <br/><br/>The suggested tour below will be guided by our professional zoologist (zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) or expert local guide. We also have a great network of local guides in South Africa who have developed a great range of wildlife watching locations where the rarest species are commonly seen. To make the most of our time away we will spend many hours during the early morning and late afternoon on jeep safaris and guided walks. We will also explore after dark with high powered spotlights in order to catch a glimpse of animals that only come out at night.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary). We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers and game drives. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through South Africa (and elsewhere in Southern Africa). Your naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. Whilst the trip involves a lot of camps, these are not pitch your own tent camping camps, instead these are luxury tented camps where the tents are permanent and you do not need to bring any camping equipment or sleeping bags with you. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the Kalahari wilderness, night safaris are available in some locations (subject to the local conditions on that day). You will have to speak to your guide on arrival there and book places on these (this is not included). A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist guides as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it. We do our best to include as many wildlife activities as possible in all of our itineraries.<br/>• Depending on budget and interest we have a range of different accommodation packages to offer, from luxury top end lodges, national park safari lodges and mobile-camps which often offer unbelievable wildlife watching deep inside national parks as well as camping. We can also arrange mobile camping safaris of Botswana is very popular and all of your camping gear will be provided.<br/>• Spend all the daylight hours searching for wildlife and visiting various natural wonders and stunning landscapes.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our South Africa wildlife safaris a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Southern Africa so that we can try and find and observe some of the rarer and more elusive species. We have great itineraries and expertise in all Southern African countries (Namibia, South Africa, Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Mozambique) and can arrange trips to find some of the rarer species such as aardvarks, aardwolves, brown hyenas and black-footed cats among other species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Best time to visit:<br/><br/>Early August to late October, which is the dry season in the Kalahari, is the best time to go for wildlife watching. Temperatures can get hot however, you will have the best chance of watching wildlife congregating around watering holes as well as less vegetation blocking the view.<br/><br/>Fitness level required:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from 4x4 safari vehicle. We can also include guided walks which can be for as long or as short as you wish; it's entirely up to you.<br/><br/>Minimum age: 18",

    "generalInfo": "Sample the very best of South Africa and Swaziland on this fully escorted small group tour, as you travel from Johannesburg to Durban through Kruger National Park, Hlane Royal National Park and the wildlife-rich Saint Lucia Estuary. Your itinerary includes a couple of very special experiences: camping with the famous Black Mambas - the world's first all-female anti-poaching unit, and a boat safari with the chance to see hippos and crocodiles, a thrilling alternative to the traditional game drive. <br/><br/>Your first stop is a few days in the legendary Kruger National Park, home to some 150 species of mammal including the Big Five, 100 species of reptile and over 500 species of bird. But your first night here won’t be spent in a lodge or bush camp. Instead, you’ll stay at the HQ of the Black Mambas. This team of 36 young African women helps patrol the Balule Nature Reserve, part of Greater Kruger National Park, and as part of your introduction to their work, they’ll take you on a nighttime bush walk to help remove snares, and perhaps see some nocturnal wildlife. <br/><br/>After a day of game drives in Kruger, you’ll cross into Swaziland, and Hlane Royal National Park. Here you’ll be taken on a game walk with a brilliant Swazi guide to see huge herds of elephants and giraffes, with lions, leopards and hippos also present. After a night camping in the park you have the opportunity to visit a local village, unusual in that it has a female chief, to learn about Swazi culture and perhaps even lend a hand with some of the everyday farming activities.<br/><br/>Cross the border, then, back into South Africa, as your group makes for the Saint Lucia Estuary, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that provides habitat for hundreds of hippos and crocodiles. Two nights of camping here include a thrilling boat safari that offers a very different experience to traditional game drives, and a day trip to Cape Vidal. Depending on the time of year, you might spot migrating humpback whales off the coast, or see loggerhead turtles making the way up the beach to lay their eggs. <br/><br/>Finally reaching Durban, South Africa’s second city, bid farewell to your fellow travellers at this glamorous coastal destination.<br/>",

This 11 day tailor made tour offers a chance to immerse yourself within the landscapes and animals of Kruger National Park.<br/><br/>There is nowhere else better in South Africa for safaris than Kruger National Park. This park was one of the world's first national parks (established in 1898) and is still currently one of the largest, covering over 20,000 km2. <br/><br/>The number of species present in Kruger is mind blowing: 336 trees, 49 fish, 34 amphibians, 114 reptiles, 507 birds and 147 mammals. During this tour we will try and see as many species as possible, concentrating, in the main, on mammals, such as: lions, leopards, cheetahs, elephants, rhinos and hippos, as well as ostriches and Nile crocodiles. Our escort for this tour has experience working in South Africa as well as other national parks around the world. We also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Kruger National Park. We also make the most of the expert guides that work for the park and head out on guided sunrise and sunset walks and spotlighting after dark. Coupled with full days spent driving in a 4x4 safari vehicle, this is the best way to experience Kruger in all its natural glory. <br/><br/>Even though Kruger is open all year there are some seasons that prove better for wildlife watching than others. Summer (Nov – Jan) is the rainy season where water fills the rivers and watering holes, resulting in the bushveld looking lush. Game viewing is sometimes a bit more difficult at this time because the vegetation is dense, making it bit harder to locate and observe wildlife. Towards the end of November and early December, Kruger National Park is filled with newborns, and spotting wildlife with their young is an incredibly rewarding experience. Birding is excellent during this time as the summer migrant birds arrive. However, it can get very hot during the day. The best time for wildlife watching is during the winter and spring (Jul – Oct). The bushveld is more open, allowing for better visibility. The grass is low, the bushes and trees are sparsely leaved and because it is so dry - with no rain - the wildlife migrate towards the water. Water holes, dams and rivers become a hive of activity and you are more likely to spot wildlife in the morning and evening as animals come to drink. The day temperatures in winter are pleasant but it can get quite chilly during the night-time so make sure you pack something warm when going on your afternoon/night game drives.<br/><br/>This tour only visits Kruger National Park but we stay in three very different sections. We will travel in and out of the nearest airport town of Nelspruit.<br/><br/>Recommended Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from the 4x4 safari vehicle so any fitness level can participate. Where guided walks are offered they will be taken at a slow pace and last no longer than an hour or so.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 years old",

In the late afternoon, we'll enter one of Eswatini's best wildlife reserves, Mlilwane Wildlife Sanctuary. This secluded and beautiful sanctuary is a haven of tranquillity, located in a natural bowl beneath the Nyonyane Mountains. For the next two nights, we'll stay in traditional dome-shaped beehive huts set in a wooded area. Though the camp has all the mod cons - showers, toilets, outdoor swimming pool and restaurant and bar - it is rustic in the best sense of the word.

Due to the high demand in Mlilwane, accommodation is subject to change without notice and can vary in style.

There are three departures per day, and the 9am departure is the best option to fit with our itinerary. Alternatively, the morning is also the best time to hike up Table Mountain. The favourable morning weather and temperatures make it a more enjoyable experience and you'll get breathtaking views over the Apostles, the Atlantic and the city below. The walk up to the viewpoint takes between three to four hours. There is also the option to take the aerial cable car to the top, which runs frequently to and from the summit, where a network of trails criss-crosses the plateau and provides a variety of vantage points. While it's possible to visit Robben Island and take the cable car to Table Mountain in the same day, you won't have time to visit Robben Island and hike up Table Mountain. If you'd like to do both, you can book a pre-trip stay to give yourself more time. Please also note that both of these activities are weather-dependent and windy weather may change things. Another option is to take a trip to the Kirstenbosch National Botanical Gardens, which claims to be the most beautiful garden in Africa and is devoted to the conservation of the Cape's indigenous species. Your Tour Leader will be able to give further local advice and recommendations on how to spend your time in Cape Town. Late this afternoon, we'll leave Cape Town and head to the scenic winelands of Stellenbosch where you can relax with a local Chenin Blanc Please note, both Robben Island and Table Mountain are weather-dependent.

Many of the estates feature spectacular gardens and farmland, providing opportunities for lunch and a leisurely stroll. There is also the option to take a guided tour of Stellenbosch Town, a great way to learn about the diverse cultures that have contributed to making Stellenbosch what it is today.

From June to November, Hermanus offers some of the world's best shore-based whale watching, with good opportunities to spot southern right, Bryde's and humpback whales. Although there is a good chance of seeing the whales from the water's edge in town, you may prefer to follow the coastal path to a better vantage point or join a boat trip excursion for a closer view. At other times of the year, you might like to spend the day exploring the galleries and museums in Hermanus, which are easy to discover on foot, or enjoying the coastal views from the 8km walking path that runs right along the cliff edge.

This seemingly empty plain is in fact home to vast numbers of ostrich, and we'll likely spot them in the farms that run alongside Route 62 as we drive. Oudtshoorn is the principal town in the Klein Karoo, which grew in the early 1900s thanks to its rich trade in ostrich feathers. We may have time to have a quick explore of the shops and the small curio museum before driving onto the huge limestone caverns of the Cango Caves. These caves are an underground network of extraordinary structures, millions of years old. The combination of dripping rainwater and limestone has led to the creation of ancient stalactites, stalagmites, and mighty rock columns. Allegedly, a local European farmer first discovered the caves late in the 18th century; however, there is research that proves the caves have been used by man as far back as the early Stone Age.

This small project began in 2018 when a group of locals decided to organise a reef clean up to tackle the threats posed to the reef and native marine wildlife, from discarded fishing tackle. The project has expanded onto the land, and the volunteers now use microplastic collection data from the beach to lobby regional councils about their plastic waste. The walk on the beach is spectacular, and we'll learn not just about the project but also about the surrounding environment.

From July to December there's also the chance to spot the southern right whales that come into the calmer and warmer waters to calve and nurse their young. For those who don't want to undertake the 5.5km loop with the Tour Leader, there is a shorter 2km loop, or you could simply enjoy the fantastic views from the clifftops. After working up an appetite, we'll stop for a well-deserved lunch in Plettenberg Bay. Seafood is a favourite on the menu here - hake, meaty prawns or calamari washed down with a crisp white wine.

        "description": "Arrival at Hoedspruit & Welcome to Rukiya Hoedspruit (Eastgate) Airport is the gateway to South Africa’s premier wildlife viewing reserves, with daily flights arriving from Johannesburg and Cape Town. We can arrange your internal flight to Hoedspruit (approximately 50 minutes). Upon landing, you'll be greeted by your On Track Safaris (OTS) representative and transferred to Rukiya Safari Camp. Keep an eye out as you drive past game fences—your first wildlife sightings may happen before you even unpack! No matter how you arrive, you'll reach Rukiya Safari Camp in time to settle in, unwind, and enjoy the tranquil surroundings. You’ll also receive a reusable On Track Safaris metal water bottle to help reduce plastic use during your stay, along with a spoor card to help identify animal tracks during game drives and bush walks—be sure to keep it handy! Rukiya is a small, luxury eco-tented camp nestled along the banks of the year-round Blyde River, shaded by towering trees. It’s also an important location for our leopard research, making your visit part of a meaningful conservation effort. Depending on your arrival time, lunch will be served, followed by an optional afternoon drive through the Wild Rivers Reserve. Don’t forget to order your sundowner drinks for the perfect end to your first day. At Rukiya, you’ll receive a complimentary camera trap (one per couple or single guest) as a gift from On Track Safaris. On your first day, with guidance from our expert team, you’ll choose a location on the reserve where you believe leopards and other wildlife may pass. These motion-sensitive devices capture photos or short videos of animals—day or night—offering a thrilling glimpse into their natural behaviour. Camera Trap Challenge Capturing Africa’s wildlife with a camera trap is both exciting and deeply rewarding. Begin by selecting a location frequented by animals—such as watering holes, game trails, or mineral licks—where wildlife naturally congregates. While our guides are there to assist, the final choice is yours. Your camera will be securely mounted to a tree or post at animal height and angled slightly downward for optimal shots. Equipped with infrared technology, it operates silently to avoid disturbing nocturnal creatures. The camera will run continuously throughout your stay, capturing candid moments of Africa’s untamed beauty. These will be checked before departing Rukiya. After dinner at the lodge, you’ll likely retire early to your tent, ready for your first early morning rise and the adventures ahead."

        "description": "A Day at Rukiya Safari Camp Your days at Rukiya begin with a gentle wake-up call, accompanied by a warm drink and traditional rusks (local biscuits) to start your morning. You'll then set off on a morning game drive through the Wild Rivers Reserve and into the adjacent Balule Reserve, part of the Greater Kruger National Park. This marks your first adventure in a 'Big5' Reserve. These drives may extend longer than usual, often including a bush breakfast served in the wild, before returning to the lodge in the late morning. Lunch is served at the lodge, followed by time to unwind and take in the tranquil views from your private deck. Bush Senses Experience During your stay, you'll have the chance to participate in our unique Bush Senses activity—a short guided walk paired with a sensory exercise developed over many years. This popular experience encourages you to engage all your senses in the bush: not just sight, but also smell, hearing, and touch. In a world where modern living dulls our natural instincts, this simple and fun activity helps sharpen your awareness—perfect preparation for any safari. Conservation & Camera Trap Check You’ll also be invited to attend a fascinating presentation by the Ingwe Leopard Research Team, offering insight into the vital conservation work happening right on the reserve. In the afternoon, your PM drive will explore the Wild Rivers Reserve, possibly passing by your camera trap to ensure it’s still in place. Curious hyenas and baboons are known to tamper with these devices—sometimes even taking selfies before abandoning them in the bush. The resulting photos are often hilarious and a highlight of the trip. Evening at the Lodge After your afternoon adventure, dinner will be served at the lodge, offering a chance to reflect on the day’s sightings and stories under the African sky."

During your visit, you’ll explore their inspiring projects, meet the women leading change, and see firsthand how small initiatives can make a big impact. To end the visit, we’ll stop by a lively community hub where children gather after school. You’ll have the opportunity to help serve lunch and share in the warmth of their daily routine—a heartwarming experience that connects you to the spirit of the community.

Midday we'll pause for lunch at one of the park's restaurants before continuing our safari in the afternoon, heading towards the Sabie River. This is a major water source for the park's wildlife and an excellent spot for game viewing. After a rewarding day exploring Kruger, we'll leave the park mid-afternoon and climb more than 1,000 metres to our overnight stop at Graskop."

There are also lions, black rhino, cape buffalo (and maybe a leopard that hasn’t been seen for a number of years) so with 4.5 of the Big Five it is a great park. However it has to be the elephants that make this such a special place. We average over 10 elephants every 2 hours of driving around the park, so this frees up time to try and search out some of the smaller and seldom seen animals like meerkat, yellow mongoose, bushbuck, caracal as well as dozens of bird species. Over the next 5 days here you will be able to spend as much time as you wish inside the park, we will aim to be in the park at sunrise until sunset each day and by taking lunch and some snacks we will be able to spend the entire day inside the park if you wish. Each night the park rangers also organise a spotlighting tour of the park, and it is on these spotlighting drives that some of Addo’s most special species can be seen. As well as lions and hyenas being more active and commonly seen during the evenings it is also the only time to see nocturnal animals like springhare, porcupine, bat-eared foxes, striped polecats and aardwolves.

The lagoon is popular with tourists and local residents alike and is home to fishermen, water sports enthusiasts and many birds, including herons, kingfishers, African fish eagles and Knysna warblers. The waterfront hosts a wide choice of excellent restaurants and cafes and there are good shopping opportunities in town.

We'll take a walk along the 12-kilometre/7.4-mile cliff path in the hope of spotting southern right whales in the surrounding waters after their long migration from the Antarctic. There will be free time to either continue whale watching along the coastal paths or spend some time in the town. For departures operating outside of whale watching season, we'll visit the Fernkloof Nature Reserve, a protected area situated above Hermanus with stunning views out over the town and bay. The reserve has recorded over 1,400 species of flora, and over 90 species of birds, as well as resident baboons and dassies along the hiking trails. Our tour leader will guide us along the reserve's red trail through evergreen forest which takes around 90 minutes to complete with a gentle ascent and descent.

After a one-hour drive, we'll make our first stop in the Betty's Bay area where we'll have an included visit to Stony Point Nature Reserve, home to one of the world's largest African Penguin colonies. The reserve sits on the site of a historic whaling station and thanks to its distance from Cape Town offers excellent penguin viewing without the crowds. We'll be able to follow the path over the craggy outcrops, allowing us to see these flightless birds up close without disturbing their habitat. Although humans are not allowed to wander beyond the path, it does not always stop the penguins from joining the trail and setting a slow walking pace! Around lunchtime, we'll arrive in Stellenbosch, where we'll check in to our hotel before enjoying a free afternoon. You may choose to relax in the town, take a walk around the university grounds or maybe visit the museum to learn more about the history of the town. You might like to join a walking food tour to learn about the spices, teas and flavours of South Africa. Alternatively, if you have a taste for South Africa's produce, there's the option to go wine tasting at a local winery. Stellenbosch has a reputation for excellent Chenin Blanc, perfectly matched with seafood, caught fresh from the Indian Ocean that morning. If you are more of a red fan, then expect big earthy reds, a great companion for a sumptuous steak or meat on a braai. There is also the local phenomenon of Pinotage, created in South Africa as a blend of Pinot Noir and Cinsaut, the wine has now achieved global recognition and the best place to try it is here in South Africa."

We can see the towering Table Mountain from miles away, though if the day isn't clear we'll see the cloud rolling over the top of the precipice - either vision is equally impressive. This afternoon, we'll ascend the iconic Table Mountain by cable car. After a heady ride up to the top, there will be time to explore the network of trails which crisscross the plateau and provide a variety of vantage points over the city, the coastline and the Twelve Apostles Mountain range. In the distance, you can see Robben Island, the former home of Nelson Mandela, South Africa's favourite son and most famous hero. Apart from its obvious geographical attractions, Cape Town is also famous for its food and drink culture, with an abundance of restaurant options, from the trendy downtown to the more touristy but beautiful V&A Waterfront. For our 2025 departures, we'll be using two different hotels in Cape Town, the AHA Harbour Bridge Hotel and the equally beautiful Cresta Grande. Both hotels are located centrally close to both the Waterfront and Greenmarket Square. Please note, the Table Mountain cable car closes for two weeks of maintenance each year, usually around the end of July, and if your tour is impacted the tour leader will propose another activity to replace this."

This trip will also visit Boulders Bay and its resident penguin colony.

You will have the opportunity to explore our home reserve with wildlife conservationists, too, and there is of course plenty of time for relaxation and enjoying the African bush. <br/><br/>The safari itinerary shown below has been developed and honed over many years, in keeping with our company ethos and taking into account feedback from our safari guests. It includes all the elements we believe an African safari should have, and continues to delight guests, who regularly leave five star reviews! We can also offer exclusive tailored safari itineraries to suit your personal needs and preferences – just let us know.<br/><br/>We understand how important it is to be able to plan your safari costs before you arrive and avoid any hidden extras.

This is the point when you can put all you have learnt so far into action. Guided by the Ingwe team you are able to consider and select places along game trails that you feel are likely spots to photograph the local leopards as they roam during the forthcoming nights. Leopard movement and territorial behaviour changes almost on a daily basis and is dependent on many factors, making this a fascinating and fun exercise and rightfully invites you to feel and become part of the Ingwe team.

Pick up your hire car in Johannesburg and drive north for three and a half hours to Welgevonden Game Reserve, your first safari port of call. As with many places on this itinerary, you can choose from villas, chalets or tented camps as a place to stay, but we also recommend you spend three nights here in order to gain maximum enjoyment from the Big Five game viewing experiences. <br/><br/>The cultural heritage of the Limpopo Province is also a feature of this holiday, and we try to incorporate as many experiences as possible such as visits to galleries, artisans, local cafes and community run enterprises. Your next stop in the Soutpansberg Mountains is ideal for this, home to the Venda and Tsonga people with a fascinating heritage. <br/><br/>The heritage of the ancient San people is also a feature of your next stop, staying at a bush lodge near Mapungubwe National Park, a World Heritage Site bestrewn with rock paintings and artefacts of San Bushmen and Iron Age Bantu. As with everywhere in Limpopo there are also dramatically beautiful landscapes all around, with more to follow at Leshiba Wilderness game where you can go on a walking safari to see giraffe, zebra and wildebeest, to name but a few. <br/><br/>These are just a few ideas for your trip to Limpopo, with the suggested itinerary below, but we can tweak this to suit your budget and timeframe. <br/>",

We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the Kalahari wilderness, night safaris are available in some locations (subject to the local conditions on that day). You will have to speak to your guide on arrival there and book places on these (this is not included). A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced zoologist (where available- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) or naturalist guides as well as local drivers, boat skippers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it. We do our best to include as many wildlife activities as possible in all of our itineraries.<br/>• Depending on budget and interest we have a range of different accommodation packages to offer, from luxury top end lodges, national park safari lodges and mobile-camps which often offer unbelievable wildlife watching deep inside national parks as well as camping. We can also arrange mobile camping safaris of Botswana is very popular and all of your camping gear will be provided.<br/>• Spend all the daylight hours searching for wildlife and visiting various natural wonders and stunning landscapes.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our South Africa wildlife safaris a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Southern Africa so that we can try and find and observe some of the rarer and more elusive species. We have great itineraries and expertise in all Southern African countries (Namibia, South Africa, Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Mozambique) and can arrange trips to find some of the rarer species such as aardvarks, aardwolves, brown hyenas and black-footed cats among other species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Best time to visit:<br/><br/>The southern Hemisphere winter is best, July - October. This tour is best in the southern Hemisphere winter into the southern spring. This is when the weather is at its most comfortable for us to visit and the seas around the Cape of Good of Hope are calm enough to allow pelagic birding trips as well as whale watching excursions too. As for the Kalahari early August to late October is the dry season in the Kalahari, is the best time to go for wildlife watching. <br/><br/>Fitness level required:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from 4x4 safari vehicle or from boats and there is very little physically demanding activities needed. There are some guided walks, but they are usually along flat trails and no longer than 1 hour.<br/><br/>Minimum age: 18",

        "description": "Cape Town & False Bay - Arrival & Wildlife Watching On arrival in Cape Town airport you will be collected by your guide and taken south towards False Bay. The drive will take you past a section of the Table Mountain National Park and as well as having views of the iconic Table Mountain (if the skies are clear) as it usually has the ‘table-cloth’ on it during the afternoons; you could see Cape mountain zebra and black wildebeest grazing on the national parks grasslands, just on the side of the highway. Heading past the city you will start to see the sea, this is False Bay, the home of the famous ‘jumping’ sharks. The bay is the largest in South Africa and is fringed by Aghalus Point on the east side (Africa’s most southerly point) and Cape Point on the west side. It is Cape Point and the notorious Cape of Good Hope that took many lives in the colonial era and up until today (the famous Skeleton Coast of Namibia is just north of here and responsible for shipwrecks even today). When we descend towards the bay we will see some of the small communities that are dotted along the coast of False Bay. Fishoek, Muizenberg, Kommeije and Simonstown are the main ones. They were all once small fishing villages that are now hotspots for the rich and glamorous to live (such as Simonstown and Kommeije) or are thriving backpacker and surfer towns such as Fishoek and Muizenberg. We will head to Simonstown, this is the largest harbour in the bay and also home to the largest South African naval base, which when you see the small size of it makes you realise that the South African navy is not a global force. The town is base of our cage diving operations and also the most picturesque and conveniently located for many excursions to sites around Cape Town and Cape Point. After checking in the rest of the day will be free to rest and relax. (no meals are included today)"

        "description": "False Bay & Surrounds - Wildlife Watching & Sightseeing Our activities for the next week or so are heavily dependent on the weather, unfortunately the best time to see the hunting great white sharks is also the winter. Whilst rare it is not unheard for storms to come through the Cape and disrupt the shark boats for a day. However you will receive a full refund for the any boat trips that doesn’t head out due to the weather and with a week dedicated to this and 10 different trips on the boat planned we should have plenty of time on the boat and get the photographs of the breaching sharks we are after. So the order of the activities listed here may vary depending on the weather, but the activities mentioned (other than the shark trips) will all be done as they are less weather dependent and we will be able to do them. Even if they are not done in the exact order mentioned. So scheduled for today is a morning trip to Seal Island and its resident 64,000 Cape fur seals and their 100 or so toothy neighbours. We will meet the crew at 7:00am sharp, they can and will leave without us if we are late because the best breaching and predation events occur at first light. The island is located around 7km offshore and on a very clear day it is just visible from shore. It takes around 45 minutes to get to the island and the sunrise over the bay is spectacular. Along the way it is possible to see southern right whales, pods of dolphins (dusky dolphins, common bottlenose dolphins, short-beaked common dolphins as well as (rarely) orca (we will be praying not to see orca as they are the only predator of great white sharks and when they have been seen around here and other aggregation sites around the world the sharks disappear for a few days to avoid them)), as well as African penguins and of course the seals. The bird life around the bay is also spectacular with Cape gulls, kelp gulls, Hartlaub’s gulls, sooty shearwaters, various petrels, cormorants and the occasional albatross all possibly sighted. This morning will be visiting the island. Once we reach the island we will first of all scan the waters and particularly the ‘gauntlet’ which is a narrow channel under the water which is used by the sharks to launch most of their vertical ambushes. Whilst predations occur all around the island and up to around 100m offshore from the island, most occur just off the southern tip. This is where the underwater topography is perfect for ambushes and the seals seem to aggregate before heading off to the deeper water. At first we just watch the natural predations and try our best to predict which of the many seals will be targeted. As the sun rises the amount of attacks decreases, with the sun higher in the sky the seals can see deeper and so can spot the sharks below easier. At this point (when conditions are good) we will tow a decoy seal behind the boat. This entices the sharks to launch a breach attack on the decoy and as you only have one target to focus on you have a much higher chance of capturing a breach with your camera. This is the best and possibly only place in the world where great white sharks can be seen easily without getting in the water and without the need to use bait and chum. We will be out at the island for the morning and then we will return to the harbour and to the guest house to freshen shower and change. Afterwards we will head around the point to Cape Point National Park, the drive into the park will take us around some of the point and the views are just spectacular. Chacma baboons are not uncommon along the way and once we enter the park we will be in the Fynbos, this is one of the 5 floral kingdoms in the world and when you consider some of the floral kingdoms are Paleo-Arctic-temperate-deciduous forest and span the entire world, the fact that the western cape of South Africa has one of its own you realise the importance of this ecosystem. Unfortunately during the winter the fynbos will not be flowering but the wildlife here will still be around. Inside the coastal park we could see ostrich, Cape Mountain zebra, eland, endemic bontebok, rhebok, chacma baboons as well as wealth of bird life. We will go to the visitor centre today and have lunch here before heading up to the Cape Point lighthouse. We will also explore some of the park and get out and walk through the Fynbos and visit some beaches, the endemic bontebok are beautiful and usually found around the beaches, there are also a couple of beaches where spotted-gully sharks can be spotted from the beach if we are lucky. After spending the afternoon here we will head back to Simonstown and have dinner. (breakfast is the only meal included today)."

        "description": "False Bay & Surrounds - Wildlife Watching & Sightseeing This morning we will all depart for Seal Island like yesterday and the routine on the boat will be the same as described above. On our return to Simonstown today we will have lunch in the town and then head the short distance to the largest African penguin colony in the world and also possibly the most accessible penguin colony (of any species) in the world. You will start to see penguins as we drive into the car park and even before we get into the official entrance you could have seen dozens of the little critters. The walk bold as brass right past people and between the cars, they seem to be completely oblivious to the presence of people and vehicles. These traits make them very good photography subjects as they will allow you to get as close as you wish but bad when they try and cross roads and several of killed on the roads every year. We will spend an afternoon with these adorable little birds, they will be nesting at this time of year and so you can observe the male and female mating rituals and little beak slapping dances they perform when they greet each other from another fishing excursion. They also tussle with each other; each penguin is after the perfect next burrow and the best vegetation to line their burrow with. This causes a conflict that are usually decided by who brays the loudest, in fact the noise can be so loud that it is clear where they get their other common name from, the Jackass penguin. As we explore the colony you will also see some penguins coming back to shore from a day fishing as well as many playing in the surf zone, they are predated on by dolphins, seals and of course the multitude of sharks in the bay including the great whites too. Also living around the colony are rock hyraxes, they can be seen around Cape Point too but they are very easy subjects here as they are very used to people. Afterwards we will have a relaxing evening with dinner at a restaurant in Simonstown. (breakfast is the only meal included today)"

Once we get back to Simonstown we will change and freshen up before travelling into the city of Cape Town, we will not go deep into the city centre but instead to the most iconic feature of South Africa’s most beautiful city, Table Mountain. We will drive half way up and then take a cable car to the summit. We will pray for good weather and a clear summit, however it is very common for the ‘table cloth’ to be on the mountain. This may sound quaint but it is a cloud, however even if the views from the top are not fantastic the landscape on the top is well worth going to see. The cable car will take us to the top and from here we will have an explore of the strange rock formations and also if the weather permits enjoy the great views out over the city and to the old penal colony of Robben Island. There is some wildlife here too, Cape grass birds, Cape Sugar birds, southern rock agamas, plated lizards and possibly klipspringers can all be seen on the top of the mountain.

This afternoon we will have a trip over to the island, this was the prison where many black activists were incarcerated during apartheid. This is not a wildlife excursion (although African penguins and introduced springbok can be easily seen on the island), but it is not possible to understand South Africa without understanding what happened on this island and what it was like for people during the apartheid era. Your guides around the island will be former prisoners who lived here, this allows for a wonderful insight into what life was really like here. You will get told about the history of the island and also visit the prison (seeing Nelson Mandela’s actual cell and belongs as they were when we was here) and the limestone mines where many of the prisoners worked until they dropped and went blind with the glare of the sun reflected back from the white rocks.

The drive will only take around 2 hours and once we arrive we will check into the accommodation and have some lunch in one of the nearby resturants. Hermanus is an old colonial town that is now one of the most picturesque bay towns in Africa, it is also the premier land-based whale watching destination in the world and after lunch we will go and see if we can see of the southern right whales that entire the bay in June. They spend the Austral winter here, which is far warmer than their usual home in the Antarctic waters furthe south. They come here to rest, mate, calve and rear their young so there is a chance you can see some incredible behaviour whilst here. Sometimes the whales can be seen only a few meters away from the cliffs. So it is the cliffs that stretch from once side of the town to the other that will be our destination this afternoon and we hope that the whales are cooperative. We will have dinner in another restauant and relax before another morning on the water tomorrow. (breakfast is the only meal included on this day)"

Once we return to the harbour we will have lunch and then head to Stanford (around 25 minutes from Hermanus) and here we will have a private Cessna flight out over the bay. This will be one hour and we hope to see the bay, surrounding countryside and the whales in a completely new way. The aircraft is perfectly set up for photographers with a removable door offering unobstructed views from a stable, smooth platform. I hope that you will be the first amongst your group of photographer friends to get aerial whale photographs of this kind.

Tonight's three-course barbeque will be traditionally cooked over hot coals, so you can enjoy the delicious smells of your dinner in the open air, while you stargaze under the African sky."

This is an activity that we have developed over many years and has proven to be very popular with our safari guests. In a fun way it encourages you to use all of your senses when in the bush. Not just sight, but also smell, hearing and touch. Some of our senses are dulled by modern living, but this simple and fun exercise quickly hones one’s bush senses, ideal preparation for any safari. We also encourage our guests to download our leopard research App and become a citizen scientist by using the App while on game drive to help monitor Leopard movement. Territorial behaviour changes almost on a daily basis and is dependent on many factors, making this a fascinating and fun exercise and rightfully invites you to feel and become part of the Ingwe team should you wish."

    "generalInfo": "Explore the terrestrial and marine ecosystems north, south and east of Cape Town and come face to face with whales, dolphins, albatross, black rhinos, baboons and even the once extinct quagga on our Western Cape Safari.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/><br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife tours in Southern Africa which combine various different wildlife events. In order to develop our unrivalled range of combined wildlife watching holidays, our guides and colleagues around the world have spent years searching out the world’s best wildlife watching locations as well as visiting some seldom visited areas. This dedication has led us to create this wonderful tour that explores the incredible and diverse ecosystems of the Western Cape of South Africa. Anyone interested in the natural world will no doubt know that there are very few better destinations than South Africa. This tour focuses around the beautiful city of Cape Town and you will pretty much be in the shadow of Table Mountain throughout most of the tour. Using Cape Town as a base for the first few days we will head out to sea and explore the marine ecosystems around False Bay and the Cape of Good Hope. Here southern right whales, cape fur seals, African penguins, dusky dolphins, great white sharks, dozens of marine bird species and possibly humpback whales and orcas reside. But we do not end there as you will also explore the Table Mountain National Park where the unique fynbos floral kingdom in home to many endemic birds, baboons, ostriches and antelopes such as eland. We also head inland to Karoo National Park where the once extinct quagga is being bred back to life and coupled with black rhinos, aardvarks and other arid zone creatures are our main targets. But just as we started at sea we end at sea by heading to Gaansbai where whale watching is once again on the agenda. All of our tours are guided by our own professional zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) so you are sure to be in the best hands possible for the best sightings. Our escort for this tour has experience working on a in South Africa as well as working on various studies marine life around the world. We also have a great network of local guides in South Africa who have developed a great range of wildlife watching locations where the rarest species are commonly seen. Also to try and make sure that we will see as many of the rarer and elusive animals when in Karoo National Park we will spend many hours during the early morning and late afternoon on jeep safaris and also after dark each night we will head out with high powered spotlights and start the search for nocturnal species. One of the reasons why our wildlife watching holidays are unique is that our background (as a company) is from a scientific and zoological standpoint and so have a great network of colleagues and contacts all over the world who are the people on the front line in search of the best new locations for wildlife watching. All of these reasons and many more make us experts in arranging safaris and are able to tailor a safari to any location to try to find your targeted species.

If your flight arrives in the morning we should have time for some sightseeing after you have been transferred to our accommodation in Simonstown. Simonstown is a beautiful little harbour town situated on the south side of Cape Town and is nestled between False Bay and Cape Point National Park. On the drive from the airport there is a chance of spotting black wildebeest, Cape mountain zebra, eland and grey rhebok as the motorway flanks the national park boundaries. Once we have checked in and grabbed some lunch (depending on the time) we will head out to Simonstown’s number one attraction. Boulders Beach National Park. This is one of the smallest national parks in all of Africa but it is home to a huge population of African penguins. They nest here and the beaches and pathways get you really close to the birds as they fearlessly waddle right up to you and seem more interested in you than you are in them! In addition to the penguins there are plenty of rock hyraxes or dassies here. They are the closest living relatives to elephants but you have to look hard to see why as they look more like guinea-pigs. We can stay here as long as you like and afterwards we can either go back to the accommodation so you can rest or drive around the bay and take in some of the sites, including a view of Table Mountain in the distance. Our evening meal will be back at the accommodation. (Lunch and or Dinner included (depending on the time of arrival))."

Karoo National Park is isolated park and is mostly semi-desert but boasting more tortoise species than any other park in South Africa and recently playing home to the re-birth of the quagga, Karoo really is more than just semi-desert. In fact we have a good chance of finding black rhino, cape buffalo, red hartebeest, black wildebeest, kudu and both the Cape Mountain zebra and the quagga-like-Burchells zebra. The quagga project has bred the Burchells zebra to havce quagga like characteristics and as the quagga was only a subspecies of the Burchells zebra it is not as farfetched as it may sound to bring the quagga back from extinction; and if we are lucky enough to see one you will agree they look pretty convincing. On arrival we will check into our accommodation, level - cottages / chalets (national park main camp) and get ready for a night drive with a national park warden. The spotlighting drives are the best and usually only way to see some really remarkable animals like aardvarks, aardwolfs, bat-eadred foxes, African crested porcupines, striped polecats and African wild cats.

It's a prime destination for a first-time safari, able to showcase the diversity of African game while providing many intimate moments with nature's biggest and more impressive. Weaving through Kruger, you enjoy your first game drive. Turn a corner and a springbok herd skips across the dusty savannah. Follow the trail and white rhinos stand with enchantment; dotted along the sand are the tracks of a leopard. Next, you cruise through Kruger towards Sabi Sands Game Reserve, a private concession that borders the national park. Now the safari becomes more intimate. All the famous mammals are found in the Sabi Sands, but they share a compact area, arriving to enjoy the bounty of the Sabi and Sands rivers. Lions rest beneath the shade of branches, kudu and eland cluster in large herds, baboons are scattered above the trails, while a rustling amongst the green reveals a hiding cheetah. Now some elephants, a whole herd that trumpets its route to the river, then veers clear of where the hippos wallow in the mud. And of course, the rhinos, Africa's legendary endangered species, are found in wonderful abundance. Over these two days, you enjoy luxurious game drives in an open-sided vehicle, heading out in the cooler hours of morning and afternoon to experience African safari in all its wonder. On both days, you also have the opportunity for a nighttime drive. Open your ears to the sounds, feel the redolence of the savannah, and then turn on the spotlight to find great herds just meters from your vehicle. Yet for all the drama, and for all the moments of discovery out in the bush, safari in Sabi Sands is a relaxed experience. Hippos wander across the grass beside the river, giraffes raise their necks along the horizon, and large zebra herds gather in open clearings. All this is seen from the room of your lodge, nature's greats congregating on the plains as you tuck into lunch or lounge on the verandah. And when nighttime rolls around, the sounds keep you company, Africa's eternal tones echoing throughout the dark. It's not merely the mix of wildlife that makes this a premier destination for a first-time safari. It's the chance to fully immerse yourself in the unmistakable tones of Africa."

Today you go on a horse-riding safari through Mlilwane, trotting alongside the zebra and cantering past large herds of kudu and impala. Giraffe and buffalo stop their grazing to say hello while there's always hippos lounging in the lake. This experience can also be switched or complemented with a walking safari or bicycle safari. In the mid-afternoon, you will also head out to a traditional healer, or witch doctor as the West might call him. Feel his mysterious presence, openly discuss his life, and admire the sense of spirituality that pervades throughout his hut."

Beaches lie mostly empty, framed by the odd palm tree and the grunts of hippos. St. Lucia looks like a quintessential version of a postcard paradise. But its backdrop is a maze of waterways of thick forest, home to mass numbers of hippos and various monkey species. So the safari doesn't stop, even if you're slumbering on the beach. After the drive, the afternoon is free to lounge amongst nature or explore the small coastal town of St. Lucia, with your accommodation at the sublime luxury lodge."

Lions chase impalas; cheetahs hide in the high grass while sharp eyes pick out leopards as they lounge in the trees. With its rolling red roads and distinct habitats, Hluhluwe-Umfolozi exudes the sense of old Africa. You spend the safari day in the park, venturing on a long game drive that breaks for a picnic lunch beside a hippo pool.

Youngsters grunt and fight for prime wading space while baboons gaze down on the odd hippo charging out of the water. Then you cruise past and the calm returns. Silence reigns, but it's a silence that's filled with the distant sounds of nature: tropical birds tweet, a distant monkey call echoes, and a paddle softly enters the water. From the estuary, you can continue the safari by crossing the first waves and searching for dolphins in the ocean. Excellent snorkeling can also be found here, and this can be arranged during the day."

Liberally dappled around the landscape is Africa's greatest concentration of rock art, some 40,000 pieces of bushmen work filling caves and rocks. Dozens of hiking trails take you beneath the Amphitheatre or onto its summit, including one to the world's second highest waterfall – Tugela. The Drakensberg can be as active or as relaxed as you want it to be and the guide will tailor the daily itineraries to your interests.

The city’s recent popularity now means that these destinations have become crowded, nor reflective of Cape Town’s changing culture and atmosphere. Today’s guided, Cape Town tour will take you beyond the famous stops, focusing instead on how the city is changing after apartheid. Take an art-based walking tour through District Six, which is where you will see how graffiti is being used to both transform and protest the neighborhood’s regeneration. Learn about this neighborhood’s harrowing history at the District Six Museum before continuing the tour in Woodstock and Observatory. These two neighborhoods were gray areas during apartheid, so they have always been the most multicultural parts of Cape Town. They have transformed into quirky, creative, and engaging places to be. Now, they are reflective of a modern, changing South Africa. You can explore the trendy, black-owned boutiques, discover the city’s coffee culture, visit one or two groundbreaking breweries, and find that almost every street is dominated by graffiti. If there is time remaining, you will return to the city and visit Zeitz MOCAA, which is Africa’s most important museum of contemporary art. It reframes definitions of contemporary art and asks why the boundaries should be dictated by Europe and the West."

The wild West Coast remains far from the tourist trail, although, after today’s private tour, you will be wondering why. You will leave the city to bask on a deserted white beach with a sublime view across the bay to Table Mountain. Further up the road, you will make a stop at a San bushman center where an ancient way of life is being preserved. An indigenous San will be your guide, leading you in the basics of the nomadic lifestyle and animal tracking. There is an opportunity to search for zebras, using local San clues before you continue north along the West Coast. Spend the afternoon in Darling, which is a farming settlement of whitewashed houses and old-world charm. Here, you will visit a theater that used satire to challenge apartheid along with a vineyard that will provide a nice introduction before tomorrow’s destination. You will have lunch at Darling Brewery, which is a superb community-based project. After the theater and winery, there are various beaches that you can stop at on the way back to Cape Town.

You will touch down in the wilderness, and a surreal atmosphere will take over. Orchestral trumpets suggest elephants are in the nearby trees, resonant growls may alert you to a resident lion, and baboon troops may battle on a dusty trail, yelping and hooting in an attempt to control territory. Leaving the trees, you may find giraffes and impalas, which are animals that are very common on every Sabi Sands safari. Even when transferring to the camp, you are likely to spot a dozen different mammal species, perhaps even three or four of the famous Big Five. A safari in the Sabi Sands provides luxury, and your lodge is positioned on the Sabi River, which is a popular gathering place for a wide variety of animals. Hippos are the permanent water residents, and they are joined by everything from buffalos to springboks and even leopards. Settling into a private plunge pool, you can watch the animals from a place of indulgence, probably with a glass of wine or cocktail in hand. Then, on an afternoon game drive, you may complete the finish your list of famous sights. With the first day of safaris, the focus is always on the big and famous animals, and for this, there is nowhere better than the Sabi Sands."

There will be an air of exhilaration but also of tension as you share the land with Africa’s giants. An elephant may appear up ahead, and you may hear your own heartbeat as the trackers skillfully lead you away from the path of the herd. Walking slowly, you may pass a zebra herd. Next, you may see buffalo, which are noisy and hairy as they stare straight back at you. With no barrier between you and the animals, it will seem as if time stands still. However, the guides will already know that this is a harem, and encountering them will not be dangerous. Options for walking safaris are really beginning to open up in the Sabi Sands, and the experience will be entirely different from yesterday’s game drive. Nighttime game drives have been part of the Sabi Sands appeal for decades. A leopard may be spotted, and you will watch it prowl for prey. You can pay close attention to the cat’s neck and how it dips with solemn precision as it stalks its prey. Lions are also a good animal to track on a nighttime drive along with other nocturnal creatures that are almost impossible to encounter during the day such as serval cats and mongooses."

Gradually, the acacia trees will come out of the shadows, and you can track the wildlife down below. A hot air balloon will provide a great vantage point onto moving herds, especially the patterns that are made by buffalos and elephants. You can see swathes of the forest where herds have passed along with giraffes that are clustered around their favorite trees. The hot air balloon will touch down deep in the bush where you will be served brunch with sparkling wine. From here, you will bump into South Africa’s most beautiful landscape. There are fewer animals on the Panorama Route, but the vistas are remarkable. Weather-carved pinnacles stand high above a forested valley, and ochre hues meet with lush green. The silence will seem to whistle through your ear, and the solitude can provide eternal memories. Occasionally, you do encounter life, and the animal sightings are heightened in comparison to the Sabi Sands. For example, a lone elephant may appear incredibly small and humble against the enormity of Blyde River Canyon, or a springbok herd may be skipping beneath the most bizarre rock formations. You will be back in the Sabi Sands before sundown, so you can venture on another game drive with the option of staying out after dark."

It offers you luxury and indulgence in a wilderness environment and is home to the classic image of elephants that drink from plunge pools. Exploring Kruger National Park provides you with a different, more adventurous experience. Over these three days, you will make a long, circular journey through the park, heading north and west to parts of the Kruger that receive a lack of visitors. The accommodation will be mixed with one night in a national park chalet, one night at a small camp in a small private concession, and the final night at a contemporary lodge. Once inside the national park, there are more restrictions on activities. You can only explore on daytime game drives. This is why combining Kruger with Sabi Sands is advantageous. By now, you will have experienced different perspectives, and now, it is time for adventure. Over a dozen different ecosystems can be found in Kruger National Park, and this journey will explore their contrasts. You will discover the animals that thrive in miombo woodland, the drama that plays out on open grasslands, the strange creatures that lurk around the Lebombo mountains, and the importance of watering holes on a vast, arid landscape. On a safari, it is always impossible to predict exactly what you will see. Some animals are so abundant that they blur into the Kruger landscape, notably impalas, springboks, buffalos, elephants, zebras, wildebeests, giraffes, and hyenas. Maybe, you will see spotted hyena as they chase an impala herd. Perhaps, you will see a friendly buffalo herd that is all calm and charm as they graze the grass. However, it can also be a boisterous and belligerent herd. This three-day journey is also an excellent opportunity to search for some of Africa’s rarer species. Roan and sable antelope may both be a highlight along with the highly endangered African wild dog. White rhinos are plentiful, and five days in the Greater Kruger should provide numerous good sightings. However, black rhinos are very rare, and it will take some patience to search out one of these bashful creatures. The most dramatic action tends to take place at watering holes, which are excellent places to take a picnic and watch the wildlife world unfold."

Standing in Nelson Mandela’s former cell, take a moment to reflect on his extraordinary resilience and capacity to forgive his captors once he was released, and pave the way to a peaceful and democratic South Africa. Due to its relatively small size, Cape Town is easily explored on foot. Once you disembark at the Victoria and Alfred Waterfront, this precinct of shops, cafés, and bars overlooks the busy harbor that is a great place to wander. Further towards the city, the streets around Greenmarket Square are worth spending a while exploring, on the lookout for interesting African arts and curios.

Touching down at the airfield, you find yourself in the middle of the African wilderness, with nothing but pristine bush for miles around. Your guide meets you and directs you to his safari vehicle, in which you take the short game drive to the lodge. Keeping an eye out for animals along the way, the chances are you will spot at least a few impala antelope, zebra and wildebeest as they graze and move through the golden grassland. Arriving at the lodge, you find an elegant, stylish and modern lodge set on the banks of the Sabie River. It is astonishing, but here is a six-star luxury establishment in the middle of the African wilderness! Your suite is enormous, with a private veranda complete with a heated pool and stunning view over the river. After you have settled in, you wander over to the main building in the mid afternoon for an English high tea. A selection of delicacies is on display to tempt your taste buds while you discuss your afternoon’s adventure with your guide. You set off with your expert tracker and guide team, riding in an open Land Rover in order to maximize your field of view. With the light of the late afternoon giving the grasses swaying in the breeze a golden tinge, your sense of anticipation heightens as your eyes scan the surrounding bush. The Sabi Sands is a huge tract of land that shares a fenceless border with the Kruger National Park to the east. This creates an area of almost three million hectares of pristine wildlife habitat where animals roam freely. The abundance of wildlife here is astonishing, and apart from the signature Big 5 species of lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo and rhino, there are many more species of mammals and birds here to encounter. This is also the home range of the critically endangered African wild dog, the supreme hunters of this untrammeled wilderness. Highly social by nature, to encounter a pack of these predators on a high-speed hunt must rank as one of the most thrilling wildlife experiences you could possibly imagine. The dynamics of the group dictate that they kill quickly and silently, feed their youngest members first, and depart from the carcass before it attracts other larger predators such as lions and hyenas. As the afternoon draws to a close, your guide will select a spot to stretch your legs and take in the scenery. He produces a hamper packed with drinks and snacks, and you find yourself sipping on a glass of your favorite beverage while the sun sets the sky on fire in a pyrotechnic display of color. As the first stars begin to appear, you drive back to camp with a spotlight, seeking out the reflected eyes of nocturnal species as they emerge into the night. Civets, honey badgers and genets are often seen, while the loping stride of a hyena off on his nightly hunt is a thrilling sight. Returning to camp, you will find a welcoming fire blazing on the viewing deck, and delicious aromas wafting from the kitchen. A sumptuous meal is served in the dining room, bathed in soft lantern light, and after a final drink at the fire, you slip back to your suite and slide between the covers, serenaded by the sounds of the African night outside."

        "description": "You arise at dawn with a gentle knock on your door, and soon you find yourself sipping a freshly brewed hot drink on the terrace, watching the sun bring the world to life. Setting off on your game drive, the dew sparkles on the grasses and the air has a fresh tang to it that enlivens your senses. Scanning the ground intensely for spoor, your guide and tracker use their vast experience and skills to interpret every facet of their surroundings. By looking at tracks in the sand, they can tell the story of the night’s events- which animal went in which direction, and why they might have done so. Listening to the morning chorus of birds uplifts you as they welcome the day, and your guide knows the call of every one of them, and has a fascinating story to tell about each. Smaller birds like starlings will make a ruckus if they spot a snake; larger birds like francolins and grey go-away birds will tell you if there is a big cat nearby. A drag-mark on the ground reveals where a leopard made his kill, then took it to safety in the fork of a tree, and the overlaid pug-marks of a male lion show his intention of stealing the leopard’s prize. Every aspect of the bush has a story to tell, and if you look hard enough, the magic of this ecosystem will reveal itself to you. From the tiniest insect to the largest elephant bull, your guide will inform and educate you as to how they all fit into and function within this incredible mosaic of life. After a few hours, you return to the camp for a well-earned and hearty breakfast. After breakfast, if you so choose, you can take a safari walk with your guide, and it is well worth it. Nothing can compare to being on foot in the African wilderness. Walking along game paths that might never have felt a human tread, you feel your senses become heightened and more engaged. With this sharpening comes the sensation of being fully in the moment, alive and breathing in the warm air of this ancient land. Your guide will point out things that you might not notice from a vehicle- hoofmarks around a salt lick, a dung beetle rolling his enormous ball, the various uses of the plants you encounter: which are medicinal, which are edible, and which leaves make the softest toilet paper! Return to the lodge uplifted and energized, and after enjoying a delicious lunch, you retire to the shade for a well-earned rest. What could be a better place to while away a warm afternoon than in the pool on your deck, a chilled glass in hand, looking out over the African wilderness? Eventually as the sun begins to lower, you feel yourself compelled to venture out again to see what nature has in store for you. In the golden light of the late afternoon, you are once again moving through the bush, eyes peeled for any signs. Coming to a waterhole, you watch a herd of elephants lumber to the water’s edge to drink and observe the intricate family dynamics as they do so- watched over by the matriarch; the youngsters jostle and shove each other until their exuberance is quelled by a sharp trumpet from an elder member of the family. The tiny calves are not yet able to fully control their trunks and are comical in their attempts to mimic their mothers, while a teenage bull might try and challenge a larger cousin in an attempt at dominance. It is easy to spend hours watching the behavior of these amazing pachyderms as they interact among each other, but after a short while they turn and melt back into the forest as silently as ghosts. Returning to the lodge, you find the welcoming glow of campfire and lantern light. After another culinary experience conjured up out here in the middle of the wilderness, the excitement of the day comes to an end as you gratefully slip between the covers. Listening to the far off giggles of a hyena, you drift off into deep slumber in a moment."

        "description": "Is it easy to imagine the exhilarating moments of a Kruger safari. You will be exploring the wilderness and searching for lions, elephants, and all the other legendary, African mammals. Preconceptions usually revolve around excitement and thrills, but a Kruger safari is serene at heart, especially in the Timbavati. This is the most laid-back and compact Kruger region, and you will not need to spend all day, bouncing around a dusty savannah. In the Timbavati, you can often see the animals directly from your lodge, and you can take a picnic and dine on the view with hippos and buffalos as they quarrel at a watering hole beneath you. In short, you can take it slow and easy and still experience incredible wildlife sightings. After flying into Johannesburg, you will board a mid-morning safari flight to the Greater Kruger. The transfer to the lodge is a game drive, which will be a beautiful journey past many of the large species that also call this landscape home. An afternoon game drive will be included, and there is an excellent chance of encountering the full Big Five on a single Timbavati drive. Still, do not think too much about the Big Five and checking off your list because today is mostly about settling into the safari atmosphere. You will experience the space and serenity of the Timbavati and drift off to a soundtrack that is dominated by elephants and baboons."

        "description": "Sounds will alert you to elephants in the nearby trees, and you can hear the flapping of ears and stomping of feet plus the sonorous crack of a tree as it gets barged over. By driving closer, you see the trunks and how they twist effortlessly around tree branches. For 20 minutes, you can watch the elephants pass as a large herd moves playfully through the trees. Buffalos can also be heard, and they are giant grazers who like to huff and grunt audibly throughout the day. In contrast, rhinos and giraffes are silent animals; they move elegantly across the savannah and somewhat bashfully given their incredible size. You can see giraffes necks as they pop above trees. These animals are common sightings in the Timbavati. This Western strip of the Greater Kruger has diverse habitats and permanent water, making it home to a sublime range of wildlife. Today, lions and leopards can complete your Big Five experience, and you rarely need to drive far. Timbavati is compact, so you can comfortably see most of the iconic species without long or uncomfortable drives. This is perfect if you are still battling with a little travel fatigue, and it also helps to slow you down and settle into the Kruger’s day to day rhythm. After a morning game drive, you can choose a walking safari for the afternoon. Walks allow you to visit places that are inaccessible by vehicles and usually go in the opposite direction of vehicles. Game drives are also the only way to encounter predators and large, dangerous mammals. With Kruger walks, you will focus on smaller animals, notably the superb collection of antelope. Therefore, you can stand amid a springbok herd, walk alongside zebras, and watch kudu as they march past with their incredible horns. Walking safaris can be part of your customizable safari program in the Timbavati and Lebombo but less so in Mala Mala, where walks are usually not permitted due to the profusion of dangerous mammals."

        "title": "Mala Mala Private Game Reserve – Hot Air Balloon Safari and Extravagant Natural Landscapes",
        "description": "After an early start, you will be soaring across the Greater Kruger in a hot air balloon. From the air, you can appreciate the mix of habitats and how arid savannah is punctuated by riverine forest and thicker strips of bush. Even when soaring over Blyde River Canyon, you can spot animals down below, notably the elephant herds. The canyon is impressive, snaking into the distance like an elephant trunk. Peaks and canyon walls are colored an iconic African ochre with lush forest rising upon the slopes. There are few finer vistas anywhere on the continent, and it is a more intimate experience from a hot air balloon than from any of Blyde River Canyon’s famous viewpoints. You will touch down to the east of the canyon, where you will continue your journey by road. It will take around one hour to reach Mala Mala, which is the largest of all the Sabi Sands game reserves and the one with the best location. The Sabi Sands and Kruger National Park share an unfenced border. Wildlife migrates freely between the two parks and congregates where there is water, most popularly the Sabi and Sand river. Mala Mala has the longest shared border with the park. Essentially, it is on the inside of the Sabi Sands, deep within the Greater Kruger. Some of the cheaper Sabi Sands private reserves are located along the outside of the ecosystem, where they have a fenced barrier to the urban world. Naturally, the unfenced realm on the inside is more attractive to the animals."

        "title": "Mala Mala Private Game Reserve – Legendary Big Game Encounters through the Day and Night",
        "description": "As dawn breaks, you will be greeted by a special scene. A leopard may meet your gaze with its green eyes, piercing the morning haze. It will move slowly, serenely, and then in a split second, it will descend onto the savannah floor. A few steps at a time, the predator explores. It is elegance personified, but there is a deep earnestness to the hunter’s movements. Leopards are one of Africa’s most elusive and difficult to spot animals, and they are a specialism of Mala Mala. Guides know their hideouts and sunrise game drives can begin by venturing straight to their lairs. On most drives, you will simply watch a leopard as it moves slowly around the savannah, but sometimes, you can be treated to the spotted cat on a hunt. Leopards are also an excellent animal to follow on a nighttime game drive. Leopards and lions prefer to hunt at night, which is when the temperature is cooler, and their acute eyesight comes into its own. It is on a nighttime game drive when you are most likely to encounter lions on the prowl. Often, these drives have a near spooky resonance, but they are completely safe. The driver may cut the engine, so you can be led by sounds. Your eyes will adjust to the gloom, and the animals will seem much closer under the veil of darkness. These nighttime game drives help you understand the nocturnal world, and you can go in search of specific animals like leopards and lions. They will a beautiful addition to your daytime adventures and can be included on all three nights of your stay in the Mala Mala. The daytime game drives are all about abundance. Since there are so many animals here, it can be difficult knowing which way to look. Hippos wallow in a river as eland drink tentatively from the banks, baboons and vervet monkeys cry out from the treetops, possibly alerting everyone to a cheetah that hides in the grass, and white rhinos provide sublime and usually short moments as they cross your path and wander into a place of privacy. By the end of these two days, you will also know how to distinguish most of the Kruger antelope, including hartebeest, impala, waterbuck, endangered Roan antelope, and the stunning Sable antelope. As with the other destinations, you will have a private guide and driver, and this can really enhance your experience as it enables you to create a very personal Kruger storyline. For example, photographers can spend longer at specific sights to get the best shots, and hippo lovers can venture out before dawn to watch the giants as they return to a river. You can also focus part of a drive on anything from eagles to the unique pronking that is performed by Springbok. As this is a private reserve, you can also drive off the trail whenever you desire. In Kruger National Park, you do not need to stick to the roads and vehicle trails because going off the trail is essential for getting closer to the cats and the more elusive animals."

        "title": "Lebombo Concession – Evoking Kruger’s Phenomenal Scale",
        "description": "After three nights in Mala Mala, you will enter Kruger National Park for the first time. Lebombo is on the far east side of the park, and it will take at least half a day to drive there. It could take the entire day, depending on what you see and how often you stop. A drive across the park must stick to vehicle trails, but it offers an outstanding impression of Kruger’s scale. This ecosystem also dwarfs many US states and European countries in size, and the deeper you go, the more surprises that you can encounter. Towards Eastern Kruger, there are fewer animals. You can drive for 20 minutes and claim that you have seen nothing, but then, you can cross a ridge, and suddenly a buffalo herd blocks your way. Your guide may also stop and use their binoculars to seek out a cheetah with cubs. One animal can seem to be following your journey, and that is the spotted hyena, which are active animals that are constantly on the move in search of food. They not only scavenge but seek out the weak and sick, using their incredible stamina to find food that others miss. At first, you may find them a bit ugly, but hyenas can be quick to change your perception. While reaching the Lebombo Mountains, you will check into your luxurious clifftop lodge. Mala Mala has an excellent camp and will provide an experience amongst the wildlife. It is the sort of place where you open your curtains to an elephant. Your final lodge in Lebombo is contemporary in style, and here, you can open your curtains to an almost endless view over the Kruger. There will be no other buildings or any vehicles in sight. This is an opulent retreat that is complete with a marvelous wine cellar, a safari spa, and some of South Africa’s best dining. After Mala Mala and a long drive, it will provide a nice change of pace."

Here, you can slow down again and feel the beautiful seclusion of a Kruger safari. That does not mean there will not be any wildlife sightings. Although life is not as abundant as in Mala Mala, the Lebombo Mountains hide an excellent array of wildlife, including smaller hunters like a jackal, which you may not have seen yet. Game drives are the mainstay of most programs, and they can be complement with game walks, nighttime drives, and also riding safaris. You can peddle through the bush on a mountain bike, or you can be lounge around the pool and enjoy a regal view over the Kruger."

You will be collected by your transfer afterward and whisked away to the airport, where you will catch your flight home."

        "title": "Sabi Sands – Introductions in the Sabi Sands",
        "description": "The word safari comes from the Swahili language, translating into English as “journey.” It's a fitting definition of the experience to come, immediately suggesting notions of an adventure into the unknown. Yet there's more to the Swahili interpretation as the word safari means more than just the movement of travel, but also a journey of changing perspectives. Land in the Sabi Sands and both sides to the definition are immediately apparent. The landscape evocatively showcases how you've traveled into a new world; one where rhinos roam free and elephants tower above the airstrip. And the first experience on the savanna quickly helps to shift many people's perspective on Africa; this is not merely a continent to visit and experience, but one to intimately connect with. From a giraffe elegantly wandering by to a zebra herd beside your suite, the Kruger savanna immediately invites you into a realm untouched by time. It feels like animals are everywhere, either in sight or the sounds that reverberate across the bushland. Your first luxury safari lodge overlooks the Sand River, and there are dozens of different species roaming freely on the surrounding savanna. Just sit back, sip on a welcome cocktail, and watch the procession of mammals tentatively drinking in big cat country. An afternoon game drive provides a close-up, and when dinner is served under the stars, there's a sense of making a connection that can't be found elsewhere in the world. The Sabi Sands is a short flight from Johannesburg, and a representative will assist with the transfer between planes at O. R. Tambo International."

        "title": "Sabi Sands – Big Game Encounters",
        "description": "As the iconic African sun pierces the horizon, you're out on the savanna, trailing a lion pride in hunting mode. Six lionesses work together, exchanging stealth for a group attempt at a breakfast buffalo. They harass the herd, snapping at the fringes before getting chased away by large males. Their prize is hidden behind the fur and horns, a young buffalo calf being carefully protected by the herd. Getting trampled by a buffalo would mean certain death, but the lionesses keep coming, pulling the herd in different directions, a few brave hunters dragging out the wrath of the biggest males. Then there's a flurry of dust and a haunting cry, three lionesses bringing down their target. Yet the battle isn't over. As you watch transfixed, the buffalo charge the lions, attempting to save their calf. For another hour the scene plays out, made even more dramatic by a pack of hyenas on the prowl. As safari in the Kruger promises, you're not just sightseeing, but immersing yourself in the rhythms of the wild. On a Kruger game drive, there are moments of charm, like watching rhinos or giraffes slowly walk past the vehicle. And then there are snippets of drama, like a lion hunt or two herds battling at a waterhole. Nothing is predictable, and this is part of the immersion; one moment you're following a leopard, the next moment you're surrounded by a noisy baboon troop. A safari is not like being at the zoo. You don't pass a cage knowing that a certain animal will be there. Instead, you escape into the wild and allow the landscape to surprise you. Soon, any notions of the Big Five have been replaced by the beauty of connecting with the wild. Over these two days, you enjoy morning and afternoon game drives, punctuated by a few hours of quiet time to let the heat of the day pass by. Your suite has a private plunge pool, ideal for cooling off and watching the life at the river. A private terrace continues the sense of escapism, with uninterrupted views dotted with wildlife. Monkeys and baboons swing past; elephants roam just meters below, and a myriad of exotic birds land beside you. Safari is certainly an adventure, but few people predict the utter serenity when it's just you and the Kruger savanna."

        "description": "After a short game drive transfer, you settle into your next property on MalaMala, an exotic world amidst the forest on the banks of the Sand River. There's a certain air of romance and exclusivity here, where varied wildlife can be viewed from a private plunge pool and your suite seems to be hidden in the wild heart of Africa. MalaMala is a large private reserve, only accessible to guests staying at one of its three camps. Drivers are permitted to take you off the trail, so game drives bring an even more inspiring proximity to the wildlife. For example, you see a leopard high in the tree and the driver bumps over the grass until you're just a few meters away. Like the landscape you just left, this is big cat country, and the encounters come thick and fast. Cheetahs disappear into the grass then emerge in a flurry of dust; hyenas scowl as they seek a meal, joining jackals and vultures in picking at bloodied, discarded carcasses. Sometimes you see a lion pride lazing in the sun, snoozing with eyes ever alert for what's moving on their savanna. On other occasions, you follow a rare caracal as it journeys beneath the moonlight. At MalaMala, you're not restricted to exploring during the day. Nighttime drives enable you to see nocturnal creatures and further mystical encounters between predator and prey. There's also an option to go on a walking safari with an armed ranger, another way to keep bringing new safari experiences after four or five days in the savanna. The daily itinerary is flexible, and you can pick and choose between the activities. Along with the big cats, the Kruger is also a celebrated haven of Africa's giants. Around 10,000 rhinos occupy the savanna, and they quickly become a highlight, especially in the quieter and private world of MalaMala. Elephants are hard to miss, and you might find one passing the camp at sundown as you sip on a cocktail. Hippos spend their day in the river below, their gaping jaws a mesmerizing display of power. Yet perhaps your finest safari memories come from something very personal; a private show of affection between two zebras, a kudu nursing her calf, maybe a hairless baby baboon carried on her mother's stomach. When you escape to a world like the Kruger, such inspiring moments further cement your connection with the wild. The next day, a final game drive is a bonus chance to savor the last safari memories. Perhaps two rhinos in the bush, giants with a grace that matches their imposing bulk. Maybe a leopard, the furtive hunter keeping you spellbound as she dips her neck and disappears in the grass. Or an adorable zebra herd, an ancient elephant bull, a hundred springbok skipping elegantly across the grasslands. Return from the drive for a second breakfast before you transfer to the Skukuza airstrip for the one-hour flight to Johannesburg. You'll spend the night at a boutique getaway in the old colonial suburb of Houghton. A driver-guide is at your disposal and the afternoon can be tailored towards your interests, from wine tasting in private cellars to the colors of the city's urban forest or sundowner cocktails."

You land in the Quirimbas Archipelago, on an island that's dominated by thick indigenous forest. The island is only shared by a maximum of 12 guests and the canopy further enhances notions of privacy. Your suite cascades down onto the white sand, and you could go days without seeing anyone else but the attentive personal butler. Settle in, dip into your pool, brush your toes in the sand and float on the turquoise waters of the Indian Ocean. Like when on safari, your package is fully inclusive of meals and selected drinks."

Next, the ocean laced with a divine blur of tropical colors. A forest backdrop adds another hue and the soothing sights are complemented by the islands' sounds; wind is rustling softly, waves lapping lightly, the odd exotic bird tweeting from the high branches. Mozambique has 2,000 miles of white sand coastline, along with a suite of islands cast adrift in the ocean. It's a country that remains off most travel radars, yet provides a compelling getaway into a realm untouched by modernity. Vamizi is an island where you take off the shoes and never put them back on, a place where time has no meaning and the day slips along with the utmost of tranquility. As you might expect on a private island, the accommodation adds a further haven of luxury. Expect a spacious suite with multiple places to rest and relax, along with a private pool and deck overlooking the beach. Spend your time lazing away the day and then add in one of the activities. Perhaps a deep-sea fishing trip, maybe snorkeling or diving on the surrounding reefs, or it could be sailing away in a traditional wooden dhow, with the captain timing your departure for a serene Indian Ocean sunset."

Both the hike and the gondola are fulfilling in different ways and both lead you to the same incredible panorama of Cape Town. Lion’s Head Peak sits just below to your left, while Devil’s Peak is to the right. The air atop the mountain is cool with the breeze blowing against your cheeks. The ocean circles around the Cape of Good Hope, shining an opulent blue and sparkling from the sun’s reflection. The mountaintop is craggy and looks like a marriage of landscapes between the Old West and the Moon. The mountain feels like a giant monolith in its flat nature and ease in which you can explore its crown. The vibrant neighborhood of Bo Kaap can be seen from the mountaintop, nestled in the shadow of Signal Hill, the houses neon in color. Bo Kaap is an incredibly eclectic neighborhood and is considered to be Cape Town’s Malaysian Quarter. You can practically smell the curry and slow cooked stews from the Table. Take the cableway down for one last vista of the city beneath you. The gondola slowly rotates and Cape Town comes closer as you descend the gondola, the beauty of the city you came to see, touch, and take in."

        "description": "With Cape Town’s stunning location and fabulous history you will always need another day to explore the city’s best sites. For a deeper sense of Cape Town’s and South Africa’s history visit the Castle of Good Hope. The castle is in actuality a fortress built by the Dutch East India Trading Company in the 17th century. The gateway was built in 1682 and replaced the old entrance that faced the sea. Two pillars are carved out of gray-blue stone. The entrance is made of small yellow bricks which offer a unique example of 17th century Dutch classicism in the Cape. Soldiers in traditional Dutch uniforms march through the courtyard. Whether strolling through the courtyard in the warm Cape Town sun, or wandering through the castle museum, you can feel the history of the castle and its support in shaping the city and the world around. There is plenty of day left to see the fantastic African penguin colony at Richards Bay. The penguins are a wonder of imagination. Their shiny black and white coats glimmer in the daylight and their very existence on the continent is a wonder to see. Whether through evolution or constitution, the penguins at Boulders Bay not only live on the African continent but thrive along the water’s edge. They nest on warm sand and swim in the cold water. The beach is lined with boulders that penguins climb over. They waddle along the shore and squawk if you get too close. The waves fall gently along the sand. The penguins linger in groups, some along the lapping sea, others staunch in the sand. From a connection to Cape Town’s history to connecting with some of Cape Town’s most visited wildlife, just like a soothing sun, you can always take more."

The vineyards just on the outskirts of town stretch onto the foothills of the surrounding mountains. Each winery has unique and luscious flavors from the land’s diversity and the breeze the blows through the valley. You will make your way to the fabulous River Manor Boutique Hotel and Spa where the comfortable luxuries of South Africa’s second oldest settlement await you. With the sun still high in the bright sky there is plenty of time to explore Stellenbosch. Its exceptional beauty fills more than just its aesthetic. The vineyards of the valley range from boutique wineries to large farms that have spread their ideas from just wine to include preserves, breads, olives, and cheeses. Four Secrets has a uniquely delightful wine in its Sparkling Shiraz. With a nose of red berry, vanilla, and black pepper the palate is soaked in a lingering finish of berries and spice, all touched with a light rush of carbonation. From olives and cheese, to wine and vineyards, explore and experience as much, or as little, of Stellenbosch as you like; either way you will be taken over by its majesty."

Aquila will take you far away from the life you knew at home, and although you will be close to Cape Town, you will be light-years away from the city’s history and culture as you personally step into the luxuries of wildlife. The sun drifts through the sky and lingers over the horizon. The heat of the day begins to give way to the cool evening air. The scent of warm grass drifts beneath your vehicle. Your guide informs you of the presence of the Big Five in the park: lion, rhinoceros, elephant, leopard, and buffalo. The vehicle slowly drives along the paths, dust jumps from behind the rear wheels. The wind flows through your hair until you come to a stop. Your guide points in the short distance. You follow his finger and search in the amber afternoon light. He isn’t pointing to the grass but the tree. Just beneath the canopy you can see the black tip of a tail. The tail swishes over the branch and leads up to the light brown body that is decorated with black fur. A leopard lounges in the tree, escaping the warm sun, and scouring the savannah in search of easy prey. The leopard lies in the tree with ease and grace, comfortable in the branches and the shade.

You make your way once again into the bush to see more of the life that calls Aquila home, including the reminders of life that once lived in Aquila. Venture to the Khoisan rock art to see the remains of the culture that once filled the bush. Tribes lived among the Big Five and so many others as a way of life. The San were a tribal people once found throughout South Africa. Their drawings are elaborate and shine with bright colors contrasted with the color soft stone. Elephants stand in a herd. Lines of men are adorned with spears. Hunters and half-human, half-animal creatures believed to be medicine men or healers, decorate the rocks. The drawings were made with different colored stones. Finely ground red rock rubbed on a boulder to form the pictures could withstand weather for long periods of time. The animals decorating the rocks are no less majestic than the animals active in the savannah. From the rock walls to the golden grass, the lives once lived and the wildlife still living are no less than ineffable."

Natural landscapes seem to stretch for eternity; their elegance immediately relaxes your rhythm. Silence reigns, yet all good silences are filled with noise. An elephant trumpets its call through the forest as herds graze on the grass beneath your balcony, a hippo grunts, and exotic birds sporadically add to the soundtrack. After your flight to South Africa, touch down in Kruger and you are immediately soothed as you are transported into a natural realm as tension melts away and the panorama is instantly energizing.

Head out on a game drive and this paradoxical paradigm continues as you slow into nature's soft rhythm, yet every corner brings a surprise to make your heart jump. A lion pride basks beneath a jackalberry tree, content to rest in the shade as two more rhinos saunter past, their horns an exquisite piece of the safari landscape. Keep moving into a grassland that ripples with an atmosphere of fear. Now the rhythm changes as leopard hides in the green as it stalks a herd of impala. Tension builds and the antelope scatter and gallop in any direction they can. But where has the leopard gone? Keep watching and the rest of nature's drama will play out as the hunt takes place just below your camera.

Take a few more steps and then stop, wait, and then continue. Soon you are just 15 meters away and can admire the bulk and the beauty of one of the world's most endangered giants. There is not just one, as the group of white rhinos will rest and create a trilogy of excitement on your first day of your walking safari. There are very few places in the world where you can track rhinos on foot, and you will find three within the first hours of your walk. Continue through the bush as expert trackers piece together the clues. They will crumble dung in their hands to discover its age, follow indentations and upturned stones, and anticipate the future direction of prints in the sand.

Journey further into the wilderness and a herd of buffalo will grace the horizon. The guide will turn if they are bachelors, filled with testosterone and not to be encountered. But later on your walk, you may find the females, who are happy for you to get a little closer and admire their furs. It's the same landscape as yesterday, a mystical wilderness of big mammals.

It could be two shorter walks with a lunchtime break back at the camp, or a full-day walk with a picnic on the route. The guides may also radio in a vehicle pick-up and enable you to make a one-way walk that goes deeper into an untouched world. Cross grasslands that overflow with impala and springbok. Stop at rivers where kudu and eland take a drink; walk through the thorn thickets and spot more rhinos in their haven. Then follow the sounds to a wildebeest herd as their enthusiastic rutting is an exciting part of the day. You can easily spot the giraffe from a distance as their necks stretch above the trees. They can also easily spot you, but they are not perturbed as you weave through the bush and stand just 20 meters away as the giraffe feast elegantly from the treetops. Stay silent, feel the connection with nature, and admire the giants as they wander off with easy strides. On your walking safari, you are just another mammal, not a large and sometimes noisy safari vehicle. Wildlife isn't scared as it inspects you like it inspects every visitor to its realm. The respect is usually mutual; if you don't get too close or invade the space with too much noise, most animals will accept your presence. You can get very close, and everything feels bigger than your imagination.

It's still safe as the trackers check for infinitesimal signs of annoyance or aggression. Remember, the local guides and trackers have grown up on this landscape and for many generations, they have lived side by side with all of these giants. Their understanding of what to do is as automatic as your understanding of how to negotiate a shopping mall or highway intersection. Armed rangers always accompany your expedition to provide another layer of security in the case of emergency.

While big cats also inhabit this wilderness, the walking route is always designed to avoid their presence. Encounters with predators are saved for the game drives either side of your walking safari. A tented camp provides a natural resting point in the evening, a simple but luxuriously appointed accommodation that blends effortlessly into the landscape. There are no extra thrills or opulent amenities as your experience is centered around your connection with the Kruger ecosystem. Dine beneath the stars as a fire sporadically crackles as you listen to the endearing soundtrack and appreciate the lack of the usual noise of regular life. Be moved by nature and wake each morning to the serenity of the bush."

        "description": "After three days of Kruger at its purest and most untouched, transfer to Sabi Sands for three days of an African safari at its most luxurious with a fabulous lodge that overlooks the life along the river. Soothe your muscles in a private heated plunge pool and watch as hippos quarrel below. Dine on an ornate wooden deck as zebra and springbok canter past and then lay down on your bed to watch a procession of animals through the glass and canvas walls. Decadent and exclusive, the lodge provides the perfect space to for relaxing and reenergize after the walking safari. But the wildlife encounters never stop in the Kruger – so much can be spotted directly from your room."

        "description": "Wildlife congregates in the Sabi Sands, a private reserve that borders the larger Kruger National Park. Whole processions of mammals arrive here, enticed by the bounty of two permanent rivers. Antelope arrive in the tens of thousands, followed by zebra, buffalo, primates, and more. When there is such an abundance of food, you can always expect a mass congregation of predators. Big cat encounters are what the Sabi Sands is famous for, from resident lion pride to the wandering leopards, raucous hyenas to elegant cheetahs that hide in the grass. After the walking safari, it's likely that the different predators will be the focus of your safari activities. Over these two days, create your own program and choose morning and afternoon activities that reflect your mood and interests. Game drives and walking safaris are expertly tailored towards the sights you have yet to see, while nighttime drives reveal a new and thrilling world. The guide flicks on a spotlight and herds are grazing just meters away; buffalo, zebra, springbok, kudu have their ears alert and then they run, chased by a leopard that's jumped out from the darkness. Much like a walking safari, a nighttime drive provides a fresh connection with the landscape and enables you to discover a world at its most pure. The safari activities are punctuated by quiet time at the lodge, where you can lay back and allow the sights of the river to entertain your eyes. Even though this is one of Africa's most luxurious lodges, it's still a seamless piece of the landscape, a place that's surrounded by the drama of wildlife."

You are transferred to the airport in an open-sided game vehicle and will take in the wildlife on route to your flight. After your domestic flight lands, a representative will assist with transferring you to your international departure in Johannesburg."

You will lounge in a private plunge pool as giraffe and elephant roam below the trees below, a troop of monkeys will swing by as you sip on a welcome glass of bubbly and your suite will exude a modern luxury while the surroundings scream of wild Africa. Yours is one of South Africa's most unashamedly luxurious lodges, with decadent suites that open out onto the wonders of the bush. After your intercontinental flight, this will be a glorious place to rest and relax, especially as you spot so many animals from the comforts of your bed. Upon your arrival at Johannesburg's O.R. Tambo International Airport, you will be greeted by a representative and assisted onto a local flight to the Thornybush airstrip. The afternoon will be yours and at your leisure for a chance to recuperate from your long day of travel. An afternoon game drive will ease you into your wild safari experience and begin to unravel the stunning biodiversity of the greater Kruger area. You will be on the lookout for the Big Five, but there are dozens of other species that fill this landscape, along with over 500 species of birds."

        "title": "Thornybush Nature Reserve – Luxurious Big Five Safari",
        "description": "An eery silence hangs over the savannah at dawn as the odd bird tweets, and a zebra is rustling in a bush, but it seems that nothing is happening. But then suddenly a yelp with a haunting cry followed by a cacophony of protest. Your driver will quickly take you towards the noise, and there you will find a leopard in the trees, carrying a vervet monkey into the highest branches. Primates shout their disapproval, but there is nothing to be done, as no one had suspected the leopard's hiding place. Anything can happen in an instant when you are on safari, especially on a morning game drive. A little later, you will find a lion pride and hold your breath as they walk past your vehicle. Following their prints, you will spend an hour to admire the pride as they work a wildebeest herd into a frenzy. Safari always brings surprise and every game drive will bring a new scene. Maybe two elephants in the river, squirting water as if on a postcard shot. It could be a cheetah hiding in the grass or a leopard chasing an impala across the bush. Zebra pairs share looks of adoration while a bushbuck herd reveals extraordinarily large horns. Greater Kruger has a marvelous diversity and Thornybush is home to almost all of the ecosystem's different species. Starting a safari here means an easy journey through the mental tick list, with every hour likely to bring two or more new mammals. You will enjoy morning and afternoon game drives in open-sided vehicles, with trackers helping to bring an exceptional proximity to the animals. Balancing out the drama of the game drives is the lavishness of your lodge accommodation. An inclusive wine cellar allows you to taste through the best of South Africa as a whole host of antelope graze below. Spa treatments are savored as the elephants' hooting calls flicker through the forest. Nightly feasts are served under the stars, with hippos and zebra roaming freely on the plains below. Your personal butler will bring everything you need and these two days could easily be spent watching the world go by from your verandah. In comparison to the other private reserves, Thornybush doesn't quite have the same density of wildlife, yet this is balanced by the sheer luxury of your accommodation."

        "title": "Sabi Sands Game Reserve – The Predators' Paradise",
        "description": "It's a quick drive south to the Sabi Sands Game Reserve, the most famous of all of Kruger's private reserves. Most of the Sabi Sands is marked out into smaller individual reserves, the majority of them centered on either the Sabi or the Sand River. These permanent snaking rivers entice tens of thousands of mammals from the neighboring Kruger National Park, some of them migratory visitors and others becoming permanent residents. Each reserve has its specialty, thanks to the subtle differences between habitats. In Londolozi, that specialty is the leopard. A thrilling resident population occupies the trees, and you will be quick to find them. Birds cry out, alerting all the antelopes of the leopard's presence. From an elevated vantage point in your vehicle, you can also find their camouflage. The tails flick and clear blue eyes return your gaze before the leopard dips her neck with cold precision to follow the trail of the kudu. But the birds have done their job, and the antelope begin to scatter, leaving the leopard to seek out another target. With two days here, you are virtually guaranteed to see the cheetah at work, and there is great chance of spotting one out on the prowl. While this hunt may have been unsuccessful, another may continue into a blur of dust and a kill. The leopards are normalized to visitor presence, and they continue their hunt within clicking range of the camera. Lion and hyena provide equally hypnotic moments, as do the hippos that gather in the Sand River and the continued presence of wild white rhinos. Your suite is fitted with private heated plunge pools and a verandah that gazes over the savannah. Grey duiker and nyala regularly roam below, along with bushbuck, waterbuck, mongoose and civet. Wahlberg's eagles soar overhead, and like all of the Kruger's private reserves, safari starts straight from the suite. As you will come to expect, your luxurious suite will have floor-to-ceiling windows, so you will always enjoy the authenticity of the wild. Your safari program is flexible, and you will have an opportunity to switch a morning or afternoon game drive for a bush walk. Guided by an armed ranger, these walks focus on the rich array of antelopes that occupy the reserve."

        "description": "Wake in the cool of the morning and gaze down from your treehouse on the Sabie River. The views stretch out in every direction from your ultimate bush bedroom, and the savannah is dappled with elephant and buffalo herds, as well as with the antics of the wild hippo pods. Yours is not a traditional treehouse as rather it is a luxurious home in the sky, as even your bathroom has an incredible view. Your evening meals are served beneath moonlight and lanterns. Exclusive to just two people, your treehouse is serviced by a personal butler and is exceptionally well-located to hear the narrative of the Kruger. Throughout the day and night, you will hear the calls of the wild as the landscape speaks to you through its mystical soundtrack. Lion Sands is another of the enclaves found within the Sabi Sands Game Reserve. While its lodge accommodation is excellent, the opportunity to sleep in a luxury treehouse makes this one of the iconic Greater Kruger stops. Gloriously appointed, this is also an idyllic place to relax on a longer safari itinerary. As with all Sabi Sands lodges, the surrounding landscape has an extraordinary density of wildlife. Roaming pride of lions seek out the resident wildebeest and kudu and then battle with hyenas to keep their kill. Dawn and dusk provide delightful moments as hippos rise out of the water, the big giants plodding and huffing away. Elusive creatures like the wild dog bring a new sight to the safari, their resplendent fur rising in and out of the grass as they run. The Sabi Sands is a compact area and game drives travel at a languid pace along the river. Moving carefully and slowly allows you to see everything and not lose the raw impression of the wild. The wildlife stays close to the water, so even though you cover a short distance, you are likely to encounter a rich medley of sights and scenes. The highlight of one drive might be two elephant or buffalo herds clashing while on another, there might be a cheetah tracking its prey. There will always be thrills here, which makes the tranquility of your treehouse even more inviting as your day ends."

Both options evoke a dramatic scale, whether it's as herds roam beneath the wingtips of your plane or as you encounter dozens of rhinos and pride as you meander to the east. Your safari is based on your game drive options, but there are also easy aerial connections. Nestled beneath the Lebombo Mountains in the far east of Kruger is your next camp, a decadent accommodation that is set within its own private concession. Few visitors make it into these mystical mountains, so your safari experience will truly be unique and a true adventure. Your next camp is an authentic hideaway, lost amongst the trees and concealed from the rest of the world. You will feel as if you are staying in the trees with your elevated vantage point that provides incredible views over the Sweni River below. As you will have grown accustomed to, it will only take a brief glance from your lodge to admire an astonishing array of animals and birds that inhabit the water below. Open your curtains in the morning with coffee in hand to find hippos, and then an elephant as you return at noon, and then find that your guided stargazing excursion has been interrupted by a tower of giraffe. There is also an onsite spa and swimming pool for your enjoyment, as well as an exceptional wine cellar. Your safari program is flexible, and a couple of activities deserve special mention. This region is one of the very few places in the Kruger for a mountain bike safari, a rugged adventure across pristine mountain trails that are dappled with zebra, springbok, wildebeest, warthog, and more. Walking safaris can be longer here, providing a chance to get out into the wilds of the bush. And of course, the game drives never disappoint as in this remote area the guides using decades of knowledge to pick out the resident predators and pride."

        "description": "Completing your safari through Kruger's private reserves is Mala Mala, the largest of the reserves. Size makes Mala Mala special as a vast swath of savannah is reserved for just a handful of visitors. Thanks to its flowing waterway, the landscape has become a home to almost all of the species you will find in the Greater Kruger area. In many ways, the reserve is the whole of Kruger in microcosm, although that does not do justice to the surprises and sublime encounters. Leopards are a regular part of the game drives while battles between lions commonly create the commotion that echoes through the air. You will be staying at an exceptionally appointed camp that has been the blueprint for other camps and reserves across Southern Africa. The lands are fully unfenced, so it is an oasis in the heart of the bushveld, where private suites are tucked into the green and filled with natural birdsong. Standing over the Sand River, the lodge is a serene place to escape the world and settle in for your final few days of safari. When your camp is this good, you will never feel bad about spending a morning or an afternoon just relaxing as just below your deck, the parade of safari wildlife continues. Mala Mala really relaxes the rules and each of the activities is imbued with a thrilling intimacy. After seeing a leopard in a nearby tree, your driver will bounce the vehicle off of the trail until you are not more than ten meters away. When vultures circle and baboons hoot, your guide will find a path through the trees so that you can inspect the decaying carcass. A full selection of safari activities are available, and by now you will know which are your favorites. In Mala Mala, it is highly recommended to take the nighttime drives as your excellent guide will bring memories that will last a lifetime. The legendary animals of safari will seem to magically appear at such frequency that you will be hard pressed to leave MalaMala without memory cards full of lion, leopard, elephant, rhino and buffalo."

Rhino and buffalo complete the Big Five absorption and, because this is a private reserve, there won't be other people to encounter on the roads. Bushwalks increase the intimacy, bringing you into a world of the smaller mammals and extensive birdlife that swarms around Thanda. Don’t forget about the little five. Wandering these plains are the rhino beetle, leopard tortoise, buffalo weaver, ant lion, and elephant shrew. Springbok and kudu hop around, giraffe stand proud against the lavishly blue sky, and the guide's narrative weaves cultural history with natural knowledge.

And still, even after four days, you've hardly seen anyone other than the expert local guides."

        "description": "A short helicopter ride skirts the Indian Ocean, shocks of blue interspersed with the forests of Isimangaliso. Lush waterways and lakes are engulfed by a thick awning of indigenous trees and your lodge hides amongst a blanket of kaleidoscopic green. For the next three nights, this luxury lodge provides an unforgettable combination of safari and beach bliss. Blue ocean views come through the thatched suite windows, gentle rollers mingle with the sounds of mischievous monkeys, and one of Africa's most undiscovered beaches is just meters away. In many ways, this is the ultimate beach getaway, a delightful escape into a forest of milkwood trees. But these three nights aren't just about the deserted sand; Isimangaliso is a UNESCO World Heritage Site that will provide new perspectives of African safari."

While there's only a handful of other guests, hippos regularly inhabit the surroundings and they've even been spotted down on the sand. Journey to Lake Sibaya and take a boat safari further into the pachyderms' territory. Large pods cover river channels and swamps, snouts poking above the blue and loud wheeze-honks finding a way into the trees. A myriad of monkey species vie for attention, some skipping across the ground and others swinging through the trees in their trademark style. Take a picnic and stop beside the hippos, admiring them over a sumptuous interlude in lavishly colorful surroundings. Birdsong tweets, a young hippo charges a larger male, monkeys squabble, and then silence returns as you slowly explore the waterways. Isimangaliso is a vastly under-explored part of South Africa despite its UNESCO status, and these next two days offer a submersion in the water-based safari charms of the continent."

Over your three days at Thonga it's easy to be lulled thanks to the beautiful sand, lavish private dinners and the seclusion of the forest. Today offers another chance for adventure here. Boat safaris can weave further into the Wetlands, passing by the primates and elephants that find haven amongst the trees. Traverse a river, cross a lake, emerge in the ocean and a series of sandbanks stand lonely in the warm blue waters. These little beaches are completely inaccessible by road and make an idyllic choice for the afternoon. It's not just safari and beach. Some of South Africa's finest snorkeling and diving can be found in the sapphire water, a vivid concoction of treats waiting just below the surface. Just walk out from the beach and the marine reefs begin. Today is for getting lost together, whether that's on the sand, in the trees, along hippo-covered lakes, or all of the above. When you're back at Thonga Beach Lodge the solitude continues, the delights of Indian Ocean paradise extending in all directions."

        "description": "From wilderness to wilderness you journey across South Africa. A private flight takes you over the wetlands, the dazzling expanse of blue and green admired for a final time. You're flying north, cruising over scorched plains and jagged mountain lines. Kruger National Park is one of Africa's largest and oldest, almost 20,000 square kilometers of competing ecosystems that provide a haven for almost all of Africa's unique mammals. One magnificent sight immediately grabs your attention: White rhinos roam free here, over half of the world's wild population found within the Kruger's boundaries. Horns sparkle and bulky frames merge power with grace, these endangered wonders providing a lasting impression as you touch down and make the short drive to camp. The Kruger is undeniably, and justifiably, popular. There are few national parks on the continent that can rival Kruger for its sheer abundance of life and diverse ecosystems. However, popularity won't dampen the exclusivity of this itinerary. Your dazzling lodge is set within its own private game reserve within Kruger, ensuring you receive all the intimacy and authenticity but none of the crowds. A superior suite offers gorgeous views onto the bushland, with rhinos and buffalo as regular wanderers past your veranda. Turn around and the floor-to-ceiling windows offer uninterrupted vistas into the forest, providing a new set of safari delights that can be photographed from the bed, the lounge, deck area, or swimming pool. Two private game drives a day explore this pristine wilderness. Marvel at hartebeest and their red-striped coats, soak up the interaction between competing elephant herds, or stop alongside vast grassland and watch cheetahs speed towards a springbok herd. By its very nature, safari is unpredictable. Game drives are not zoo experiences. But Kruger's sheer abundance of ecosystems makes tailoring the experience easy. Elephants are found in riverine forests, ungulate herds swarm around permanent water sources, and a predator's movements are regularly watched by trackers; so you define the safari wish and these Kruger game drives will respond."

One offers lodge-style accommodation and thick coatings of opulence. For the final two nights, the romantic stage moves to a tented camp, an ode to old-world adventurers with its elevated wooden perch above the riverbank. Oil lanterns provide the lighting, wooden stilts mingle with the forest backdrop, and the sight of rhinos never grows tired. They keep coming; one by one, then in larger groups as they maraud past your wooden veranda. As you've grown to expect, the safari experience effortlessly combines indulgent relaxation with the thrills of the wild. For every dramatic intimate moment or raw hunting scene, there's an antidote; perhaps a scented bathtub gazing out at elephant silhouettes, an evening of quietude around the fire, or opening the curtains to the black and white stripes of a grazing zebra herd. Game drives are private and continue to respond to your wishes. Stay within the reserve or take long journeys into far corners of Kruger National Park, exploring a vast animal paradise that is difficult to take in in just one or two days. Only after four days do you start to appreciate the scale; Kruger stretches on and on, and the wild game keeps rolling by."

Breathe in the fresh morning air and take in the panorama, the odd giraffe neck or elephant trunk poking above the flowing acres of bush. Stretching across the northeast of South Africa, the Kruger ecosystem is the country's most evocative wilderness. And it doesn't end at the border; it extends into neighboring Zimbabwe and Mozambique. You can't see all that way, but you can sense the scale, especially when buffalo herds rumble past on the game drive to the lodge. Standing on the Sand River, in its own private reserve, Singita Boulders Lodge is an ode to the wild surroundings. Organic interiors complement the raw beauty outside while glass walls ensure the wildlife experience continues uninterrupted. Good wine is integral to the Singita experience, and the boutique cellar is stocked with some of the country's finest vintages. On an afternoon game drive, you uncork a bottle in a clearing, spending a relaxed hour as zebra herds and wild rhinos march on past. As the sun descends, you sit on a private terrace with a glass in hand, watching the antelopes skip past on their migratory journeys. It's the Sand River that gives the landscape its legendary abundance, the animals sticking close to permanent water and food. During a relaxed evening, with a bottle of vintage wine from one of the Wineland's most celebrated estates, there's always a procession of mammals to find in the waters below."

From a hidden branch, a leopard descends, elegantly passing the vehicle and then disappearing into the grass. Baboons cry out, alerting antelope to a cheetah that flickers in and out of the highest green shoots. As you drive down to the river, you see the hippos in a boisterous mood, the odd one yawning to reveal a cavernous jaw. Even when you gaze across at a seemingly static wilderness, there's something moving; a springbok skipping, kudu poking up their heads, a low reverberating grunt from a hidden lion. Game drives are complemented by bush walks, short journeys into the wild that focus on different ungulates. Stop beside a zebra herd, watching the exchange of tender greetings, then walk on to a clearing populated by vervet monkeys. It's also possible to explore after dark, with a nighttime game drive that showcases a very different atmosphere. And when the thrills of the activities are over, the charms of the lodge take over, the wilderness extending from swimming pool and terrace, the wine cellar an accompaniment to the rich parade of mammals that flow past."

The panoramas are equally expressive as in the Sabi Sands, just with the Big Five replaced by rows of flourishing vines, and the epic baobab trees swapped out for jagged spires of hard granite mountain. Over 500 vineyards grace these sweeping valleys, some of them with nearly two centuries of history, others providing contemporary luxury and innovation. First, you fly to Johannesburg, then transfer onto a flight to Cape Town International Airport, where it's just over 30 minutes drive out to the elegance of Mont Rochelle, Richard Branson's boutique hotel in the heart of the Winelands. A degustation lunch introduces you to fresh local flavors, particularly the range of Pinotage wines made from grapes on the surrounding slopes. They're paired with exquisite cured meat – known as biltong – and cheeses from the family-owned farms around Mont Rochelle. This afternoon has time for stops at one or two other wineries, a good starting point being those on the winding road between Franschhoek and Stellenbosch. Delaire Graff is internationally acclaimed, and their cultivated gardens are matched by cultured wines. But along the same road, there's more bite and full-bodied intensity in the wines from estates like Tokara, Zorgvleit, and MolenVliet. With a private guide, the afternoon's tastings can be tailored to your tastes."

Colonial towns like Stellenbosch and Franschhoek feel time-warped, rustically preserved as they glow amongst the vineyards. They've kept the old recipes, serving hearty dishes of local steak and lamb, an exquisite accompaniment to the rounded Bordeaux blends that are concocted by local winemakers. On a relaxed day, you'll visit both of these old towns along with a series of vineyards, with the exact itinerary flexible dependent on your tastes.

You'll recognize the names of some vineyards, major exporters who have found fame across the world.

While this is a poor neighborhood, the smiles are endless, inviting you to explore and see a lesser-known side of urban Cape Town.

        "description": "From the street, you may spot a giraffe, and their necks may crane over a tree, which will be a surreal welcome after landing in Kenya’s capital city. You will weave into the trees, and there will be more endangered Rothschild giraffes in the hotel garden. Your suite will be tucked away with excellent panoramas from the first-floor window. Giraffes like to visit this suite, sometimes popping their heads through the window. These animal introductions showcase the Kenyan experience. There is so much wildlife that it is not confined to national parks. Even when not on a safari, there will be beautiful moments with Africa’s four-legged giants, and you know you are in Africa when giraffes are beside your hotel window."

        "title": "Lewa Wildlife Conservancy – Discovering the Safari Experience",
        "description": "A black rhino may trot bashfully past your vehicle on route to a bushy hiding place, and Zebras may graze around your suite, lifting their heads to say hello. Later, you may spot an elephant herd, including a newborn that likes to stay close to its mother. Hippos may make an appearance during a picnic lunch, and wildebeest may bring enthusiasm to the early afternoon. Then, this afternoon, you may catch a glimpse of a lion. Within a few hours of arriving, your tick list will be completed, and this is just the beginning of your African safari adventure. Laikipia is a great place to start for any first-time safari. You will be staying in Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, which is one of the unfenced, private reserves on the plateau. Animals move freely between these reserves, but human access is heavily restricted, which helps to preserve the land and provide a more private visitor experience. In relative terms, the conservancy is small and compact. Here, you can encounter a large range of animals without needing a long game drive. You can explore slowly, starting to understand wildlife behavior and getting a good feel for the day-to-day safari experience. Safaris are always fun adventures. Few first-time visitors appreciate how tranquil they can be. Nature will write the script, and the digital detox will provide wonders for wellbeing. Stresses will melt away as elephants wander past, and monkeys chirp their morning alarm call. Animals will appear as nearby silhouettes as you sit around an evening campfire. The lodge will be rustically luxurious as it is converted farmstead that has been preserved in the old-world style. Again, it will be something to ease you into the safari. For two days, you will drive and walk in the reserve with rhino encounters being a particular highlight. Rhinos are one of the continent’s most hard to find sights, and in Lewa, there are both black and white species. Plus, it is possible to go on game walks, so you may feel their presence more keenly."

        "title": "Maasai Mara – Wonders of the Maasai Mara Private Safari",
        "description": "Now that you have experienced the safari atmosphere, it is time to visit Africa’s most famous safari destination. You will fly directly to the Maasai Mara and admire how the grasslands unfold. Wildebeests may gather in the thousands, which are euphoric animals that are full of energy. Zebras may crowd in tight groups, so their black and white stripes create a blur and fool predators. Thomson’s gazelles may skip around, bouncing endlessly over the grass. You saw buffalo in Laikipia, but now the herds have multiplied, sometimes 80 individuals marching in unison. Laikipia shows you the animals, and now the Maasai Mara reveals Africa’s wildlife abundance. From July to September, there are more wild, four-legged mammals here than anywhere else on the continent. For every other month of the year, there is still an unfathomable density of life. You will be staying in Mara Naboisho, which is a private conservancy that is adjacent to the Maasai Mara National Reserve. Here, you will see all of the same animals but without any crowds. These quieter plains are very attractive to certain animals, especially spotted cats who are raising their cubs. Local guides take visitors around the same concession each day. This gives them an intimate understanding of different territories, especially where elusive and solitary animals hide. It is not uncommon to encounter more than one leopard or a cheetah on every single drive. Drivers are permitted to take you off the main trails inside the conservancy, and this enhances the intimacy with the animals as you can safely approach all the different wildlife rather than just watching it from the trail. Day four will be spent in the conservancy, experiencing the wonders of the Maasai Mara. From lions battling zebra to cheetah cubs peering from the grass, the destination lives up to its hype. On day five, you will explore Maasai Mara Game Reserve with a full-day game drive and a picnic lunch that will overlook the Mara River. During this experience, you will pass hundreds of thousands of wild mammals. Even when the wildebeest migration is not in the Maasai Mara, the quantity of life makes for continual theater. You may watch animals interact at a watering hole, and you may see another pride of lions. Here, you will feel the wilderness and drift off to the evocative calls of nature."

A hot air balloon will offer you a magnificent aerial perspective with ochre kopjes , or rocky outcrops, contrasting the vast open plains. From here, you witness how herds continually move to fresh pastures. Like everything on a safari, there will be a sense of adventure, but it will also be a serene escape into a world that is so different from your home. You will land for a second breakfast and then fly back to Nairobi. The afternoon and evening will be at your leisure and provide some downtime to reflect on what you have experienced so far."

After Kenya’s open plains, the lush riverine forest will greet you when you land. As you walk through the trees, you can hear your destination. Victoria Falls thunders a baritone growl that echoes into the forest. You can glimpse the falls through the trees before the first viewpoint looks across the canyon as a circular rainbow may appear in the mist. Following a one-mile trail, you will walk parallel to Victoria Falls, stopping at over a dozen viewpoints. You will get so close that mist will rain down and drench you in an instant. Today, you will have the full afternoon at the falls before a quiet evening along the Zambezi riverbank."

Hippos may be spotted directly from the lodge while a nearby park may bring rhino encounters. You may choose to go canoeing on the river with guides skillfully keeping you clear of the hippo pods. There will be an option for a scenic flight above the falls. The most popular activity on a two-day itinerary is to cross the bridge into Zambia and witness the falls from the other side as well as the atmosphere in a different country. All these activities can be arranged locally. The day ends with a sunset cruise on the Zambezi River, which will include food, drinks, and plenty of elephants."

Table Mountain dominates as an imperious ode to nature’s power over urban life. Much of this vacation is spent in the wilderness, so city streets will provide a nice interlude. You can check out boutique cafes, vibrant markets, colorful houses, Atlantic Ocean beaches, and the positive ambiance that makes Cape Town so special. Later in the afternoon, a guide will take you to Table Mountain. You will ascend in a cable car and then walk one of the lesser-known mountaintop trails. You will remain on the summit for sunset before a dip into the city’s superb dining scene."

Your guide narrates fabulous tales of friendship with Mandela, providing an intimate insight into the man’s character and beliefs. Continuing with the cultural theme, you will spend the rest of today exploring Cape Town’s highlight where you will wander the vibrant old neighborhood of Bo Kaap. You can explore the changes that are taking place in District Six, and see some of the early colonial architecture along with the city’s modern and multicultural sides. There will be time left over to visit boutique shops in the V & A Waterfront or the beach in Camps Bay."

        "description": "Today, you will land in Mala Mala, and you will be back among the wildlife. Elephants may use their trunks as trumpets, lions may stare straight into your eyes, and springbok and kudu may skip around the savannah. It will feel good to be back on a safari, experiencing the atmosphere and animals one more time. The Kruger is another of Africa’s most legendary destinations. It is one of the continent’s largest and oldest protected areas with the trans-frontier conservation area larger than the State of New Jersey. Mala Mala is the most wildlife-rich area within this ecosystem thanks to its constant water flow and broad range of vegetation. Within an hour of landing, the diversity of wildlife encounters may be quite remarkable. You will spend three days going on game drives and short game walks in this private conservancy. Again, a private conservancy means more intimate animal encounters and no crowds. There is a strict rule of two vehicles per sighting, and only guests that are staying at a Mala Mala lodge are permitted inside the conservancy. Soon, you will lose track of the lion prides, the buffalo herds, and baboon troops. Now, you can quickly identify hartebeests, impalas, and elands. Giraffes may be so common that they start blending into the landscape. It may feel like zebra and wildebeest are part of every vista. Kruger will live up to its reputation when you safari in one of its private reserves. Mala Mala has the best location of all the Sabi Sands private game reserves as it has the longest border with Kruger National Park. Here you will be deep in the bush and not on the outskirts. Nighttime game drives will also add something new to your experience. Leopards can be abundant and at night, and you may follow them as they prowl for food. You may also encounter peculiar nocturnal creatures, adding more to the list of animals that you have encountered. Most of all, a safari in Mala Mala provides the opportunity to relax. You will sit around a fire with a drink in hand as you watch animals approach the floodlit river below."

Touch down and the mystique captivates, a savanna landscape stretching beyond the horizon. Look closely and nothing is still. An elephant roams alone through the bushwillow trees. Giraffes stand like sentinels to a lost world. Black dots create a patchwork; get closer and they become cinematic buffalo herds. Balule is home to all the revered African animals, making it an indelible place to start a safari. Within the first hour, the questions in your mind have been redefined. It's no longer “will I see this animal and that animal?” but rather, “how many times am I going to encounter them?” After the short transfer from the airstrip, you check into your boutique bush lodge that combines iconic safari luxury with a pristine sense of the wild. Throughout the day, yours is a luxurious base where the safari never stops. Dip into the pool with a zebra herd grazing nearby. Lounge on your wooden verandah and watch life approach the waterhole. Then enjoy two activities a day, game drives and walking safaris that take you across the inspiring big five landscape of Balule. Sharing unfenced boundaries with Kruger National Park, this is a fabled home of all Africa's great mammals. Nothing is guaranteed on a safari.

It rarely does, as the trackers' phenomenal knowledge weaves a path straight to a herd of zebra, then a tower of giraffe, now a grazing kudu herd and the skipping steps of springbok. Every piece of animal dung is understood, every indent in a tree can be analyzed, every change in animal behavior guides your next steps. Walking safaris are all about intimacy. You've seen zebra and kudu before. But now you share the land that they walk on. You meet their eyes, and they move closer, as intrigued by you as you are with them. The experience also focuses on the interaction of life, showcasing how everything in the ecosystem is intrinsically linked. Come to a clearing and an elephant wanders by. It's an old bull, great tusks towering far above you. Stop. Stay silent. Watch it roam by, just 20 meters away.

Its beauty cascades across the northeast of South Africa, winding along the borders of Mozambique and Zimbabwe. The scale baffles. It's home to millions of mammals, including over half the world's wild rhino population. As you journey through the park, you unravel complexities. Mopane savanna provides a haven for elephants and giraffe. The thorn bush is favored by the white rhino. The Lebombo mountain bushveld has its own cast, with wildebeest charging beneath the stare of primates. Rivers wind a serpentine trail, always attracting a congregation of nomads on the move. Remote waterholes are the scenes of ambush, like leopards descending from the bushwillow trees to attack at dusk. Every angle is different, bringing another intimate scene. And it's all connected. Hyenas attacking a carcass at one waterhole means the zebra herds walks straight into a lionesses' trap at another. As you connect the scenes, you appreciate Kruger's scale. Full-day game drives take you on a rugged adventure, bumping across the wild corners of an untouched landscape. You picnic en route, stopping to watch the hippos at lunchtime. Then spend the night at one of the national park's excellent rest camps. These are very comfortable, although not as luxurious as the accommodation in Balule and Sabi Sands. You stay in deluxe cabins with private facilities, with the guide cooking traditional South African barbecues in the evening.

After the thrills of driving through remote Kruger now's a chance to lie back, reenergize, and take in all the enchantment of your accommodation. Of course, the safari never stops. Even from the shower, you'll hear an animal grunting nearby. In the late afternoon, you take a game drive through the surrounding area, where a resident lion pride is among the favorites."

        "description": "A relaxed day, where you create your own safari itinerary. Choose to explore at dawn, or choose to lie in and watch the animal world from your balcony. Guided safari walks are possible, as are unique mountain biking safaris. At this lodge, you create the program based on your mood, connecting the activities that have most inspired you throughout your Kruger trip. In the evening, it's also possible to explore. Drive out beneath the stars and bask in the serenity. The engine is cut. You listen to the clues. Animals breathing, others galloping, a loud grunt from the trees. Slowly your eyes become accustomed, and you pick out the silhouettes. Now the guide flicks on the spotlight, and you realize just how close everything is. Nighttime safaris are a specialty here, a chance to explore a nocturnal world but also feel the thrill of the dark. It's a different realm now, some animals finding opportunity, others with faces coated in fear."

        "description": "Many ponder how long a first-time safari should be. In truth, there should never be a limit. Go once and you immediately want to go again. Spot a leopard out hunting, tick it off your safari list, and you'll still want to witness the same scene again. It doesn't how many times you encounter a rhino; it always leaves you inspired. Similar feelings are evoked when you see a lion's mane or a zebra tenderly caring for her calf. Three days in Kruger allows you to see the different animals. A week or more ensures you can truly appreciate the interactions and complexities. Plus, the longer the safari, the more relaxed the itinerary. Rather than rush to squeeze in all the sights and activities, the pace moves slowly, more in keeping with the rhythm of the environment. The luxury of your lodge provides the serene base to end the experience. But the safari team can customize a day to your exacting mood and interests. Hippos? The guides take you out for a champagne picnic beside a large wallowing pod. Lions? Trackers know in advance where they'll be found. An all-day adventure or two hours of slowly looping around the popular waterholes? Spending nine days in Kruger enables you to try everything, before picking the activities that reflect your dream safari."

        "description": "Into the wild, the plane touching down in the Sabi Sands as elephants watch on. Gaze towards the horizon and giraffe poke their heads above the trees. Transferring to the lodge, you spot springbok jumping around, their fearful antics suggesting that a predator is nearby. Turn a corner and the pride sits serenely, the yawn of a lioness indicating that now isn't the time for a hunt. Sabi Sands is a reserve that borders Kruger National Park, offering all the animals of its larger neighbor in a secluded area. It's an ideal safari starting point, filled with a diversity and abundance that can be seen on short game drives. The transfer to the lodge is just the start, a great myriad of four-legged mammals discovered before you've even checked in. Relax and take lunch at the lodge, continuing the game viewing from a private verandah overlooking the Sand River. Then an afternoon game drive traverses the famed haven of Africa's big five. On the first day, there's often an anticipation of seeing the most famous. Sabi Sands excels on this point. A pair of rhino gracefully wanders past the vehicle, entertaining with their serene stares. Buffalos block the trail, rumbustious beasts that huff noisily. An elephant pride drifts across the landscape, the baby jumping around as it chases a warthog. Now a lion pride, chiefs of their realm, lounging just a couple of meters from the vehicle. Returning to the lodge, there's a flicker in the trees, a tail wiggling around. Look closer. It's a leopard, as content as could be, sleeping with one eye open. While a safari never guarantees you can see certain animals, Sabi Sands always has the abundance to satisfy."

        "description": "Dawn breaks and the Sabi Sands is alive. A herd of elephant is splashing in the Sands River, throwing up ladles of mud and squirting jets of water. They're the attraction as you begin breakfast. But as you sip on a second coffee, a white rhino arrives, its horn a showcase of elegance and power. Inyati Safari Lodge's superb positioning means that the safari never stops; there's always something in the Sand River below, from wallowing hippo pods to an eclectic cast of antelope. Every animal must come to drink. So from a relaxed luxury suite, you can watch the Kruger circle of life unfold. It's particularly mystical at dawn and in the early hours of the evening when spotlights ensure you can savor the nocturnal action of the park. Over the next two days, you enjoy morning and afternoon activities, coinciding with when wildlife is most active. In a four-wheel drive vehicle, you loop across the landscape, initially following the river before crossing an expanse of the iconic savannah. Impala graze tentatively, lionesses wander menacingly, and you're never far from the antics of the park's primate cast. Baboons are shouting ferociously. But why? It doesn't appear to be a conflict between troops. Drive to the space the baboons have vacated, and a cheetah walks furtively through the grass. Spots initially disappear before a slender neck emerges from the green, a look of determination in the mother's eyes. With a Kruger safari, you're not just admiring the different animals. You're immersed in their interaction, appreciating how everything is linked, from baboons warning impala to buffalos and hippos staring each other down beneath your balcony."

Giraffes wander as if in a daze, too serene to be bothered by the quarreling buffalo nearby. Springbok skip with the energy of youth, energized by the morning sun. And the lions are on the move, a pride inspecting the breakfast menu. This is the prime time to see the predators out hunting. Sometimes you follow their movements, other times you arrive to find a bloodied carcass. And sometimes you arrive long after the kill, watching the frenzied battle between hyenas and vultures unfold. Like yesterday, you arrive back at the lodge in the late morning, for a few tranquil hours along the Sand River. Shangaan trackers are constantly watching the landscape, picking up on clues as they maintain an encyclopedic knowledge on what is residing where. They know how to avoid the lions, where to find the zebra, and which sandy routes are safe to take. This afternoon, they lead you on an interpretive bush walk, teaching some of their knowledge while guiding you to intimate moments with the ungulate herds. Travel on foot and you're almost silent. You're also relatively small. So the antelopes are not scared away. They stop to greet you, providing beautiful moments of recognition as you stand just meters from a zebra or impala herd. On some walks, it's even possible to cross elephants and giraffe safely. An armed ranger provides another layer of security to keep you safe through the experience."

Today you spend the day crossing the park, traversing different ecosystems that are havens for diverse characters. Drive through the bushwillow woodlands, revered hangout of the elephant herds, where their tusks roam through the trees. Now along a strip of thorn thickets, where rhinos congregate in astonishing numbers. Kruger is home to over half the world's wild rhino population, and their horns are a constant part of the experience. Next, it's into the bushveld, iconic sweeps of rustic earth and sporadic green, a meeting point for a great variety of life. Picnic here, watching ungulates graze and admiring the hippos that splash in the muddy pools. Your destination is the mountain bushveld of the Lebombo Mountains, a raw and rugged corner of Kruger. It's many miles from civilization, and that's the appeal. The big game experience is complemented by a sense of seclusion, of being alone in the wild African bush. Discreet and delightful, Camp Shonga completes the impressions. With just five luxurious tented suites, it enables you to be fully absorbed in the landscape. Close your eyes and listen. An elephant's trumpet, a hippo's wheeze-honk, a herd of zebra munching, monkeys yapping; there's always a resonant soundtrack to keep you company in Kruger."

The focus at Shonga is on really understanding this environment and the guides unveil the rhythm of the bush. Game drives offer the intimate encounters of course, but they also showcase how everything is connected in the wild. Settle into the landscape's beat, rest in the heat of the day and explore when the cool air brings everyone to life. In such a remote place, the experience is never interrupted by another safari vehicle or group of tourists."

After two hours in the heart of Cape Town, you take the boat to Robben Island, where the desolation is a stark contrast. This is where Nelson Mandela and many ANC members were incarcerated for 18 years; an ex-inmate takes you on an inspiring tour that's filled with stories. Return to the mainland for lunch in the city, on an al fresco terrace along Kloof Street. Completing the Cape Town tour is the ultimate aerial experience, a cable car taking you to Table Mountain's summit. Everything stretches out from here; a chain of peaks cascading towards Africa's southwestern point, deserted beaches rolling north, city suburbs glistening in the Cape Town sun. You'll return to the hotel in the late afternoon and the rest of the day is at your leisure."

Throughout the day and night, this water source is visited by a large proportion of Malilangwe four-legged residents, so you just need to sit back, recharge the batteries after the flight, and enjoy your first impressions of the Kruger’s diversity. An afternoon game drive will provide exhilarating sights as you come face to face with rhinos and lion prides for the first time, along with the enchanting cast of antelopes.

Or follow the scents, and you encounter elephants bulldozing through the trees. Oribi, suni, steenbok, wildebeest; this is a reserve that supports a fabulous array of ungulates and the day’s game drives should acquaint you with a dozen different species. Come between November to March, and you’ll also be enchanted by the sight of tens of millions of red quelea, moving in flocks that look like dark clouds. Visit any time of year, and there’s a great chance of spotting black and white rhinos together, something that’s extremely rare in Africa.

Weave through the ironwood and mahogany trees, admiring the giraffes that poke above the canopy and the elephants that bash fresh trails through the forest. Drive along the edge of swamps and marshland, where antelope move with a troubled inelegance. Then rise to the summit of the Chilojo Cliffs and admire the landscape from the scorched red sandstone. Gonarezhou is one of Southern Africa’s least visited parks, although the infrastructure has really developed in the last few years. It’s rare to see another vehicle or visitor, something that helps keep the wild atmosphere in full focus. Sometimes you can drive for 15 or 20 minutes without seeing anything. But then you turn a corner, and there’s an animal party filling the savanna. This is a destination that’s unknown to the world, yet an integral piece of the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park."

It’s a wild mopane savanna stretching for thousands of square miles, home to upwards of a million animals. And it’s where you’ll find the Kruger at its surprisingly best. Distances are large, and the game drive will take the full day. You’ll need a little patience, as sometimes you see nothing. But embrace an adventurous spirit and the scenes seemingly come straight from a wildlife documentary. Spot some rustling in the shrubs and watch a white rhino emerge. Drive a few meters further, and there’s another eight of them, standing majestic, staring you down.

Continue a little further, and the rugged trail is blocked by a zebra herd, a black and white mirage that scatters as you peddle faster. Slow down as you pass a giraffe, and then freewheel down the mountain as nomadic elephants grace the panoramas. Return to the lodge for lunch and a dip in the pool before a late-afternoon walking safari. Like the cycling, the guides lead you away from the predators and provide an intimate look at the Kruger’s herbivores. In particular, there are thousands upon thousands of wildebeest out here, along with vast numbers of impala, springbok, and kudu.

This is a private reserve, so you’re able to go off the trail, the driver skillfully bringing you close to the fallen zebra.

Perhaps zebras galloping into the distance, elephants locking trunks at a waterhole, or the flowing mane of a grandiose male lion? Or maybe your safari daydreams feature hippos along the river, giraffes wandering past the vehicle, or a leopard hiding high in a tree? Timbavati responds to all these preconceptions and much more. Located on the western side of the Greater Kruger ecosystem and sharing an unfenced boundary with Kruger National Park, this is a game reserve that offers a wonderful diversity of wildlife. Such a varied roll call of animals makes it a perfect first-time safari destination. Even on the game drive from the airstrip to the lodge, you’re likely to encounter many of the animals from the top of your wish list. Your international flight lands at O. R. Tambo International in Johannesburg, Africa’s largest airport. After clearing immigration, you transfer onto a local flight to the Timbavati Airstrip, where you’re picked up in an open-sided safari vehicle. It’s a thrilling journey to your luxury safari camp accommodation, one that may even include the complete Big Five. Sit down to a sumptuous lunch then spend an hour or two relaxing in your suite. Then an afternoon game drive continues the relaxed unraveling of wild Africa, leading you past elephants, lions, buffalos, zebras, and giraffes. Returning for sundowners, you’ll already know how to recognize up to half a dozen different antelope species.

Fresh tea and coffee are delivered to your private deck, along with a light snack to get you going. Early morning is the prime time to explore the bush, as many of the predators are on the prowl before the heat of the day kicks in. Spend an hour seeking out lions, cheetahs, and leopards, with an expert guide and tracker revealing their intimate knowledge of the landscape. They know where particular prides hang out, or where a leopard likes to hunt wildebeest. Then enjoy a hearty breakfast beneath a majestic bushwillow tree, a chance to energize, stretch your legs, and listen to the chirping of the endemic birds. On each morning, there’s an option to continue the safari adventure in the safari vehicle, or on foot. It’s your choice, as the program is fully flexible to your interests. You return to camp in the late morning. Relax and unwind on the viewing deck, take a snooze or check out the library, then indulge in an excellent lunch. When the heat of the day is dissolving away, you head out for a late-afternoon game drive. Explore at leisure, stopping for canapés and refreshments as the wonders of wild Africa gradually reveal themselves. Relatively unique to Timbavati, the game drive will continue after sunset, giving you some time to spot nocturnal animals.

At other times, you find lionesses on the prowl, or a pride tearing apart a zebra carcass. On every game drive, you’ll encounter hundreds of buffalo. But that’s nothing like seeing hundreds of buffalo congregating in one giant herd, with the guides getting you close enough to hear their hissing, exhaled breath. In such an abundant landscape, every few moments are going to bring fresh and exciting scenes. Game drives allow you to get close to the giants and the predators. This is when you see the most revered of safari scenes, such as the hunt, or animals mating. The guided walks move at a very slow pace and help you experience flora and fauna from a new angle. You’ll track different antelope, like kudu, springbok, and eland, along with gaining a detailed understanding of how each animal move.

Stop beside a bushwillow and gaze up at a leopard that’s draped across the highest branches. It returns your gaze, resplendent blue eyes shining through the foliage. Then it descends, bounding down the trunk and heading off on a hunt. You follow at a respectful distance, goosebumps rising on your arms as the spotted hunters attack a herd of wildebeest. Sometimes it’s a success, and the leopard emerges carrying a carcass. At other times a sentinel raises the alarm, and you watch a herd scatter in fear. An African safari isn’t about seeing animals in isolation. By spending seven days, you’ve become engrossed in their world, settled into the ambiance of a landscape untouched by man or time. The experience isn’t about spotting and photographing an elephant. It’s about watching a herd interact as you take breakfast in the bush. It’s about snoozing on your balcony as zebras splash gleefully in the lake below, or hearing two lions roar then spotting the lioness they’re fighting over. Each visitor to the Greater Kruger will be treated to different scenes and that’s why this is unlikely to be your last safari.

From here, there are a number of options in the heart of the city as the tour can be tailored to your mood. Visit markets, wander the streets of colorful neighborhoods, and sip sundowners at rooftop bars overlooking the ocean."

        "description": "Today’s journey leads you to the southwestern tip of Africa. You’ll journey in the reverse direction of most Cape Point tours, therefore avoiding the traffic and peak times at the lighthouse and penguins. Start by cutting through the city to the coastal village of Muizenberg, then onwards to Boulders Beach in Simons Town. One wooden walkway leads you to a huge colony of jackass penguins, hundreds upon hundreds of them delighting the camera. But another, lesser-known path, leads you onto a beach, where penguins waddle between the boulders. There is fewer of the charming creatures here, but no barriers. So jump into the water and swim with the playful characters. Drive onwards towards the Cape of Good Hope, where two lighthouses mark the tip of Africa. There’s a deserted white beach for enjoying a light snack while savoring the views. Then you wind back towards the city, stopping for a more substantial lunch at a vineyard overlooking the seemingly endless Noordhoek Beach. Traveling this way provides the best vistas as you take Chapman’s Peak Drive back to Cape Town. Clinging to the mountain, this remarkable road seems to literally stand over the ocean. The vistas will linger long in your memory, and the cute fishing village of Hout Bay provides a delightful optional stop before you reach the city."

        "description": "From Cape Town International Airport, you board a direct flight to the Sabi Sands, where the transfer to your lodge provides an introduction of what’s to come. Elephants roam, rhinos plod past the vehicle, and there are thousands of springbok and kudu skipping about. An afternoon game drive continues the immersion, and the focus is on moving slowly, taking your time with every scene. Lions bask beneath shady acacia trees; rhinos send goosebumps across your arm, and buffalo herds seem to inhabit every corner. On a first journey, there’s almost too much to take in, with so many animals inhabiting the resplendent savannah. Sabi Sands is a collection of private reserves, all unfenced and opening out onto Kruger National Park. Animals move freely, and many come to settle in the Sabi Sands, due to the permanent Sabi and Sand rivers. Your lodge has an ideal location in the heart of it all, with your suite expertly positioned to enjoy the show. From a private balcony, you can watch the wildlife roam by, from trunk-swinging elephants to rumbustious hippos that emerge at sunset. Accommodation is full board, and every meal is taken in a different location within the reserve. Over these three days, you’ll enjoy picnics in the bush, dinners beneath the stars, and breakfasts overlooking the Big Five."

You can see the springboks; their ears alert for danger, yet their senses not picking up the hunter. Watch the scene play out, tension rising as the predator seeks out breakfast. A little later on the drive, you stop by a thicket, waiting for a rhino mother and calf to emerge. Time seems to stand still and only ten minutes later do you turn around and spot the elephant herd; they’ve been feeding on the trees just 20 meters away. Over these two days, you enjoy a privately guided safari. There are options for daytime and nighttime game drives, as well as the choice for a short walking safari. Each day is tailored, and by building a relationship with the guides, you can seek out anything that’s been missed. Buffalos become such a regular sight that you hardly stop, while the profusion of lions and leopards makes the Sabi Sands a legendary destination. A safari in the Greater Kruger takes you far beyond the Big Five. You’re enveloped by life, admiring how everything interacts on an untouched savannah. This is a safari that puts you on the center stage in a wild world, where big cats are seen hunting their prey and large herds clash at the waterhole. These three days will reveal more than you could possibly imagine. You’ll see animals mating, antelope fighting, and giants sending out echoed calls."

By covering a large distance, you move through the realms of many lion prides, along with seeking out waterholes favored by elephant herds. Take a picnic and stop beside a pool filled with hippos, watch giraffes as they lope into the distance, and find a cheetah perched on a cliff.

Colors shine in the morning light, the aesthetics of a world wonder painting a majestic picture below. Touch down, and when the propellers cease, you hear the rumble, the growling roar of the world’s most powerful waterfall almost deafening. A self-guided walking trail takes you alongside the falls, and the visuals are accompanied by sound, as well as the soft smell of freshly falling water.

Mala Mala is the largest and has the best location. Why? It is on the water on a border with the national park, so essentially, it is deeper in the wilderness and in a natural wildlife corridor, rather than being on the outskirts of the conservation area. Location is everything, and it makes Mala Mala the ultimate of all South Africa’s safari destinations. Your lodge is traditional in style, without the same decadent extras as its neighbors, but with close to a century of providing high-end hospitality. Touch down and immerse yourself in this intimate world. Go out tracking leopards, as there is nowhere better in Africa to see the spotted cats, and then stay out after dark to follow the predatory cats as they eye up their prey. Back at the lodge, the safari continues, a floodlight illuminating the river and all those that come to drink."

These experiences are what make certain destinations really stand out. Rather than see animals in isolation, you are immersed in the ongoing interaction. It is not an elephant, it is a boisterous young male elephant getting told off by the patriarch. That is not just a leopard, it is a mother hiding two cubs in a treetop den."

So you might see the same lionesses or hyena, experiencing how they act differently based on when they last ate. Game drives are rugged and wild, but it is calm back at the lodge, as you sit around a campfire as buffalo take a drink in the river below. You will also remember the exclusivity.

        "title": "Cape Town – The Explorer’s Beginnings",
        "description": "Land in Cape Town with the excitement of an explorer beginning their expedition. The roadway opens and practically guides you to beautiful Victoria and Albert Waterfront. The smell of fresh muscles stewing in garlic lines the walkway, emanating from the luscious restaurant Quay 4. The boardwalk is filled with crowded restaurants; the happy sound of boisterous diners travels along the walkway. The water is a cool, pearl blue. Table Mountain lingers above the city like a bodyguard ready to be scaled, and the colors of Cape Town shine from below. The clouds drift over the top of the mountain looking like a tablecloth being draped over the table. The Victorian Dutch architecture decorates much of the city, the multi-tiered buildings lined with balconies where people lounge in the shade and watch the world below them pass by. Settle into your accommodation at the luxurious hotel located at the Victoria and Albert Waterfront. The colors of Table Mountain shift from deep brown to a burning red. Lion’s Head Mountain neighbors the table and points high into the air as the sun drifts over the ocean. Look over the water at the sunset, the lights along the boardwalk reflect in the calm harbor. The buzz of the waterfront slowly drifts away with the remnants of the day. But your excitement never wavers; you know the adventure is just beginning."

        "title": "Cape Town – Expeditions Rising",
        "description": "Join your guide to explore and experience the surrounding beauty of the Western Cape Province. Journey to the southernmost point of the African continent where explorers have passed for centuries on their way from Europe to Asia. The water is just as sweet as the breeze that rushes through the air. Standing along Cape Point summit you can see the actual southern tip of Africa pointing to where the two waters, the Atlantic and the Indian Oceans, converge. The gentle crash of waves along the rocky point rises from below. The air is otherwise quiet except for the occasional rush from the breeze. The water is a deep blue connoting its depths and cold temperature. A tour to Seal Island will take you from Hout Bay to the enigmatic island covered with seals, seals often smothering one another. Their barks and head-bobbing cannot be missed. Birds soar around the sand sometimes landing in the open spaces between the masses of seals. The seals’ noses are tiny, their whiskers stretch long, and they rush from the sand to the water to cool themselves from the hot sun. Continue your explorations of the Western Cape and its exceptional wonders with a visit to Boulders Bay. The African penguin colony is large, adorable, and loud as you make your stride along the boardwalk to see them in their natural, if somewhat odd, habitat. It is understandable to wonder how and why penguins are inhabiting the African continent but these penguins, affectionately known to locals as jackass penguins because of the awkward, donkey-like bray that can be heard from beyond the boardwalk, thrive in the cold waters and warm sun. They fly fast through and dive deep beneath the waves. They build nests in the warm sand from February to August and molt from November to December. Discover the fun and beauty of the penguins along with the southern tip of the continent knowing that there is so much more to be experienced."

        "title": "Cape Town – Urban Explorers",
        "description": "There is never an end to exploration, especially in the urban centers. Today explore Cape Town’s hidden, and not so hidden, treasures with a personal guided tour of the city. Concealed in central Cape Town, beyond the hustle and bustle, is the neighborhood of Bo-Kaap. Currently it is filled with Cape Town’s Malaysian neighborhood, but is truly multicultural, tucked safely in the shadow of Lion’s Head along the foothills of the range. The cobblestoned streets guide you to the lively neighborhood filled with brightly colored homes dating back almost 300 years in some cases. The buildings are so bright that they glisten in the sunlight and almost glow in the dark. Many mosques, including the first Muslim Mosque in South Africa, call Bo-Kaap their home. Their spires rise above the homes and the soothing chant of the call to prayer moves through the streets. With your guide urging you forward you will visit the District Six Museum. District Six was originally a bustling community mixed with freed slaves, merchants, artisans, laborers, and immigrants. However, by the 20th century the government began the process of removals and marginalization. The removal and relocation of District Six was satirized and metaphorically memorialized in the movie District 9. The museum was intended to create a space that would enable a reaffirmation of identity, to celebrate the heritage of those that had lived, thrived, or perished in the district, along with allowing for a place where people could confront the complexities of South Africa’s history. The museum is warm and quiet except for the shallow breaths of people literally reading the writing on the wall. The beauty of South Africa’s history is mixed with tumult but it is the country’s past that has led to its majestic present. Every explorer uncovers the dark pasts of their excavated worlds; however, it is beauty that brings about change. Travel to the top of Table Mountain on the rotating gondola that gives you the amazing panorama of the Cape of Good Hope. The bustle of the city is set far below you. The color of Long Street and the Company’s Gardens stand out as if floating above the rest of the city. Victoria and Albert Waterfront shines along the harbor. With every breath you take the cool air of Table Mountain helps the stunning present come back, and the wonderful excitement of South Africa is once again ready to explore."

        "title": "Cape Town – An Unlikely Prisoner",
        "description": "Today you will make your way to Robben Island on a tour of the old prison where Nelson Mandela was once confined. The ferry leaves from Victoria and Albert Waterfront close to your accommodation. The sea breeze rolls through the ferry filling the deck with a salty sweet air. The water is a beautiful blue that tumbles around the ferry, mist lifting into the air. From a distance the island is a beautiful mix of green and gold, surrounded by the deep blue ocean. The surreal feeling settles over the people on the ferry as it docks at Robben Island. The pleasant journey, the beautiful scenery; they mix with the stone walls and the large towers, a reminder of what was once there. A former occupant of Robben Island will guide you through the prison and around the grounds. The gentle water laps at the surrounding beaches, the sun is warm in the sky, but deep in the concrete prison cells you are able to experience some of the plight of the former inmates, including the late Nelson Mandela. The history of the island is a reflection of the history of South Africa; however, the history of the island is also a reflection of South Africa’s evolved present and bright future."

        "title": "Stellenbosch – The World Around",
        "description": "Depart from the lovely city of Cape Town, leaving behind the uncovered beauty but not the experience. You will head to the world-famous Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens, a lush complex of gardens filled with the indigenous plants of Southern Africa, nuzzled at the eastern foot of Table Mountain. The mountaintops hover over the garden’s edge. The garden supports the natural forest along with numerous indigenous animals and birds. The riot of color cries out from the blooming and blossomed flowers. The vibrant colors of yellow, fiery-orange, and reddish-purple, shine in the warm sun. Flowers that resemble sea anemones glow, their pistils a stunning rich purple while their petals are thin and pink, swirling upward to their bulbous tips. From the lush gardens to the luscious winelands, spend the remainder of the day exploring the incredible Stellenbosch region. One of the oldest towns in the Western Cape, Stellenbosch boasts some of the best restaurants and wine in the region, let alone the country. Vineyards stretch along the valley’s floor to the foothills of the mountains. Olive groves intermingle with grapevines. The sweet smell of ripening grapes flows along the country roads. Trust your guides as they take you to some of the best tasting-rooms to experience the wines like a local. Try the Ernie Els Sauvignon Blanc 2013. The wine swirls around your glass and the nose bursts with fig and a medley of tropical fruit. The palate is rich and elegant, fruit-driven and complex. Explore more of the vineyard’s beautiful productions or settle in with a full glass and the view of the vines from the window."

        "description": "Every exploration brings with it hunger and tasty treats. With the day at your leisure, why not partake in a hands-on cooking experience? Apprentice for a day under the chef that created the renaissance of Cape Malay cuisine. Mixing the aromatics and spices of Indian and Indonesian cuisine with a hint of African vibrancy, Cape Malay cuisine has wrapped its arms around the hearts and palates of the Western Cape Province and refuses to let go. Cumin and pepper fill the kitchen. The beautiful red of paprika fills the bowl. Cinnamon adds a hint of spice to the plate. The rich crunch of a samosa is paired with a crisp white wine where the floral citrus helps balance the vegetable-filled pastry. With an unlimited amount of options to explore, the day is yours to do with it what you’d like, whether winetasting, golfing, relaxing by the pool, or so much more. No matter what your decision, it will be a fabulous choice."

        "title": "Sabi Sands – A Total Safari Exploration",
        "description": "Today you will transfer from the Western Cape province to the stunning African beauty of Sabi Sands, a private game reserve close to Kruger National Park. On the ground and ready for adventure, climb into the vehicle as your guide takes you through the incredible bush of Sabi Sands. The savannah stretches in every direction, a golden field full of life ready to be discovered. The Big Five refers to the five most dangerous animals to hunt in Africa: rhino, elephant, lion, leopards, and Cape buffalo. Each animal lingers in the bush and around watering holes, some grazing on the grass, others waiting for an opportunity to pounce. Your vehicle tumbles over the dirt paths. The smell of golden grass rushes through the open vehicle. The breeze is cool in the warm afternoon. Sabi Sands is one of the best locations to view the elusive leopard. Its golden coat spotted with black dots blends into the trees beneath the canopy, hiding from the hot sun. You can spot its paw or tail dangling lazily off a branch as it watches out for a wandering impala or careless zebra. The sun sets along the savannah and turns the golden grass a stunning orange. Enjoy a cool drink in the sunset lounging in the cooling air, as the reddish sun bleeds along the horizon. When the sun has set you will traverse the grounds in the dark, a spotlight shining along the tall grass as you listen and watch for nocturnal life in the park. Large cats, such as leopards and lions, come alive in the cool evenings. Aardvarks and pangolins graze along fallen branches and feed on termites. Genets, long spotted animals similar to mongoose, dive into the bushes to hide from the oncoming lights and the dark nightlife of Sabi Sands comes to bright life with you there to witness the whole thing."

        "description": "Wake up to the beautiful wild sound of starlings chirping in the distance. The sun is about to rise, the smell of fresh roasted coffee takes you from your room. The cup is warm in your hands during the cold morning dark. The taste is rich and comforting. The sun rises slowly along the horizon bringing in the bright blue of a warm day. Follow the sound of playful lion growls, the noise coming from the active cubs climbing on and over their mothers. The vehicle travels off the road venturing into the bush so that you can see the cubs in the stretching morning. The cubs have pale brown fur and their size and light spots indicate their youth. The mother grabs the cubs gently between her teeth, lays them beneath her paws and begins to lick, grooming them, the cubs’ fur sticking up with each lick. The male lion lies still on the far side, his mane brown mixed with red. The sound of his shallow breathing releases like a huff. The cubs begin to purr; the sun is now high in the air, and the pride begins to move toward shade to hide from the afternoon heat."

        "description": "With the lion spotting fueling your excitement, begin another day with a warm, delicious cup of coffee readying you for the sun’s rise and the wildlife’s activity. Venture back out into the bush in search of the incredible wildlife that has yet to reveal themselves in the golden fields of the savannah. The sweet smell of acacia trees fills the reserve. The rustle of bushes gives the guide warning as he points out a heard of elephant feeding on the brush. The matriarch stands tall and proud, her trunk stretching through the trees and tearing the leaves away. Adolescent elephants follow suit still learning how to properly act like an elephant; their trunks stretch as high as they can reach to feed themselves while imitating the older elephants. They traipse through the brush, pulling up smaller trees to mark a path. They stomp along the road for an unimpeded walk until they eventually make their way back into the bush, through the trees and vanish into the savannah as quickly as they had appeared."

        "title": "Johannesburg – Never an End To Exploration",
        "description": "On your final day in Sabi Sands you will once again explore the depths of the savannah in search of the majestic life that wanders in the bush. The elephants trumpet, the lions roar, and the impala call out in the morning sun. The calls and cries of the savannah morning will be as memorable as the savannah itself as you make your way through the park. Cape buffalo meander along the watering hole slobbering up water and grazing on the grass. White egrets stand beneath the buffalos’ girth and peck at what the grass leaves behind as it’s tugged from the earth, the bugs that are pulled from the mud below. The smell of fresh grass fades as you make your way out of the Sabi Sands and to the KMI airport. Whether heading to Johannesburg for the end of this particular South African exploration or being whisked away to another exotic location, the choice is yours whether you would like to extend your trip or venture back home. Visit the South African safari reviews for ideas on trip extensions. Either way, the explorer in you, the one who has traveled the globe and ventured through the incredible majesty of South Africa, will never settle for anything less than another expedition; if not now, soon. When that next adventure begins, the excitement of the new adventure will mix with the memories of this one."
