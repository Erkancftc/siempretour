    "generalInfo": "This India safari holiday travels to three of India’s most prestigious Tiger Reserves, in search of these beautiful big cats. You’ll enjoy game drives in Bandhavgarh, Kanha and Pench National Parks, which are all found in the state of Madhya Pradesh. You will also have time to explore New Delhi at the start of this holiday, so you can see some of this great city’s famous sights. From here, fly to tiger country.<br/><br/>Tigers are not the only species you can hope to see while on safari. These three national parks are home to leopards, sloth bears and wild dogs, too, as well as Indian gaur, sambhar, wild boar, cheetal, languor and a huge number of birds. This safari holiday supports local conservation work, through membership of TOFT Tigers (Travel Operators for Tigers). <br/><br/>November, February, March and April are the best times to go on tiger safari in India. May can be very hot, but wildlife sightings are great now as undergrowth dies back and animals head to dwindling water supplies to drink. October is also possible, while December and January tend to be less busy and popular, but morning game drives in open jeeps are cold.<br/><br/>Do chat to us about your interests and requirements and together we can create the perfect trip. The accommodation is four star, with a mix of lodge styles throughout the holiday, but you can upgrade to five star. Families are welcome and children under 12 years enjoy a 50% discount on adult prices. There are no hidden extras, and we aim to give you an all-inclusive price, with any later additions clearly shown on your itinerary. <br/>",

Rich in culture, architecture, lush gardens, and human diversity, the city’s storied past is reflected in its grand monuments, museums, and galleries.

Your day of exploration is split into two parts, each offering a unique perspective on this dynamic capital—accompanied throughout by a private guide.

    "generalInfo": "There are few animals in the world that evoke such imagery and emotion as the sleek, glossy form of a jet black panther walking through vibrant green jungle. But for many years the idea of seeing one of these unusual leopards in the wild was a pipe dream. But then a dominant male leopard in a place called Kabini, part of Nagarhole National Park in Southern India changed all of that. <br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>When thinking of the vast subcontinent of India from an environmental point of view it is often easy to think of a thriving sea of humanity and great swathes of land cleared for rice production and large landfills where poor Indian children collect items they can sell for pittance; all of this mixed with the horror stories of tiger poaching.<br/><br/>The very idea of there being large and well protected populations of wildlife and big ecosystems still home to a great variety of wildlife seems strange. But that is the case in some areas of southern India, the Western Ghats region is home to many species of wildlife and some of the last large populations of megafauna. This trip will focus on one such place, the stunning Nagahole National Park. This is a largely forested areas and home to a diverse collection of wildlife.<br/><br/>This tour is focused, not on just one species but actually one individual animal, there is a large male leopard that occupies a territory in the tourism zone near Kabini. Over the last few years this particular leopard has become globally famous and also one of the most sought after and photographed animals in the world. The reason being that this particular male leopard is melanistic. Meaning that it has a special gene which results the general colour pattern of leopards (yellowish with black rosettes) not being present; instead the rosettes are hidden under a dark pelage of jet black.<br/><br/>This is of course the famed and fabled black leopard, black panther the living incarnation of Bagheera from Rudyard Kipling’s Jungle Books himself.<br/>We have a high success rate of around 90% in seeing this black panther (as well as one or two other black panthers that are also in the area) and we hope to continue this success for your tour and many more in the future.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Bangalore. There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. We have great photographer guides for this and out other wildlife photography trips; this photography guide will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through India and particularly Kabini. Your photographer guide or naturalist escort is an expert in the wildlife of Kabini and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing as well as getting perfect pictures. <br/><br/>The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching and wildlife photography locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the park. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>This tour is recommended for mid November - mid December as this is during this time of year that the national park authorities clear the overgrowth of vegetation from the seasonal monsoon and so there is increased visibility into the forest and also the removal of the vegetation allows for increased big cat activity as they are out and scent marking their territories more.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife photography holidays are guided by an experienced wildlife photographers as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>• Our wildlife photographer guide that escorts all our safaris has great experience working with and photographing wild animals all over the world and in particular the wildlife of India.<br/>• Our local Indian guides around Kabini have a good relationship with the park officials and because of this we get a heads up when animals are sighted and this can guide us in where to focus and thus increasing our chances of seeing our targeted species.<br/>• Visit the park morning and afternoon in your own private jeep for your group only.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our wildlife photography and Indian big cat safaris a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout India so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the tigers, leopards, sloth bears, dhole and many more species. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of India at other times of year and focusing on other species such as striped hyena and snow leopards, Indian one-horned rhinos, Western Ghats endemics, elephants, primates, Asiatic lions and many species throughout this incredible country. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour is completely focused on one region within one national park and tiger reserve, the Kabini region of Nagarhole National Park. It is located in Karnataka state. We will fly in and out of Bangalore, which is your entry and exit point for the trip.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from a vehicle. So no physical fitness for hiking or anything like that is needed. This is a very easy trip to undertake.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 Years Old<br/><br/>Photo Credits:<br/>Davidvraju, CC BY-SA 4.0 <br/>Ranjith Kumar 2016, CC BY-SA 4.0 <br/>Jaya Krishna, CC BY-SA 4.0 <br/>Kirti Ranjan Nayak, CC BY-SA 4.0 <br/>Dheerajmnanda, CC BY-SA 4.0<br/>Scott Hyman",

These tours range from the dry desert regions of Gujarat in search of striped hyena and Asiatic lions to the icy peaks of the Himalayas on the quest for snow leopards.

But it is not just the wildlife of India that makes India such a great holiday destination, but the varied and unique culture is also a focus for our trips.  <br/><br/>This tour is a specialist tiger safari of one of the best locations in the world for tigers and a host of other large mammals in India. Tadoba Andhari National Park has one of the highest density of wild tigers in the world. As well as the large population of tigers the park is also home to a great range of other species of predators, which are seen more readily here than many other locations in India. These are leopards, dhole and sloth bear. These predators live alongside their prey such as guar, barasingha, chital, sambar, wild boar and many other species.<br/><br/>Because this tour is only focused on Tadoba National Park you can add on extensions to also visit many of the cultural highlights such as the Taj Mahal or Old Delhi.

Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through India and particularly Tadoba. Your naturalist escort is an expert in tigers and their conservation and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. We will also employ a specific cultural guide for all sightseeing of temples and monuments.<br/><br/>The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, river safaris, spotlighting, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the park. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>This tour is recommended for February - May as this is the dry season and the chances of seeing tigers is much higher in the dry season. However the temperatures from April onward can be very hot and humid. You can visit this park and enjoy the itinerary between October – June. The park is closed during the monsoon season.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• Our local Indian guides around Tadoba have a good relationship with the park officials and because of this we get a heads up when animals are sighted and this can guide us in where to focus and thus increasing our chances of seeing our targeted species.<br/>• Visit the park morning and afternoon in your own private jeep for your group only.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our wildlife and tiger safaris of India a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout India so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the tigers, leopards, sloth bears, dhole and many more species. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of India at other times of year and focusing on other species such as brown and snow leopards, Indian one-horned rhinos, Western Ghats endemics, elephants, primates, Asiatic lions and many species throughout this incredible country. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour is completely focused on one national park and tiger reserve, Tadoba. It is located in Maharasthra. We will fly in and out of Mumbai, which is your entry and exit point for the trip.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from a vehicle. So no physical fitness for hiking or anything like that is needed. This is a very easy trip to undertake.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 12 Years Old",

The wildlife sojourn starts at one of the most special Eastern Himalayan Landscapes, the Singalila National Park. This is the best place in India to see the elusive firefox or Red Panda. The Red Panda is a mammal native to Eastern Himalayas and Southwest China. The Red Panda has been classified as Endangered by the IUCN because its wild population is estimated at less than 10,000 mature individuals living in the wild. Singalila is one of its last strong holds and it is also the best place in India to see this elusive and rare mammal. Red Pandas are best found at an altitude ranging from 2,500 meters to 4,000 meters, and this part of the journey will be conducted at this altitude. <br/><br/>After a 5 nights quest to search for the elusive Red Panda the journey continues to Kaziranga National Park, a UNESCO world heritage site which was declared a tiger reserve in 2006. Kaziranga is a paradise for megafauna. It is stronghold for the endangered Indian One Horned Rhino with over 2,600 (2/3 of the global population) residing in its grassland and floodplain habitat. Apart from rhinos, it is home to many mammal species, including tigers, elephants, Asiatic wild buffalo, leopard, bears, swamp deer, hog deer, hoolock gibbons, smooth coated otters and a high diversity of birds. <br/><br/>The next and final stop on this journey is another UNESCO world heritage site and the largest mangrove forest in the world, the Sunderban Tiger Reserve. Nestled in the delta of the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna rivers, this intricate landscape is home to the elusive Royal Bengal tiger, as well as a wealth of other wildlife including saltwater crocodiles, wild boars, and a myriad of bird species. Visitors can embark on thrilling boat safaris that weave through the forest’s dense, tidal channels, offering glimpses of the rare flora and fauna in their natural habitat. A journey through the Sundarbans is not just a chance to witness its unparalleled biodiversity but also an opportunity to engage with the rich cultural tapestry and traditions of the communities living in harmony with this wild, ever-changing landscape.",

On the three game drives you will be accompanied by an expert naturalist guide.  <br/><br/>The holiday cost includes bed and breakfast accommodation, driver guide and air conditioned vehicle in Delhi and Agra, entrance fees, transfers and overnight air conditioned rail journey. During your time in Kanha National Park you will stay in a luxury lodge, with all meals, game drives, park and naturalist guide fees included. <br/><br/>Please note that as this is a tailor made itinerary, we can always adapt it to your needs and interests. For example, many of our guests include an additional day or two to Varanasi and Khajuraho’s temples. Please do not hesitate to contact us to discuss any further ideas. <br/>",

    "generalInfo": "This tailor made trip has been crafted by a local company that specialises in Gujarat wildlife, such as the much sought after Asiatic lions, blackbuck and wild asses. The nine day itinerary has been carefully crafted to allow plenty of time in each of the Gujarat national parks. With one full day in Velavadar National Park, famous for its beautiful blackbuck and two days in Gir National Park where the Asiatic lions take centre stage. Gir was given protected status as far back as 1900 when, after being used as a trophy hunting ground for years, the lion population was reduced to almost zero. Since then, hunting lion has been illegal and the legacy of committed conservation still stands here.  A night time safari at Gir is a highlight for many of our guests. <br/><br/>At Velavadar NP, game drives will not only bring you in contact with over 1500 blackbuck but also wolves and jackals, although a night time safari is the time to spot the latter. There is rich birdlife, such as the lesser florican, a large bird in the bustard family that thrives in these grassland habitats.  <br/><br/>In addition to the national parks, we also include the unique habitats of the Little Rann of Kutch in our itinerary, a saline desert that is famous for being one of the last places on earth where you can see the beautiful Indian wild ass. Other stunning wild mammals to catch sight of include the chinkara, desert fox, jackals, caracals, nilgais and striped hyenas. It is also home to over three hundred bird species, with flamingos and pelicans creating a fine sight as well as many migratory birds arriving in over the Gulf of Kutch. Our visit to the Rann region also allows us to spend time with the tribal groups still living very traditional lifestyles here. <br/><br/>As this is a tailor made trip, we are happy to accommodate your interests and needs, starting the holiday in Delhi or Mumbai, for example, or adding additional days to take in other experiences such as a night time leopard safari. <br/>",

    "generalInfo": "Gujarat is home to India's driest national parks, but they are full of wildlife and surprisingly diverse. This trip focuses on Asiatic lions, striped hyena, Indian wolves and other predators that are found in the arid lands of this wonderful Indian state.<br/><br/>The very idea of there being large and well protected populations of wildlife and big ecosystems in India still seems strange. But that is the case in most of Gujarat, a largely desert state in the north west of the country, bordering Pakistan to the west.<br/><br/>To help preserve this incredible diversity, Gujarat has various protected areas including wildlife sanctuaries, national parks, reserves and large community concessions which have been established to integrate humans with wildlife in the most harmonious way possible.<br/><br/>Many of the protected areas in Gujarat support large mammals including Asiatic wild ass, striped hyena, blackbuck, leopard, nilgai, Indian wolf and of course the iconic and last remaining Asiatic lions; which is testament to the state's conservation ethic.<br/><br/>About the tour:<br/>This two week itinerary is split into four mini-sections so as to properly explore the most impressive national parks and wilderness areas. We start with the fantastic and vast Rann of Kutch in the middle of the Thar Desert and spend three nights in both the Little and Greater Rann of Kutch. Here we will search for the endemic Asiatic wild ass as well as the rare and elusive Indian wolf before we head to the last stronghold of the critically endangered Asiatic lion in Sasan Gir National Park. Reduced to a couple of dozen at the turn of the 19th Century they have now been protected enough to have a population numbering over 400. From here we visit the reserve of Velavadar National Park which was originally set up to protect and conserve blackbuck antelopes. As well as the blackbuck we will also be on the look out for seldom seen striped hyenas. A short flight backs to Delhi makes short shrift of the distances we will have travelled overland.<br/><br/>More information about this Gujarat wildlife holiday:<br/>In designing this trip we believe you will be getting the best wildlife experience of Gujarat and one that will leave you with a completely wild impression of India. January through to April is the dry, and surprisingly cold, season and best for wildlife in Gujarat. This is when we have the highest chances of seeing our targeted species. All of our Indian safaris are guided by a local naturalist guides. Local drivers and also scientists or researchers may also accompany the trip. This not only gives us numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also provides a chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife we're watching. <br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 years",

This is a research station that allows wildlife watchers to stay here and experience this incredible ecosystem. The food is all prepared by a local Kutchi family and is very traditional, the power is solar and the whole set up of the CEDO is to sustainably keep tourism coming to the Great Rann of Kutch and also contributing to the local people and local economy.

We will hopefully arrive in time for lunch and an afternoon safari into the remote desert regions of the Great Rann of Kutch.

The hotel was built as an annex of the Huzoor Palace during the British Raj period and the gardens and royal memorabilia is a nice break from wildlife watching and a nice place to rest.

        "description": "Sasan Gir National Park - Travelling - This morning you will be transferred from Gondal and continue your journey to the last stronghold of Asiatic lions in the world. Asiatic lions were once widespread from Italy in the west to the eastern side of India in the east, but due to habitat destruction and intensive hunting since the times of the Ancient Greeks they were reduced to around 20 individuals. But the Maharaja of Gir forest foresaw their extinction as his hunts were getting less and less productive. He then protected the last few (firstly for hunts and then for their continued survival) and since then the forests and scrubland of Sasan Gir has been protected (for around 100 years) and their numbers are now booming. There are now over 400 lions in the park and they are beginning to spread out into the neighbouring villages. This could lead to human-animal conflicts in the future so there is encouraging talk of reintroducing some of the lions into another national park nearby to start a second population. The supreme court in Delhi ruled in favour of translocating some lions from Gir to Kuno in Madhya Pradesh in April 2013 and this is expected to be done before the end of 2013. This drastically improves the lions long term chances of survival as it will increase genetic diversity and help in case of a disease outbreak in Gir. Once we arrive here we will in plenty of time to check into the accommodation and head into the park in the afternoon. This lodge is one of the best in the area and it actually shares a boundary wall with the park, in the recent past lions have been seen in the gardens of the resort whilst people were enjoying their dinner in the main building; it is worth bearing this in mind and looking around the gardens when heading for dinner in the evening or the early morning jeep safaris. When we have our first jeep safari into the park we will be looking for lions and they are not particularly difficult to find, with over 400 lions in a small area we should see them without too much difficulty (although they are not always seen on every safari. Also whilst here in the evenings we will be on the lookout for leopards. Leopards are very hard to see in India, they are displaced by tigers throughout the majority of Indian parks but their interactions with lions is different and as a result they are seen here more regularly than any other park in India. Of course the leopards are still hard to see here but we are in the best place for them. (breakfast, lunch and dinner included)"

This is one of the best national parks in India, home to large populations of beautiful blackbuck and probably the best places in the world to see the striped hyena. This is one of the most elusive species of mammal in the world and here there are a couple of den sites that the local guides know of. Today will be your first chance to see this incredible animal after checking into the lodge and we enter the park. The park was initially set up for the protection of blackbuck which are now doing very well. It is also the best place to see nilgai but during the evenings we will be focused on striped hyena, Indian wolves, Indian foxes and jungle cats; before returning to the lodge for your evening meal. Despite these elusive and wonderful predators the true star of the park are the many blackbuck; despite being popular in animal collections on private estates in both Europe and North America, the wild population in India decreased drastically over the last century and fragmented into various pockets from a former position of abundance throughout the plains. Velavadar Reserve now probably has the highest concentration of Blackbuck in the world with the very regal dark males with their long spiraled horns strutting their stuff for the females they are very fun to watch.

This is because these species and many others are strictly nocturnal. So we have found a way of getting into the forests safely after dark to try and see these species, in addition we have a much higher chance of seeing species such as leopards, sloth bear and tigers which are also largely nocturnal too.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of Indian wildlife watching safari holidays. These tours range from the dry desert regions of Gujarat in search of striped hyena and Asiatic lions to the icy peaks of the Himalayas on the quest for snow leopards. But we also focus heavily on some of the 40 plus Tiger Reserves in this wonderful and diverse country. One of these reserves is Panna National Park, a little visited but large park with a population of tigers inhabiting it – but without the large numbers of tourists that can be found in the more popular and well known parks. <br/><br/>This tour doesn't just enter the main park in search of tigers, dhole and other typical Indian tiger safari species (which are included), but we also spend time outside of the main park and in the buffer zones where we stay overnight in a wonderful tented camp and have night safaris.<br/><br/>After years of travelling to India we have been asked many times about why we cannot spotlight in the parks after dark to try and find the really interesting animals. Such as striped hyenas, leopards, leopard cats, Bengal foxes, Asiatic crested porcupines and the numerous civets and genets which live in India. We are now able to head into the buffer zone after dark and spotlight for wildlife, this has increased the sightings of usually difficult and elusive species. So if you have always wanted to see the Indian wildlife which is usually out of sight, then this is the wildlife tour for you. <br/><br/>Panna is one of India's less visited parks, so you can often have the park and surrounding buffer zones to yourself or with very little other tourists, which is a rare event in Indian tiger reserves nowadays. <br/><br/>In addition to this tour we have an incredible range of safaris in India. Whether you wish to visit the Western Ghats for its endemic species, Gujarat for the desert adapted species, the high grasslands of the North East for giants such as rhinos, elephants and buffalo or even head to the Himalayas for snow leopard spotting we have the itinerary for you. India is a treasure trove of wildlife and habitats and all you have to do is to get in touch with your budget and your group size and where you would like to go and we will come back to you with an itinerary and quote for your perfect Indian wildlife safari tour.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Delhi. There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through India and particularly Panna. Your naturalist escort is an expert in tigers and their conservation and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. <br/><br/>The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the park. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>The best time to go wildlife watching in Central India is mid January to mid May. This is the hot dry season with the hottest time from beginning March until mid May. This is when many species come out to waterholes to find water. <br/>However you can visit this park and enjoy the itinerary between November – April. <br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.• Our local Indian guides around Panna have a good relationship with the park officials and because of this we get a heads up when animals are sighted and this can guide us in where to focus and thus increasing our chances of seeing our targeted species.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our wildlife and tiger safaris of India a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout India so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the tigers, leopards, sloth bears, dhole and many more species. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of India at other times of year and focusing on other species such as brown and snow leopards, Indian one-horned rhinos, Western Ghats endemics, elephants, primates, Asiatic lions and many species throughout this incredible country. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour is completely focused on one national park and tiger reserve, Panna. It is located in Madhya Pradesh. We will fly in and out of Delhi and then travel onto Khajuraho before reaching the park in the Indian wilderness.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>All of this safari is done from a vehicle. So no physical fitness for hiking or anything like that is needed. This is a very easy trip to undertake.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 15 Years Old",

    "generalInfo": "If you have always felt like exploring new and interesting places and not just following the crowd when it comes to safari destinations? Then this tiger safari for you. <br/><br/>On this Indian safari you will travel to two little known and seldom visited tiger reserves. Whilst we will be of course looking for tiger throughout we will also be occupying our time in Satpura and Panna National Parks with with searches for sloth bears, dhole, leopards, gaur, striped hyenas and jungle cats to name but a few. <br/><br/>This tour is quite unusual as it will not only combine day time safaris but also spotlighting night safaris (which is very unusual in India). Searching for animals by day and night is a new experience in India and all of a sudden animals which were deemed impossible to see are being spotted; such as striped hyena and leopard cats. Satpura, Panna and Jhinna are on the rise but if you book soon you may still be the only foreign people inside the park.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of Indian wildlife watching safari holidays. These tours range from the dry desert regions of Gujarat in search of striped hyena and Asiatic lions to the icy peaks of the Himalayas on the quest for snow leopards. But we also focus heavily on some of the 40 plus Tiger Reserves in this wonderful and diverse country. Two of these reserves are Satpura and Panna National Parks, both not often visited national parks but both full of incredible wildlife – but without the large numbers of tourists that can be found in the more popular and well known parks. <br/><br/>This tour explores these great parks on the trail of tigers of course, this iconic denizen of the Indian jungles is as symbolic of India as the Taj Mahal or Mahatma Ghandi. Satpura has a fantastic record for also showing the other predators of the jungle. Whilst rare and hard to see in other parks the leopards, sloth bears and dhole are all regularly seen here. So we will dedicate a large amount time to these species as well as the tigers whilst here. <br/><br/>Panna also has a good dhole and tiger population but another reason for visiting these two parks is that they allow a couple of things that other national parks and tiger reserves in India do not. Firstly you can stay overnight inside the park, there is a small lodging complex deep in the park. <br/><br/>They are a little more basic than the lodges of course but it allows you experience the park at night from within and also allows to get deeper into the jungle on our safaris as we do not have to come back to the entry gate in the evening. <br/><br/>But also along the buffer zone of the park we can go out after dark and spotlight. This is a great way of seeing some of India’s rarer and more elusive species such as leopards, striped hyena, Indian porcupine, common palm civet as well as owls and nightjars. <br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Delhi. There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers.

Our focus here will be particularly upon the Indian Leopards and tigers which reside here, along with gaur, one of the tallest bovines in the world. Tourists also tend to flock here to spot the famous characters from The Jungle Book including Akela (The Indian Wolf), Raksha (the female Wolf), Baloo (Sloth Bear), and the vicious Shere Khan (Royal Bengal Tiger). Other sightings may include wild boar, striped hyena, monkeys, four-horned antelopes, jackals and much more. During your night safari you can also hope for sightings of flying foxes, flying squirrels and more tigers and leopards. Accommodation: 2 nights’ accommodation at Pench Tree Lodge with all meals included. Activities Included During Your Stay: 2 Private Jeep Safaris and 1 Night Safari in Pench Tiger Reserve."

        "description": "Satpura Tiger Reserve: Your last park to discover on your Indian wildlife adventure is the beautiful Satpura Tiger Reserve which you will transfer to on the morning of day 11. After an approximately 6 hour drive, you will arrive at the wonderful Reni Pani Jungle Lodge where the rest of the day will be at your leisure. After the long drive you may simply want to relax within the comforts of your lodge, or you could join a dusk/night time drive through the reserve which is included as part of your package. Nighttime drives here are highly recommended as they offer excellent chances of spotting species such as rusty-spotted cats (one of the world’s smallest wildcat species which is endemic to the Indian subcontinent), sloth bears (also endemic), Chausinghas (four-horned antelopes), leopards, a variety of owls, and nightjars. You may also be lucky enough to spot tigers at night. Over the next 2 days you can enjoy your included jeep safaris through the reserve in search of sightings of the area’s iconic wildlife. Entering the park is an adventure in itself as you transfer to the river front to take a motorboat across into the core forest where your safari jeep will be waiting to collect you. As this is one of the best places in India to see sloth bears, your safaris will have a focus on finding them and the chances are very high. Leopard sightings in the park are excellent too, however, over the last 3-4 years we have seen a rise in tiger numbers which had made the other stars of Satpura a little shyer since they are no longer the top predators. Indian giant squirrels are another unique species that can be found here. During your time here you can also enjoy an included canoe safari or walking safari. The canoe safaris offer excellent birdwatching opportunities as well as sightings of crocodiles and the land mammals that come down to the water to drink. Walking safaris are a great way to get closer to the smaller fauna that is often too well camouflaged to be seen during jeep safaris. Accommodation: 3 nights’ accommodation at Reni Pani Jungle Lodge with all meals included. Activities Included During Your Stay: 4 Private Jeep Safaris, 1 Dusk/Night Drive and 1 Canoe or Walking Safari in Satpura Tiger Reserve."

    "generalInfo": "The most famous predator in India if not the whole world, is of course the iconic and majestic Tiger. And when it comes to seeing this amazing animal there really is only one place; central India. <br/><br/>There are a number of national parks and tiger reserves around India (over 40 in total) and many are in the central state of Madhya Pradesh, it is here where some of the reserves boast such a huge percentage of the world population its hard not to find tigers. <br/><br/>This safari is by far the most comprehensive tiger safari around; travelling to three of the best parks in the world for tigers and spending three weeks searching for them we could easily spot over 25 different tigers during our time here. But its not just tigers there are dhole, sloth bears, leopards, langurs, chital, sambar, golden jackals, jungle cats and many more mammals and birds. <br/><br/>We enter the parks with a local guide and driver, travel between the parks in private air conditioned vehicles and stay in the best lodges around the parks.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of Indian wildlife watching safari holidays. These tours range from the dry desert regions of Gujarat in search of striped hyena and Asiatic lions to the icy peaks of the Himalayas on the quest for snow leopards. But we also focus heavily on some of the 40 plus Tiger Reserves in this wonderful and diverse country. But it is not just the wildlife of India that makes India such a great holiday destination, but the varied and unique culture is also a focus for our trips.  <br/><br/>This tour is a specialist tiger safari of three of the best locations in the world for tigers and a host of other large mammals in India. Panna, Bandhavgarh and Kanha National Parks. These parks have a population of over 200 tigers and some of the highest densities of wild tigers in the world. As well as the large population of tigers the park is also home to a great range of other species of predators, which are seen more readily here than many other locations in India. These are leopards, dhole and sloth bear. These predators live alongside their prey such as guar, barasingha, chital, sambar, wild boar and many other species.<br/><br/>Because this tour is mainly focused on tigers and only visits national parks in central India you can add on extensions to also visit many of the cultural highlights such as the Taj Mahal or Old Delhi. If you are interested in adding on more to this Tiger Safari please let us know.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Delhi. There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through India and particularly the national parks. Your  naturalist escort is an expert in tigers and their conservation and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. We will also employ a specific cultural guide for all sightseeing of temples and monuments.<br/><br/>The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, river safaris, spotlighting, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the park. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>This tour is recommended for February - May as this is the dry season and the chances of seeing tigers is much higher in the dry season. However the temperatures from April onward can be very hot and humid. You can visit this park and enjoy the itinerary between October – June. The park is closed during the monsoon season.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• Our local Indian guides around Panna, Bandhavgarh and Kanha have a good relationship with the park officials and because of this we get a heads up when animals are sighted and this can guide us in where to focus and thus increasing our chances of seeing our targeted species.<br/>• Visit the park morning and afternoon in your own private jeep for your group only.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our wildlife and tiger safaris of India a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout India so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the tigers, leopards, sloth bears, dhole and many more species. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of India at other times of year and focusing on other species such as brown and snow leopards, Indian one-horned rhinos, Western Ghats endemics, elephants, primates, Asiatic lions and many species throughout this incredible country.

With Delhi being the main arrival and departure hub.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from a vehicle. So no physical fitness for hiking or anything like that is needed.

When we arrive here you will be met by your local guide/driver and depending on the time of the flight we will spend some time sightseeing here. Khajuraho is well known for its magnificent temples, which were built between 950 and 1050 A.D. Khajuraho derives its name from the Khajur tree (the date palm tree), which can be found in abundance in the area. The divine sculptures in these temples are a tribute to Life itself, embodying everything that is sublime and spontaneous about it. The murals depict the life and times of the Chandelas, and celebrate the erotic state of being. They not only testify to the mastery of the craftsman, but also to the extraordinary breadth of vision of the Chandela Rajputs under whose reign, these temples were constructed. After lunch we either visit the Eastern and Western groups of Temples or we will travel direct to our accommodation at Panna National Park, level – safari lodge (Ken River Lodge) (1 hour). Once again depending on the time of arrival we may head into the park on an afternoon jeep safari to try and find some wildlife. Panna National Park is an excellent place to find leopards.

But the park is also one of the most aesthetically beautiful and home to some very rare species that are not seen in other parks such as dhole and barasingha. <br/><br/>You then travel north and east to the vast and lush grasslands of the Indian terai, this lowland ecosystem is fed from by monsoon waters from the south and Himalayan meltwater from the north. Making these alluvial soils some of the most fertile in the world. These grasslands now support 75% of the world’s population of Indian one-horned rhinos as well as large populations of Asiatic elephants, water buffalo and tigers. All of which help to make Kaziranga one of the most popular parks for wildlife film makers and enthusiasts alike. <br/><br/>From here you travel to the massive city of Kolkata and then onto the Indian side of the Sundarbans. The largest mangrove forest in the world is home of the world’s largest populations of endangered tigers and Gangetic river dolphins in the world. From this pristine and incredible ecosystem.

    "generalInfo": "This tour will explore one of the oldest national parks in the world, India's very first national park. Established by one of the most prominent and famous big game hunters in all of Asia. Jim Corbett decided to protect a huge area of sub-Himalayan belt in North West India in 1936. <br/><br/>His main aim was to protect the animals he was paid well to hunt, the tigers and leopards of this region were dying out quickly here and with a growing human population he was determined to protect the wildlife and ecosystem he had come to know, love and respect with passion and enthusiasm. <br/><br/>Since then the park has changed names and been expanded but the wildlife is still exceptional. With over 100 tigers resident to the surrounding area, a mix of lowland and sub-Himalayan species and 600 plus bird species recorded, Corbett National Park is a must for all wildlife lovers visiting India.<br/><br/>The combination of habitats which are more familiar to Central India, some terai habitat from the fertile floodplain belt in the sub-Himalayas as well as forested hills means that the there is a large diversity of wildlife here. Animals which are not found in the same areas elsewhere in India can be found here such as Asiatic black bears, tigers, Asiatic elephants and gharials.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of Indian wildlife watching safari holidays. These tours range from the dry desert regions of Gujarat in search of striped hyena and Asiatic lions to the icy peaks of the Himalayas on the quest for snow leopards. But we also focus heavily on some of the 40 plus Tiger Reserves in this wonderful and diverse country. But it is not just the wildlife of India that makes India such a great holiday destination, but the varied and unique culture is also a focus for our trips.  <br/><br/>This tour is a specialist tiger safari of one of the most interesting national parks in India. There is a large population of tigers here as well as elephants and many other iconic species from India. One of the most interesting species found here which is very rare is the large crocodilian the gharial.<br/><br/>Because this tour is only focused on Corbett National Park you can add on extensions to also visit many of the cultural highlights such as the Taj Mahal or Old Delhi. If you are interested in adding on more to this Indian Tiger Safari please let us know.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Delhi. There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through India and particularly Corbett. Your naturalist escort is an expert in tigers and their conservation and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. We will also employ a specific cultural guide for all sightseeing of temples and monuments.<br/><br/>The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, river safaris, spotlighting, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the park. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>This tour is recommended for late spring in the northern hemisphere as this is the dry season here and also most of the wildlife is very active during this time year.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• Our local Indian guides around Corbett have a good relationship with the park officials and because of this we get a heads up when animals are sighted and this can guide us in where to focus and thus increasing our chances of seeing our targeted species.<br/>• Visit the park morning and afternoon in your own private jeep for your group only.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our wildlife and tiger safaris of India a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout India so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the tigers, leopards, sloth bears, dhole and many more species. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of India at other times of year and focusing on other species such as brown and snow leopards, Indian one-horned rhinos, Western Ghats endemics, elephants, primates, Asiatic lions and many species throughout this incredible country.

The drive is around 4-5 hours and along the way the highway crosses the famous Ganges River and as this is the closest point of the river to Delhi so that it can get busy with worshippers. Once you arrive at the park and your lodge you will check in and then if time allows you will be taken on a short afternoon jeep safari into the buffer-zone of the park. This is a brief introduction to some of the wildlife in the area and you should see barking deer, wild boar and chital as well as many species of the commoner bird species such as crested serpent eagles, blossom-headed parakeets, pied kingfishers, dollarbirds and Asian paradise flycatchers. During this short safari you will cross the wonderful Ramganga River, this is a monsoonal river that is the lifeblood of the surrounding areas you will see how most people’s lives revolve around the river. After this you will be taken back to the accommodation to relax and enjoy your evening meal. (breakfast and dinner included)."

    "generalInfo": "This budget tiger safari of India takes you to one of the best national parks in the country; Kanha National Park. This park is a wonderful mix of grassy plateaus, open misty plains and bamboo forests and is home to around a hundred tigers living wild. As well as dhole, guar, leopard, sambhar, chital and monkeys and dozens more species. <br/><br/>This budget safari has been designed to maximise your time in the park and chances of seeing tigers with as low a cost as possible. We are proud of our 100% sighting rate and of course, you will also get a chance to see a wide array of other wildlife, not just tigers. Please note that we are very happy to organise this trip for a solo traveller as well as for groups.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of Indian wildlife watching safari holidays. These tours range from the dry desert regions of Gujarat in search of striped hyena and Asiatic lions to the icy peaks of the Himalayas on the quest for snow leopards. But we also focus heavily on some of the 40 plus Tiger Reserves in this wonderful and diverse country. One of these reserves is Kanha National Park, a popular and large park with a huge number of tigers inhabiting inside it – but without the large numbers of tourists that can be found in the more popular and well known parks. <br/><br/>This tour explores this great park on the trail of tigers of course, this iconic denizen of the Indian jungles is as symbolic of India as the Taj Mahal or Mahatma Ghandi. But Kanha has a fantastic record for also showing the other predators of the jungle. Whilst rare and hard to see in other parks the leopards, sloth bears and dhole are all regularly seen here. So we will dedicate a large amount time to these species as well as the tigers whilst here. <br/><br/>Kanha is one of India's more popular parks, however we have an incredible range of safaris in India. Whether you wish to visit the Western Ghats for its endemic species, Gujarat for the desert adapted species, the high grasslands of the North East for giants such as rhinos, elephants and buffalo or even head to the Himalayas for snow leopard spotting we have the itinerary for you. India is a treasure trove of wildlife and habitats and all you have to do is to get in touch with your budget and your group size and where you would like to go and we will come back to you with an itinerary and quote for your perfect Indian wildlife safari tour.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included.

The city has been at the heart of numerous empires and dynasties over time from the Mughals to the British Raj, with each one having left its own unique mark on the city, resulting in the rich patchwork that is modern-day Delhi. For those arriving on time today, our tour leader plans to meet you in the hotel reception at 5pm for a welcome meeting. We'll then make our way out into the city on foot, arriving at Hanuman's Temple in time to witness the evening prayer rituals. Afterwards, we'll explore the bustling hub of Connaught Place - a colonial-era circus of shops, bars, restaurants and street vendors. If you'd like an airport transfer today, you'll need to arrive into New Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport (DEL), which is around 45 minutes from our hotel. Please note, that if you'd like to join the city tour today, you'll need to arrive at the hotel by 4pm. If you're booking your own flights, we recommend giving yourself at least one hour to clear the airport.

We visit India Gate and the UNESCO-listed Mughal site of Humayun's Tomb, a precursor to the great Taj Mahal.

        "description": ": Sariska National Park has been a real success story of conservation. Back in the early 2000s, it was thought that due to poaching and habitat degradation, the reserve had no tigers left within its boundaries. A huge conservation effort was mounted and fast-forwarding to today there is now thought to be a population of around 30 tigers including a litter of healthy cubs. Straddling Rajasthan's Aravalli Hills, Sariska is characterised by dry deciduous forests, grasslands and rocky landscapes. The park is generally considered to be a far quieter park than its very popular neighbour, Ranthambore. As the sun rises and the dawn breaks, we head out early to catch our first glimpse of India's incredible wildlife. As well as the tigers, the park is also home to the elusive leopard, jungle cat, jackals, a variety of deer a huge number of langurs. After lunch, we take a second game drive as we continue to search for wildlife. The group will be split into a number of open-topped, private jeeps, with each jeep having an accompanying naturalist."

Such is the population of UP, that if it were a country in its own right, it would be the fifth most populous country in the world. The state is a major industrial and commercial centre and, being on the main Indo-Gangetic plain, it benefits from rich soil for excellent agriculture. We make the five-hour drive across fertile landscapes to the city of Dholpur, sitting beside the Chambal River. The Chambal is one of the few remaining undammed rivers in northern India and is known for its rich biodiversity and relatively untouched natural surroundings. After lunch, we will take a private boat out onto the river where we hope to spot some of the rich variety of wildlife found here. This river is one of the last remaining habitats for the critically endangered Gharial, a species of long-snouted crocodile which are often found on the banks of the river, basking in the afternoon sun. As well as crocodiles, we may spot the playful Gangetic River Dolphin, smooth-coated otters or the Indian softshell turtle. The river is also a haven for birdlife where we hope to be lucky enough to spot Indian Skimmers, Sarus Cranes and Kingfishers. In the rare event that water levels in the Chambal River rise, Indian authorities may suspend river safaris for safety reasons, in which case an alternative activity will be provided."

Travelling by train is a wonderful way to experience India, from the bustling railway platforms to the chai wallahs that ply their trade through the carriages, offering hot tea and snacks along the journey. India has one of the largest rail networks in the world, and it serves as a vital lifeline for many Indians - connecting many small towns, villages and rural areas with larger commercial centres. Along the way, we can soak in the rural scenery as it rolls past our window and we're likely to get the chance to chat with some of the locals in our carriage who are often interested to see tourists travelling by train. After disembarking in Jhansi we will continue by bus, crossing into the central state of Madhya Pradesh to Khajuraho, a journey of around three hours.

The park's topography provides some truly stunning scenery and makes it quite different from our experience in Sariska. The park is made up of thick teak forests separated by wide plateaus and gorges. The lazy Ken River flows through the park and acts as its main water source, and in parts cascades down stacked rocks forming impressive waterfalls. Known less for tigers (although sightings still can be made) the park is renowned for its birdlife with over 200 recorded species found here. Vultures and eagles are not uncommon sightings, as well as the colourful Asian Paradise Flycatcher; the state bird of Madhya Pradesh. Migratory birds are also prevalent in the winter months. Later this afternoon, we explore the UNESCO World Heritage Temples of Khajuraho. Intricately hand-carved, the erotic sculptures which adorn the Hindu and Jain temples here are full of symbolism and depict various aspects of life at the time, during the 9th to 12th century. We spend the afternoon exploring the main temples including the magnificent Kandariya Mahadev and Vishwanath temples."

The majestic Royal Bengal is at home here amongst the ideal habitat of high grasslands interspersed with forests of sal and bamboo, while rivers and streams crisscross their way through the park. The trees and high grasslands provide ample food for the park's large deer population, and in turn, provide plenty of cover for the tigers to hunt their prey. The various water sources are an ideal location for tigers to rest and a great place to spot the big cats lazing around on hotter days. Whilst tigers are the focus here, the park is also home to wild dogs, hyenas, spotted deer (chital), bison and many more species. We spend the day taking two safaris through the park, one in the early morning and one in the late afternoon. Safaris will be in private 4WD vehicles with a maximum of four to a jeep and with an accompanying naturalist."

They not only testify to the mastery of the craftsman, but also to the extraordinary breadth of vision of the Chandela Rajputs under whose reign, these temples were constructed. After lunch you will be taken to the Eastern & Western groups of Temples for a guided tour. A highlight here is Kandariya Mahadeo, which is the largest and most typical Khajuraho temple. Dedicated to Lord Shiva, it soars 31 m high and makes a brilliant picture. (breakfast is the only meal included)."

    "generalInfo": "India is a wealth of wonderful wildlife, historical and cultural attractions. There is an never ending variety of historical sites to visit and wilderness areas to observe animals and this tour provides you with a great overview of Indian culture and wildlife. <br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>This tour is perfect for people visiting India for the first time or seasoned travellers to the Subcontinent. This tour will showcase two of the best reasons to travel to India as well as visiting probably the last refuge for two of the worlds most unusual and endangered species. Combining sightseeing of historical sites in Old Delhi, and marvelling at the magnificent Taj Mahal, with tiger safaris in the stunning and culturally important Ranthambore National Park and river safaris looking for gharial and Gangetic river dolphins; this is the perfect overall wildlife holiday of India. <br/><br/>Ranthambore is probably the most iconic of all Indian tiger reserves and we visit here to look for tigers. The most iconic and famous wildlife resident of India is the tiger and many of the tigers that live in Ranthambore are very well known. They are regularly filmed for various documentaries and most of known by name. It is a great way to further understand the tiger and it's role in modern India. <br/><br/>Along with the tigers we will see in Ranthambore and the cultural excursions taken to Old Delhi and Agra which will include sites such as Taj Mahal, Red Fort and Agra Fort; this tour also visits the Chambal River Sanctuary. This is one of the most important sanctuaries in the world for 2 of the world's most endangered large animals, the large fish-eating crocodilian, gharial, and the Gangetic river dolphin. These two species are commonly seen here and coupled with the tiger provide chances to see some of the world's most endangered and wonderful species.<br/><br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of Indian wildlife watching safari holidays. These tours range from the dry desert regions of Gujarat in search of striped hyena and Asiatic lions to the icy peaks of the Himalayas on the quest for snow leopards. But we also have a range of specific birding and bird watching tours, this being one of them.  <br/><br/>This tour is a specialist wildlife and cultural tour of north-west India. There are many species of mammals, birds and reptiles that can be found in Ranthambore and Chambal. The different ecosystems of sal forest, bamboo groves and meadows coupled with the river and wetlands of the Chambal Sanctuary are home to a great diversity of life of all kinds. But of course no trip to India is complete without visiting religious and culturally important iconic sites such as the Taj Mahal. <br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in cities and towns. There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through India and particularly tiger safaris. Your naturalist escort is an expert in ornithology and their conservation and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. We will also employ a specific cultural guide for all sightseeing of temples and monuments.<br/><br/>The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, river safaris, spotlighting, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the park. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>This tour is recommended for February - May as this is the dry season and the chances of seeing tigers is much higher in the dry season. However the temperatures from April onward can be very hot and humid. You can visit this park and enjoy the itinerary between October – June. The park is closed during the monsoon season.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• Our local Indian guides have a good relationship with the park and reserve officials and because of this we get a heads up when animals are sighted and this can guide us in where to focus and thus increasing our chances of seeing our targeted species.<br/>• Visit the parks and reserves morning and afternoon in your own private vehicle for your group only.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our wildlife and bird watching holidays of India a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout India so that we can try and find and observe birds. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of India at other times of year and focusing on other species such many mammals like tigers, snow leopards, elephants, rhinos and many species throughout this incredible country. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour is focused on two wildlife watching locations in the northern part of India, the great national park of Ranthambore as well as the Chambal River Sanctuary and then the iconic cities of Delhi and Agra.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from a vehicle. So no physical fitness for hiking or anything like that is needed. This is a very easy trip to undertake.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 Years Old",

Once here you will be taken to your hotel. Then in the afternoon you will have a guided tour of one of the wonders of the world, the majestic Taj Mahal. This marvel of human engineering took 20,000 men 22 years to complete for the emperor Shah Jahan as a tomb for his beloved wife. But it is not just the beautiful architecture and manicured gardens that hold the attention in the Taj Mahal grounds, there are numerous bird species to be found here too. From Egyptian vultures and black kites that nest on the high turrets and minarets of the buildings to many babblers, warblers, grey hornbills and the very approachable common tailorbird that can be found in the gardens. After spending a couple of hours here you will come back to the hotel. (breakfast only included today)."

        "description": "Chambal River Sanctuary - Travelling & Wildlife Watching This morning you will be transferred in your private vehicle to the wonderful Chambal River Sanctuary (~2 hours). Before exploring this river sanctuary you will be taken to the lodge. This is a huge sanctuary which protects one of the largest and most biologically valuable rivers in India, covering a 400km stretch of the river and protecting around 1.6 km on either side of the river the sanctuary is 1235km sq. The sanctuary was initially set up for the gharial, these huge fish-eating crocodile can grow to 7m long and is the most critically endangered species in the Indian subcontinent. There may be as few as 250 breeding individuals in the world and the vast majority live along the Chambal river. But as well as providing protection for this magnificent and ancient animal the sanctuary now has over 330 bird species recorded as well as other mammals, reptiles and amphibians that now rely on this protected stretch of water. After settling into the accommodation and lunch you will be taken on a river safari here to welcome you to the birdlife. You should encounter small pratincoles, numerous duck species, black-winged stilts, common & spotted redshanks, ospreys, bar-headed geese and up to 100 other water birds. You may also see both gharial and the other crocodile species here the mugger crocodile as well as up to 8 species of freshwater turtles (all of which are endangered), the unsual and endangered Gangetic river dolphin and possible a family of foraging or playing smooth-coated otters. When you arrive back to the lodge you are free to stroll the gardens as the sunsets and listen to the many Indian flying foxes that roost and feed in the trees around the lodge, before your evening meal. (all meals included today)."

        "description": "Chambal River Sanctuary Over the next two days you will further explore the various ecosystems of the Chambal River sanctuary, there are a variety of activities that can be provided by the lodge and exactly what you want to do and the order of the activities will vary. But we recommend the following itinerary for your stay at this eco-lodge; after breakfast on the first full day here we suggest taking a jeep safari to the plains that surround areas of the Chambal river, you will travel to some isolated ravines in the Chambal sanctuary to try and find one of the most beautiful animals in India, the stunning blackbuck antelope. There is a small population here protected in the sanctuary, whilst the blackbuck was once widespread throughout the Gangetic plains, hunting and habitat destruction all but wiped the antelope out. This used to be the favoured prey of the Indian cheetah and there are ongoing talks about reintroducing the cheetah to the Gangetic plains and that would be a wonderful sight. Whilst spending the afternoon here you are likely to see some species of birds that have spend their time on the open grasslands that the blackbuck favour such as coursers, harriers and possibly falcons. Then after coming back to the lodge and having lunch you would be taken the short distance to the ancient Bateshwar Temple complex. These Hindu temples are built on the banks of the Yamuna river and consist of over 100 temples dedicated to Lord Shiva. The ravines surrounding the temples and river are home to a number of Naga sadhus (snake worshiping ascetics) who have carved out little caves and temples within the mud walls. These temples are a very nice way to see how the Hindu people around here still use these ancient temples in ways that have not changes for hundreds, possibly thousands of years. The next day we suggest participating in a camel ride safari through some of the ravines that fork off from the Chambal River, here you are likely to see a different range of birdlife including plain martins, wire-tailed swallows, jungle babblers, steppe eagles, sand lark, wood sandpipers and large grey babblers. Travelling on camel back is a wonderful experience and a great way of exploring the ravines and river bank whilst on the way to another ancient building. This is Ater fort and it is a magnificent site perched on the cliff side. It is also home to many species of raptors and other bird species; once a valued stronghold and at the forefront of numerous battles between the Rajputs, the Mughals and the Marathas, the crumbling ruins bring alive the romantic glory of a bygone age but it is the breathtaking views out over the Chambal valley that are truly spectacular. From here a scan of the skies can produce many more species and hopefully some of the critically endangered vultures. Then after lunch you will have a guided walk along a new section of the Chambal river bank. By walking the riverbanks with the local guide from the lodge you will be in good hands when it comes to spotting some of the harder to see mammals birds and reptiles such as golden jackals, black-naped hares, Burmese spot-bellied duck, Temmincks stint, Pallas gull, Indian skimmer and some of the 9 species of freshwater turtles here. Whilst spending time around the lodge you are free to explore the vibrant and diverse gardens. In the grounds of the lodge the abundant flowers attract many sunbirds and the fruiting trees are home to commersmith and brown-headed barbets, many babblers, hornbills, koels, treepies as well as being the day roosts for flying foxes and owls. Also whilst here, if you are not too tired we recommend a guided evening walk around the expansive grounds of the lodge; these walks often find Indian palm civets, jungle cats, Indian foxes, black-naped hares, hedgehogs and possibly the very elusive striped hyena. Of course the skies will be full of flying foxes, owls and nightjars as well. (all of your meals included)."

    "generalInfo": "Few places look as barren and inhospitable than the Trans-Himalayan highlands. Empty, rolling plains mostly made up of rock and scree as well as a few hardy grass species and stunted trees and bushes; all dominated by inaccessible steep rocky mountains and outcrops. <br/><br/>All of this do not seem like the best place to find wildlife. But this ecosystem is teeming with animals, from the ghost-like snow leopard and Eurasian lynx to herd dwelling Tibetan wild asses (kiang), argali, Asiatic ibex and Ladakhi urail there is a raft a life here waiting to be seen. <br/><br/>This tour is a specialist tour where some of the most elusive and specially adapted species of mammals and birds are searched for. So if you wish to be one of the few wildlife watchers to explore the vastness of India's Himalayas and possibly see some of the rarest species in the world then this tour is for you.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching tours and safari holidays all over the world, specialising in the Indian subcontinent and of course the wonderful and diverse country of India. Whilst most wildlife watchers who visit India spend time in the famous tiger reserves of the central plains or maybe the forests and grasslands of the north east of India and the Western Ghats in the south. But these ecosystems and incredible wildlife are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the wildlife that India has to offer. <br/><br/>This tour explores some of the lesser known regions and takes you into the wildest and least inhabited parts of India’s north west Himalayas. All of this whilst escorted by our very own expert zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us)coupled with local guides. Of course there is one species in particular that dominates everyone’s thoughts and dreams when they think of the stunning Himalayas nowadays and that is the majestic snow leopard. <br/><br/>Whilst there are chances of seeing snow leopards here we take time to showcase the their ecosystem in full and try and find as many other animals that share the mountains with snow leopards. Most of this trip will involve driving to spotting and scanning locations as well as walking among the high altitude grasslands and rocky slopes looking for animals that make this inhospitable locations their home. <br/><br/>One of the reasons why our safaris of India are unique is that our background (as a company) is from a scientific and zoological standpoint and so have a great network of colleagues and contacts all over the world who are the people on the front line in search of the best new locations for wildlife watching in the wild. All of these reasons and many more make us experts in arranging and guiding safaris and are able to tailor a Indian safaris to any location to try to find them that you request. All you have to do is to get in touch with us and tell us your budget and your group size and where you would like to go on safari.<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of Indian wildlife watching safari holidays. These tours range from the dry desert regions of Gujarat in search of striped hyena and Asiatic lions to the icy peaks of the Himalayas on the quest for snow leopards. But we also have a range of specific birding and bird watching tours, this being one of them.  <br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in cities and towns. There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through India and particularly birding holidays. Your naturalist escort is an expert in ornithology and their conservation and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. We will also employ a specific cultural guide for all sightseeing of temples and monuments.<br/><br/>The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, trekking permits, spotlighting, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the park. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>This tour is recommended for the northern hemisphere summer season. This is not the normal season people visit Ladakh for snow leopards, but they are seen throughout the year with good regularity. But the key factor here is that during the summer there are more roads and passes open to explore and the diversity of wildlife is much higher. Many of the herbivorous animals and migratory birds which leave to head to areas not covered with snow in winter are here in their numbers.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our bird watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• Our local Indian guides have a good relationship with the park and reserve officials and because of this we get a heads up when animals are sighted and this can guide us in where to focus and thus increasing our chances of seeing our targeted species.<br/>• Visit the parks and reserves morning and afternoon in your own private vehicle for your group only.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our wildlife and bird watching holidays of India a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout India so that we can try and find and observe birds. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of India at other times of year and focusing on other species such many mammals like tigers, snow leopards, elephants, rhinos and many species throughout this incredible country. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour visits a range of locations around Ladakh, your entry and exit point in Ladakh will be the city of Leh and when you arrive and depart from India you will travel through Delhi.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>This tour is at high altitude and whilst it is not full hiking, there are no long days of trekking; there are some hikes at altutude included and so a level of fitness or experience of being at altitude is needed for full enjoyment of the trip.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 Years Old",

Lato is where the Indian plate collided with the Eurasian plate about 55 million years ago and you can see the impact of the collision here. The steep crevices and the rock faces in brilliant hues of pink, green, purple, red and ochre show what occurred in stunning colours. Here along the riversides you will be stopping to look for brown dipper, fire-fronted serins, Eurasian crag martin, Northern house martin, hill pigeon as well as fly bys from Himalayan griffons. There are chances of sighting mammals around here like the mountain weasel, stone marten, blue sheep and few other mammals. We will carry on towards Rumtse and look for golden eagle on a well known nest here, then wait and see if we can get to see the long tailed marmots, there will be birds like lammergeier, osprey, golden eagle, Himalayan griffon and of course possibilities of Himalayan snowcock, Tibetan partridge etc as we move towards Tso Kar. Along the way there are lots of birds species that can be seen including large flocks of horned larks, Tibetan snow finches, robin, brown and black-throated accentor, Tibetan lark, Brandt mountain finch etc near the Tso Kar area. Some of the speciality bird species here include the black-necked crane, great crested grebe, black-necked grebe, common tern, white-winged tern, Tibetan sandgrouse, nesting bar-headed geese and ruddy shelducks, saker falcon, upland buzzard and little owls. Also around here we will try are best to see some of the Himalayan mammal species such as Tibetan wild ass, woolly hare, silvery mountain vole, Tibetan argali, Tibetan wolf (however the chances of wolves depends on the movements of the Nomads as they follow them) and dhole. There is a small population of Eurasian lynx in the area surrounding this place however they are very hard to see here. So we will keep a look out for this with our local guide. After exploring the area for its mammals and birds we will head back to the accommodation, level camping; for your evening meal. (all of your meals are included today)."

The cafe works to raise awareness of acid attacks in India and to empower those who have sadly been the victims of these heinous crimes. Prior to gaining employment in the cafe, many of the 'Sheroes' led solitary lives, rarely going outside due to shame associated with their scars. At Encounters Travel we're proud to support such an organisation, which has the sole aim of helping these women find acceptance, a supportive community and a means of income. Lunch will be included whilst at the cafe. Once you've checked in into your hotel, we'll spend the afternoon on a Mughal Heritage Walk through the ancient village of Kachhpura and surrounding farmland on the banks of the Yamuna River across from the Taj Mahal and Red Fort. This walk has been designed by a local NGO and helps support the local community through employment and new infrastructure. During the walk one of the villagers will give a guide to their village life, the layout of their homes, with living, cooking & religious areas, the farming done, and the local cottage industry for leather shoe making which helps Agra export shoes all over the world. You'll also see some lesser known but important Mughal era monuments. Finally today we'll stroll around the park at Mehtab Bagh - originally built by Emperor Babur as the last in a series of 11 parks on the Yamuna River's east bank, before taking in the magnificent sight of the Taj Mahal at sunset.

If you chose to sleep a little later, your morning starts with a visit to the Amber Fort, the jewel in Jaipur's crown - an ancient fortress built on a hilltop in the 16th century dedicated to the ruling Kachhawa clan of Amber. Be mesmerised by this majestic architectural wonder, with its pink sandstone and marble palace shining in the sun. It's massive fortress walls sprawls across the hills, with many seeing a resemblance of the Great Wall of China. Later, we return to the city for a tour of Jaipur, as we visit the strange Jantar Mantar monument, a collection of nineteen architectural astronomical instruments, built by the Rajput king Sawai Jai Singh II between 1724 and 1730. Jaipur was the first planned city of medieval India and we'll also explore its City Palace. Built by Raja Man Singh during 1729-1732 AD, the City Palace was once the seat of kings as it was from here that they ruled the region. This tangle of courtyards, manicured gardens and exceptionally crafted mahals is one of the most revered attractions in India. We spend the remainder of the day walking in the walled city to discover some of Jaipur's famous crafts markets and craftsmen in action such as jewellers, silversmiths, textile workshops and bangle makers. Our tour will include a blockprinting workshop, where we learn the ways in which fabric is decorated using this ancient method and we'll also have a gemstone demonstation. OVERNIGHT"

    "generalInfo": "South India is home to a dazzling range of rare and endemic species and we explore all of the individual forests, hillsides and waterways in search of some of the world's most charismatic and endangered species such as Asiatic elephants, Tigers, Hornbills and King Cobras. <br/><br/>Introduction:<br/><br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching tours and safari holidays all over the world, specialising in the Indian subcontinent and of course the wonderful and diverse country of India. Whilst most wildlife watchers who visit India spend time in the famous tiger reserves of the central plains or maybe the sub-Himalayan parks of the north west and north east. But these ecosystems and incredible wildlife are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the wildlife that India has to offer. <br/><br/>This tour explores some of the lesser known parks and takes you into the deepest parts of India’s southern rainforests and hillsides. All of this whilst escorted by our very own expert zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) coupled with local guides. Of course there is one species in particular that dominates everyone’s thoughts and dreams when they think of an Indian safari and that is the beautiful tiger. <br/><br/>Whilst there are chances of seeing tigers here we take time to showcase the tiger’s ecosystem in full and try and find as many other animals that share the forests with tigers. We also offer a few different ways of exploring the parks, so however you like to travel through the tiger’s habitat we have the tour for you, whether you want to drive around in your own jeep, walk through the forests and grasslands tracking the elusive big cat or even via a boat or canoe in the water ways of Periyar. <br/><br/>One of the reasons why our safaris of India are unique is that our background (as a company) is from a scientific and zoological standpoint and so have a great network of colleagues and contacts all over the world who are the people on the front line in search of the best new locations for wildlife watching in the wild. All of these reasons and many more make us experts in arranging and guiding safaris and are able to tailor a Indian safaris to any location to try to find them that you request. All you have to do is to get in touch with us and tell us your budget and your group size and where you would like to go on safari.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner). There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned vehicles with an excellent local driver for all transfers. We include internal flights where ever possible on all our Indian safaris. We use two brilliant full time guides; first a professional zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) will escort you on all your excursions and also a very knowledgeable English speaking local guide at each national park. Your zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) escort is an expert in mammal biology, ecology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. Your zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) escort has spent time studying and working with different species all over the world and he has years of experience guiding throughout most of India’s national parks. We also use local expert guides with decades of experience on all our Indian safaris. We also include all jeep safaris, guided walks, canoe safaris, boat-trips, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more individual safaris into national parks per tour than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the national parks to search for tigers and other wildlife. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on tigers and other Indian wildlife which are available to watch throughout the tour.<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>March and April is the dry season and best for wildlife. For wildlife watching in southern India we recommend visiting during March and April (this is the best overall game viewing in the Indian Subcontinent’s main tiger reserves and national parks). This is towards the end of the hot dry season and offers the best chances of seeing wildlife as the hotter and drier it gets the more the wildlife aggregate around waterholes as well as there being less vegetation blocking the view. <br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>•\tAll of our Indian safaris are guided by a zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) as well as local naturalist guides, drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife your watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) that escorts all our Indian safaris has great experience guiding throughout India and the world, and specialising in big cat tracking and has worked with and tracked big cats on 4 continents.<br/>•\tWe use camera traps (where available) which will increase the chances of getting close up pictures and movies of tigers and other rare nocturnal wildlife.<br/>•\tDuring this tour we explore various national parks and wildlife sanctuaries (Bandipur, Nagahole, Wayanad, Parambikulam, Eravikulam, Silent Valley and Periyar) which will give you a very good overview of the Western Ghats and Nilgiri biosphere wilderness.<br/>•\tTravel to Silent Valley National Park for the rare and endemic lion-tailed macaques, that are best seen here than anywhere else in the world.<br/>•\tBy joining one of our Indian safaris you will have an overall wildlife experience as we are determined to showcase all of the wildlife of the parks we visit (not just tigers), you will not feel like a passenger in a rally and bounce all over the place in pursuit of tigers; we make sure all our Indian safaris are relaxed and environmentally friendly experiences. In fact the majority of tiger sightings that we enjoy in India are of tigers that our jeep and guides have found (as opposed to other operators who wait for a tiger to be seen and then stake out the waterhole surrounded by dozens of other jeeps), we always investigate any suspicious behaviour exhibited by their prey and usually find tigers by watching the deer and monkey behaviour as they change from relaxed to agitated when a predator is spotted.<br/>•\tWe have explored all the areas we visit in depth and have found the best and most conveniently located accommodations to stay in whilst searching out wildlife in isolated and remote places. Including some of the best and most ecologically friendly lodges in all of India.<br/>•\tWe are a member of Tour Operators for Tigers (TOFT) and we make sure that all of our tiger safaris run by their code of practice and we also make sure that all the accommodation we use is audited by TOFT to make sure of sustainable practices.<br/>•\tAll the above reasons give this our tiger tours and general wildlife holidays of India a great success rate of seeing tigers (100% in Bandhavgarh and close to 50% for this tour, which is very good considering the dense forests and vastness of the protected areas). <br/>•\tWe have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout the India and are able to find and observe species that are difficult to find or overlooked sometimes such as Indian leopards, Asiatic elephants, water buffalo, sloth bears, jungle cats, dhole, gaur and hundreds other endangered, rare or endemic species throughout the tigers current distribution. <br/>•\tDue to our greta network of guides and researchers throughout India we are able to organise tailor made safari to anywhere in India, whether it is Bandhavgarh, Kanha, Periyar, Kaziranga, Corbett, Ramthambore, Satpura, Tadoba, and many other wildlife watching locations you want to visit we can arrange it. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari holiday to India.<br/>•\tUnlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour takes you to the southern states of Kerala and Karnataka and from the cities of Bangalore to Trivandrum, visiting Nagarhole, Bandipur, Parambikulam, Silent Valley &amp; Eravikulam National Parks as well as Wayanad &amp; Periyar Wildlife Sanctuaries. <br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The fitness level required for this safari holiday is not very high. The vast majority of the activities are conducted from vehicles so no fitness is required, but there is some walking involved. The walking is all done at a leisurely pace with regular breaks, anyone who is used to mild hiking will find this easy.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 Years Old",

After taking a flight from Delhi to Nagpur, and then a two hour transfer by car or minibus, you arrive at this wonderfully remote park that is well off the normal tourist tiger trail. The name of this tiger watching terrain comes from the indigenous tribe’s language, as Tadoba was a deity worshipped by them. Indeed, the indigenous people still live in this region and, having been stewards of it for generations. It is fitting, therefore, that this responsible tiger watching holiday ensures that it supports local conservation initiatives, as well as the economy. Many of the indigenous people are now being trained as naturalists and will, therefore, guide you on your safaris, morning and night, through this special park, also their ancestral home. <br/><br/>Tadoba National Park’s tiger population is thriving and, for that reason, it is believed to be one of the best places to see tiger in the country.  We also offer one of the best lodges that you will find on a tiger safari holiday surrounded by forest and watering holes, making this an ideal location for you not only to relax after safari, but also watch out for other wildlife, including prolific birdlife, take photographs as the sun sets, or simply sit back and enjoy the lodge’s fine Indian food and hospitality. <br/>Note: Pench Tiger Reserve or Kanha National park extension is available.",

Plus the guides on this trip are all expert naturalists from the region, who will share all their knowledge and passion for conservation while on the tiger safari with you.<br/><br/>After a sleeper train journey from Delhi, your first safari experience is in Bandhavgarh National Park, celebrated as the place where the rare white tigers were captured for the Maharaja of Rewa, the last one thought to have been seized in the mid 1990’s. Today it is an extraordinary arid landscape, where a 2000 year old ruined fort provides dramatic rocky terrain, surrounded by caves and chasms for tiger to roam. As well as the park’s other wild residents, with mammals and reptiles ranging from monkeys to mongoose, leopard to lizards, snakes to sambar. As well as 138 species of resident birds, and flocks of many other migratory ones passing through too. Kanha National Park proffers an eclectic mix of habitats over its almost 2000 sq. km of grassy plateaus, open plains and resplendent Shorea robusta or sal forests. All perfect terrain for tiger as well as the endangered and exquisite Barasingha Deer.<br/><br/>A large part of Kanha National Park also falls into the domain of Kanha Tiger Reserve, an important conservation initiative from the 1970’s led by Project Tiger. Kanha is also famous for being the first place where leading biologist and conservationist, George Shaller, carried out the first scientific research into tigers in the 1960’s. Today there are approximately one hundred tiger here, as well as leopard, wild dogs, langur monkeys, chital, sambhar and mongoose.

The park is home to 22 species of large mammals and well over 200 species of birds. Commonly spotted animals include the sambar, the largest of the Indian deer, nilgai or blue bull and the barking deer. One can also see the sloth bear, locally called Bhaloo, the same name given by Rudyard Kipling to the loveable bear in \"Jungle Book\" as well as the thickly muscled gaur or Indian bison. Explore Kanha in four morning and afternoon safaris along with walks in the buffer forest.

    "generalInfo": "This tour is a unique combination of India’s wildlife. We will be visiting Sunderbans, a UNESCO World Heritage Site to see its famous swimming tigers, as well as Kaziranga National Park for rhinos.  Your first stop is Kaziranga NP, one of the world’s beacons of conservation, having successfully protected its great one horned rhinos, and now home to two thirds of the world’s population of them. With over 2,400 of them today in the park, rhino safaris here are second to none. The park is also a tiger reserve and, as if that isn’t enough, other animals that you will be able to look out for on your morning and evening game safaris here include elephants, water buffalo and superb birdlife. <br/><br/>In contrast, your time spent in the Sunderbans, in the state of West Bengal and accessed by an internal flight to Calcutta and onward transfer to Sonakhali, is all about water. This UNESCO World Heritage Site recognises the importance of this vast wetland of estuarine forests, mangroves and maze of rivers around the Ganga delta. On two different river cruises you will have chances to spot creatures ranging from crocodiles to chitals, wild boar to Olive Ridley turtles. The birdlife is sublime too, with kingfishers, ibis, herons and storks dipping and diving all around and, last but not least, this is home to the largest population of Bengal tigers. <br/><br/>A tailor made itinerary to suit your interests, many of our guests often add on Kanha National Park to the trip, another haven for tigers. Or else, for a cultural highlight, we can organise a trip to Agra to see the Taj Mahal. <br/><br/>We recommend the best time to go wildlife watching for tigers and rhinos is between October and April.<br/>",

This park is a wonderful mix of grassy plateaus, open misty plains and bamboo forests and is home to around a hundred tigers. As well as leopard, sambhar, chital and monkeys. After being met in Delhi, you will be transferred to a hotel for the night before taking a domestic flight to Jabalpur to start your safari holiday. All domestic flights are included in the price of your holiday. <br/><br/>This tailor made holiday is designed by a wildlife watching specialist operator and, in particular, wild cat safaris. As well as Kanha National Park, we can organise tailor made safaris to other national parks in India where there are tiger populations, such as Bandhavgarh, Corbett or Ranthambore.  You will be accompanied by an expert local guide and will take at least five safaris within a park to maximise viewing opportunities. <br/><br/>We also recommend a night time spotting safari, although this is only possible in Panna and Satpura National Parks, using night vision equipment to spot tigers at night.  In Satpura National Park you can also go on a walking safari but whichever way you choose to go in search of tigers, we will ensure it is an ethical experience, as we are member of the Tour Operators for Tigers (TOFT) and follow their strict codes of practice. We also stay in TOFT approved lodges along the way. <br/><br/>We are proud of our 100% sighting rate and of course, you will also get a chance to see a wide array of other wildlife, not just tigers. Please note that we are very happy to organise this trip for a solo traveller as well as for groups.  The minimum age is eighteen. <br/><br/>The best time to go tiger watching in India is mid January to mid May. This is the hot dry season with the hottest time from beginning March until mid May. This is when tigers come out to waterholes to find water, or prey on other wildlife doing the same.",

    "generalInfo": "Nestled in West-central India, the lure of the Tiger at Tadoba and the fascinating undulating landscape at Pench is what drew us here many years ago in the pursuit of our love of photographing the stunning diversity of wildlife and game in what has come to be among the list of India’s best managed wildlife reserves on the sub-continent. <br/><br/>The etymology of Tadoba comes from the amalgamation of the tribal God Taru and the Andhari river that serves as the reserve’s water vein, filling it’s fresh water lakes during the brutal summer months. <br/><br/>Situated in the western state of Maharashtra, Tadoba’s wildlife fringes the local Gond tribal settlements around the region of Chandrapur. Traditional farmers and basket weavers, these tribes dwell in traditional village homes. Over the years we’ve cultivated a support system with these communities where we share with travellers what they do and how they carry on their process of living. We attempt to give back for our footprint in the region by supporting these communities by sourcing their produce and enlightening travellers about their culture and heritage. <br/><br/>It’s important to not just understand the rich bio-diversity of the park but also be made aware of the social conservation that inherently exists amongst these villages and their efforts in establishing a stable co-existence, especially within such close proximity, between man and wildlife in this region. <br/><br/>Pench on the other hand is situated in slightly hillier terrain over the border of Maharashtra and into the state of Madhya Pradesh in Central India.<br/><br/>Serving as an inspiration for Rudyard Kipling’s Jungle Book as home to Mowgli, it’s easy to see why Sir David Attenborough described Pench as the most appropriate location for documenting the behavior of Tigers in the wild. <br/><br/>Spread over an area of 750 square kilometres, Pench’s undulating terrain makes for a fascinating mix of plant species, rock caves and a fantastic diversity in woodland bird species. <br/><br/>But again, Pench is not just about the Tiger. In fact the excitement in pursuing unique species such as the four-horned Antelopes, wild dog packs, the elusive Leopards and the rather sly Indian Jackals. <br/><br/>With some of the best managed and regulated game drives within national Parks in India, the experience in Pench is of anticipation, intrigue and the satisfaction of being amidst nature in it’s best preserved state.",

Over 30 species of birds are endemic or near endemic to this region and this tour will also seek to see them all. <br/><br/>On this journey, you will also be sighting the other major wildlife like the Asian elephants, Sloth Bears, Dholes and possibly the big cats.

The place derives its name from Kannada - \"Naga\" meaning snake and \"hole\" referring to streams. The area was an exclusive hunting reserve of the former rulers of Mysore. It was set up in 1955 and is one of the best-managed parks in the country. This park is located to the northwest of Bandipur National Park. Kabini reservoir separates this park from Bandipur National Park. The climate is tropical, summers are hot and winters are pleasant. The park boasts of a healthy Tiger-predator ratio. Tigers, gaurs (Indian Bison) and Elephants are much denser here than in other reserves in South India. In fact this National Park is the best destination for viewing tigers and Asiatic elephants in large numbers during the four vehicle safaris during your stay here. The amazing wildlife in this area also includes Hyenas, Dholes (Wild Dogs), Sloth bears, Common Langurs, Leopards, Mouse Deer and Spotted Deer."

    "generalInfo": "Eastern India is one of the most biodiverse areas of the world; an area rich in forests, river systems and grasslands all bursting with wildlife. Some iconic and crictically endangered such as tigers, Asiatic elephants, Indian one-horned rhinos and others smaller and regionally endemic such as sunbirds, frogs and primates like Gee's golden langur and western Hoolock gibbon. <br/><br/>This tour explores some of the most famous and best wildlife watching locations in north-east India. These include the vast mangrove wetland ecosystms of the Sunderbans, the lush grasslands of Kaziranga and Manas as well as the seldom visited forests of Hoolongopar Gibbon Sanctuary. <br/><br/>For anyone interested in exploring some of India’s wildest and most remote national this is the tour for you.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/><br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching tours and safari holidays all over the world, specialising in the Indian subcontinent and of course the wonderful and diverse country of India. Whilst most wildlife watchers who visit India spend time in the famous tiger reserves of the central plains or maybe the sub-Himalayan parks of the north west and Western Ghats in the south. But these ecosystems and incredible wildlife are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the wildlife that India has to offer. <br/><br/>This tour explores some of the lesser known parks and takes you into the deepest parts of India’s north eastern rainforests, mangroves and grasslands . All of this whilst escorted by our very own expert zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) coupled with local guides. Of course there is one species in particular that dominates everyone’s thoughts and dreams when they think of an Indian safari and that is the beautiful tiger. <br/><br/>Whilst there are chances of seeing tigers here we take time to showcase the tiger’s ecosystem in full and try and find as many other animals that share the forests with tigers. We also offer a few different ways of exploring the parks, so however you like to travel through the tiger’s habitat we have the tour for you, whether you want to drive around in your own jeep, walk through the forests and grasslands tracking the elusive big cat or even via a boat or canoe in the water ways of the Sundarbans. <br/><br/>One of the reasons why our safaris of India are unique is that our background (as a company) is from a scientific and zoological standpoint and so have a great network of colleagues and contacts all over the world who are the people on the front line in search of the best new locations for wildlife watching in the wild. All of these reasons and many more make us experts in arranging and guiding safaris and are able to tailor a Indian safaris to any location to try to find them that you request. All you have to do is to get in touch with us and tell us your budget and your group size and where you would like to go on safari.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner - where mentioned in the itinerary). There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned vehicles with an excellent local driver for all transfers. We include internal flights where ever possible on all our Indian safaris. We use two brilliant full time guides; first a professional zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) will escort you on all your excursions and also a very knowledgeable English speaking local guide at each national park. Your zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) escort is an expert in mammal biology, ecology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. Your zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) escort has spent time studying and working with different species all over the world and he has years of experience guiding throughout most of India’s national parks. We also use local expert guides with decades of experience on all our Indian safaris. We also include all jeep safaris, guided walks, canoe safaris, boat-trips, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more individual safaris into national parks per tour than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the national parks to search for tigers and other wildlife. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on tigers and other Indian wildlife which are available to watch throughout the tour.<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>March and April is the dry season and best for wildlife. For wildlife watching in southern India we recommend visiting during March and April (this is the best overall game viewing in the Indian Subcontinent’s main tiger reserves and national parks). This is towards the end of the hot dry season and offers the best chances of seeing wildlife as the hotter and drier it gets the more the wildlife aggregate around waterholes as well as there being less vegetation blocking the view. <br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>•\tAll of our Indian safaris are guided by a local naturalist guides, drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife your watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>•\tWe use camera traps (where available) which will increase the chances of getting close up pictures and movies of tigers and other rare nocturnal wildlife.<br/>•\tDuring this tour we explore various national parks and wildlife sanctuaries (Sundarbans, Kaziranga, Manas and Hoolongapor Gibbon Sanctuary) which will give you a very good overview of the wild Eastern forests of India.<br/>•\tTravel into wonderful and world's largest mangrove forest of the Sundarbans in search of tigers, river dolphins and enormous slat-water crocodiles.<br/>•\tBy joining one of our Indian safaris you will have an overall wildlife experience as we are determined to showcase all of the wildlife of the parks we visit (not just tigers), you will not feel like a passenger in a rally and bounce all over the place in pursuit of tigers; we make sure all our Indian safaris are relaxed and environmentally friendly experiences. In fact the majority of tiger sightings that we enjoy in India are of tigers that our jeep and guides have found (as opposed to other operators who wait for a tiger to be seen and then stake out the waterhole surrounded by dozens of other jeeps), we always investigate any suspicious behaviour exhibited by their prey and usually find tigers by watching the deer and monkey behaviour as they change from relaxed to agitated when a predator is spotted.<br/>•\tWe have explored all the areas we visit in depth and have found the best and most conveniently located accommodations to stay in whilst searching out wildlife in isolated and remote places. Including some of the best and most ecologically friendly lodges in all of India.<br/>•\tWe are a member of Tour Operators for Tigers (TOFT) and we make sure that all of our tiger safaris run by their code of practice and we also make sure that all the accommodation we use is audited by TOFT to make sure of sustainable practices.<br/>•\tAll the above reasons give this our tiger tours and general wildlife holidays of India a great success rate of seeing tigers (100% in Bandhavgarh and close to 50% for this tour, which is very good considering the dense forests and vastness of the protected areas). <br/>•\tWe have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout the India and are able to find and observe species that are difficult to find or overlooked sometimes such as Indian leopards, Asiatic elephants, water buffalo, sloth bears, jungle cats, dhole, gaur and hundreds other endangered, rare or endemic species throughout the tigers current distribution. <br/>•\tDue to our greta network of guides and researchers throughout India we are able to organise tailor made safari to anywhere in India, whether it is Bandhavgarh, Kanha, Periyar, Kaziranga, Corbett, Ramthambore, Satpura, Tadoba, and many other wildlife watching locations you want to visit we can arrange it. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari holiday to India.<br/>•\tUnlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour takes you to the eastern states of Bengal and Assam all from the city of Kolkata where you will enter and leave India. The parks visited include the Sundarbans, Kaziranga, Assam and Hoolongapor Gibbon Sanctuary. <br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The fitness level required for this safari holiday is not very high. The vast majority of the activities are conducted from vehicles so no fitness is required, but there is some walking involved. The walking is all done at a leisurely pace with regular breaks, anyone who is used to mild hiking will find this easy.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 Years Old",

The place is full of thick forests with creepers and undergrowth and here one might see the Red Headed Trogon, Snowy Browed Flycatcher, Ferruginous Flycatcher, Lesser Shortwing, Grey Bellied Tesia, Slaty Headed Tesia and many other species of birds. After the morning gibbon watching and birding you will be stopping at a place inside the sanctuary for the packed lunch. After lunch you will continue searching forest for wildlife, including one of the only ape known from the Subcontinent. We have a choice of accommodation whilst exploring the Hoolongapor Gibbon Sanctuary, firstly for anyone interested in seeing the rare and elusive Bengal slow loris there is a single government run guest house (Forest Rest House) in fairly livable condition inside the forest – those interested to see the Slow Loris will need to spend the night inside the sanctuary. Where after dinner a short walk for about an hour might reveal a Loris. However the decision regarding the stay has to be done prior to coming at Gibbon and the permission for the night walk has to be secured from the authorities – so we would need to know at the time of booking. The best time for the Loris is February – though it is sighted in other months too. For anyone not wanting to stay here we will leave the sanctuary towards sundown and drive back to other accommodation. (all meals included today)"

The impressive mixture of the city’s rich history pushes against the modern buildings, cars, and commerce. Delhi’s past is displayed in the museums and ruins. The Red Fortress was once converted to British barracks and continues to stand with vibrant red colors, from the sandstone walls to the towers that bring a sense of majesty from its glory days during the Mughal dynasty in the 17th century. The walls extend over 54 feet tall encompassing the vibrancy of Delhi’s opulence within the large and quiet walls that hide the modern world away . You can also find the India Gate, a larch arch reaching over 126 feet high and built in 1931 as a war memorial. The wide and long stretch of road that leads to the monument allows you to also view the unending flame within the archway. You will have the evening to yourself able to enjoy the aromas of the famous mutton burra kebab near the old mosque as the marinated meat delicately lingers over charcoal."

You depart the capital and make your way to the famous Pink City of Jaipur. You arrive in the afternoon and will settle yourself in the comforts of your hotel before you make your way through the city on a guided tour. The city was founded in the 18th century. The precious pink coloration stems from the use of sandstone to construct much of the Mughal city which was repainted in the 19th century. The vibrant hues and the people’s energy seem to collaborate giving an ebb and flow to the streets where rickshaws and buses rush by meandering camels. The Galta Monkey Temple is situated within the tranquil yet impressive surroundings nestled between two granite cliffs. Known for the natural fresh water springs and holy water tanks, the marvelous temple shimmers pink within the foothills and looks more like a palace than a temple. As you ascend the stairways and walk along the edges of the pools you hear hymns and chants, but also interspersed animal screeches. An abundance of monkeys run along the upper levels, speeding over towers and rails, resting on the domed cupolas, and sipping water from the pools. You notice locals feeding the monkeys nuts and fruits. Stunning landscape, opulent architecture, and now the incredible wilds all surround you."

The City Palace comprises marvelous courtyards, gardens, and buildings at the heart of the Old City, creating a lavish combination of Mughal and Rajasthani architecture. The incredible pink coloration of the Chandra Mahal glows over the open square. The tranquil complex brings a subtle contrast to the surrounding energy of the modern city’s electric streets. Adjacent to the palace is the tremendous Jantar Mantar Observatory. The interesting sculptures displayed within the courtyard were specialized astronomical tools and were constructed in the 18th century. Meander along the 14 structures to discover the range of their functions; the instruments are used for measuring time and tracking the stars. Each instrument was chiseled from stone and adds to the continued inspiring feelings emitted from the complex. The sundial reaches a peak of 90 feet tall. You can see its shadow moving every minute, capturing the swiftness of time and the impeccable imagination of the past."

The structure is situated at the edges of a lush courtyard like a crowning jewel. The complex dates back to the 17th century and was built as a tomb for the wife of emperor Shah Jahan. The entire structure is made of marble, which accounts for the way the opulent walls and Moorish dome catch the changing light throughout the day. Standing at the entrance of the complex gives the structure an entirely new look. The garden is lush with manicured trees and bushes and lined with walkways and placid ponds. The water reflects the image of the Taj Mahal when the fountains aren’t trickling. The minarets rise over 120 feet tall with a backdrop of open sky. The central structure contains pieces of semi-precious stones that bring different colors to the floral carvings. There is a surreal quality to the building and the complex, where symmetry is highlighted and delicate light shines through the marble screens. In the evening you will venture into the comforts of a first-class night train to Umaria."

Your train arrives in the early morning and your private transfer takes you to your jungle resort in no time. The earthen aromas of lush leaves and wet earth mix with the scent of spiced tea. A guided game drive will take you out into the vast forest in search of the wild that is known to scour the trees and grasslands. The park is also home to the famous white tigers of Rewa. Declared a National Park in the late 1960s you will traverse the park on the windy roads that take you up to the 2,400 feet high summit where the old fortress continues to look out over the expanse of wild. Endangered vultures nest within the towers and ramparts of the old protectorate that is now overgrown with vines and roots. Statues of Hindu gods continue to mark the complex, some sit beneath branches and others are somewhat covered in moss. The fort itself is thought to be over 2,000 years old, where even the caves that dig into the mountain were manmade and used as stables. Now those very caves are home to an abundant bat colony that is vibrant in the evening. They swoop through the air in search of prey. Step along the sturdy stone pillars to find spaces that nature hasn’t yet overtaken. It adds to the fortress’ natural and constructed wonder."

In the morning you will be met by your guide and vehicle, which turns out to be an elephant with a comfortable wooden saddle along its back. You make your way through the tall, thin sal trees in search of the famous, regal tiger atop your pachyderm ride. En route you notice a small brownish-furred figure amongst the trees and discover the barking deer. The males have short antlers used for fighting over territory or mates. If you’re lucky enough to hear one call, it sounds similar to a dog’s bark. Its ears twitch as your ride trundles through the forest until the deer disappears beyond the tree line. The elephant is intent and focused with every step, somehow elegant in its walk even with its lumbering size. When you come to a raised ridge your guide and the elephant abruptly stop. Prowling close by is the black striped fur of a tiger watching you come closer through the wild grass. You can make out its face between the blades but its body seems to blend in effortlessly. You watch the large cat but are sure not to challenge it by looking into its eyes. It soon decides that you are not a threat and rushes past leaving you, your guide, and the elephant behind."

The diverse topography comes from the Horseshoe Valley at the foothills of the Mekal Mountains where the Surpan River winds its way along the grasslands. In the evening you will set out on a game drive to explore the sensational nature when the wildlife awakens with vigor after the midday heat recedes.

On top of the animal’s back you sway with every step and watch the grasslands below, the trees above, and the vast expanse in front, while searching for leopards in the branches and tigers in the bush. Every now and then your elephant pushes aside a tree or brings up a sapling’s roots. It marks the path and spreads the seeds along the forest floor. Close by you find the graceful but skittish dhole , an Asiatic wild dog with red fur, a black tail, and a bark that sounds more like a whistle. It is easy to imagine an unaltered state of the forest, brimming with flora and fauna over the mountains and along the riverbanks. As you listen to the rambunctious chirp of the dhole you find awe in their playfulness with one another and in the surrounding rising grassland."

Kanha National Park is known as the inspiration for Kipling’s The Jungle Book and persists in its ability to awe visitors in the same way it once captivated the famous novelist. The day takes you out into the woods once more in search of the tiger, referred to as “Shir Khan” in The Jungle Book in reference to the tiger’s power and prowess within these lush lands. When you come across the tiger in the wild you find unquestionable beauty in its stride. You notice its black and faded orange tail curling under its hind legs. Each step it takes is slow and calculated, not wanting to waste any unnecessary energy. Adult tigers, especially males, are often solitary, so when you come across two tigers lingering at the edges of the river you will witness a rare moment when the cats display how relaxed and delicate they can be toward each. As the sunlight drifts across the sky you don’t want to pull yourself away from the extraordinary vision of the wild."

        "description": "Once more you will venture out to explore the depths of the flora and fauna within Kanha National Park. With your professional and seasoned guide you will traverse through the revving of early morning forest. Sloth bears are nocturnal but can be seen traveling through the woods within the early mixture of night and day. Their lanky build and shaggy coats create a mane around their face. Their lower lip has been adapted to dig for insects. The bamboo forest shapes the terrain as much as the rising mountains creating the valley. The scent of bamboo and sal are picked up in the breeze while the quiet atmosphere brings an echo to the rustling leaves. When you look into the trees you can see a branch dangling from an awkward angle. Soon you realize that it isn’t a branch but a tail, flicking lightly in the warm afternoon air. Able to leap more than 20 feet and capable of carrying an animal three times their own weight straight up a tree, the leopard’s nocturnal nature keeps them lazing about in the cool shade of the canopy during the day. You watch its tail swish along the branches and you can see the leopard’s elegant spots as well. As one of the most prolific cats, you cannot deny its stunning grace. In the evening upon your return to the hotel you can sit around the fire and listen to jungle tales that range from tribal dances with fabulous rhythms, to simple stories that have been passed down through the ages, adding mystery to the starlight and understanding to the relationship of animals and humankind."

        "title": "Kanha National Park – Discovering the Wildlife",
        "description": "When you find yourself within the beauty of nature, no matter the time of day, you can’t help but marvel at the serene landscape of the extensive grassland, oftentimes towering over the Indian bison that you see grazing in the distance. The forest canopy mixes sal and pakur trees and the foothills bring the bamboo thickets to abundance. You hear a hawk-eagle call in the sky, circling somewhere beyond the lush leaves that have overtaken the view. Cheetal deer groom one another along the riverbanks, their white spots glowing against their brown fur. Peacocks stand attentively on branches that overlook the tall grass and their chortle brushes through the blades. Their effervescent blue feathers look like a spotlight, standing out against the coloration of the landscape. The day brings another endless collection of wildlife along garnered memories, whether from your photos or from the pictures in your mind, all wrapped together with the tranquil sounds and abundant life of the park. Upon your evening return to the lodge you are certain that the following day will bring you close to the majesty of tigers."

        "title": "Kanha National Park – An Elephantine Exploration",
        "description": "This morning you can experience Kanha a different way by scouring the plains and forest on the back of an elephant instead of in an open air vehicle. You climb aboard the pachyderm early in the morning and sit comfortably in a brass saddle covered with pillows. You already feel like the moment has accentuated your exploration of the wilds in India. Every second seems to be worth a photograph as your elephant steps with intent, able to traverse the dense forest, steep foothills, and tall grasslands without worry. The longer you travel through the flora, the more excited you become, as you scour the distance in search of the largest wildcat. Finally, you spot one, resting at the edges of a marsh with its paws dipped into the water. You have only imagined its exquisiteness, but up close you find that your images don’t measure up to what the tiger looks like in reality. Its coat glows in the afternoon light. It lounges against the comfort of the cool water. The black and orange coloration somehow blends into the grasslands around it. As the photos of the tiger hold strong in your camera and your mind, you continue through the forest, where you will come to the river where you can help your guide wash the elephant if you wish. Note: All interactions with wildlife planned with our travel experts are ethical and humane"

You are taken to your hotel where you can relax with the rest of the day at your whim and pleasure, whether that means reclining on the rooftop terrace, watching the racing rickshaws and horse carts close to the old market, or venturing once more through the historical sites of the city to revisit the culture that you will soon leave behind. Jama Masjid is the largest mosque in the city and dates back to the 17th century under the Islamic Mughal Empire. Multiple entrances surround the sandstone walls that lead to the main worship deck. The area is often brimming with people who come both to pray and to witness the architectural integrity of the ancient mosque. Two minarets and a smattering of onion-shaped domes create a particular skyline as the scent of grilled cuisine lifts around the main entrance gates from a local restaurant nearby."

The clothing flows effortlessly in the breeze with the vivacious aromas of coriander and cinnamon. The palpable energy boosts you to readiness, eager to venture out and visit the city. Your private transfer will have you settled into your accommodation where the rest of the day is at your leisure to rest or explore, with your guide eager to help in any way. Once within the city you notice the endless activity in the streets. People sip chai on the corners and people form long lines in front of food-stands where the aroma of smoky charcoal adds succulence to the grilled meats. At Hauz Khas Complex you will find history wrapped in the ancient network of ruins, from a mosque to a once important water tank. Dating back to the 14th century, the water tank stored rainwater only to be used when necessary in the dry season. Around the stone ruins where columns support bulbous domes atop risen porticos, you can see local college students studying or relaxing between classes, giving a rebirth of modern life to the ancient stones."

Venturing through Delhi brings richness to the history and the current state of the city. At the Qutb Minar Complex you will find the first monuments erected by the Mehrauli sultans dating back to the 13th century. The sandstone coloration brings a depth of red to the tower that stands over 217 feet tall. The fluting fluctuates between angular and rounded bringing a variety of textures to the pillar. It is hard not to notice the Alai Darwaza Gate, the main gateway built in the 14th century. The dome brings a collection of red sandstone and white marble to the complex with latticed stone screens and is the first building in India to display Islamic architecture. The surrounding architectural park is filled with locals and visitors alike, some enjoying the beauty of the past while others simply come for the open space and stillness, away from the outer walls of endless vibrancy.

You are met by your private jeep and are ready to explore the magnificent nature once more. At the summit of the 2,433-foot tall mountain is a 10th century fort, once the stronghold known as Moti Mahal. From the height of the mountain and scouring along the ruin fortress walls, you can look out over the expansive jungle, even through the canopy to grounds below. Past the entrance gate you notice the walls overtaken by nature, shrouded with elegant vines and sprawling leaves. Man-made caves that once housed horses are now home to a thriving bat colony. Even within the once prominent fortress, the structure has been combined with the surrounding nature, not just within the foliage but also with the wildlife. Deer traipse through open space and nibble on the grass. Falcons swirl the air in search of food, and old statues lie beneath looming trees."

The jeep trundles through the unpaved pathways and vines dangle overhead. The scent of dry earth is pleasant in the cool early hours of the day. Vultures circle in the distance above the peak where the fortress is situated. You continue to scour the contrasts of desiccated and colorful grass. Your guide stops the jeep and quietly points into the distance. You can see a tiger laying its head down in a marsh overrun with thick grass. It laps at the blue pond water with calm strokes. The orange coat glows with sharp black stripes with patches of white along her underbelly. The moment is not just unique but unparalleled, giving you a look of the largest wildcat in its natural habitat. Soon the tiger finishes its drink and sets out into the grasslands disappearing within the jungle as quickly as it had appeared."

The morning breeze brushes against your cheeks as you tour along the unpaved pathways beneath the thin tower of trees and beside the open grasslands in search of the regions most notable inhabitant, the tiger. As the biggest cat in the wild, the tiger can weigh over 700 pounds with a length of almost 11 feet. The scent of leaves and brush fills the air. The calm forestry is palpable with the independent birdcalls chirping sporadically in the silence. As you peer into the meadow along the warm afternoon you find a large male tiger relaxing in the shade of dangling branches out of the sun’s reach. His coat ranges from yellow to light orange with dark brown stripes stretched long on his body and decorating his face. The magnitude of the cat adds to its splendor. After you or the tiger move on, you will continue your exploration of the jungle to see more of the fabulous nature in action."

The compartment that sits on the elephant’s back sways back and forth like a boat as your ride steps with large, intent steps, taking you deeper through the trees. Now and again it strips the bark from the towering sals and you can hear the wood splinter into the air. Your guide brings you to the riverbanks where, within the meadow, you find a collection of deer. One of the animals proudly presents its large, splaying antlers which rise above the grassland. The serene image of deer grazing in the meadow near the water viewed from your position atop an elephant is a memory that you know will be treasured."
