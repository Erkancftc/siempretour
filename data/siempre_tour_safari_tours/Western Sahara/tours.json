    "generalInfo": "This specialist mammal watching tour focuses on the some wonderful but often elusive desert wildlife (particularly mammals) of the remote Western Sahara. There is a special focus on the rare and iconic nocturnal mammals of this part of the world and so there are some very long (but productive and rewarding) nights of spotlighting throughout the trip. <br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>On this rare wildlife tour some of our targeted species are among the rarest and most elusive nocturnal creatures in the world (as well as being some of the most sought after species of mammal watchers worldwide). Species such as African golden wolf, Fennec &amp; Ruppell’s Foxes, African wild cat, Sand Cat, Saharan Striped Polecat &amp; Desert Hedgehog are all possible on this tour and we have a very good success rate with many of these species including the two top priority animals which are fennec foxes and sand cats. <br/><br/>The tour will involve some stunning desert camping and after dark the beautiful and spectacular starry skies are among some of the best in the world. All in all this tour is a great overview of the Western Sahara’s fascinating and unique wildlife, much of which is very difficult to see elsewhere.<br/><br/>It is hard not to be mesmerised by the expanse of sand and wilderness of the Sahara and it is easy to think that the whole area is devoid of life, however on closer inspection there are many species of birds and reptiles which live on the dunes and gravel pans during the day and then after dark when the temperatures drop the landscape comes alive with jerboas, gerbils and their predators which include various foxes, mustelids and of course the tiny sand cat. <br/> <br/>We are specialists at rare mammal watching tours all over the world and can tailor tours to any specifictions. Whether you are interested in desert mammals of the Western Sahara or trying to see the critically endangered Javan Rhino or look for Giant Pandas in China we have the options for you, as well as many other safari options.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Dakhla. We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers and game drives and spotlighting. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Western Sahara. Your naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. Whilst the trip involves a lot of camps, for the camping we will provide all of the camping equipment the only thing you will need to bring is your sleeping bag. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the Western Saharan wilderness, night safaris are available in some locations (subject to the local conditions on that day). You will have to speak to your guide on arrival there and book places on these (this is not included). A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>We plan this tour from November - March as it is cooler in the winter and so the wildlife is more active for longer than in the hotter times of year. Also there is more night time hours and as most of the wildlife on the trip is nocturnal, that factor helps us also.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist guides as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it. We do our best to include as many wildlife activities as possible in all of our itineraries.<br/>• Depending on budget and interest we have a range of different accommodation packages to offer, from luxury top end lodges, national park safari lodges and mobile-camps which often offer unbelievable wildlife watching deep inside national parks as well as camping. We can also arrange mobile camping safaris of Botswana is very popular and all of your camping gear will be provided.<br/>• Spend all the daylight hours searching for wildlife and visiting various natural wonders and stunning landscapes.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our Western Sahara wildlife safaris a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Southern Africa so that we can try and find and observe some of the rarer and more elusive species. We have great itineraries and expertise in all African countries (such as Namibia, Gabon, Ethiopia, Madagascar, South Africa, Tanzania, Botswana, Kenya, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Uganda, Rwanda and Mozambique) and can arrange trips to find some of the rarer species such as mandrills, aardvarks, gelada baboons aardwolves, brown hyenas and black-footed cats among other species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour visits two general locations within Western Sahara, however they are best kept relatively secret as they are unprotected and so we do not want to highlight the presence of wildlife in these areas and potentially open the area up to poaching.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from a vehicle and whilst there is some walking, most of the walking is over flat terrain. This doesn't require any special fitness level. The biggest consideration is the heat, it is very hot in the wilderness of Western Sahara during the day.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 15 Years Old<br/><br/>Photo Credits:<br/>Javi Elorriaga<br/>Payman sazesh, CC BY-SA 3.0<br/>Leonemanuel, CC BY-SA 4.0",
