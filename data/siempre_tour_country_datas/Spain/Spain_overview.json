    "Main_Title": "Our Spain holidays & tours",
    "Main_Paragraph": "The most interesting parts of Spain aren’t found along the Costas, in the city centres or on island resorts. We know that they are found inland, among the peaks of the Pyrenees and the Picos de Europa, in the Catalonia countryside, or the Altiplano de Granada in Andalucia. Our Spain holidays champion the traditional culture found in the mountains and plains by bringing you into contact with communities happy to share their ways of life with you. Walking mountain landscapes with knowledgeable local guides, language or cookery lessons, and multi activity holidays where you stay in family-run guest houses – this is Spain.",
    "Subtitle": "More about our Spain holidays",
    "Title1": "Walking in Spain",
    "Paragraph1": "There are two immediate reasons why you’d want to go walking in Spain: great weather and great scenery. Our walking holidays seek shade in Mediterranean forests in Catalonia, hike between striking white villages in Andalucía, and wander the vivid green valleys of the Basque country. Take time in these special areas and you realise that every part of Spain has its own local identity, every town has a specialty, and every region runs on its own calendar of festivals. Our holidays use local guides and visits the markets, restaurants and shops that form the heart of these communities, so that you experience the best of the region, while also contributing to its success.",

    "Title2": "Cycling in Spain",
    "Paragraph2": "When each village has a different specialty, there's no better way to see Spain than on one of our cycling holidays. Pedal between settlements, stopping for a well-earned lunch every day. There are quiet roads and well-established cycle paths, and – whether you’re freewheeling through orange groves or tackling a summit – it’s a great landscape to take in from two wheels.  Our cycling holidays go everywhere from wetlands in Alicante to coastal forest in Catalonia, or overtake walkers on the Camino de Santiago. In central Spain, you only have to go a little way out of Madrid to find yourself cycling in some really wild Castilian countryside.",

    "Title3": "Spain for families",
    "Paragraph3": "When the water is this warm and the weather this sunny, there’s no question that our family holidays in Spain will be an instant hit with your little ones. If your kids love splashing around, activity holidays in Andalucía, a villa in Lanzarote, or a trip to Catalonia’s Costa Brava will suit them, whilst older teens will enjoy the great outdoors in the Spanish Pyrenees or the Picos Mountains, or tackling some more rugged Catalan terrain on a mountain bike. Spanish food is delicious and kid-friendly, and paella and tapas are a great way to end the day.",
    "Title4": "Flight free holidays",
    "Paragraph4": "Spain is well connected by rail, not just between cities, but with neighbouring France and Portugal too, meaning that a flight free holiday is perfectly possible. If you’re travelling from London, you could be in Spain 15 hours later, travelling via Paris or Lyon and changing train just before the French-Spanish border. We have a great team of travel experts and partners who can help if you are looking for your next flight free adventure, and they can help you with everything from itineraries to timings and bookings. Spain by train isn’t just doable, it’s highly enjoyable.",

    "Title5": "Tours & holidays in Spain",
    "Paragraph5": "Seeing Spain in a small group gives you a ready-made social circle, and is especially great if you’re interested in learning and practising your Spanish. There are plenty of active ways to see the country. Our walking holidays take advantage of the great weather and scenery, cycling holidays take you through quiet towns off the tourist trail and our multi activity holidays give you a little bit of both, plus kayaking and paddle boarding. Our adventure holidays in Spain aren’t just for the brave – they’re for the curious. You can learn Spanish, go horse riding, or even try a little winter walking. Best of all, our trips are designed to benefit the communities and protect the natural surroundings that they visit.",
    "Title6": "Where to go on holiday in Spain",
    "Paragraph6": "Spain’s best holidays highlight its diversity. Catalonia shows that Spain’s identity isn’t as simple as it seems – the Catalan language, cuisine and traditions distinguish this autonomous region, as does its famously pretty coastline. Andalucía’s Moorish architecture in the beautiful cities of Seville, Cordoba and Granada still points to its previous tenants – the Moors occupied large parts of Spain for centuries. Further north, Spain becomes greener, making the famous Camino de Santiago, which runs for 800km all the way from Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port in France to Santiago de Compostela in Galicia, if not a walk in the park, then a walk in the pastoral."
