    "Main_Title": "Our Ivory Coast holidays & tours",
    "Main_Paragraph": "As well as the undeniable coastal charms of Sassandra and Grand-Bassam, our Ivory Coast holidays promise visitors a fascinating cultural immersion. Our tours here typically begin in the emptiest political capital in the world, Yamoussoukro, but then quickly take you out on the road to learn about the rich traditions of Ivory Coast’s many ethnic groups. You’ll witness or even take part in tribal ceremonies such as the Senufo mask dance, or a rare jongleurs performance in a Guere settlement. And you’ll meet skilled craftspeople like blacksmiths hard at work, or the Dan tribe, who build bridges from living vines. Not only do you enjoy a deeply enthralling tour, but these many different communities gain significant economic benefit from responsible tourism.",

    "Title1": "1. Abidjan",
    "Paragraph1": "Ivory Coasts beating heart, Abidjan is New York City with a tropical West African flavour: a seemingly endless sprawl across islands, peninsulas and lagoons, crowned by glittering skyscrapers. It may appear chaotic but dig deep and youll find excellent galleries and markets, a fine national museum and some of the best music in West Africa. Not to mention restaurants serving food with the kind of panache youd expect in Paris.",

    "Title2": "2. Bouaké",
    "Paragraph2": "Set in the Vallée du Bandama, at a crossroads between the arid north and the more verdant south, Ivory Coasts sleepy second city is the historical home of the Baoulé people, who are related to the Ashanti of Ghana. Theres plenty of opportunity to see their dancing, weaving, ceramic and sculptural traditions, both in the city and in the surrounding villages.",

    "Title3": "3. Grand Bassam",
    "Paragraph3": "Yes, its less than an hour from Abidjan, but this elegantly ageing grande dame is a far more laidback affair. Once a colonial trading post and the capital of French Côte dIvoire, Grand Bassam was named a UNESCO site in 2012 and is a popular beach break for metropolitan Ivorians and tourists alike, thanks to its gorgeous blonde beaches, faded 19th century architecture and terrace restaurants overlooking the sea.",
    "Title4": "4. Korhogo",
    "Paragraph4": "Surrounded by dry bush, savannah and mud caked roads, Korhogo, the capital of the Senufo people, dates back to the 13th century. It saw fighting during the 2002-7 and 2011 civil wars, but its regaining its reputation as a cultural hub. In nearby villages, weavers, painters, metalworkers and wood carvers practice their craft, many using pre-modern techniques. Look out for a\nBoloy\n, or panther dance, performed by initiated young men.",
    "image3": "",
    "Title5": "5. Man",
    "Paragraph5": "Snuggled next to the vivid green peaks of the Toura Mountains and surrounded by farms and cocoa plantations, this relaxed mountain town entices visitors to come and hike in the crisp mountain air, visit the tumbling La Cascade waterfall or explore the surrounding rainforest: a green world home to sacred monkeys and mysterious liana bridges, built secretly in only one night by young men being initiated into the Dan tribe.",
    "Title6": "6. Yamoussoukro",
    "Paragraph6": "Abidjan might feel like the capital, but it is in fact sedate Yamkro that takes that particular political prize. The birthplace of the countrys first president, Félix Houphouët-Boigny, it was built on the site of his ancestral village and is home to a surprising number of massive buildings, including the presidential palace and the imposing Basilica, even bigger than the Vaticans St Peters Basilica by which it was allegedly inspired."
