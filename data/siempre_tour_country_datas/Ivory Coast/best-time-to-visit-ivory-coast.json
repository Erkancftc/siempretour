    "Main_Paragraph": "Ivory Coast is typically tropical: hot and humid in the south, and a little cooler in the north and the west. Being so close to the equator, it experiences little variation in temperature, with seasons restricted to wet and dry, or windy. Daytime temperatures in the equatorial south of the country regularly surpass 30°C, with temperatures in the tropical centre and the arid and semi-arid north a little cooler, particularly at night. The best time to go to Ivory Coast tends to be the dry season, roughly from December to April.",

    "when_to_go_html": "Mid-November to April is the dry season, and the most pleasant time to travel. You wont have issues with blocked roads from floods, there are fewer malaria carrying mosquitoes and there are some excellent festivals on the agenda, such as the Fête de IAbissa in Grand Bassam in November and the Fêtes des Masques held in the villages around Man in February. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe harmattan wind blows down from the Sahara from December, January, February and March. It can cool temperatures a little but be prepared for dusty haze and uncomfortable dryness, as well as reduced visibility for both photography and sightseeing. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe rainy season lasts from May to October, with rains the heaviest in the south from May to July, and the lowest average temperatures in August and September. If youre planning to explore the west, June to October is best avoided, as the rains can cause roads and hiking paths to deteriorate with alarming speed.",

    "paragraph2": "Aled Evans, from our supplier Undiscovered Destinations, shares his Ivory Coast travel tips:\nBy taking a tour in Ivory Coast, you have all the arrangements in place and ready. An organised tour reduces the stress meaning that all your transport and accommodation is pre-booked and confirmed before you travel. An expert local guide also accompanies the tour meaning that language issues are not a problem and you also get a more in depth experience of the local culture. By travelling as a small group (max. 12 people) the costs are also lower than independent travel as travel and guiding costs are split amongst all the travellers.",
    "title3": "Challenges on the road",
    "paragraph3": "Aled Evans from our supplier Undiscovered Destinations:\nAs with many of the countries in West Africa, public transport schedules and road conditions can make travelling unpredictable. Journey times can be doubled by unforeseen road blockages and check points. Hotel accommodation is surprisingly good but travellers in the country should not expect Western standards of service. This is a country still emerging from civil war and the effects can still be clearly seen.",
    "title4": "",
    "paragraph4": "Tips from Jim OBrien, from our supplier Native Eye:\nIvory Coast is reasonably well developed compared to some other countries in the region. It was a favoured colony of France and as such the level of development, especially in the south, is high. But even so the roads can be bad at times, especially in the north  you need to have patience when travelling here. As in all of West Africa, the infrastructure isnt the same as at home, but with a flexible approach and a sense of humour, it shouldnt pose too much of a challenge.",
    "title5": "Cultural highlights",
    "paragraph5": "Tips from Jim OBrien from our supplier Native Eye:\nFor me, the main cultural highlight of a visit here is most definitely seeing the mask dances of various groups  the Dan, Baoule and Senoufou people, for example.",
    "title6": "",
    "paragraph6": "Aled Evans from our supplier Undiscovered Destinations:\nThe large variety of tribes (approximately 60 different ethnic groups) that you will meet all have their own unique history. As an example, the Baulé people are of Akan lineage originating from Ghana and in the vicinity of Odienne live the Malinké, descendants of the old empire of Mali. All have their own cultural traditions and the production of handicrafts summarises these differences: fine statues that represent the world of the spirits, weaving loom pulleys, and masks."
