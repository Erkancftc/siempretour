        "Main_Paragraph": "As well as the undeniable coastal charms of Sassandra and Grand-Bassam, our Ivory Coast holidays promise visitors a fascinating cultural immersion. Our tours here typically begin in the emptiest political capital in the world, Yamoussoukro, but then quickly take you out on the road to learn about the rich traditions of Ivory Coast’s many ethnic groups. You’ll witness or even take part in tribal ceremonies such as the Senufo mask dance, or a rare jongleurs performance in a Guere settlement. And you’ll meet skilled craftspeople like blacksmiths hard at work, or the Dan tribe, who build bridges from living vines. Not only do you enjoy a deeply enthralling tour, but these many different communities gain significant economic benefit from responsible tourism.",

        "Title1": "1. Abidjan",
        "Paragraph1": "Ivory Coasts beating heart, Abidjan is New York City with a tropical West African flavour: a seemingly endless sprawl across islands, peninsulas and lagoons, crowned by glittering skyscrapers. It may appear chaotic but dig deep and youll find excellent galleries and markets, a fine national museum and some of the best music in West Africa. Not to mention restaurants serving food with the kind of panache youd expect in Paris.",
        "image1": "",
        "Title2": "2. Bouaké",
        "Paragraph2": "Set in the Vallée du Bandama, at a crossroads between the arid north and the more verdant south, Ivory Coasts sleepy second city is the historical home of the Baoulé people, who are related to the Ashanti of Ghana. Theres plenty of opportunity to see their dancing, weaving, ceramic and sculptural traditions, both in the city and in the surrounding villages.",
        "image2": "",
        "Title3": "3. Grand Bassam",
        "Paragraph3": "Yes, its less than an hour from Abidjan, but this elegantly ageing grande dame is a far more laidback affair. Once a colonial trading post and the capital of French Côte dIvoire, Grand Bassam was named a UNESCO site in 2012 and is a popular beach break for metropolitan Ivorians and tourists alike, thanks to its gorgeous blonde beaches, faded 19th century architecture and terrace restaurants overlooking the sea.",
        "Title4": "4. Korhogo",
        "Paragraph4": "Surrounded by dry bush, savannah and mud caked roads, Korhogo, the capital of the Senufo people, dates back to the 13th century. It saw fighting during the 2002-7 and 2011 civil wars, but its regaining its reputation as a cultural hub. In nearby villages, weavers, painters, metalworkers and wood carvers practice their craft, many using pre-modern techniques. Look out for a\nBoloy\n, or panther dance, performed by initiated young men.",
        "image3": "",
        "Title5": "5. Man",
        "Paragraph5": "Snuggled next to the vivid green peaks of the Toura Mountains and surrounded by farms and cocoa plantations, this relaxed mountain town entices visitors to come and hike in the crisp mountain air, visit the tumbling La Cascade waterfall or explore the surrounding rainforest: a green world home to sacred monkeys and mysterious liana bridges, built secretly in only one night by young men being initiated into the Dan tribe.",
        "Title6": "6. Yamoussoukro",
        "Paragraph6": "Abidjan might feel like the capital, but it is in fact sedate Yamkro that takes that particular political prize. The birthplace of the countrys first president, Félix Houphouët-Boigny, it was built on the site of his ancestral village and is home to a surprising number of massive buildings, including the presidential palace and the imposing Basilica, even bigger than the Vaticans St Peters Basilica by which it was allegedly inspired."

        "Main_Paragraph": "Ivory Coast is typically tropical: hot and humid in the south, and a little cooler in the north and the west. Being so close to the equator, it experiences little variation in temperature, with seasons restricted to wet and dry, or windy. Daytime temperatures in the equatorial south of the country regularly surpass 30°C, with temperatures in the tropical centre and the arid and semi-arid north a little cooler, particularly at night. The best time to go to Ivory Coast tends to be the dry season, roughly from December to April.",

        "when_to_go": "When to visit Ivory Coast & when not to",
        "when_to_go_html": "Mid-November to April is the dry season, and the most pleasant time to travel. You wont have issues with blocked roads from floods, there are fewer malaria carrying mosquitoes and there are some excellent festivals on the agenda, such as the Fête de IAbissa in Grand Bassam in November and the Fêtes des Masques held in the villages around Man in February. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe harmattan wind blows down from the Sahara from December, January, February and March. It can cool temperatures a little but be prepared for dusty haze and uncomfortable dryness, as well as reduced visibility for both photography and sightseeing. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe rainy season lasts from May to October, with rains the heaviest in the south from May to July, and the lowest average temperatures in August and September. If youre planning to explore the west, June to October is best avoided, as the rains can cause roads and hiking paths to deteriorate with alarming speed.",

        "paragraph2": "Aled Evans, from our supplier Undiscovered Destinations, shares his Ivory Coast travel tips:\nBy taking a tour in Ivory Coast, you have all the arrangements in place and ready. An organised tour reduces the stress meaning that all your transport and accommodation is pre-booked and confirmed before you travel. An expert local guide also accompanies the tour meaning that language issues are not a problem and you also get a more in depth experience of the local culture. By travelling as a small group (max. 12 people) the costs are also lower than independent travel as travel and guiding costs are split amongst all the travellers.",
        "title3": "Challenges on the road",
        "paragraph3": "Aled Evans from our supplier Undiscovered Destinations:\nAs with many of the countries in West Africa, public transport schedules and road conditions can make travelling unpredictable. Journey times can be doubled by unforeseen road blockages and check points. Hotel accommodation is surprisingly good but travellers in the country should not expect Western standards of service. This is a country still emerging from civil war and the effects can still be clearly seen.",
        "title4": "",
        "paragraph4": "Tips from Jim OBrien, from our supplier Native Eye:\nIvory Coast is reasonably well developed compared to some other countries in the region. It was a favoured colony of France and as such the level of development, especially in the south, is high. But even so the roads can be bad at times, especially in the north  you need to have patience when travelling here. As in all of West Africa, the infrastructure isnt the same as at home, but with a flexible approach and a sense of humour, it shouldnt pose too much of a challenge.",
        "title5": "Cultural highlights",
        "paragraph5": "Tips from Jim OBrien from our supplier Native Eye:\nFor me, the main cultural highlight of a visit here is most definitely seeing the mask dances of various groups  the Dan, Baoule and Senoufou people, for example.",
        "title6": "",
        "paragraph6": "Aled Evans from our supplier Undiscovered Destinations:\nThe large variety of tribes (approximately 60 different ethnic groups) that you will meet all have their own unique history. As an example, the Baulé people are of Akan lineage originating from Ghana and in the vicinity of Odienne live the Malinké, descendants of the old empire of Mali. All have their own cultural traditions and the production of handicrafts summarises these differences: fine statues that represent the world of the spirits, weaving loom pulleys, and masks."
