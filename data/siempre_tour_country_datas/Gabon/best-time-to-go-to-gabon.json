    "Main_Paragraph": "The best time to visit Gabon is during the drier season of May to September, with June, July and August being the driest months, although dry is relative here  Gabon experiences around 2.5m of rainfall a year. Yes, thats metres. So downpours can happen at any time. There is also a mini dry season in December to January. As most roads are unpaved, travel can be unpredictable at the best of times, and roads can turn to thick mud during the wettest months. In April and November in particular, youre guaranteed a soaking. Year round, temperatures hover around 26°C.",

However, in <b>December, January</b> and the first half of <b>February</b>, the abundance of tropical fruit draws creatures such as gorillas and elephants towards the coast, so this is the most promising time to observe them on the beaches.</bullet>\n<bullet>One of the benefits of travelling during the rainy season is that when its not pouring, the skies are usually blue. In the drier months of <b>June, July and August</b>, Gabon is often grey and overcast.</bullet>\n<bullet>In Loango National Park, leatherback turtles nest on the beach from <b>November</b> to mid <b>January</b>.</bullet>\n<bullet>From <b>July to September or October</b>, look out for migrating humpbacks offshore; if youre especially lucky they may even be joined by pods of dolphins.</bullet>",

    "title4": "Accommodation advice",
    "paragraph4": "Accommodation in Gabon ranges from top end to simple. On our trips we also spend time camping and/or staying in village houses, where it can be fairly basic, but a great way to meet local people.",
    "title5": "Tips on tracking gorillas",
    "paragraph5": "For a start, Loango National Park isnt mountainous, and so tracking gorillas here tends to be less strenuous than in Rwanda and Uganda. It also feels a little more raw as there just arent the numbers of visitors that these other areas experience. Id have to say that this is one of my favourite experiences  theres little that beats tracking these magnificent creatures in the wild.",
    "title6": "Remember youre on Africa time",
    "paragraph6": "My main tip would be to bring a lot of patience. I can remember travelling through Gabon with a group in the run up to local elections where it seemed that every town we passed through had four or five separate checkpoints, all manned by officials who were intent on scrutinising our documents  a most frustrating experience!",
    "title7": "Staying on the beaten track",
    "paragraph7": "Some of the parks have problems with poaching and for this reason, sometimes the more remote ones can be out of bounds for the visitor as they are not always safe. Having said that, those that are more accessible  such as Loango and Lope  offer exceptional wildlife experiences for visitors."
