    "Main_Title": "Our Georgia holidays & tours",
    "Main_Paragraph": "Cultural discovery is at the heart of all our Georgia holidays, whether youre touring wine regions or hiking in the Caucasus Mountains. Local guides unlock Georgian traditions and customs, making the introductions in remote communities, where travelling in small groups means the impact of tourism remains positive. Paying entry fees when visiting ancient sites help preserve the unique heritage. And if you want to really tap into local lifestyles, theres no better way than sharing a cup of mountain tea or a glass of Georgian red wine with your hosts in a guest house. To extend your adventure, Georgia is often combined with neighbouring Armenia and Azerbaijan.",

    "Title1": "Sacred architecture",
    "Paragraph1": "Despite Christianitys dominance, Georgia is renowned for its religious tolerance. Nowhere is this better demonstrated than in Tbilisi, where city tours explore mosaicked mosques, grand synagogues and domed churches nestled together. Our itineraries glitter with visits to ornate churches and mountain monasteries, including the magnificent UNESCO-listed Svetitskhoveli Cathedral in the holy city of Mtskheta. Elsewhere, you can appreciate the ancient Vardzia Monastery, still inhabited by monks, and the Gergeti Trinity Church. Its impressive location beneath Mount Kazbegi makes it a popular stop on our hiking tours.",

    "Title2": "Taking the family",
    "Paragraph2": "Active and adventurous families will love rural Georgia, as well as the generous helpings of food waiting for them after a busy day. You wont find many kids clubs here, but you need have no concerns about keeping your brood entertained. Rafting, mountain biking, horse riding and a spot of R&R along Georgias Black Sea coast are all natural adjuncts to hiking in the gorgeous Caucasus Mountains. There are plenty of historic forts, castles and monasteries about, too. What may recommend Georgia to families most of all, however, is the warm welcome you experience everywhere you go.",

    "Title3": "Hiking highlights",
    "Paragraph3": "Hiking in the ruggedly beautiful countryside is one of the highlights of our Georgia holidays. The dramatic Caucasus Mountains are home to rustic stone villages and endless views stretching across the border into Russia, while national parks such as Lagodekhi hide glaciers, waterfalls and tons of bird and animal life, including lynx, eagles, bears and wolves. You might opt for an easy-going trek to investigate a remote monastery or a challenging multi-day route at high altitude. Whatever you choose, youll discover the joy of walking well off the beaten track, village to village. Small hotels, guest houses, camping and homestays are the standard accommodation on our walking holidays, chosen to connect you with welcoming communities  and great Georgian food  throughout.",
    "Title4": "Tbilisi hot springs",
    "Paragraph4": "Tbilisi means warm place  it was founded in this location because of the natural hot springs here, and consequently some of our Georgia holidays include a visit to the subterranean sulphur bathhouses in the Abanotubani district. There are dozens to choose from, and in winter the locals flock to get clean in the traditional way, with a sulphur scrub and plunge pool. If you go to a public bathhouse, youll want to be comfortable with nudity, and they are segregated by sex. Private rooms are usually available too, which often have their own sauna attached.",

    "Title5": "Eating and drinking",
    "Paragraph5": "Cuisine is central to the Georgian lifestyle, our food tours make sure you get the best of the local fare. The wines arent bad either  almost everyone consumes large quantities and will urge you to do the same. If you have the chance, visit the wine producing region of Kakheti for a visit to a winery. Closer to the food of Turkey or Iran than Russia, Georgian cuisine features plenty of grilled meats, garlic, coriander, walnuts and a plethora of breads, many stuffed with cheese, herbs or meat.",
    "Title6": "Culture",
    "Paragraph6": "Art, architecture and history buffs are well served in Georgia, both in the cities and in the more remote areas, so its the ideal place for our cultural tours. In Tbilisi there are religious buildings, parks and fortresses, contemporary culture means dining, shopping, gallery visits and bar hopping. In nearby Mtskheta, you can wander ancient streets and visit the 11th-century Svetitskhoveli Cathedral, and in Kutaisi to the west are monasteries, theatres and museums. Out of town there are the cave structures of Davit Gareja and Vardzia as well as the medieval towers of the Svaneti Region.",
    "Title7": "Multi-country tours",
    "Paragraph7": "Combining Georgia with neighbouring Armenia and Azerbaijan makes perfect sense. Our organised tours dont just cut down on paperwork and handle all the logistics  theyre guided by people wholl help you to untangle the cultural characteristics of each Caucasus country as you travel between cities and across mountainous landscapes. Small group tours match you with a handful of like-minded travellers, while tailor made trips let you set your own agenda and pace. Multi-country tours are typically two or three weeks in length, involving long overland journeys and plenty of opportunities to indulge in regional cuisines, wine tasting and meetings with local people.",
    "Title8": "Types of tours and holidays in Georgia",
    "Paragraph8": "Organised tours are a great way to explore the culture of Georgia. On sociable small group holidays, youll quickly bond with a gaggle of enthusiastic fellow travellers as expert local guides illuminate Georgias history, from its pre-Christian roots through invasions, occupations and Soviet annexation. Tailor made holidays can be fitted to your own requirements. Transport, accommodation and guided activities are all arranged on your behalf, but the actual route can be shaped to your interests by our Georgia experts."
