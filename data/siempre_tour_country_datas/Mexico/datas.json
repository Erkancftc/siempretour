        "Main_Paragraph": "From the golden beaches of the Caribbean coast to the spectacular Mayan ruins of the Yucatan Peninsula to sea kayaking off Baja, our small group and tailor made holidays in Mexico employ local guides with deep knowledge of their communities and landscapes, promising experiences that you’ll remember much longer than holidays that rarely leave the resort. Because while most famous locations are sadly tarnished by mass tourism, it’s still possible to escape the crowds. Our holidays eschew gaudy resorts and large cruise ships in favour of small, locally owned accommodation and restaurants where you’ll get a far more authentic taste of Mexican culture.",
        "Subtitle": "Mexico holiday highlights",
        "Title1": "History & culture",
        "Paragraph1": "Led by knowledgeable local guides, our holidays in Mexico offer a genuinely insightful introduction to the countrys thriving Indigenous communities, who in turn benefit financially from responsible tourism. As just one instance of the many interesting ways you can explore Mexicos heritage with our tours, try a section of the 2,400km Mayan Trail. It is a brilliant introduction to key sites including the famous Chichen Itza and Uxmal, as well as many other lesser-known  and therefore quieter  ruins.\nThe Maya civilisation dominated Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula between 600-900AD. During the 1990s, many sites in Mexico were unearthed and restored as part of the creation of the Mayan Trail  or Ruta Maya  which stretches through all the countries that had Maya communities, including neighbouring Belize and Guatemala. They are now among the essential cultural highlights of our Mexico holidays. Some are UNESCO World Heritage Sites, such as Chichen Itza, Uxmal and Palenque; all are at various stages of restoration. These were massive cities after all, and if you find yourself walking across a big hill in Palenque National Parks jungle, the chances are you are walking over an ancient palace or pyramid. It is hard to see them all, but they all have something unique about them, and keen historians often add the neighbouring Guatemalan Maya marvels on to a Mexican holiday.\nMexico has over 60 indigenous groups and just as many languages, meaning that it defines itself, in its constitution, as a pluricultural nation. The most prolific groups that you are likely to meet on your travels are Nahuatl, Yucatec (Maya), Zapotec and Mixtec. In Oaxaca, for example, our tours can take their pick of some 12 community museums run by local villages with Zapotec weaving, archaeological artifacts and traditional healing methods on display, plus guided tours into their lands.\nAnd of course, you cant fully explore Mexican culture without trying the cuisine. In fact, you can just eat your way around Mexico on our holidays, if thats your thing. Food trails and gastro tours are all the rage, with taco trails in Mexico City, market tours in Oaxaca, and Yucatan seafood at every turn. Puebla is also embracing tourists food fest fancies, justified given that it is home to the national favourite, mole poblano  a sauce to accompany meat made with chillies, and sometimes chocolate.",
        "image1": "",
        "Title2": "Whales & other wildlife",
        "Paragraph2": "If youre interested in seeing wildlife on our Mexico holidays, a good policy is to stick to the water. The reason is big, grey and bound to amaze: Mexicos superb whale population draws boatloads of stunned onlookers. Whale watching between February and April along Mexicos Baja California Peninsula provides the best chance of sightings. One of the longest peninsulas in the world, it proffers 3,000km of coastal homes to several whale species, as well as dolphins and myriad other marine creatures.\nGrey whale watching off the Baja Peninsula is one of the most intimate and enthralling wildlife encounters you can enjoy. So comfortable are the whales with boats that they will nudge up against the hulls and push their often just days-old calves towards you as if to show them off. Our friends at the World Cetacean Alliance have no problem with this kind of behaviour so long as the whale watching is done responsibly, which is why our holidays always employ boat operators and marine guides who are capable of understanding and respecting the whales behaviours.\nOn our Mexico tours, expert marine biologist guides provide you with fascinating commentary as you spot humpback, finback, grey and even blue whales plundering the plankton off the Baja Peninsula, while keeping a safe and respectful distance. Whale sharks swim serenely beneath the surface alongside dolphins and manta rays off the Yucatan Peninsula. Birds and sea lions cram Isla Espiritu Santo biosphere reserve.\nMost magically, almost every grey whale in existence gathers around four mangrove lagoons here to breed and birth. You can camp on lagoon islands, surrounded by their moving sights and sounds. The whales are almost habituated, coming up close to check out the fiberglass panga boats that take handfuls of tourists for viewings. Off the southern tip lie the humpbacks, who sing and dance their way through the breeding process. A tour de force in natures theatre.\nBut its not all about whats going on offshore. To witness the epic monarch butterfly migration, head to the forests west of Mexico City from late October onwards. Our holidays purposefully seek out lesser-known and therefore quieter sanctuaries where you can enjoy this spectacular natural phenomenon.",
        "image2": "",
        "Title3": "Family holidays in Mexico",
        "Paragraph3": "Besides thrilling adventures, our Mexico holidays provide families with a memorable introduction to life here, with local guides accompanying you, and independent, locally owned hotels and restaurants used wherever possible. Older children will soak up the fascinating (and sometimes gruesome) stories that emanate from Mayan ruins, while all the family will love taking refreshing cenote swims on hot days. You can spend time together horseback riding, stand up paddleboarding, or learning how to roll the perfect taquito. Naturally, theres no end of beaches to explore, too  those off Tulum are ideal for easy-going snorkelling. Be sure to throw in a (responsible) whale watching tour too, bound to be a highlight since the giant mammals are so prolific that sightings are pretty much guaranteed."

        "Main_Paragraph": "The best time to visit Mexico is between December and March.\nThe weather on the coasts is glorious: dry, hot and sunny, with whales to be seen in abundance off Baja. Youre also missing the rainy season, and the hurricane season is dying down. From around March the cruise crowds and hedonistic spring breakers can make it advisable to give some parts of the coast a miss, especially Cancun, and move further inland for Mayan ruins and Monarch butterflies. Mexico is mammoth though, with four time zones, four deserts, two oceans and mountains at every turn, meaning the climate is as convoluted as a Cancun cocktail menu.",

Youre midway through the short whale watching season off Baja California, migratory bird species are in abundance, and the forests of central Mexico are thick with Monarch butterflies wintering down south. The weather is gorgeous, dry and sunny, but in mountainous regions there is snow, which makes for an interesting contrast. <div style=\"margin-top: 15px;\"></div>\n<bullet><b>January is great for a</b> <a href=\"/holiday/13183/mexico-small-group-holiday-culture--beach\">small group beach and culture holiday</a></bullet><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Sea kayaking</li>\n<li>Culture and Mayan history in Oaxaca</li>\n<li>Beaching it</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\nFebruary in Mexico is mid-winter across much of the country, but youll still experience warm weather, so this could be the best time to visit Mexicos beaches, before the spring break crowds arrive. If youre stretched out on a sunlounger, cocktail in hand, youll see energetic sea kayakers paddling off the Baja California coastline and boats carrying whale watchers in hope of spotting humpbacks and blue whales. February is pleasant for cultural tours inland, exploring ancient ruins such as Chichen Itza before the temperatures start to rise.<div style=\"margin-top: 15px;\"></div>\n<bullet><b>February is great for an</b> <a href=\"/holiday/17467/baja-and-the-sea-of-cortes-adventure-cruises-mexico\">adventure cruise in Baja and the Sea of Cortez</a></bullet><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Warmer weather</li>\n<li>Catch whales and butterflies before they leave</li>\n<li>Cruise season begins in earnest</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\nMarch is a hectic time in coastal resorts along the Riviera Maya, with cruise crowds combining with hordes of inebriated spring breakers to soak up the sunny weather as temperatures begin to increase. Head inland instead to roam Mayan ruins or the Piedra Herrada sanctuary where you can admire forests awash with orange as Monarch butterflies mate before their return migration to North America and Canada. March in Mexico also marks the end of whale watching season, toward the end of the month.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Yucatan Peninsula and Tulum</li>\n<li>Cooler temperatures in highlands and mountains</li>\n<li>Steer clear of spring break and cruise crowds</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div> \r\nTemperatures are on the up, making it a popular time to visit before rainy season begins. April in Mexico also means that cruise season is in full swing, massive ships disgorging thousands of day-trippers, so plan well if you want to be on the coast. By mid-April, spring break is over, affording some relief. Our partners are well aware of the coastal crowds, their small group and tailor made tours staying clear of busy spots in favour of less-visited locations such as tribal villages in the highlands.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Rainy season begins</li>\n<li>Northern Mexico and Pacific Coast</li>\n<li>Cinco de Mayo</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\nRainy season starts in May, with rising temperatures and humidity. Short, sharp showers start mainly in the south and move further north over the next few months. May in Mexico is a 'shoulder month', so the Pacific Coast is significantly quieter than it was in March and April, and its a good time to visit sites such as Tulum, Chichen Itza and Palenque, fewer crowds making for a more enjoyable experience. Puebla in Central Mexico celebrates Cinco de Mayo and a hard-fought victory over the French.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Hurricane season starts</li>\n<li>City culture and Mayan ruins</li>\n<li>Good deals on flights</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\nJune in Mexico tends to be hot and sticky, with rain showers likely in the afternoons, but still very sunny otherwise. This is the start of hurricane season when local people on the coasts prepare to batten down the hatches if necessary, although the worst of it comes later in the year. June sees Mexico entering its low season, and so locations such as Mexico City and Cancun are decidedly quieter. June is also the best time to travel to Mexico if you want to explore its jungle-clad Mayan ruins, with fewer coach groups around.\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Mayan Riviera</li>\n<li>Whale sharks</li>\n<li>Sizzling temperatures and showers</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\nNot many people choose to visit in July, this being the height of rainy season. Despite that, Mexico in July is not such a bad option. Showers occur mainly in the afternoons and are rarely heavy enough to inhibit tours, while the heat makes it lovely to swim on the Mayan Riviera, with many Mexican people on holiday themselves. Whale sharks are seen in large numbers off the Yucatan Peninsula from July through to September. Water temperatures are ideal for swimming with them.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Head inland to the cooler highlands</li>\n<li>Great deals on small group adventures</li>\n<li>Overland tours through Central America</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\nAugust in Mexico is low season, with heavy monsoons on the Pacific Coast, increased likelihood of hurricanes, and temperatures that get unpleasantly high  though its cooler inland. Bargain hunters unfazed by the weather relish lower flight prices and deals on small group tours tracing Mexicos cultural heritage. There are plenty of overland tours through Central America for intrepid travellers taking in countries such as Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras and Costa Rica.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Peak hurricane season</li>\n<li>Mexican Independence Day</li>\n<li>Mexico City, Oaxaca and Palenque</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\nSeptember is low season, but if youre staying inland and avoiding the coast (this being peak hurricane season) it can be a good month to visit. September in Mexico usually means that the rains are drying up, there are plenty of cheaper flights, and popular destinations such as Oaxaca, Mexico City, Tulum and Palenque are quiet. Independence Day (Día de la Independencia) is celebrated on 16 September, with most parties taking place on the evening of the 15th and going on through the night.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Hurricane season winding down</li>\n<li>Warmest weather in the north</li>\n<li>Sea swimming later in October</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\nThere is still a substantial risk of hurricanes and monsoons, so that beaches are often closed off, and October in Mexico is not much fun - on the coast at least. Later in the month, the rains ease  as do the sweltering temperatures  and the seas are no longer too turbulent to swim. In northern parts of the country such as Guadalajara its still pretty warm, although youll need a light jacket for the mornings and evenings.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Day of the Dead</li>\n<li>Baja California</li>\n<li>Sea kayaking</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\nNovember is one of the best times of year to visit Mexico  its dry and sunny on the coast and cooler inland and in the cities. November in Mexico means it's time for the Day of the Dead Festival (Día de los Muertos), when Mexican people come together to pay their respects to those who have passed, set against a backdrop of carnivals and outrageous costumes. Later in the month it gets busier as peak season approaches.<div style=\"margin-top: 15px;\"></div>\n<bullet><b>November is great for a</b> <a href=\"/holiday/15865/mexico-belize-and-guatemala-tour-mayan-encounter\">multi country Mayan marvel tour</a></bullet><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Start of whale watching season</li>\n<li>Christmas and New Year</li>\n<li>Las Posadas</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\nCool, dry and sunny, December is a pleasant time to be on the Mexican coast  something that grey whales know very well, as they start appearing in large numbers later in the month, marking the start of whale watching season off Baja California. December in Mexico means temperatures ranging from 15°C to a balmy 30°C. Christmas retains much of its religious connotations in Mexico, the most important date being 24 December, when families gather for midnight dinners.",

January, February and March are the best months to visit Mexico to witness fir forests in the highlands ablaze with orange, tree branches sagging beneath the weight of the butterflies.

In Cancun it can be difficult to find a free patch of sand in the daytime, and by night the bars and clubs are abuzz with drinking sessions.

November to April is usually the best time of year to be on the coast, when its sunny and hurricane season is over. May to October is a great time to be inland, with much less busy Mayan ruins and green scenery.<br/><br/>\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>",

You can also swim in some of the <i>cenotes</i> (limestone sinkholes) nearby. <br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe best time to visit Tulum is usually between <b>November and December</b>. Its after the rains and the hurricane season, so there is a wonderful freshness to the air and its dry but not oppressively hot. Plus, peak season hasnt fully got going yet, so the ruins arent likely to be busy and you may find prices are a little cheaper. <br/><br/>\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>",
        "title11": "When is hurricane season in Mexico?",

After the season has waned in November and December, Mexico has a lovely feel to it with fresh breezes.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nIts cheaper to travel during hurricane season but have good insurance and be aware of safety procedures  its unusual for a hurricane to approach without warning. In fact, its rare for hurricanes to make landfall at all in Mexico, however climate change has caused their behaviour and intensity to become more unpredictable. <br/><br/>\r\n\r\nInland areas may see substantial rain, but hurricanes mainly affect the Pacific coast, particularly Baja California, and they have also been known to make landfall on the Caribbean coast."
