    "Main_Paragraph": "The best time to visit Japan is either spring (March to May) or autumn (September to November).\nBoth seasons offer relatively good weather thats ideal for walking. Spring is the right time to visit Japan to admire the cherry blossoms, while in the autumn the trees are resplendent with golds, reds and oranges. Japan is very much a four-season type of place to holiday, with fantastic festivals and events taking place throughout the year. The climate varies from the cooler, mountainous north to the subtropical islands of the south with their Pacific vibe.",

The most popular, such as the Meiji Shrine in Tokyo, can welcome millions of visitors in early January. In southern Okinawa the first cherry blossoms make an appearance, while skiing and snow sports thrive in the north. January is a good time to meet the residents of Jigokudani Monkey Park and to follow their lead soaking in steamy hot springs.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Crowd-free sightseeing</li>\n<li>Warmer spring-like weather further south</li>\n<li>Sapporo Snow Festival</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\nFebruary in Japan is peak winter sports season while cities are uncrowded  ideal for relaxed sightseeing. The Sapporo Snow Festival sees huge crowds coming to admire sculptures of celebrities, buildings and events carved from snow and ice. Meanwhile, thousands of scantily clad men brave the cold for naked festivals, where they try to win good luck for the year ahead. Or at least avoid hypothermia.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Sumo wrestlers spring into action</li>\n<li>Cherry blossom season in full swing</li>\n<li>Omizutori Festival in Nara</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\nJapan in March welcomes cherry blossoms (and plum blossoms) in cities such as Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka, making this a very desirable time to visit. Less delicate but just as enthralling, sumo wrestling tournaments take place year-round but theres a big event in Osaka during March. And in Nara, the Omizutori Festival sees a Buddhist priest drawing water from a sacred well, while others wield fiery torches to fend off evil spirits.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Ideal walking weather</li>\n<li>Bears emerge from hibernation</li>\n<li>Cherry blossoms spread further north</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\n<i>Hanami</i>, the tradition of appreciating flowers, gets really busy in popular locations, so seek out less-known spots such as the Shinyo-do Temple in Kyoto to spread your blanket beneath the cherry blossom during what is for many the best time of year to visit Japan. Japan in April is lovely for walking, with snow melting away, allowing mountain routes to open up. The weather is mild and the spring foliage gorgeous. Youll see little bells around  ring them as you go, as theyre to scare away bears which are waking from hibernation around now.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Avoid Golden Week in early May</li>\n<li>Brief rainy season starts mid-May</li>\n<li>Sanja Matsuri in Tokyo</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\nJapan in May sees a short rainy season that continues to mid-June, starting in Okinawa and moving north. But showers are light and infrequent. The cherry blossoms are thinning out but there are lots of other floral delights to be found, including pink and purple flowering phlox in Saitama. Golden Week comprises four national holidays and sees high prices and packed hotels. And the Sanja Matsuri sees hundreds of musicians and dancers in traditional clothing thronging the Asakusa Shrine in Tokyo.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Japans month of water</li>\n<li>Hokkaido drier and perfect for hiking</li>\n<li>Wonderful time to explore public gardens</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\nHot, humid and  at least for first part of month  wet in many areas, June is known as <i>minazuki</i>, the month of water. Showers move north and farmers enjoy seeing their rice paddies flood, which kills off weeds without harming the rice. Japan in June can be very picturesque, especially around public gardens, with lush foliage a lovely backdrop for photography. And if it does rain, duck into a traditional teahouse for shelter.\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Festival season across Japan</li>\n<li>Ideal time for hiking Mount Fuji</li>\n<li>Pack sunscreen as temperatures climb</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\nBy July, the rains are easing and temperatures rising, and people head for beaches, beer gardens and higher ground where its cooler. Hike to the summit of the sacred Mount Fuji, an active volcano, which due to snow at other times of year can only be reached in July and August. Expect lots of company on the trails. Japan in July is festival season, events taking place across the country including one of the most significant, the Gion Matsuri in Kyoto, with parades, floats and delectable street food.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Pilgrimage walks popular and cooler</li>\n<li>Obon Festival sees busy hotels</li>\n<li>Japanese school holidays</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\nJapan in August means the Buddhist Obon (Bon) Festival, which sees Japanese families coming together to honour their ancestors, combining with school holidays to mean high prices and busy hotels. There are lots of festivals going on, with lanterns and fireworks a common sight in the night sky. The Gozan Okuribi in Kyoto concludes Obon with dramatic bonfires lit on the hillside to signify ancestors returning to the spirit world. Pilgrimage walks through mountainous forests are a good way to escape the heat.<div style=\"margin-top: 15px;\"></div>\n<bullet><b>August is great for a</b> <a href=\"/holiday/6711/japan-walking-holiday-nakasendo-trail\">Nakasendo Trail walking holiday</a></bullet><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Peak typhoon season</li>\n<li>Warm autumn weather and fewer crowds</li>\n<li>Amazing rice paddy art in Inakadate</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\nJapan in September often involves typhoons. Okinawa in the south is most vulnerable, and the worst storms cause heavy rains, flooding and landslides. Climate change is likely to make them more intense and common. In the village of Inakadate, amazing rice artworks planted months before come to fruition, drawing crowds. Plus, every few years Silver Week, a five-day national holiday, results in many Japanese people travelling and higher prices. <div style=\"margin-top: 15px;\"></div>\n<bullet><b>September is great for a</b> <a href=\"/holiday/10594/japan-golden-route-holiday\">Japan Golden Route holiday</a></bullet><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Spectacular scenery for walkers</li>\n<li>Harvest festivals country-wide</li>\n<li>Celebrate Halloween in Tokyo</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\nJapan in October is fab for travel, with the turning leaves colourful enough to rival the cherry blossoms of spring. Walking in northern regions and the national parks is magnificent with all the reds and golds in the landscapes. For foodies too, October is one of best times to visit Japan, as there are harvest festivals all around. And for a uniquely Japanese spin on Halloween, wander the streets of Harajuku in Tokyo, and dont miss the costume parade at the Shibuya Crossing. <div style=\"margin-top: 15px;\"></div>\n<bullet><b>October is great for joining pilgrims on a</b> <a href=\"/holiday/8740/kumano-kodo-trail-walking-holiday-japan\">Kumano Kodo Trail walking holiday</a></bullet><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Mild temperatures but chilly evenings</li>\n<li>Prime time for leaf changes in Tokyo and Kyoto</li>\n<li>Perfect season for temples, shrines and palaces</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\n<i>Koyo</i>, or <i>momji</i>, is the term for the autumnal leaf change, which is spectacular in November. Admire the beauty in the foliage in the gardens of temples, shrines and palaces across Japan at this time of year. Those with paid entry tend to be less crowded. The cities have some brilliant winter illuminations up by the end of the month. And Japan in November is still suitable for walking, though youll want layers for the mornings and late afternoons when temperatures drop.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Early snowfall at higher elevations</li>\n<li>Ryokans and onsens in high demand</li>\n<li>Snow monkeys in Joshinetsu Kogen National Park</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\nChristmas is not a big event in Japan, although the small Christian population do celebrate. Famously, the traditional Christmas dinner is KFC rather than turkey. New Year is a big deal, with lots of festivities, and there are many fantastic illuminations the length of Japan. Meanwhile, December in Japan also sees the photogenic snow monkeys of Joshinetsu Kogen National Park on Honshu keeping warm by bathing in the hot springs. Traditional ryokans with onsen baths are sought-after.",

    "paragraph5": "The Kanamara Matsuri in Kawasaki is one of Japans most unusual festivals. Held at the Kanayama Shrine, the festival attracts devotees praying for good marital relations, successful childbirth, and sexual health. Curious visitors, meanwhile, tend to be there to see the many phallic symbols that are paraded around  dont miss the penis-shaped sweets. The festival raises funds for HIV research, another reason to check it out.",
    "title6": "Golden Week (late April to early May)",
    "paragraph6": "Golden Week is a grouping of five public holidays that means many cities empty out as Japanese people return to their family homes in small towns and the countryside. Lots of businesses in the cities temporarily draw their shutters, while hotels and public transport tend to be very busy. Silver Week in September is another hectic period that makes travel to Japan inadvisable, but that only takes place sporadically rather than every year.",

    "paragraph7": "This charming festival around the village of Inakadate in northern Honshu began as a way to combat a declining population, as well as to boost much-needed tourism income. Every May, hundreds of volunteers plant rice in intricate patterns and designs. By summer, their efforts burst extravagantly to life in fields and on hillsides.

Its a cluster of public holidays: Shōwa Day (29 April), Constitution Day (3 May), Greenery Day (4 May) and Childrens Day (5 May) that sees many Japanese people leaving the cities to visit their families. Trains are full, hotel prices rocket, and a lot of restaurants and shops close in the cities.

Small group and tailor made trips to Japan dont fluctuate in price a great deal throughout the year.

Spending a few nights in one of these traditional inns is a highlight of many stays in Japan, not least because they often have private hot spring baths (onsens) attached.
