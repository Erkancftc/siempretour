    "Main_Paragraph": "Belize temperatures are gorgeous all year round. For sunny and dry, November until May is great with warmth really kicking in around February. The rainy season is June to October, although rainstorms only last a couple of hours.\nThe more tropical south can have short bursts of rain all year. Diving is superb all year round but, for migratory whale sharks, March to June is best.",

    "when_to_go_html": "<bullet>Belize is popular with US visitors, so public and school holidays can get very busy, as is the cruise season, <b>February until mid-April</b>. </bullet>\n<bullet><b>June</b> is the month for <b>LobsterFests </b>around the country, although the founders on Caye Caulker have theirs in July. </bullet>\n<bullet>The <b>Ruta Maya canoe race</b> on the Old Belize River in <b>March</b> is an iconic event locally. </bullet>\n<bullet>The tropics become <b>seriously tropical in April and May</b> with humidity levels going off the scale. </bullet>\n<bullet>If you fancy a Christmas visit, its a perfect time climate wise, but <b>December and January</b> really are peak season, packed out, high prices and so on. <b>Head south to avoid the crowds</b>.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>August, September and October</b> are the <b>rainiest</b>, and many businesses shut down for the latter two. But you will always find gaps in the clouds and welcoming inns. And bargains too.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>Hurricane season</b> can hit the coast between<b> June and October</b>. There have been sixteen since 1930, and the last major one was in August 2012.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>September</b> is for celebrating local style with <b>Carnival, Independence Day and St. Georges Caye Day</b> all falling during this month.</bullet>\n<bullet>Head south to the Garifuna towns for <b>National Garifuna Day on November 19.</b> Especially if drumming is your thing.</bullet>\n\n<b>Dan Hancock, from our supplier Audley Travel, specialists in tailor made holidays to Belize:</b> <br/>\r\nI think February is one of the best times to visit Belize. In between the exceptionally busy periods of January and Easter, you can enjoy some of the countys finest weather, but with more choice of hotels and lower airfares.",
