    "Main_Paragraph": "The dry months from Oct/Nov to March are the best time to visit Chad  the rains may liven up the arid landscape, but they wreak havoc with the largely unpaved roads and travelling north is virtually impossible. The rains are shorter in the Sahel northwards  lasting roughly June-Sept. Autumn is slightly cooler than spring  when temperatures are regularly over 40°C. The Gerewol Festival takes place in late September but is close enough to NDjamena not to have transport issues; however, it cant usually be combined with trips to the desert as its still too wet.",

Its not an easy country at all  theres no tourist infrastructure whatsoever, and theres very little infrastructure at all outside two or three main cities. Having said that, Ive been to Chad four times in the last few years, and its probably my favourite destination.",
    "title3": "How safe is Chad?",
    "paragraph3": "Chad is one of the safer parts of the Sahara and Sahel. Its got a slight problem around Lake Chad, but once you get up into the desert, theres really no one there. The northern regions have always had a tempestuous relationship with the south because theyre inhabited by the Toubou people who generally dont like outsiders and just want to live as they always have done. But for years now its been peaceful.",
    "title4": "Cultural tips",
    "paragraph4": "Jim OBrien, from our specialist supplier Native Eye, shares his Chad travel advice:\nThe Toubou people are very sensitive to having their photos taken, and Ive seen some ugly incidents where tourists havent heeded that advice, and have almost got themselves into trouble. So you always, always have to ask. Its more critical there than anywhere else Ive ever been. Youre out in the desert, the law is basically the person in front of you so if they want to take offence at that then they can.",
    "title5": "Not all deserts are lifeless",
    "paragraph5": "There is quite a surprising amount of wildlife in the Ennedi Mountains. Ive seen hyenas, Ive seen baboons, monkeys, fennec foxes, and just outside of the mountains youve got dorcas gazelles  quite a lot of them. So theres actually quite a lot of wildlife in the desert, but its not always easy to see. On one particular day of our trip into the Ennedi we drive into a region which comparatively well watered. Theres a fair bit of vegetation and we see about a hundred gazelles throughout the course of the day  its alive."
