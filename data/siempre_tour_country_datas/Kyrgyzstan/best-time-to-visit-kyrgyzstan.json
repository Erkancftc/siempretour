    "Main_Paragraph": "Where other Central Asian countries are about history and architecture, Kyrgyzstan is all about natural splendour: rough and rugged mountain scenery and wildflower meadows that roll endlessly, all underpinned by a fascinating, semi-nomadic shepherd culture. The best time to visit Kyrgyzstan is in summer, when hiking trails and roads are accessible and you can ride horses under a hot sun, stopping at glistening lakes, so the horses can drink and you can cool off with a swim. Winter is bitingly cold and best avoided, but late spring and autumn are temperate, revealing a lush landscape of gold, green and bronze.",

    "paragraph2": "Daniel Waters, from our partner, Wild Frontiers, shares his Kyrgyzstan travel advice:\nKyrgyzstan offers so much to those that travel there from hiking in the strikingly beautiful Mountains of Heaven, watching frantic games of buzkashi played by impossibly agile horseman, drinking glasses of kumis in toasty yurts overlooking crystal clear lakes, beguiling walks in dense walnut forests, marvelling at the history of the ancient but perfectly preserved caravanserai youre standing in. You can create an amazing trip in Kyrgyzstan based around whatever your interest is: hiking, riding, family trips, the Silk Road. The warmth of the people and diversity of scenery will humble and awe in equal measure.",
    "title3": "Food tips",
    "paragraph3": "Linda Maguire from our partner, Undiscovered Destinations, shares her advice on coping with the food:\nThe food is best summed up as simple. There is a lot of grilled lamb, and stew with mixed vegetables is very traditional and is served everywhere. The food isnt stodgy, but there is very little variety and its not the most exciting. We ate a lot of cucumbers, tomatoes and herbs and the ingredients are very fresh, so it does taste delicious, but I wouldnt say that vegetarians are well catered for as the rice that is available is often cooked in meat stock, so they could struggle after a few days surviving on salad and bread.",

You will see wonderful scenery, but theres a lot of travelling.<b>  Peter Jackson</b>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIt was very hot throughout, so take loose, cool clothing.<b>  Gillian Urro</b>",

I think everyone needs to be warned to be a bit more cautious about food and water/drink. We were much more cavalier about these things (I ate and drank everything put in front of me!) than I would be when somewhere like India.<b>  Sue Noble</b>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBe prepared for long days driving, often on very bumpy roads. However, nature's spectacles compensate for the travelling inconveniences. Sleeping in a yurt was a new adventure for me.\"<b> - Jayne Hanlin</b>"
