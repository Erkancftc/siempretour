    "Main_Paragraph": "The best time to visit Denmark is May-Aug when the days are at their longest, temperatures are mild and the countryside is in full bloom. Spring and autumn are best for birdwatching on the west coast, with migrant species passing through. For a city break in Copenhagen, any time of year will do  spring is a time for sunshine, flowering bulbs and coffee at outdoor café tables (where blankets are thoughtfully provided), summer offers pleasures like taking a dip in a Harbour Bath and autumn brings Kulturnatten (Culture Night), when art installations pop up in secret locations.",

The season officially begins on the first Friday evening in November, when Tuborg brings out its special Christmas beer, Julebryg, thats sweeter and stronger than the regular brew. Known as J-day, it is cause for celebration right across Denmark. Shopping is a treat, with fantastic Christmas markets, sparkling shop displays and\npebernødder\n, lightly spiced little biscuits, set on counters as a treat for customers.\nGlædelig jul!",
