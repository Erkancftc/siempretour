    "Main_Paragraph": "Temperatures vary little in Jamaica, averaging mid to high 20°Cs year round, although the wet and humid summer months of May to August are slightly warmer. Peak season in Jamaica starts in the week or so before Christmas and carries on until mid April. Weather-wise, this is the best time to go to Jamaica, and it also lets Europeans and North Americans dodge the miserable winter back home. Book well in advance, however, and expect higher prices. Late November to early December provides a quieter, and better value, alternative.",

    "when_to_go_html": "<bullet>Mid <b>December</b> all the way through <b>January, February</b> and <b>March</b> to mid <b>April</b> is peak season, when prices rise, and places will get very busy, particularly at Christmas, but the weather is at its dry, balmy best. If travelling at this time, book well in advance and stay away from the most popular beach spots  preferably with time spent inland, in the cooler hills and forests.</bullet>\n<bullet>Around <b>Easter</b>, in <b>March</b> and mid <b>April</b>, spring break crowds arrive. If frat boy parties are not your thing, avoid busy resort areas at this time. </bullet>\n<bullet>Things start to get a lot wetter in <b>May and June</b>, which marks the start of the official hurricane season. Humidity peaks in <b>July</b>, with hurricanes historically most likely to occur in late <b>August</b> and early <b>September</b>. Along with <b>October</b>, this is generally the cheapest time to visit Jamaica. </bullet>\n<bullet><b>October and November</b> are the wettest months, with the eastern side of the island receiving the heaviest rainfall. The rain eases off in late <b>November to December</b>, so this is a great time to travel ahead of peak crowds and prices.</bullet>",

Literati jet in from New York and London to join crowds of enthusiastic locals from across the country to hear readings, panel discussions and open mic sessions in sleepy Treasure Beach."
