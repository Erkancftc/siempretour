        "Main_Title": "Our Cyprus holidays & tours",
        "Main_Paragraph": "Our Cyprus holidays unearth the countrys rural identity and archaeological sites while steering away from the busy beaches and nightclubs on the east coast. That said, the island does boast some of the cleanest beaches in Europe with many seaside towns still retaining their traditional character and only serving typically Cypriot cuisine. Staying in locally owned hotels you can enjoy the islands beautiful botany, and you can capture some of it too with our wonderfully relaxed painting holidays. Those who prefer to be a little more active can explore the rugged Mediterranean scenery of the north with cultural hiking in the Kyrenia and Besparmak ranges. And our walking tours also cross the Green Line, venturing along trails in the Troodos Mountains in South Cyprus.",
        "Subtitle": "Cyprus highlights",
        "Title1": "",
        "Paragraph1": "Although Cyprus is divided like Northern and the Republic of Ireland, crossing the UN-monitored Green Line is an easy option on foot but not quite so straight-forward if you're driving. Explore the Cypriot south and in between the notorious Ayia Napa in the southeast and Paphos there are plenty of not so busy beaches to relax on. Peninsulas provide the most scenic stretches of sand with Akrotiri in the south, Akamas in the northwest and the Karpasia Peninsula in the northeast all relatively untouched. Mountain ranges, Kyrenia and Troodos, offer options outside of summer with orchids, snow and verdant vineyards all to be found, depending on the season.",
        "image1": "",
        "Title2": "1. Bellapais",
        "Paragraph2": "If youre looking to sup coffee beneath the tree of idleness then theres no better place than the north coastal village of Bellapais, just along the way from Kyrenia. Lawrence Durrell references aside, Bellapais also features a 13th century ruined abbey with gardens filled with jasmine and orange blossom overlooking the Med, the perfect setting to settle back and thumb through a copy of\nBitter Lemons\n.",
        "image2": "",
        "Title3": "2. Famagusta",
        "Paragraph3": "Find out more about Cyprus, pre-Brits, by visiting the fortified port of Famagusta on the east coast. The Monastery of St Barnabas, the Sinan Pasha Mosque and the ancient city walls will all feature on a guided walking tour with the lively student district of Salamis Road contrasting with a thespians pilgrimage to Othello Castle to add to the appeal of easy access to sandy beaches and fish suppers.",
        "Title4": "3. Nicosia",
        "Paragraph4": "Nicosia is the last divided capital although this moniker is fading fast thanks to 24-hour checkpoints. Expect a vibrant cafe and cultural scene spilling from ancient Venetian walls where labyrinths of narrow streets reveal mosques, churches, hammams, bazaars, and evocative colonial-style architecture alongside the history, particularly the political history, offering an enthralling epitaph.",
        "image3": "",
        "Title5": "4. Polis",
        "Paragraph5": "Adjacent to Akamas Peninsula Nature Reserve and close to the fish restaurants of Latchi, Polis is the gateway to some wonderfully wild stretches of northwest coastline as well as the slightly less well hidden Baths of Aphrodite. Polis is also relatively close (37km) to the bright lights of Paphos but has yet to succumb to the trappings of tourism and retains a traditional fishing village ambience, worth catching before it gets away.",
        "Title6": "5. Rizokarpaso",
        "Paragraph6": "Located along the Karpasia Peninsula, Cypruss guitar neck, Rizokarpaso is just as well known for its fertile farmlands and ageing Greek population as its untamed coastline, with numerous beaches accessible by car whilst wild donkeys watch from the hard shoulder. Youll find several thoughtfully converted guesthouses offering traditional lodgings from where to get out and enjoy the Apostolos Andreas Monastery.",
        "Title7": "6. Vouni",
        "Paragraph7": "Alight amongst the alleys of sleepy Vouni before going in search of the wine routes and nature trails that are abound throughout the surrounding Troodos countryside. A couple of tavernas, village craft shops and a kafeneia coffee house at the old school ensure life ticks along unhindered by pace, with stone clad apartments for those looking to enjoy star-filled nights accompanied by cicadas."

        "Main_Paragraph": "The best time to visit Cyprus is the spring which often arrives as early as Feb. Weather is still favourable in Mar-Apr with wild flowers, including over 40 species of orchid, popping up across the ridge of the Besparmak Mountains and the hillsides towards the Akamas headland. The heat starts to kick in in May and the sun usually lasts all the way through to October. Summer is the best time for sea turtles with conservation projects to be found on Lara Bay and Alagadi Beach. Prices start to fall in autumn, so consider a getaway before the cold and rain of Dec-Jan.",

Many people associate the north with the picturesque harbour at Kyrenia but few discover the wonderful scenery. The Troodos Mountains in the south are beautiful too but hardly a secret being much more developed.",

        "paragraph3": "As this mesmerising Mediterranean island is situated at the crossroads of Europe, Asia and Africa, the food has evolved to cater for many different tastes. You can discover the impressive variety of cuisine by enjoying mezes, particularly in an authentic village tavern. Mezes consist of a main dish of meat or fish accompanied by a plethora of small side dishes which embrace the most traditional foods and provide food to suit all tastes.",

        "paragraph5": "The Cyprus Tourism Organisation has produced free guides to walking in the south. The tourist organisations of the north are now beginning to produce some publications but as yet its best to walk with a guide or on self-guided walks written by people who know the best walks.",
        "title6": "Cypriot hospitality",
        "paragraph6": "Helen, co-owner of Vouni Lodge in the Troodos Mountains, shares her local knowledge of Cyprus:\nWherever you go on the island from our smallest villages to our towns take the time to have a cup of coffee or a glass of Zivania with the locals and you will make their day.",
        "title7": "North/South divide",
        "paragraph7": "The South is more European with luxury hotels, restaurants and clubs. At the same time the foothills of Troodos Mountains have numerous villages featuring Byzantine monasteries, Venetian bridges and nature trails. The North is like a different country - less developed with its own currency giving you the impression you are entering Turkey. The old harbour of Kyrenia is a must for those who decide to visit the North, also the area of Pelapais is of exceptional beauty.",

        "title10": "",
        "paragraph10": "Note that there is no electronic money in Vouni, so you need to bring plenty of cash (we were there for two weeks!). The friendly local shop sells all the basics, but not everything is obvious, so ask! We mostly cooked for ourselves; but there are a couple of nice tavernas in the village too. <b> David Muir\r\n</b>\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe walking terrain in North Cyprus isn't difficult, but there are rocky/stony sections, so take a comfortable pair of boots/thick-soled walking shoes. If you use them, walking poles could be helpful for the mountain treks. <b> Paul Watling</b>\n<br/><br/>\r\nIf you like hikes, give yourself at least 4 days to discover all the trails in Vouni and Platres and beyond. Economy car rentals are very good and efficient and cost less than the big ones. <b> Oosha Rao\r\n</b>\n<br/><br/>\r\nLearning a few basic words of Greek seemed to be much appreciated by the local people. <b> Elayne Jackson\r\n</b>\n<br/><br/>\r\nVouni is a small village with limited shop and other facilities. Make sure you bring necessary supplies of food and drink for your first night, particularly if not arriving until evening. <b> Michael Moriarty \r\n</b>\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe Erimoudes winery about 4 or 5 Km up the road on the way from Vouni to Pera-Pedi produces high quality wine at a reasonable price although you may need to phone for an appointment. <b> David Graham</b>"
