    "Main_Paragraph": "This tropical terrain has heat, humidity, heavy rain and high elevation hit or miss weather. The dry season is generally the best time to visit Central America which, in most countries, is January-March (or November-April in Nicaragua, Panama and Honduras). In Nicaragua the rainy season means an hour of rain in the afternoon, and it's gorgeous at this time of year. Costa Rica is driest and sunniest late December-April, but clouds lift a little later from Belize and Panama, around February. And with any rainforests, come rain. When you least expect usually.",

    "when_to_go_html": "<bullet>Mexico is mammoth, so the weather is as convoluted as a Mexican cocktail menu. End <b>November</b> until <b>April</b> on the coast is dry, hot and honeypots are buzzing. But in the northern mountainous regions, you’ll hit snow <b>December</b>, <b>January</b> and <b>February</b>.</bullet>\n<bullet>The dry season is generally <b>January</b>, <b>February</b> and <b>March</b> (or <b>November</b>-<b>April</b> in Nicaragua, Panama and Honduras).</bullet>\n<bullet><b>Feb</b>-<b>mid April</b> is peak season for cruise ships, which frequent the big ports of Mexico, Honduras, Costa Rica and the Panama Canal. Getting a tailor made package will stop you getting a bruising from the cruising.\r\n\r\n</bullet><bullet>For whale watching in Baja, Mexico, during early <b>February</b>-<b>end April</b> the seas are, literally, singing. Calves join the chorus in <b>February</b>.</bullet>\n<bullet>The rainy season can actually be quite beautiful, with greener landscapes, lower prices and fewer tourists. However, <b>September</b> and <b>October</b> bring seriously heavy rain in some parts of Costa Rica, with roads and rivers often merging into one. Many businesses shut down during this time anyway.</bullet>\n<bullet>If you don’t do mornings, don’t do the rainy season. If you are an early riser, it is perfect in most Central American countries as the rain doesn’t kick in until the afternoon. So get up early, hit the hills or the heritage sites, siesta in the afternoon, and fiesta at night.\r\n</bullet>\n<bullet>Although Costa Rica, Panama or Nicaragua hardly know what a hurricane is, Northern Central America has had its fair share of hurricanes, between <b>June</b> and <b>November</b>, with Honduras and Guatemala hit badly by Mitch in 1998. But note, they are not the norm.\r\n</bullet>\n<bullet>Late <b>November</b> to <b>April</b> is also not the best time to visit Central America if you are on a budget as prices get hiked up during peak season.</bullet>\n<bullet>If hiking in some of Central America’s highlands, temperatures are defined by altitude rather than season. In Honduras, for example, the average annual temperature is 32°C but it can dip to 20°C in mountain areas.\r\n\r\n</bullet><bullet>Costa Rica and Belize, in particular, pack out during US/European public and school holidays, in the honeypot areas. <b>4 July</b>, Memorial Day at the end of <b>May</b> and Labor Day at the beginning of <b>September</b> are the biggies. Don't let them put you off though. Tailor made holidays are great for directing you off the beaten track during these times.</bullet>",

Accompanied by traditional marimba musicians, they dance in the streets, in peoples homes. They dance everywhere. Beautifully and skillfully.  And masked. Which conceals the fact that they are all, in fact, men."
