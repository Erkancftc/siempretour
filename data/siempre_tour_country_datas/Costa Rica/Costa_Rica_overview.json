    "Main_Title": "Our Costa Rica holidays & tours",
    "Main_Paragraph": "Costa Rica is a pioneer in responsible tourism, and our holidays ensure that while admiring the (spectacular) wildlife of this easy-going Central American country, you’ll also be contributing to their ongoing protection. We make sure that whether you are volunteering with turtles on the beach or visiting parks and reserves, you are having a positive impact. Our hotels are small and family-run; our local guides will share with you their unparalleled knowledge of Costa Rica’s culture and nature. Our incredible activity holidays demonstrate why this is one of the world’s top destinations for families.",
    "Subtitle": "About our Costa Rica holidays",
    "Title1": "Costa Rica's amazing wildlife",
    "Paragraph1": "Our wildlife holidays in Costa Rica are focussed on protecting animals rather than making them a tourist attraction. Costa Rica is teeming with wildlife, with half of the country blanketed in primary forest, and around a third of it protected by conservation areas. We use expert local guides to explore forests that echo with the calls of birdlife. They can help locate sloths lazing on tree branches, shy jaguars in the shadows, and gigantic American crocodiles. Our rural-based accommodation ensures that money goes straight back to conservation and funds initiatives, including legal action to protect threats to wildlife.",

    "Title2": "Surfing, or zipline?",
    "Paragraph2": "Our Costa Rica holidays are usually multi activity holidays; that’s just the nature of travel here. Typical itineraries take you wildlife watching with local experts one day and tubing down a lazy river the next. You could be trying your first surf lesson on a Caribbean beach, mountain biking, or strapping in for a thrilling zipline tour through the tree canopy. We work with activity guides from the local community, so you know you are getting the best possible experience while also supporting the local population.",

    "Title3": "Made for families",
    "Paragraph3": "Our family holidays are the ultimate in multigenerational fun. Zipline through rainforests, tube down rivers, learn to surf, and watch turtles on idyllic beaches or monkeys eyeing up your fruit baskets, all under the careful guidance of local experts and guides. And while families with older kids will find no end of adventures to dive into headfirst, those with younger ones looking to take it easier will love it here too, with gorgeous beaches to relax on, and quieter activities like cooking classes in local family homes.",
    "Title4": "Coast to Coast in Costa Rica",
    "Paragraph4": "If your idea of the perfect getaway is one where you spend most of it in the saddle then our cycling holidays in Costa Rica will be a tantalising prospect. Our holidays are typically guided small group tours; leaders, guides, mechanics and drivers are all locals, benefitting the Costa Rican people, and giving you direct contact with local knowledge of the country. Our Coast to Coast tour is a stand-out route, taking you through forested, volcanic and coastal terrain over two weeks, climbing up mountain passes and down through valleys until you reach the warm Caribbean. We can take you on exciting multi-country cycling holidays too, combining Costa Rica with Panama and Nicaragua.",

    "Title5": "Types of holidays in Costa Rica",
    "Paragraph5": "Our Costa Rica holidays are all adventure holidays, just with different degrees of adventure. This compact country packs a lot of excitement into its borders, from river rafting to ziplining and rainforest trekking. The latter is always a highlight – you’d struggle to picture a better destination for wildlife holidays. Costa Rica is an unforgettable place for family holidays – safe and relaxed, and never a dull moment for kids aged from about seven upwards. Small group holidays have an inbuilt social element, with new friends to cheer you on throughout and local guides offering a chance to explore Costa Rican culture a little too."
