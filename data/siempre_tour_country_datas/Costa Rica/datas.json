        "Main_Paragraph": "Costa Rica is a pioneer in responsible tourism, and our holidays ensure that while admiring the (spectacular) wildlife of this easy-going Central American country, you’ll also be contributing to their ongoing protection. We make sure that whether you are volunteering with turtles on the beach or visiting parks and reserves, you are having a positive impact. Our hotels are small and family-run; our local guides will share with you their unparalleled knowledge of Costa Rica’s culture and nature. Our incredible activity holidays demonstrate why this is one of the world’s top destinations for families.",
        "Subtitle": "About our Costa Rica holidays",
        "Title1": "Costa Rica's amazing wildlife",
        "Paragraph1": "Our wildlife holidays in Costa Rica are focussed on protecting animals rather than making them a tourist attraction. Costa Rica is teeming with wildlife, with half of the country blanketed in primary forest, and around a third of it protected by conservation areas. We use expert local guides to explore forests that echo with the calls of birdlife. They can help locate sloths lazing on tree branches, shy jaguars in the shadows, and gigantic American crocodiles. Our rural-based accommodation ensures that money goes straight back to conservation and funds initiatives, including legal action to protect threats to wildlife.",

        "Title2": "Surfing, or zipline?",
        "Paragraph2": "Our Costa Rica holidays are usually multi activity holidays; that’s just the nature of travel here. Typical itineraries take you wildlife watching with local experts one day and tubing down a lazy river the next. You could be trying your first surf lesson on a Caribbean beach, mountain biking, or strapping in for a thrilling zipline tour through the tree canopy. We work with activity guides from the local community, so you know you are getting the best possible experience while also supporting the local population.",
        "image2": "",
        "Title3": "Made for families",
        "Paragraph3": "Our family holidays are the ultimate in multigenerational fun. Zipline through rainforests, tube down rivers, learn to surf, and watch turtles on idyllic beaches or monkeys eyeing up your fruit baskets, all under the careful guidance of local experts and guides. And while families with older kids will find no end of adventures to dive into headfirst, those with younger ones looking to take it easier will love it here too, with gorgeous beaches to relax on, and quieter activities like cooking classes in local family homes.",
        "Title4": "Coast to Coast in Costa Rica",
        "Paragraph4": "If your idea of the perfect getaway is one where you spend most of it in the saddle then our cycling holidays in Costa Rica will be a tantalising prospect. Our holidays are typically guided small group tours; leaders, guides, mechanics and drivers are all locals, benefitting the Costa Rican people, and giving you direct contact with local knowledge of the country. Our Coast to Coast tour is a stand-out route, taking you through forested, volcanic and coastal terrain over two weeks, climbing up mountain passes and down through valleys until you reach the warm Caribbean. We can take you on exciting multi-country cycling holidays too, combining Costa Rica with Panama and Nicaragua.",
        "image3": "",
        "Title5": "Types of holidays in Costa Rica",
        "Paragraph5": "Our Costa Rica holidays are all adventure holidays, just with different degrees of adventure. This compact country packs a lot of excitement into its borders, from river rafting to ziplining and rainforest trekking. The latter is always a highlight – you’d struggle to picture a better destination for wildlife holidays. Costa Rica is an unforgettable place for family holidays – safe and relaxed, and never a dull moment for kids aged from about seven upwards. Small group holidays have an inbuilt social element, with new friends to cheer you on throughout and local guides offering a chance to explore Costa Rican culture a little too."

        "Main_Paragraph": "The start of the year, in January and February, is considered one of the best times to go to Costa Rica. Late December to April is when the country is driest and sunniest and the northern Pacific experiences less rain. But this is still\nrain\nforest: bring waterproofs and quick-drying clothes regardless of the season. San Jose and the Central Valley are springlike year-round, while high peaks experience frost. Cool cloud forests meanwhile provide respite from the lowland heat. Despite its scale, Costa Ricas mountains, rainforests, cloud forests and Pacific and Caribbean coasts mean that temperatures and rainfall vary wildly all year round.",

Do expect to encounter high season prices and crowds, but also wildlife aplenty, and lots of local fiestas in small towns around the country. If there is any rain, it will affect the Caribbean coast but even that will be sporadic at best. Yes, January is a fantastic month to visit Costa Rica.<div style=\"margin-top: 15px;\"></div>\n<bullet><b>January is great for</b> <a href=\"/holiday/17777/costa-rica-highlights-holiday-and-beach\">our combined activity and beach holiday</a></bullet><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Excellent weather</li>\n<li>Whales, birds and turtles</li>\n<li>Crowded national parks</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nFebruary is a brilliant month to travel in Costa Rica, with fine sunny weather and little rain. Costa Rica in February is a wildlife watchers delight: humpback whales are migrating through; sea turtles are nesting and hatching along the Pacific coast, and many thousands of migratory birds arrive from North America seeking warm winter climes. As a result, Costa Ricas national parks do get busy in February.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Orchids</li>\n<li>Trekking and surfing</li>\n<li>Abundant wildlife</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nVisit Costa Rich in March and youll want to book nice and early. The dry season is the best time of year to visit Costa Rica, with fantastic wildlife-watching opportunities and perfect weather for activities such as surfing, cycling and rainforest trekking. Speaking of rainforests, they are liberally flecked with stunning orchids, and the capital, San Jose, hosts the National Orchid Show in March. <div style=\"margin-top: 15px;\"></div>\n<bullet><b>March is fab for</b> <a href=\"/holiday/8823/coast-to-coast-cycling-holiday-in-costa-rica\">our coast-to-coast cycling holiday</a></bullet><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Hottest month</li>\n<li>End of dry season</li>\n<li>Fab diving and snorkelling</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nApril is the warmest month in Costa Rica, with average daytime temperatures around 36°C and sultry evenings. Dry season is tailing off in Costa Rica in April, and wildlife gathers around shrinking water sources. Off the Caribbean and Pacific coasts (which bask in glorious sunshine) the marine life is teeming  snorkellers and divers will find whales, dolphins, rays and countless fish species on display.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Good trekking</li>\n<li>Lower crowds and prices</li>\n<li>Start of rainy season</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nIf youre looking for travel deals and dont mind taking a chance on the weather, then May can be a good time to go to Costa Rica. This shoulder month marks the start of the rainy season, but its often more drizzle than downpour. Costa Rica in May sees temperatures rising but you can still enjoy excellent trekking in parks such as Corcovado and Manuel Antonio, with fewer crowds on popular trails.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Turtles and crocodiles</li>\n<li>Showers likely</li>\n<li>Low season deals</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nWhy travel to Costa Rica in June? This is the rainy season, but dont be put off  its otherwise known as the green season. The rainforests are lush and fragrant, and youll still get plenty of sunny weather to soak up that famous <i>pura vida</i>  ideal for trekking though trails will be getting muddier. Leatherback and hawksbill sea turtles, and crocodiles, can be seen in June, while Costa Ricas resident dolphins are often spotted off the coast.\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Secret summer</li>\n<li>Turtle nesting</li>\n<li>Family getaways</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nWhile Costa Rica in July is rainy season, theres often a secret summer  a patch of dry, sunny weather mid-rainy season and one of the reasons why this month is so appealing to families. Kids on volunteer holidays can help monitor nesting green turtles in Tortuguero National Park, while activities such as rafting, trekking up volcanoes and bathing in steamy hot springs are not affected by a bit of rain.   <div style=\"margin-top: 15px;\"></div>\n<bullet><b>July is great for</b> <a href=\"/holiday/16315/family-volunteering-with-turtles-in-costa-rica\">our family volunteering with turtles holiday</a></bullet><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Lower prices</li>\n<li>Rainy afternoons</li>\n<li>Tortuguero National Park</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nAugust is an excellent time to visit Costa Rica, especially for families looking for adventurous summer holidays. Warmer and wetter weather continues across Costa Rica in August  trekking by now is becoming more difficult, but this is the peak nesting month for turtles in Tortuguero National Park, and you can find good low season deals. Rain mostly falls in the afternoons and evenings.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Caribbean coast</li>\n<li>Peak rainy season</li>\n<li>Tricky driving</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nYou can find low accommodation and flight prices, but Costa Rica in September is not much fun  the wet weather makes overland travel difficult in many areas, particularly those that are more rural, and self-drive holidays are inadvisable. While the western Pacific coast soaks up heavy rain in September, Costa Ricas eastern Caribbean coast enjoys much drier, sunnier weather.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Head east</li>\n<li>Coffee harvest</li>\n<li>Migratory birds</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nAt first glance Costa Rica in October may not seem an appealing prospect: its very wet, and though hurricanes are rare, if they do hit then its likely to be in October. But the eastern Caribbean coast continues to enjoy dry weather. More importantly, Costa Rica in October sees the aromatic start of the coffee harvest, and crowds of migratory birds, including falcons and warblers, arrive to plunder the countrys almond trees.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Unpredictable weather</li>\n<li>Lush rainforests</li>\n<li>Chillier nights</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nNovember is a shoulder month in Costa Rica. The rainy season is tapering out, temperatures are dropping a little (you may find you want a light jacket in the evenings at higher elevations), and the greens of the forest vegetation are vivid. Animal encounters are as prolific as always in Costa Rica in November  turtles and dolphins especially, and youll also find plenty of migratory birds.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Start of the dry season</li>\n<li>Crowds return</li>\n<li>Festival of Lights</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nDecember is a really good time of year to visit Costa Rica. The rains are drying up, leaving behind forests, coasts and mountains washed fresh and clean. Towards the end of the month it gets busy  Costa Rica in December is popular for Christmas and New Year getaways. The streets of San Jose are beautifully illuminated for the Festival of Lights, with floats, marching bands and dancers parading through the capital.<div style=\"margin-top: 15px;\"></div>\n<bullet><b>December is perfect for</b> <a href=\"/holiday/20715/costa-rica-family-tour-11-days\">our family activity break</a></bullet>",

The National Orchid Show takes place in either late February or early March just outside the capital, San Jose, and sees hundreds of beautiful blooms on display in a riot of colour and fragrance.
