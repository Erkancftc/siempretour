    "Main_Paragraph": "Broadly, Djibouti has two seasons: a hot dry season from May to October and a cooler season from November to April. The best time to visit Djibouti is from Nov-March; it is too fiercely hot at other times of the year, with the weather heating up from April. During December, January and February expect highs of around 29°C, but in June, July and August temperatures routinely exceed 40°C. The sun shines pretty much year round, even during winter, and the rainfall on the coast usually occurs from Nov-March (Djibouti City gets around 13cm of rain a year); further inland it falls April-Oct.",

The two lakes  Assal and Abbé  are the best of this, with amazing rock structures, limestone chimneys and gas belching from the ground. The centre of the earth sometimes doesnt feel too far away here ",
