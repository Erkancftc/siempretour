    "Main_Paragraph": "The best time to visit New Zealand is\nDecember to February\n, the summer high season, for golden weather that makes hiking and wildlife-watching absolutely blissful. Spring (September to November) and autumn (March to May) are generally mild and dry, the landscapes bursting with colour, though the shoulder months can get pretty miserable down on the South Island. December and March is the best time to spot orcas off Kaikoura (dolphins can be seen year-round). The grape harvest in New Zealands wine regions starts in February, while the autumn is also a very popular time for scenic cruises in Fjordland.",

Nelson, Queenstown and Arrowtown on South Island also get busy, but not quite as hectic as North Island. </bullet>\n<bullet><b>November, December, January, February and March are peak months for tourists</b> so if youre looking for more affordable prices and more space on hiking paths consider visiting either side of summer. </bullet>\n<bullet><b>Mid-March or mid-October are the best times to see migratory birds </b>with Miranda on North Island and Farewell Spit on South Island witnessing thousands of species flocking to their shores. </bullet>\n<bullet>Out of New Zealands nine Great Walks only the 80km Heaphy Track is open all year round with <b>peak walking season lasting from October through to April.</b></bullet>\n<bullet><b>April and May are absolutely gorgeous </b>with autumnal colours combining with good weather and off peak prices before the winter kicks in during June, July and August.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>May, June and July are also the best times to watch bottlenose dolphins and orcas </b>around the Bay of Islands whereas sperm whales and humpbacks can be spotted off the coast of Kaikoura. </bullet>\n<bullet><b>Spring is another great time to visit New Zealand </b>with September and October offering longer, warmer days, comfortably cool nights, tree blossom and snow-capped mountains. </bullet>",

If a traveller can budget three weeks for a tour they really have a good chance of seeing the best of NZ at a relaxed pace. November to March is peak season but April is also a great time to travel as theres still good weather but less people. But do pack clothing for all weather possibilities, regardless of season.",
