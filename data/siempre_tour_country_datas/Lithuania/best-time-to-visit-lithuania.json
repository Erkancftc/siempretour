    "Main_Paragraph": "Short summers and freezing winters set the scene with beach time in the Baltics best enjoyed from June to August. Either side of summer, May or September, is perfect for strolling over old town cobbles without the crowds or deserted dunes with a chunky jumper; and if youre looking for a few feathers, March-April or Sep-Oct is the best time to visit Lithuania for bird watching. Packing a brolly and waterproofs is a good idea no matter when youre travelling to Lithuania, we recommend chucking in some mosquito spray, just in case.",
