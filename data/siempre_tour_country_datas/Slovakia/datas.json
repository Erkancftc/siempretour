        "Main_Paragraph": "On the menu on a Slovakia holiday? Start with a portion of the Danube River, which creates a beautiful border between Slovakia and Hungary as it flows eastwards. The massive High Tatras mountains are a mouthful of a main, with their high peaks and excellent hiking and winter sports. For afters? Tokaj dessert wine from the south-east, of course. Slovakia isnt on as many tourists radars as neighbour Austria, but this Central European country serves up nine national parks including the High Tatras and the aptly named Slovak Paradise National Park, plus thermal springs, and Bratislava, its medieval capital, which provides great links to Vienna and Hungary.\nReady to tuck in? Our Slovakia holidays use locally-run accommodation and restaurants, plus Slovakian guides to ensure that you get to know the country from those who know it best  and ensure that income from your visit benefits people in the destination.",
        "Subtitle": "Slovakia holiday highlights",
        "Title1": "High Tatras Mountains",
        "Paragraph1": "The highest point in the Carpathian Mountains, the High Tatras are a range of the wider Tatras Mountains chain, but one that packs a big punch. Here youll find Krivan Mountain, and Gerlachovsky stit  the countrys highest mountain, and Rysy Mountain  the highest in Poland, whose slopes can be climbed from Slovakia. In their shadows lie beautiful lakes, plus mountain huts where you can stop and eat at\nkoliba\n traditional restaurants.  An easy train ride from Bratislava, and just 20 minutes from the city of Poprad, the High Tatras might be untamed, but theyre not inaccessible. Our holidays take you there, on walks fuelled by locally sourced food and under the expert advice of local guides.",
        "image1": "",
        "Title2": "Slovakia in winter",
        "Paragraph2": "When winter comes, its time to turn to Slovakias thermal pools. Slovakian people visit pools frequently, both to socialise and to cure any ailments. Youll welcome the warmth when the snow comes and covers the countrys mountains in perfect powder  Slovakia is a fantastic destination for winter sports.\nWhilst Jasna is a popular and affordable downhill ski destination, it is low altitude and relies on artificial snow, which has a high environmental cost. Our Slovakia winter holidays focus instead on snowshoeing, cross country skiing and sledging. Alternatively, come at Christmas for charming traditional markets at Slovakias second city, Kosice  and you deserve a spa bath after all that shopping.",
        "image2": "",
        "Title3": "Walking holidays",
        "Paragraph3": "The Tatras Mountains are the best walking destination in Slovakia. Trails are well marked, and cable cars can take walkers up to altitude, so you dont have to start each day with an uphill climb. Despite the beauty, its a less-visited walking area than other alpine destinations in central Europe, so you can expect quiet trails, perhaps some nature spotting opportunities (look out for the rare Tatra chamois, and mountain foxes), and opportunities to engage with the areas highlander community  the Goral people.\nOur walking holidays use local guides and might visit traditional mountain huts along the trails, where theres local wine and beer on the table, and perhaps a sauna, too.",
        "Title4": "Family holidays",
        "Paragraph4": "You never really grow too old for fairy stories  and Slovakias storied medieval towns with their towers and turrets provide an atmospheric backdrop for tales of bears, wolves, snowy lakes and spectres. In the summer, the countrys high mountains provide a massive adventure playground for adventurous families, and the River Danube provides flat, easy bike rides for emerging cyclists. Alternatively, come in the winter for reliable snow cover, at a more affordable price than other family destinations.\nOur family holidays include fun winter breaks full of sleigh rides and sledging, cycling holidays along the Danube, plus family-friendly hiking trails with the help of cable cars to avoid the steep bits. Slovakias love of bathing extends to families too  everyone will love Poprads AquaCity slides at the end of a holiday exploring the High Tatras.",
        "image3": "",
        "Title5": "Combining Slovakia with other countries",
        "Paragraph5": "Landlocked Slovakia shares borders with Poland, Ukraine, Hungary, Austria and Czechia. Given its size and geography, its easy to combine a Slovakia holiday with other countries. Bratislava, Slovakias capital, sits just one hour from Vienna, and just over two hours from Budapest by train, and the Danube provides a satisfying through-route between them for cyclists. You could explore Poland, Slovakia and Hungary together, or hop between Austria, Slovakia and Hungary. In the mountains, its not uncommon for hikers in the High Tatras to come across walkers from Poland climbing over the mountainous border, as some trails cross into Poland."

        "Main_Paragraph": "Winter means you can follow tracks of different kinds, taking part in conservation holidays to monitor lynx, wolf and bear populations around February. Although temperatures hit the high 20°Cs in summer, hiking seasons arent until late April or May, to guarantee snow free routes. The elevated Tatranska Magistrala Walking Trail doesnt open until mid-June and closes at the end of October.",

        "when_to_go_html": "<bullet><b>January and February</b> are cold months in Slovakia, even in the south of the country. In Bratislava theres an average daily high of 2°C, in the mountains it gets as low as - 20°C. From late January, the snow should be at its best, and is excellent for winter activity holidays. </bullet>\n<bullet>Easter is celebrated over a number of days in <b>March or April</b>. The most controversial tradition happens on Easter Monday, when women are doused with cold water and whipped to ensure their good health and fertility in the year ahead. Some women skip town for a few days to avoid it. </bullet>\n<bullet>The best time to visit the Danube region is from <b>April to October</b>. Spring comes later to the mountains. In the High Tatras, the first crocus flowers tremble in the chill winds and lots of trails arent open until June. </bullet>\n<bullet><b>May</b> is still celebrated with ancient May Day festivals on the first of the month. Smaller villages will erect May poles, often cut straight from the nearest forest, and adorn them with ribbons. </bullet>\n<bullet>On <b>June 15th</b>, all hiking trails open in the High Tatras (a few are open before this date). From mid-June to October is the best time to go hiking if you want to go up high. </bullet>\n<bullet>Summer is hot across Slovakia  especially across the southern lowlands, but dont forget to take lots of sun protection if youre hiking above the treeline in the mountains, where theres no shade to speak of. <b>June, July and August</b> might be warm, but they can also get high rainfall and summer storms  a weather event known as <i>Medardova kvapka</i> brings days and days of rain. In July and August there are often folk festivals across the country. </bullet>\n<bullet><b>September</b> is a lovely time to visit Slovakia. Up in the mountains, September is the month with the fewest storms and down in the valleys there are harvest festivals. The small but renowned Tokaj wine region has a wine festival in the last week of the month  now all you need is some dessert to go with its sweet dessert wine. </bullet>\n<bullet><b>October</b> is the last month for summer activities  the last cycling trips along the Danube run in October, its also the last month to hike in the High Tatras before the trails close for winter. The weather can be lovely, sunny and stable, with an average high in Bratislava of 15°C. </bullet>\n<bullet>In <b>November</b> the weather tends to take a turn for the worse. The average daily high in Bratislava drops abruptly to 7°C. Christmas markets set up shop in the capital and in Koice, accompanied by the sweet sounds of city choirs. <b>December</b> is the start of the winter activity season. From mid-December onwards youre more likely to have better snow. </bullet>",

High Tatras National Park is the oldest, with walking trails through landscapes where bears, wolves and lynx still roam in alpine meadows or on rocky peaks. The iconic Tatranska Magistrala Trail, 42km of Tatras treats, is only open June to October, but there are many other hiking havens to explore throughout the year. Go with a naturalist guide to make the most of wildlife spotting. </bullet>\n<bullet>Although one of Europe's most mountainous countries, and with snow on high ground as late as May or June, Slovakia is still, thankfully, off the beaten track for skiing. However, as cross country skiing is part of the local culture, there are actually myriad trails with over 80km in the High Tatras, or webs of wild trails emanating from the medieval town of Levoca or Slovak Paradise National Park.</bullet>\n<bullet>As well as the iconic Danube Cycle Path, seeing these luscious landscapes from a saddle is truly, and deliciously, Slow-vakia. <b>Pedal through one medieval village after another</b> on the Pieninská Cycling Route in the eponymous national park.

Although not as famous , or indeed notorious, as the Alps or Pyrenees, these are wild, elevated landscapes, and the High Tatras, for example, should only be tackled with expert mountain guides. Consequently, you are only allowed to climb the highest peak, Gerlachovský tít , on your own if you are a member of a national\nUIAA\nclub. Other visitors have to take a certified mountain guide.

Slovakia is still a young country and, as it has been linked to Austria, Hungary and former Czechoslovakia in the not so distant past, nationality can still be an issue. Reading up before you go is advised. Similarly, pride in their Slovakian identity is bursting. Best way to celebrate that is by raising a glass of local beer and wine with a Slovak.

In the summer months, there are a few folk festivals across the county, where you can see, hear and taste all things Slovak. Východná Folklore Festival takes place in the High Tatras in early July; performances are held in an open-air theatre in the shadow of the beautiful Kriváň Mountain. It gets tens of thousands of visitors  its not just an event put on for tourists  and has been running since the 1950s."
