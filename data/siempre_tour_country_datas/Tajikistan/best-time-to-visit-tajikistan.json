    "Main_Title": "BEST TIME TO VISIT TAJIKISTAN",
    "Main_Paragraph": "If youre heading over the Pamir Highway, the best time to visit Tajikistan is from late May until late September; youre going over very high mountain passes, so outside of that period its potentially snowbound and inaccessible. Hot and sunny July is peak time to head for the mountains, while down in Dushambe its stiflingly hot. If youre going to combine mountain trekking with some culture in the cities below then late April to May is spot on  its colder at night as you climb higher, but it wont be like a furnace on the ground making museums a much more comfortable experience.",

Of course, you can get nicer accommodation in the areas of Tajikistan moving up from Dushanbe to Iskander-Kul, but generally speaking your lodgings will be basic. Its a great destination for adventurous people and people that have already travelled in basic conditions. Another point to add is that you wont get guides who speak English of perfect quality either; they do their best and we have some excellent local guides, but travelling conditions in the area are primitive and that is part of the adventure.",

    "paragraph3": "Mark Huggins shares his Tajikistan travel advice:\nOne of our trips takes in the Pamir Highway, which is a huge highway that traverses the Pamir Mountains through Afghanistan Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, and is a really adventurous road trip through the high mountain range. Its an amazing experience, but a very basic trip, so you stay with local families in traditional Pamiri homestays, sleeping on mattresses on the floor and eating as the locals do.",

    "paragraph4": "Daniel Waters, from our partner, Wild Frontiers, shares his Tajikistan travel advice:\nTajikistan is an adventure travellers dream; its so little travelled, youll be hard pressed to see another tourist the entire time youre there. The country is nearly all mountainous, spectacular scenery is guaranteed throughout, from the azure blue lakes and waterfalls of the Fann Mountains to the snowy peaks of the Pamirs, and the raging rivers in the Wakhan Valley. The warmth of the people is so heartfelt, youll be offered bread and fruit wherever you go in communities that seem to be frozen in time. The sense of remoteness, and the reality of being in a country so removed from the world as we know it, creates one of the most genuine travel experiences that can be found.",

A smile goes such a \r\nlong way and gives so much in return! <b> Gunilla Westerlund</b><br/><br/>\r\n\r\nHopefully anyone booking this holiday will have some experience in remote locations so will be well prepared. I think everyone needs to be warned to be a bit more cautious about food and water/drink. We were much more cavalier about these things (I ate and drank everything put in front of me!) than I would be when somewhere like India. <b> Sue Noble</b><br/><br/>",

Take a head torch, plenty of wipes, and gloves for horse riding or trekking. You need to pack carefully for very cold and very hot conditions.<b>  Joan Godman</b>"
