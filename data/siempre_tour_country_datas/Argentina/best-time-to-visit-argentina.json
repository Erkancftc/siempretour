    "Main_Paragraph": "December-February is the best time to visit Argentina for summer warmth, though the north can be very hot; June-Aug bring more pleasant temperatures. Rainfall peaks then at Iguazu Falls, boosting water volumes  but also sometimes closing access to some trails around the falls. April is a good time to visit Iguazu for better weather. Southern Patagonia is snowed in during the midwinter months of June-August; the long, sunny days of November-February are the best time to venture south, with late spring and early autumn bringing fewer visitors. March boasts autumn colour in the Lake District, plus grape harvest in wine regions.",

    "when_to_go_html": "<bullet><b>Temperatures peak in December and January</b>  but so do crowds, and prices.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>Easter is a National Holiday</b> so many lodgings and tours will be fully booked, and prices will rise  particularly for flights.</bullet>\n<bullet>March and April can be a lovely month for autumn foliage  but winter is well on its way in the south, so <b>visit earlier if you are planning to trek in the mountains.</b></bullet>\n<bullet><b>Parts of southern Patagonia may become inaccessible due to ice and snow in May-August</b>, although northern Patagonia is more likely to remain open for business. And this is one of the best times to try to spot big cats in the north  including the exquisite and rarely-seen puma. </bullet>\n<bullet><b>December-January is high season in Patagonia; with limited spaces in the refugios</b>, we recommend booking well in advance if travelling at this time.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>The region of Iguazu Falls is at its wettest from December-February</b>. This is not the best time to travel if youre planning to hike in the surrounding area or visit San Martin Island, as access may be closed. However, youll see these incredible falls at their fullest.</bullet>\n<bullet>July can be a busy  and expensive  time, as locals take midwinter vacations.<br/>\n</bullet>",
