        "Main_Paragraph": "Our Namibia self drive holidays and small group camping tours are the most satisfying way to explore these stark, desert-bound landscapes and the wildlife that inhabits them. Destinations including Etosha National Park, and the vast sand dunes of Sossusvlei feature regularly on our Namibia holidays, which are often combined with neighbouring Botswana. But our trips focus just as much on cultural connections as they do on wildlife and scenery. You might stay in lodges using innovative eco-technologies and supporting conservation initiatives such as anti-poaching units. Meanwhile, your local guides will show you around community farming projects or schools that you can support with needed materials by packing with purpose.",
        "Subtitle": "About our Namibia holidays",
        "Title1": "Namibia safaris",
        "Paragraph1": "Namibia’s wildlife has to contend with some serious extremes in the desert, and seeing your first oryx, with its painted face and poker-straight horns, standing in the road, is a wonderful introduction to what’s in store. The biggest draw is Etosha National Park, for its sheer size, and the number of different species you can spot while you’re here. Our safaris are led by expert local guides and drivers, who are both knowledgeable about animal behaviours, and conscious of the need to keep a respectful distance from the animals, for your safety and their wellbeing.",

        "Title2": "Desert elephants",
        "Paragraph2": "For those of us who picture elephants slinging water with their trunks and breaking trees in their eagerness to eat, Namibia’s desert elephants are an extraordinary anomaly. This cautious, smaller framed version of the savannah standard has large feet adapted to walking on sand and can live for days without water. Coming across the desert elephant is a rare treat – and they’re found in the north Kunene region, near Brandberg Mountain. Camp in the desert, learning to track their movements with a local guide, and your holiday can help with conservation efforts.",
        "image2": "",
        "Title3": "Further afield",
        "Paragraph3": "Our holidays make it easy to combine Namibia with neighbouring Botswana. Desert soon gives way to lush grasslands, and the famous Okavango Delta, where hippos throw back yawning heads close to your canoe. With Chobe National Park known for its lion populations, multiple safaris are a must. If you’ve got more time and resources, you can also admire Namibia on our thrilling overland tours of southern Africa from Cape Town to Victoria Falls. They start with penguins on a South African beach, and end with white water on the Zambezi River a few weeks later.",
        "Title4": "Types of safaris & holidays in Namibia",
        "Paragraph4": "Our self drive holidays are a convenient way to explore Namibia. Distances can be long, but the roads are good, and you’re more likely to encounter herds than traffic jams. Self drive holidays also mean you can conduct your own safari in Etosha National Park. If you’d prefer some company, our small group tours match you with like-minded travellers and expert local guides. You can see everything from leopards to rhino, desert elephants to delicate oryx on our Namibia safaris. What’s more, your holiday directly contributes to conservation efforts, such as helping fund anti-poaching patrols and tree-planting projects, and also benefits local people, by visiting community markets and creating skilled jobs in tourism.",

        "Main_Title": "Best time to visit Namibia",
        "Main_Paragraph": "The best time to visit Namibia is during the dry winter from\nMay to October\n. Temperatures are comfortably around 20°C, vegetation is thinner and wildlife congregates around waterholes, where predators hungrily await. This is also the best time to travel to Namibia and Botswana for a combined trip. But the desert climate is harsh. Night-time temperatures can drop below freezing in winter and its parched; we recommend packing moisturiser and lip balm. The rainy season in Namibia is from November to April. Its drier on the coast, though, and this is the best time to go to Namibia for bird watching.",

This is midsummer, and the heat and humidity is accompanied by torrential downpours, though these are usually short and confined to the late afternoon, with mornings clear and dry. Its significantly less rainy in Namibias coastal desert, but the mercury can top 40°C during the daytime.  <br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Bird watching</li>\n<li>Wettest month</li>\n<li>Rain affects some roads</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nThe rains continue in Namibia in February; this is typically the wettest month of the year. While you can travel in Namibia year-round, those planning self drive adventures should be aware that the rain can affect road surfaces. February can be the best time of year to go to Namibia for birdwatching, especially along the Caprivi Strip where some 450 species have been recorded.<div style=\"margin-top: 15px;\"></div>\n<bullet><b>February is great for our</b> <a href=\"/holiday/6732/namibia-wildlife-sanctuary-volunteering-holiday\">wildlife sanctuary volunteering holiday</a></bullet><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Lots of young animals</li>\n<li>Rainfall and temperatures ease</li>\n<li>Enjando Street Festival</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nTheres a baby boom in Namibia in March, which coincides with lush vegetation from all the rains, providing plenty to eat and plenty of places for young animals to hide. Wildlife viewing is trickier, as animals are dispersed around the parks rather than clustering around waterholes, but that just means when you do get a sighting its all the more exciting. Windhoek celebrates its artists and performers with the Enjando Street Festival.<div style=\"margin-top: 15px;\"></div>\n<bullet><b>March is great for our</b> <a href=\"/holiday/2897/namibia-and-botswana-camping-safari\">Namibia and Botswana camping safari</a></bullet><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Desert wildflowers</li>\n<li>Walking </li>\n<li>Windhoek Carnival</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nNamibia in April tends to be relatively dry as winter nears. There are rich greens in the foliage and pretty wildflowers give the desert sands some colour. Its a good month for walking, and the Fish River Canyon trail opens in mid-April. April is an in-between month for travel, offering milder temperatures and decent prospects for wildlife watching in places like Etosha. Windhoek Carnival is one of the years biggest cultural events. <br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Wildlife watching</li>\n<li>Dry with low humidity </li>\n<li>Onset of winter</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nMay is the start of winter and the air feels very crisp and clean after the rains. Precipitation is low across the country, as is humidity, and with water sources beginning to dry up, animals congregate around those that remain, which leads to some thrilling sightings. Namibia in May is a great option, as youre just on the cusp of peak season. The vibe in Swakopmund on the coast is getting lively, but it doesnt feel busy yet.<div style=\"margin-top: 15px;\"></div>\n<bullet><b>May is great for our</b> <a href=\"/holiday/2787/namibia-small-group-guided-holiday-and-safari\">Namibia small group guided holiday and safari</a></bullet><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Stargazing</li>\n<li>Cooler temperatures</li>\n<li>Etosha and Sossusvlei</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nClear blue skies are the norm for Namibia in June. With cooler temperatures around 20-24°C and virtually zero rain, its no surprise that this is the start of the busy season. It gets decidedly chillier at night  but wrap up because winter is the best time for stargazing in Namibia, and those skies are vast. June is good for everything from safaris in Etosha National Park to hiking Fish River Canyon and climbing to the top of Dune 45 in Sossusvlei.<div style=\"margin-top: 15px;\"></div>\n<bullet><b>June is great for our</b> <a href=\"/holiday/6414/namibia-self-drive-safari\">Namibia self drive safari</a></bullet>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Excellent wildlife watching</li>\n<li>Night-time chills</li>\n<li>Fish River Canyon</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nWildlife watching is superb in Namibia in July, with animals  including elephants, giraffes and lions  all seen around waterholes and thin vegetation giving excellent visibility. Youll need a jacket, though, especially after dark. Night-time temperatures can fall below freezing in the desert. July can be the best time to visit Namibia for wildlife, but dont neglect other activities. This is an ideal month for hiking the magnificent Fish River Canyon, the largest canyon in Africa.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Clear, sunny weather</li>\n<li>Cold after dark</li>\n<li>Busiest month</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nNamibias flag depicts a bright yellow sun on a blue sky, and theres every chance it was inspired by an August day. The weather this month is fabulous for enjoying every aspect of the country by car, by safari jeep, on foot, or even in a canoe along the Orange River. Do book early to visit Namibia in August because this is high season. That said, apart from popular spots like Etosha and Sossusvlei, it rarely feels crowded.<div style=\"margin-top: 15px;\"></div>\n<bullet><b>August is great for our</b> <a href=\"/holiday/11786/namibia-and-botswana-safari-holiday\">Namibia and Botswana safari holiday</a></bullet><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Amazing wildlife encounters</li>\n<li>Temperatures increasing</li>\n<li>Fish River Canyon trail closes</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nTemperatures are still comfortable in September but theres less of a chill in the early morning and rain remains scant. Come the end of September, much of Namibia is heating up. With the threat of extreme summer temperatures and flash floods, the famous Fish River Canyon trail closes. Visit Namibia in September for thrilling wildlife encounters in Etosha. Its so dry that animals gather in huge numbers around waterholes and salt pans.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Whale watching</li>\n<li>Jacaranda trees in bloom</li>\n<li>Dusty roads</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nNamibia in October can be glorious, though the rains of summer are on the horizon. Self drive holidays are easy here, and in October vehicles kick up clouds of dust. October is one of the best months for whale watching in Namibia as southern right, humpback and minke whales pass by the coast. The best place to see them is Walvis Bay, of course  Walvis means whale in Afrikaans. Theres beauty onshore too, as white and purple jacaranda trees bloom around Windhoek. <br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Rainy season begins</li>\n<li>Wildlife disperses</li>\n<li>Afternoon storms possible</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nNovember signals the start of the wet season, although the rains might not really get going till December. Namibia in November is hot, with daytime temperatures reaching 30°C  and a lot higher in the desert. Mist and breezes make it feel cooler on the Skeleton Coast. Dramatic storms are possible in the afternoons, and wildlife becomes more spread out around the parks as the rain increases. <br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Birthing season for zebras</li>\n<li>Higher temperatures</li>\n<li>Off-peak travel</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nDaytime temperatures are around 25°C in Windhoek and higher still in the Namib Desert. Rain begins falling in earnest now, but rarely enough to disrupt travel, so self-drivers can continue to roam in confidence. Not many people choose to visit Namibia in December due to the weather, but you can witness some wildlife wonders by coming now. For one, this is birthing season for zebras and springboks, and you may see some little uns taking their first steps.",

        "title2": "Enjando Street Festival (March)",
        "paragraph2": "March can be the best time of year to visit Windhoek, with the vibrant Enjando Street Festival taking place across the city. Namibias different ethnic groups, including the Ovambo, Herero, San and Himba, congregate in a fiesta of traditional music, dance, costume and food. Enjando celebrates the diversity of urban culture in a country that is most known to tourists for its amazing natural landscapes.<br/><br/>",
        "title3": "Windhoek Carnival (April)",
        "paragraph3": "Windhoek Carnival (or Karneval) has Germanic origins, Namibia having been brutally colonised by Germany for around 30 years before World War I. It is the biggest event on Namibias cultural calendar, and the capital-wide celebrations include colourful parades, music performances and a masked ball. Many ethnic groups such as the Ovambo and Herero are represented  and it doesnt have religious roots, hence it takes place after Lent. <br/><br/>",
        "title4": "Luderitz Crayfish Festival (April or May)",
        "paragraph4": "Crayfish is one of Namibias biggest exports, and this festival in the Atlantic coast town of Luderitz pays tribute to its crustacean chums by cooking them up in a host of delicious ways. The steamed or barbecued varieties, sprinkled with melted lemon butter, are the most popular crayfish dishes. You can tuck into a plateful or two while watching music performances and browsing stalls selling local handicrafts.<br/><br/>",
        "title5": "Oktoberfest Namibia (October)",
        "paragraph5": "Oompa bands  check. Bratwurst  check. Lederhosen  check. Copious amounts of foaming beer? Check! Its Oktoberfest, and Namibias sizeable German community, along with many thirsty visitors, gather in the capital to celebrate Bavarian culture with two days packed with feasting, musical performances, and quite a lot of drinking. And all of it in the sweltering heat of a Namibian summer. <br/><br/>",

        "title7": "What is the best month to visit Namibia?",
        "paragraph7": "The best months to travel to Namibia are from\nMay to October\n, with pleasant, dry weather the norm across the country. Self-drivers will find getting around by car is easy in these conditions, wildlife watchers will be in their element, and the weather is also ideal for walkers. The clear night skies are brilliantly carpeted with stars, and really the only thing you need to consider is that it gets chilly after dark, sometimes dropping below freezing in the desert.",
        "title8": "Which season is best for safari in Namibia?",
        "paragraph8": "The dry winter season\nbetween May and October\nis the best time to visit Namibia for a safari. Vegetation is thinner at this time of year, allowing for clearer sightings. And, with near-zero rainfall, thirsty animals congregate around waterholes which can lead to some spectacular confrontations as lions and cheetahs size up their prey. Temperatures can be quite cool on early morning and late afternoon safari drives, so you will need a jacket.",
        "title9": "What are the rainy months in Namibia?",
        "paragraph9": "Namibias rainy season is\nbetween November and April\n, with January to March the wettest months. These summer months are marked by heavy afternoon showers and thunderstorms, and while they are not enough to significantly disrupt travel, they can damage unpaved roads. The rainy season makes wildlife watching more difficult, but the flipside of that is that animals are giving birth, so  particularly from January onwards  you may see lots of babies."
