    "Main_Title": "Our South Africa holidays & tours",
    "Main_Paragraph": "Given its mammoth size, the ‘Rainbow Nation’ fittingly offers a kaleidoscope of experiences for travellers. Our South Africa holidays take in Kruger and other national parks, and their amazing wildlife. But they also explore the majestic Garden Route (and its welcoming, locally owned B&Bs); the wild and remote KwaZulu-Natal; Victoria Falls, and even the beguiling beaches of nearby Mauritius. Your trip can support conservation projects, such as the Moholoholo Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre or lodges helping to train rangers. You may also visit local communities for a true insight into residents’ lives.",
    "Subtitle": "About our South Africa holidays",
    "Title1": "Why visit South Africa?",
    "Paragraph1": "South Africa is a great introduction to Africa. It’s accessible, with good roads and infrastructure, and there’s a compelling sweep of sights. Kruger National Park could be the poster child for safaris, whilst touring Cape Town and its surrounding Winelands is a fantastic way to learn from local growers. In a country this large, don’t just visit one place – our self drive holidays are popular for a reason. Add Johannesburg after Kruger National Park or combine cultural touring through KwaZulu-Natal with the beautiful Elephant Coast.",

    "Title2": "Kruger National Park",
    "Paragraph2": "Tell people you’re going to South Africa on safari, and they’ll probably think you’re going to Kruger National Park. This huge game reserve is four hours’ drive or a flight from Johannesburg, and home to black and white rhinos, big cats, and African wild dogs. The wildlife-rich south can be a busy place, so our holidays also explore the private game reserves that ring Kruger. These protected areas offer more secluded excursions, and fences between them have been removed, allowing animals to follow their natural migratory routes. You’ll also stay in lodges and camps that make efforts to employ local people.",

    "Title3": "Self drive holidays in South Africa",
    "Paragraph3": "Driving along South Africa’s coast, you might be distracted by a whale spout out to sea or do a double-take at the sight of penguins on the beach. Head inland and there are ostriches running alongside the road in the Karoo and warthogs trotting ahead in the game parks. The country’s good roads and big scenery are perfect for our self drive holidays, and you can easily weave culture into your itinerary too. Our accommodation in KwaZulu-Natal works with local community enterprise projects, while township tours in Cape Town are both eye-opening and inspirational.",
    "Title4": "Family holidays in South Africa",
    "Paragraph4": "We have safari experiences for all ages, younger children will love bush craft sessions and night tours, a cacophony of calls and exciting sounds. Children aged eight and over can enjoy more traditional vehicle-led safaris, while older children and teenagers can start to learn about South Africa’s challenging history and multifaceted culture, too, by visiting Johannesburg and having a guided tour of Soweto. You might even want to consider a volunteering holiday. Young children can work with orphaned primates, and even have their own monkey to look after all day!",

    "Title5": "Types of tours & holidays in South Africa",
    "Paragraph5": "From Addo to Hluhluwe, you’ve got your pick of parks and private reserves on a safari holiday in South Africa. It goes without saying that this is a marvellous wildlife holiday destination. And think beyond big cats: you could visit the coast to see dolphins and whales chasing the annual sardine run instead. Our small group holidays led by knowledgeable local guides are a fun way to explore the beautiful Winelands. Feeling intrepid? Consider an adventure holiday – you could get up close to great white sharks or shop for that night’s dinner at a community market on an overland tour.",
    "Title6": "Going beyond South Africa",
    "Paragraph6": "From here, the only way is up: South Africa is a gateway to the whole continent of Africa and a great starting point for an overland tour. The most popular route from Cape Town to Victoria Falls also allows you to compare the landscapes and traditional culture of Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia, and takes around three weeks. If you have less time, you could just nip into Namibia – where its vast deserts provide a contrast to the Cape Winelands. Alternatively, combine safari with a beach break by visiting South Africa and Mauritius – the perfect way to wind down after all those lion encounters."
