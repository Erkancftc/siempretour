        "Main_Title": "Our Tanzania holidays & safaris",
        "Main_Paragraph": "Tanzania is much less developed than its neighbours, with a far greater sense of wilderness. From the vast grassy plains of the Serengeti and the dramatic Ngorongoro Crater, to little visited parks in the south where African wild dogs roam, local ranger guides are the key to a truly special experience. This legendary safari destination can also be combined with trekking Mount Kilimanjaro and beach breaks in nearby  Zanzibar. Whether you're after a luxury safari or bringing the family for a memorable African escape, our holidays are designed to minimise their impact on Tanzania's fragile eco systems.",
        "Subtitle": "About our Tanzania holidays",
        "Title1": "Safari holidays in Tanzania",
        "Paragraph1": "There are many places across Tanzania where you’ll enjoy close encounters with the natural world. In northern Tanzania you’ll find the Serengeti, the Ngorongoro Crater and Lake Manyara (a lesser-known haven for birdwatchers) all relatively close to each other. Fewer people go south to the enormous Selous Game Reserve and Ruaha National Park. To really get off the beaten track, try the Enduimet Wildlife Management Area near Kilimanjaro, where our holidays significant benefit local communities that don’t see many visitors. Tanzania has a well-deserved reputation for luxury trips, but there are ways to go on safari inexpensively – especially if you join one of our overland tours or combine game viewing with volunteering.",
        "image1": "",
        "Title2": "Serengeti",
        "Paragraph2": "The big name in big game viewing, the Serengeti comprises a large area of northern Tanzania and spreads into south-western Kenya. Tour trips explore a national park and several game reserves where you can see the Big Five, as well as some of the world’s biggest herds of wildebeest. July and August are peak season for wildlife-watching in the northern Serengeti. Over 1.7 million wildebeest move through the Serengeti in search of good grazing during the Great Migration, keenly watched by predators including rare cheetahs. Our Serengeti holidays support conservation projects such as an initiative to monitor cheetah demographics here in one of their few remaining habitats.",
        "image2": "",
        "Title3": "Climbing Kilimanjaro",
        "Paragraph3": "Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain on the continent, and you dont need to be a mountaineer to get to its summit. The ascent  accounting for acclimatisation because of the high altitude  can be spread out over eight days, though there are five-day treks too. Our Kilimanjaro holidays benefit local communities by employing porters and expert guides, ensuring they are paid fairly and not overloaded. Climbers camp out on the mountain and porters carry their equipment, food and water. Its a serious achievement to get to the top, requiring good fitness and training, so its well worth looking into which of the seven routes up is best-suited to you.",
        "Title4": "Family holidays in Tanzania",
        "Paragraph4": "Our family holidays in Tanzania are wonderful for kids of all ages. They usually start with a safari and finish by the coast – the beaches of Zanzibar are just a short flight away. Talk to us to establish which trips are suited to your age group, as given the driving involved, some safaris are better suited to children over the age of eight (though you won’t wait long for animals to appear in wildlife-rich places like the Ngorongoro Crater). Older children and teens might be interested in something more active – you could consider a our cycling trips. Our family holidays in Tanzania spark interest in conservation, and introduce young minds to different cultures through village visits, and encounters with local tribespeople as they share their traditional ways of life.",
        "image3": "",
        "Title5": "Types of safaris & holidays in Tanzania",
        "Paragraph5": "The most popular way to see Tanzania is on a safari holiday, but that doesn't mean that all safaris are equal. Our trips directly fund conservation efforts while also employing local people, from guides to drivers and lodge staff. Tanzania is well-known for sophisticated wildlife viewing and the best way is by safari vehicle. Our small group safaris are very sociable affairs, and we also have brilliant group tours to climb Kilimanjaro, cycle, or embark on longer overland expeditions. Our tailor made holidays to Tanzania can be shaped to your requirements, and if you want to splash out on a big-ticket trip, there is a vast selection of luxury lodges and classy camps including many in less-visited parts of the country.",
        "Title6": "Where to go in Tanzania",
        "Paragraph6": "Our favourite place to go in Tanzania might be Selous Game Reserve. It’s four times bigger and far less visited than the Serengeti, and there’s more chance of seeing animals, including endangered African wild dogs – plus the wildlife benefits from conservation efforts funded by entrance fees. Safaris can be tiring, but several of our trips head to the coast afterwards for some well-deserved R and R – the Zanzibar archipelago is a great option. From the beaches here, you’ll see dhows skimming across the horizon and fish being caught for Stone Town’s market. Our holidays don’t spend the whole time on the beach though, whisking you off on village visits to explore Zanzibar’s culture and history while ensuring local communities benefit from tourism."

        "Main_Title": "Best time to visit Tanzania",
        "Main_Paragraph": "June to August is the best time to visit Tanzania. The spectacular Mara River crossing occurs from June to July, drier weather means more wildlife around waterholes, and the weather is relatively cool. That said, the Great Migration swirls around the Serengeti outside these months; you just have to follow its course. January to February brings fewer vehicles and greener landscapes after the short rains. Youll see baby wildebeest and more predators. Heavy rain showers in March and May can cause travel disruption, lodges in the remote south close, and Mount Kilimanjaro is best avoided.",

Under the sun, hundreds of thousands of baby wildebeest are born in the south of the Serengeti, in grasslands greened by the past short rains. They attract hungry predators  but not many tourists. Early January might be busier, as its part of the Christmas holiday season, but its still quieter than the busy summer.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Hot and dry</li>\n<li>Wildebeest calves in southern Serengeti</li>\n<li>Green landscape</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nWildebeest calves continue to be born in the south Serengeti in Tanzania in February  thousands of them  but many wont survive until summer. Its hot and mostly dry and its a quiet time for tourists, though its a pretty time of year, with green landscapes and migratory birds. Depending on where you are, rains could start to be more frequent towards the end of the month.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Rainy green season from mid-March</li>\n<li>Some good rates available on lodges</li>\n<li>Low season for Kilimanjaro, Zanzibar and safaris</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nIts low season: the long rains start in Tanzania in March. They make some areas inaccessible and safaris  with the possibility of getting stuck in the mud  more adventurous. Some lodges close; others might have good rates. You wont want to be on the beach and the water is too cloudy for snorkelling and diving. Kilimanjaros trails become slippery and visibility is poor. If you climb, pick an easier route.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Great birdlife and hatching turtles</li>\n<li>Some good rates about at lodges</li>\n<li>Muddy, rainy low season</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nAs the rains continue to fall in Tanzania in April, green turtles start hatching in the Mafia Archipelago and continue to do so until September. Theres plenty of wildlife following the wildebeest through the mid-Serengeti  though youll want a waterproof. It wont rain all the time, but beaches and hiking are damp, unappealing prospects and mosquitos are about.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Rains stop mid-month</li>\n<li>Wildebeest cross the Grumeti River</li>\n<li>Cycling trips</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nThe green, rainy season continues to mid-month in Tanzania in May. The end of month is dry but possibly still empty of tourists avoiding the rains. The wildebeest herds are moving north, reaching the bank of the Grumeti River from May to June. The river crossing is an exciting spectacle, as Nile crocodiles lie in wait. Our cycling trips in Tanzania and into neighbouring Kenya start from May.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>High season</li>\n<li>River Mara wildebeest crossings</li>\n<li>Long dry season</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nHigh season begins in Tanzania in June with the start of the long dry season that runs until mid-October. That said, you might slip in ahead of the biggest crowds now. Wildebeest herds reach the northern Serengeti and attempt their famous crossings of the River Mara without becoming croc fodder. The weather is cooler: bring layers on safari. Kilimanjaro is coldest from now until August.<div style=\"margin-top: 15px;\"></div>\n<bullet><b>June is a great time for our</b> <a href=\"/holiday/14368/tanzania-safari-and-zanzibar-beach-holiday-tailor-made\">Tanzania safari and Zanzibar beach holiday</a></bullet>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>River Mara crossing</li>\n<li>Long dry season</li>\n<li>High season  more jeeps</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nThe safari crowds come to Tanzania in July to see wildlife congregating at waterholes. Some regions heave with jeeps  Ngorongoro, and the northern Serengeti, where cars line up to see wildebeest attempt to cross the Mara River. There are high prices, as its perfect conditions for both safari and for the post-safari sun lounging on the beach. Less accessible South Tanzania parks, like the massive Selous National Park, remain peaceful.<div style=\"margin-top: 15px;\"></div>\n<bullet><b>July is a great time for our exciting</b> <a href=\"/holiday/14911/exciting-family-holiday-in-tanzania\">family holiday in Tanzania</a></bullet><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Peak high season</li>\n<li>Safari and beach</li>\n<li>Long dry season</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nHigh season prevails in Tanzania in August. Thats thanks to a combination of summer holidays, the continuation of the migration in the Serengeti, and cooler, dry temperatures (highs of 26°C in the Serengeti; 29°C in Zanzibar), which make it the perfect time to combine safaris and beach. Kilimanjaro is still at its coldest, though its climbable throughout the year.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Dry and not too cold or hot</li>\n<li>Mount Kilimanjaro climbs</li>\n<li>Quieter month for safaris</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nWildebeest are still crossing the rivers of the northern Serengeti in Tanzania in September. Being outside the holiday season, its also a quieter, less expensive month for safari and beach trips. September is a busy month on Kilimanjaro; moderate temperatures and more clear-sky days make this month and the next a good time to climb.<div style=\"margin-top: 15px;\"></div>\n<bullet><b>September is a good time of year for our</b> <a href=\"/holiday/27739/tanzania-tour-with-kilimanjaro-day-trek\">Tanzania tour with Kilimanjaro and Zanzibar</a></bullet><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Climbing Kilimanjaro</li>\n<li>Whale sharks off the coast</li>\n<li>Short rains starting</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nOctober can be a good time to climb Kilimanjaro. Its less busy than September and dry until the end of the month, when the short rains start. Whale sharks arrive at the coast; you could spot them at Mafia Island. Tanzania in October is less visited now, at the end of the dry season, but theres still good safari conditions: its mainly warm and sunny, but quiet too.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Whale sharks</li>\n<li>Fresh mangoes</li>\n<li>Short rainy season</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nExpect rain showers in Tanzania in November for the <i>mvuli</i>  the short rainy season. They wont bring the travel disruption of the long spring rains, but they do freshen up the landscape, making the following months lovely and green. There are mangoes ripe on the trees and visibility clear in the seas  so get snorkelling. You might even see whale sharks.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Wildebeest in the southern Serengeti</li>\n<li>Popular around Christmas</li>\n<li>Short rainy season</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nIt can be hot and feel humid in Tanzania in December (average highs of 28°C in Serengeti; 31°C in Zanzibar). Its still the short rainy season so expect showers when climbing Kili and green scenes on safari. The wildebeest have moved to the southern Serengeti. There is no migration in the Ngorongoro Crater; you can see wildlife there year-round. Mid-December to mid-January can be busier as its the Christmas holidays.",

This barbecue showcase, the largest in East and Central Africa, takes place a few times a year across different cities, including Dar es Salaam and Arusha, and is a total meat feast. Look out for <i>mishkaki</i>  grilled skewers of beef, goat and chicken  on streetside barbecues, and enjoy the sizzle.<br/>",

Thousands of runners compete from all over the world in the Kili Marathon, enjoying the challenges of the climb and the February heat, plus fantastic views of the mountain along its route if the weather is clear. Theres a half marathon and a 5km fun run, too, plus a chance to celebrate the finish with a cool Kilimanjaro lager.",

        "paragraph4": "The carnival parade that opens this three-day Zanzibar dance and music festival sets the tone of the weekend. Sauti za Busara (sounds of wisdom in Swahili) is one of the biggest and most respected music festivals in East Africa. Artists from across the continent perform live across three stages, celebrating Swahili culture. Look out for taarab, a traditional form of music that has been experiencing a revival.",

        "paragraph5": "Nile crocodiles have such slow metabolisms that they might only have one or two big meals a year. And what a big meal this is: every year, wildebeest herds, alongside zebras, elands and gazelles, reach the Mara River and attempt to cross from bank to bank in search of fresh grass. Theyre followed by hyenas, lions and cheetahs, plus hungry crocodiles. The ensuing spectacle is nature at its most dramatic, and safari-goers queue on the banks to capture the more grisly moments.",

Taking place in the quiet fishing town of Bagamoyo, on the coast north of Dar Es Salaam, it was started in 1982 by Bagamoyo College of Arts and used to take place under a mango tree.

More generally, the best month to visit Tanzania is between June and August. Not only does the country have a great climate in these summer months, being cool and dry, but the Great Migration reaches a high point as wildebeest dodge crocs to cross the Mara River. Its a lovely time to be on the beach, too.",
        "title10": "What is the rainy season in Tanzania?",
        "paragraph10": "Tanzania has two rainy seasons.\nMasika\n, the long rains, are from\nMarch to May\nand\nmvuli\n, the shorter, lighter rains, fall from\nmid-November to mid-December\n. The long rains can cause flooding, cut off areas and halt safaris in remoter regions. The short rains are less impactful.",
        "title11": "When is the best month to visit Tanzania for the migration?",
        "paragraph11": "The best months to see the migration are\nJune to August\n, when massive wildebeest herds attempt to cross the Mara River, and fall prey to crocs that havent eaten in months. Jeeps line the banks to witness the spectacle. The Mara might mean migration at its zenith, but you can see the herds all the time in Tanzania as the wildebeest circle the Serengeti through the year, starting in the south in January, and moving up to the north by June. May is another interesting time, as they start to cross the Grumeti River.",
        "title12": "When is the worst time to visit Tanzania?",
        "paragraph12": "March to early May\nis the worst time to visit Tanzania. The long rains make some safari areas inaccessible, the beach miserable, and climbing Kilimanjaro more challenging, with less chance of a good view. There are more mosquitos about, more chance of travel disruption, and some safari lodges in the south close altogether. However, rains tend to clear by mid-May, and you might also find that some holidays have good low season prices."
