    "Main_Paragraph": "Heat, dust, and roasting desert winds characterise Burkina Fasos climate  and dont expect A/C to ease the stupor. The best weather is in late Oct-Dec, when temperatures are slightly cooler and dusty harmattan winds from the Sahara at least stop it feeling too sticky. The wet season is not great for travel  but visiting shortly after youll find a refreshed landscape  and people. The best time to go to Burkina Faso is arguably during the mask festivals  the biggest celebrations take place in late Feb-early March in even numbered years, though smaller, local events take place outside this time.",

There are lots of open air bars called maquis, and theyre a great place to just sit, have a beer, meet local people and watch the world go by. Its quite an institution in Burkina Faso. Also go and check out some live music in Bobo-Dialassou. They have quite a few places that have live music, and predominantly a local crowd but you get tourists there. Mali dominates the West African music scene  Burkina's music is quite similar but you get modern performers as well.",
    "title3": "Culture & authenticity",
    "paragraph3": "The FESTIMA Mask Festival happens once every two years, but we visit masked dances on other trips as well. Theyre not quite as big but they are quite spectacular. The FESTIMA festival is something that would happen regardless of whether youre there or not, but we arrange for some villages to come out and show us their masks. Some people get concerned that by arranging something it somehow becomes less authentic, but if you went to a Catholic priest and asked him to perform Mass for you, does that make it any less authentic because youve asked him to?",

    "paragraph4": "The markets of the Sahel are a real crossroads of cultures. Youve got people from the south and people from the north and thats where they all mingle, so theres a lot of diversity; you can see a lot of ethnic groups in one day. Its not quite the Sahara but its getting that way, its a semi-arid region. Once a week all the ethnic groups from the different parts of the region come there to attend the market. So youve got Tuaregs riding in from the desert on their camels with their swords by their sides, youve got the Bella people, Songhai, its incredible atmospheric. There are cattle markets, with lots of long horned cattle standing round, many turbans, women in very brightly coloured dresses..."
