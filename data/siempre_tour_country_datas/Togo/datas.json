        "Main_Paragraph": "Barely over 110 kilometres across in places, Togo slots between Ghana and Benin and is often visited alongside its neighbours. All share vodun traditions and the interesting practices that ensue from practising this fascinating animist religion. Tours of Togo might start in capital Lome, conveniently close to the country’s beaches and Lake Togo, before heading inland to meet some of the country’s tribal groups. Togo has forty ethnic groups, including those with UNESCO-protected ways of life. Our Togo holidays and Togo tours tread carefully, ensuring you have rewarding interactions with the people you meet, and that your stay benefits, rather than exploits, any communities you visit.",
        "Subtitle": "TOGO highlights",
        "Title1": "",
        "Paragraph1": "Togo is divided into five regions which, from south to north are known as Maritime, Plateaux, Centrale, Kara and Savanes. Most tourism is still focused around the Maritime region, due to the fact that its capital, Lomé, has long been the major port. As well as the fact that the Gulf of Guinea is somewhat gorgeous. When you travel north, however, you get the feeling that you are climbing a series of ladders that lead from one fascinating attic after another, each stuffed with beautiful artifacts, secret corners and ancient stories. So, just keep climbing.",
        "image1": "",
        "Title2": "1. Kara & the Kaby Mountains",
        "Paragraph2": "Kara is the capital of Northern Togo, built by German colonists and also in the heart of the indigenous Kabiye peoples lands. It is also gateway to the Kaby Mountains, or Massif Kabye, where traditional villages made up of soukala or rings of  beautifully crafted round huts, are still home to skilled artisans from ironworkers to weavers, potters to basket makers. Check out the market at Ketao.",
        "image2": "",
        "Title3": "2. Koutammakou",
        "Paragraph3": "You won't find it on Google Maps, because this UNESCO World Heritage Site refers to a traditional settlement that spreads through the Tamberma Valley. The homes were built by Batammariba - also known as Tamberma - people in 17th century to flee threats of slavery from neighbouring Benin. Now icons of Togo, their stunning mud houses known as\ntakienta\nare more like forts than mere dwellings. This is a 50,000 hectare-wide view into Togo's living culture.",
        "Title4": "3. Lake Togo",
        "Paragraph4": "More lagoon than lake, its separated from the Atlantic by a coastal strip. The town of Togoville on its shores is traditional Togolese and taking a wooden canoe, or pirogue, across the lake is a wonderful way to travel Togo pace. Togoville has many voodoo sculptures on display in front of houses, although there is also a shrine to the Virgin Mary who appeared in the 1970s apparently. Its all happening in Togoville.",
        "image3": "",
        "Title5": "4. Lomé",
        "Paragraph5": "Lomé was a busy capital and port throughout both German and French colonial times. Since gaining independence in 1960 it just keeps growing, the coast road along the Gulf of Guinea being its main artery. The hub of tourism is actually its markets, famous for traditional voodoo and fetishes. If love of water is more your thing, the beach is always close. Although go with local people; the currents and coastal conditions have hidden dangers.",
        "Title6": "5. Notsé",
        "Paragraph6": "An important town in terms of getting your head around Togos cultural and social history built in 1600 by the Ewe people, one of Togos indigenous peoples who were displaced at that time. The Ewe Chief of the time built a 14.5km wall around the town to protect his people, and you can still see remnants of it. It is the last home of the Notsé people before colonisation.",
        "Title7": "6. Sokodé",
        "Paragraph7": "Main city of Togos Centrale region, and home to theTem or Kotokoliare people.  It is also gateway to Fazao-Malfakassa National Park where elephants, monkeys and eclectic birdlife inhabit the savannah grasslands. Tourism in the park is still minimal, with Togos emphasis being on cultural heritage right now. But as the local population swaps poaching their elephants for protecting them, it is definitely time to start supporting this park."

        "Main_Paragraph": "Togo is typically tropical, with temperatures ranging from high to higher. The higher you go geographically the higher they turn up the heat too, with temperatures averaging 27°C on the south coast to 30°C in the norths sizzling savannah. Rains fall May-October although, in the south, there is a reprise mid-July and mid-September. Fazao-Malfakassa National Park is only open Nov-April.  Togo is at its most torrid during March and April, making November to February the best time to visit. There is a different type of heat at its amazing festivals, however, such as Gbagba in August and the Voodoo Festival in September.",

Travelling through the Somba country and seeing their fortified Tata houses - simply amazing!... Just go ahead and book it as the itinerary covers so much of West African culture, with particular insights into voodoo practices and life inside remote tribal villages -<b> Mark Langer</b><br/><br/>\r\nDo not have high expectations about hotels or restaurants, but be prepared for a lot of experience and adventure  <b> Annie Kreftin</b>"
