    "Main_Paragraph": "Togo is typically tropical, with temperatures ranging from high to higher. The higher you go geographically the higher they turn up the heat too, with temperatures averaging 27°C on the south coast to 30°C in the norths sizzling savannah. Rains fall May-October although, in the south, there is a reprise mid-July and mid-September. Fazao-Malfakassa National Park is only open Nov-April.  Togo is at its most torrid during March and April, making November to February the best time to visit. There is a different type of heat at its amazing festivals, however, such as Gbagba in August and the Voodoo Festival in September.",

    "paragraph6": "I had one of my most eye-opening trips - and I have been on many. The tour delivered everything I had hoped for in a holiday that explores the more cultural aspects of West Africa. I now feel privileged to have done it... Travelling through the Somba country and seeing their fortified Tata houses - simply amazing!... Just go ahead and book it as the itinerary covers so much of West African culture, with particular insights into voodoo practices and life inside remote tribal villages -<b> Mark Langer</b><br/><br/>\r\nDo not have high expectations about hotels or restaurants, but be prepared for a lot of experience and adventure  <b> Annie Kreftin</b>"
