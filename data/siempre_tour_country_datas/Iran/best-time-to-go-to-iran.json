    "Main_Paragraph": "March-May and September-October\nare the best time to go to Iran. Youll dodge searing summer heat and bitter winters with snow-blocked mountain roads. Prices do rise in these months, particularly in April. June and October offer slightly better deals if you are prepared to dress for the heat or the cold. July and August are the hottest months in Iran, with a dry heat of over 30°C. Iran marks several festivals which can disrupt travel. Nowruz (Iranian New Year; two weeks starting 21 March) means price hikes and packed hotels. During the month of Ramadan (dates vary), eating and drinking in public is banned during the day and religious laws are more strictly enforced.",

    "paragraph2": "<bullet></bullet><b>March, April and May are high season in Iran</b>, with gorgeous temperatures for sightseeing – but also higher prices, especially in April. You might be able to get a better deal in early June. <bullet></bullet><b>The ancient festival of Nowruz celebrates the Persian New Year and the coming of spring</b>, and it’s the biggest event in the Iranian calendar. It usually runs from 20th March for around two weeks. This is a busy, expensive and chaotic time in Iran with many places closed for the celebrations, so unless you’re coming with the intention of joining in, it’s advisable to travel outside of this time. <bullet></bullet><b>Late November, December, January and February are bitterly cold</b> – especially in the mountains of the north and west. July and August are boiling, with temperatures often into the 40s. This is doubly unpleasant as shorts and t-shirts are a no-no, and women must wear headscarves. <bullet></bullet><b>Ramadan is a month-long event in the Islamic calendar which shifts around slightly each year</b>. Upcoming Ramandan dates are in <b>February and March</b>: 10 March to 9 April 2024; 28 February to 30 March 2025; 17 February to 18 March 2026; 7 February to 8 March 2027. During Ramadan, it is forbidden to eat or drink in public between sunrise and sunset – although some restaurants may discreetly serve foreign tourists, and you can eat in private or in vehicles. After dark, be prepared for feasting. <bullet></bullet><b>September and October are also pleasant months to travel in Iran</b>, and prices may well be slightly lower than in the spring. <bullet></bullet>Be aware that <b>Friday is the Islamic day of rest</b>, and that Thursday and Friday are the weekend in Iran. Saturday and Sunday are normal working days.",

    "paragraph4": "Mike Pullman, from our supplier Wild Frontiers, on the best time to visit Iran:\nI would recommend the spring and the autumn. If you can handle the heat you could go in the summer because it would be quieter, but it gets very hot, and it can be a bit of a pain in the heat when youre having to wear a headscarf. In spring and autumn the weather is really pleasant, like a warm, sunny summers day in England. Winters really cold.",

    "paragraph7": "May is not only one of the loveliest months to visit in terms of climate; its also when Irans supposedly barren landscape blooms. Cats tail-like Eremurus flowers light up the landscapes, along with pretty, bell-shaped crown imperials. And if you always associated tulips with the Netherlands, think again; tulips are the national flower of Iran, and the countrys flag features the name of Allah stylised to resemble a tulip, in memory of those who gave their lives for their country. In the springtime these delicate blooms can be seen growing wild along the roadsides."
