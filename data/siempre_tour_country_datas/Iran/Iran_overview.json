    "Main_Paragraph": "Our Iran holidays show that what we see in the news ignores the warm welcome travellers get here, and that this beguiling country is still wide open to Westerners. Our small group and tailor made holidays in Iran explore the country’s rich cultural heritage, via Tehran, Yazd, Shiraz, and Persepolis, with entrance fees helping to preserve ancient sites. Tours trace the history of the Silk Road, and immerse you into the flavours of Iranian cuisine by visiting local restaurants. Travel overland between peaceful tea gardens, historic mosques decorated with magnificent mosaics, and ruined palaces, led by Iranian guides who are thrilled to show you their country behind the headlines.",

    "Title1": "History & culture in Iran",
    "Paragraph1": "Iran is one of the oldest continuously inhabited places in the world. The vast Persian Empire may be no more, overthrown in the Iranian Revolution of 1979, but Iran remains a powerful influence in the region, often viewed malignly by Western powers. Yet Iran is not its government, and everywhere you go you will encounter friendly welcomes from open-minded people eager to show you the truth of life in Iran. Our holidays join the cultural dots, and by seeking out local hotels, restaurants and guides they ensure that your stay also financially benefits the communities you visit.",

    "Title2": "Where to go on holiday in Iran",
    "Paragraph2": "If you’re low on time then there are three key cities to explore. Our holidays often follow a route linking the secular, liberal capital Tehran with Esfahan to the south, adding in Shiraz (from where you can continue to the ruins of Persepolis). Esfahan is the most beautiful city in Iran, where you can visit small workshops turning out ceramics, woodwork and carpets and find exquisite souvenirs made by local artists. Shiraz, once the capital, may not have produced any wine since the Iranian Revolution in 1979, but its gardens, poets’ tombs and intricate Islamic architecture are just as intoxicating.",

    "Title3": "Ancient civilisations in Iran",
    "Paragraph3": "Iran’s history is measured not in centuries but in millennia. Once the centre of the vast Persian Empire, it was also a key link in the spidering trade routes that made up the Silk Road that helped civilisations and cultures spread their art, architecture and ideas. Their presence is still felt today, with key sites forming parts of modern cities, rather than being fenced off or buried beneath the sands of time. The knowledgeable local guides on our holidays are the best people to show you around these sites, as well as some of the Islamic world’s most magnificent mosques, including the Pink Mosque of Shiraz and Shah Mosque of Esfahan.",
    "Title4": "Responsible tourism in Iran",
    "Paragraph4": "Independent travel in Iran is difficult, as all visitors require a guide and visa restrictions are complex. Yet visiting Iran is in itself an act of responsible tourism – choosing to discover the country, its people and culture for yourself rather than simply accepting the limited picture recognised by the West. Our holidays, led by brilliant Iranian guides, ensure that you know the rules regarding dress and behaviour, and can provide opportunities to meet local people. It is in these instances – whether bumping into a group of students in a park or being invited to a family home for mint tea – that you will encounter the real Iran beyond the headlines.",

On our tailor made holidays the logistics, guides, and visas are still taken care of for you, but you'll have more flexibility with your itinerary and travel dates.
