        "Main_Paragraph": "Tiny Slovenia revels in its richly-storied diversity: ravishing Italianate coastal resorts, lush forests, emerald-green lakes, rushing rivers and snow-capped peaks, in a landscape sprinkled with fairytale castles and ancient towns. Beneath ground, Europe's largest cave systems give up spectacular archaeological finds. And any Slovenia holidays should also include the excellent wine! A small country, yes – but ones with big pleasures. And your trip can have a big impact here, too. Our Slovenia holidays help support Slovenia’s rural areas economies, whether you’re visiting beekeepers and their elaborate beehives; outdoor museums that depict historic farming techniques; or local farmers who are employing new and nature-friendly ones. In doing so they help preserve Slovenian heritage and prevent rural depopulation.",

        "Title1": "Family frolics  and fantasy",
        "Paragraph1": "Whatever the activity, Slovenia lets you and your family do it in spectacular settings. The magnificent Julian Alps provides climbs, hikes and biking trails to tempt the most adventurous teens, such as the steep 1,500m descent from Mount Vogel down to Lake Bohinj. In the west, gorgeous-coloured pristine mountain rivers dive into awesome valleys through rapids offering some of Europe's best white-water rafting, as well as canyoning.\nEase up on the pace beside lakes like Bled and Bohinj, where lakeside paths provide perfect terrain for easy cycling. Horsey kids, meanwhile, can choose between riding the white stallions of one of the world's most majestic breeds or little Icelandic horses. Oh, and did we mention that Slovenia has one of Europe's longest and highest zip wires?\nIt's a great place to get imaginations working as well as muscles. Thousands of years of evocative history ranges from Neanderthal and early human times to 20th century wartimes. And history's never dull when places to be explored include Europe's largest cave system, witchcraft-linked medieval castles and historic towns out of a colourful fantasy.",
        "image1": "",
        "Title2": "An ancient tapestry",
        "Paragraph2": "Its awesome caves gave up humanity's oldest known musical instrument. Castles and churches fashioned from the 11th century on beckon in superb settings. Towns like Ljubljana, Celje and Ptuj are architectural jewels dating back to Roman times. And don't miss remarkable WW1 sites around Kobarid. Slovenia may be small  but its history is vast.",
        "image2": "",
        "Title3": "Grand tours",
        "Paragraph3": "Compact, with excellent roads leading to impressive views, some think Slovenia is best savoured by car. You can drive with ease between Lake Bled and Triglav National Park, Piran and Ljubljana. Then again, perhaps it's even better to go on foot. Walking and enjoying the great outdoors is ingrained into Slovenian culture, so when you park up, you'll find fantastic hiking routes across the country, whether in Brda, 'Slovenia's Tuscany', or routes that have been connected to form the long-distance Juliana Trail.",
        "Title4": "Savouring Slovenia",
        "Paragraph4": "From Adriatic coast to the Julian Alps, and from the vineyards of the rocky Karst to the rolling wheat fields by the Hungarian border, Slovenia's diversity of climates, landscapes and terroirs creates rich foodie micro-regions with distinctive traditions and specialities. Italian and Balkan influences are complemented by peasant recipes still served at farmhouse tables. Street snacks include\nburek\n(savoury pastries) and\nkranjska klobasa\n(spicy sausages), while restaurants contrast schnitzels (\nzrezek\n) with local ravioli, and fantastic sea and river fish. Desserts include\ntruklji\n(fruit dumplings) and\nprekmurska gibanica\n, a delicious local cheesecake.\nSlovenia also boasts excellent distinctive wines: bold red Teran made with Refosk grapes, great with local ham (\nprsut\n); sophisticated Mediterranean vintages from lovely Goriska Brda; unique amphora-aged amber wines. Local spirits include superb fruit schnapps and gin-like\nbrinovec\n, while beer lovers should try the Guinness-like stout\ntemno pivo\n. Specialist food and wine tours bring you closer to this land and its incredible produce.",
        "image3": "",
        "Title5": "Snap happy",
        "Paragraph5": "Wintry Slovenia is spectacular  frozen waterfalls, misty lakes with island churches, clifftop castles, snowy peaks changing colours in low sunlight. In the Julian Alps, you can snap gorges, rushing rivers and moody WWI remnants  or grab a shot of the elusive Alpine ibex. Autumn spreads Technicolor from Italianate coast to mountains. And under dark rural skies, capture galaxies and star trails. Human life is a great subject too, from picturesque villages to historic townscapes."

        "Main_Paragraph": "The best time to visit Slovenia is different for everyone. The alpine northwest sees abundant snow from December to March, while warm, dry conditions from May to September are ideal for climbing, hiking, cycling and adventure sports. Snowmelt makes white water rafting a great option by late May. The Adriatic coast and its inland Primorska region have very warm summers, autumn colour and pleasantly cool winters. The remainder of the country sees hot, dry summers and bitter winters. Many attractions  including Ljubljana  are  enjoyable year-round.",

        "when_to_go_html": "<bullet>Activity season starts in late spring  around <b>May</b>. Mild, sunny weather means hiking, cycling and kayaking are all up for grabs. The Julian Alps starts to creep above zero in spring, too  although nights can still get to -1°C.</bullet>\n<bullet>Temperatures really jump on the coast in <b>June</b>, climbing up to a toasty 27°C. The Primorska region  from the Soca Valley down to the Mediterranean coast  is also prone to a wind known as the <i>burja</i> that can whip through at any time of the year.</bullet>\n<bullet>If you want to avoid crowds and higher prices, bypass Lake Bled and Lake Bohinj in <b>July and August</b>. Lake Bled can also be crowded any weekend between May and September. This is also when holidaying Italians and cruise ship hordes push up prices and stress levels in the Primorska region. That said, the water temperature is perfect for a swim and the forests trails are at their greenest.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>September</b> sees the summer crowds creep back from whence they came and the temperatures dip down to a very cyclable and hikable 22°C around Ljubljana.</bullet>\n<bullet>Activity trips start to wind to a halt in <b>October</b>  along with the forest bears, who duck into hibernation. You can catch the last of the small ships cruising down the Adriatic Coast now. <b>November</b> can be foggy and damp, without snowy pleasures to enliven the gloom.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>December to March</b> is the winter season in Slovenia, when most tour operators take the season off  although you might find the occasional photography holiday that aims for the frozen waterfalls and snowy forests.</bullet>\n\n<b>Maria Vrgoc, from our family activity holiday specialists Green World Holidays, says Ljubljana is brilliant for kids in the summer:</b> During summer Ljubljana has its arts and culture festival programme running, so this means there are street performers, live music, the cinema under the stars at the castle and an amazing world food market on Fridays.",

The cows are decorated with wreaths then, accompanied by herders, cheese makers and milkmaids, paraded around Lake Bohinj. Stands sell rural souvenirs and cheesy delights, and you can also have a go at folk dancing, log sawing, horseshoe casting and sling shooting."
