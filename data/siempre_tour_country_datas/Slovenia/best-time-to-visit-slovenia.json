    "Main_Paragraph": "The best time to visit Slovenia is different for everyone. The alpine northwest sees abundant snow from December to March, while warm, dry conditions from May to September are ideal for climbing, hiking, cycling and adventure sports. Snowmelt makes white water rafting a great option by late May. The Adriatic coast and its inland Primorska region have very warm summers, autumn colour and pleasantly cool winters. The remainder of the country sees hot, dry summers and bitter winters. Many attractions  including Ljubljana  are  enjoyable year-round.",

    "when_to_go_html": "<bullet>Activity season starts in late spring  around <b>May</b>. Mild, sunny weather means hiking, cycling and kayaking are all up for grabs. The Julian Alps starts to creep above zero in spring, too  although nights can still get to -1°C.</bullet>\n<bullet>Temperatures really jump on the coast in <b>June</b>, climbing up to a toasty 27°C. The Primorska region  from the Soca Valley down to the Mediterranean coast  is also prone to a wind known as the <i>burja</i> that can whip through at any time of the year.</bullet>\n<bullet>If you want to avoid crowds and higher prices, bypass Lake Bled and Lake Bohinj in <b>July and August</b>. Lake Bled can also be crowded any weekend between May and September. This is also when holidaying Italians and cruise ship hordes push up prices and stress levels in the Primorska region. That said, the water temperature is perfect for a swim and the forests trails are at their greenest.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>September</b> sees the summer crowds creep back from whence they came and the temperatures dip down to a very cyclable and hikable 22°C around Ljubljana.</bullet>\n<bullet>Activity trips start to wind to a halt in <b>October</b>  along with the forest bears, who duck into hibernation. You can catch the last of the small ships cruising down the Adriatic Coast now. <b>November</b> can be foggy and damp, without snowy pleasures to enliven the gloom.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>December to March</b> is the winter season in Slovenia, when most tour operators take the season off  although you might find the occasional photography holiday that aims for the frozen waterfalls and snowy forests.</bullet>\n\n<b>Maria Vrgoc, from our family activity holiday specialists Green World Holidays, says Ljubljana is brilliant for kids in the summer:</b> During summer Ljubljana has its arts and culture festival programme running, so this means there are street performers, live music, the cinema under the stars at the castle and an amazing world food market on Fridays.",

    "paragraph2": "This quirky festival on the third Sunday of September marks a winter return of cattle to the alpine Bohinj valley from their summer pastures. The cows are decorated with wreaths then, accompanied by herders, cheese makers and milkmaids, paraded around Lake Bohinj. Stands sell rural souvenirs and cheesy delights, and you can also have a go at folk dancing, log sawing, horseshoe casting and sling shooting."
