    "Main_Paragraph": "Leave the rains to fill those vast rivers, and keep the wetlands, well, wet, between October and March. Rainfall is heaviest on the coast during this season, although the inland mountainous regions can get rain all year round. Both seasons bring serious heat, topping 30°C in the dry season but rarely dipping below the high 20s all year. The shoulder season of September and October is a great time, as you will catch less rain, have fewer people around, but you will also catch the humpback whales which visit between July and October.",

So as long as you bring some small denomination notes you can get by without Meticais. Officially you can get a visa on arrival at most ports in Mozambique  however, we do not advise it. There have been a few cases where this has been denied so we now recommend you get this before you arrive.",
