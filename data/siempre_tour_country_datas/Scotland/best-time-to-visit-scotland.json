    "Main_Paragraph": "The best time to visit Scotland is during the summer, between May and September.\nThe weather is milder and sunnier, making it ideal for walking in the Highlands, cycling or small ship cruising off the west coast. Scotlands wildlife, including whales and dolphins around the Hebrides, is also very active in the summer months. Spring and autumn shouldnt be discounted, however, with gorgeous colours in the vegetation and fewer crowds in popular places such as the Cairngorms. Midges are also less of an issue in the shoulder season. Winter too has its charms, with the prospect of hiking across pristine snowy landscapes.",

Many parts of the Highlands and mountainous areas are blanketed in thick snow, for winter hikes led by expert local guides and wildlife watching, with red deer particularly visible against the snow. Burns Night on 25 January celebrates Robert Burns, the national bard, with readings of his poetry accompanied by haggis and whisky. Keep your eyes open when leaving pubs in the far north for the Northern Lights.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Wildlife watching against the snow</li>\n<li>Snowdrop Festival</li>\n<li>Winter walking in the Cairngorms</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\nThe rugby Six Nations Championship gets underway in February, Scotland being cheered on in pubs and homes across the nation. But you can also partake in sports yourself whether its cross country skiing, snowshoeing or learning how to dig a snow hole in the Cairngorms. Wrapped up warm in southern Scotland, wildlife aficionados can see migratory ducks, geese and swans sheltering from Greenlands harsher winter. Scotland in February also sees the lovely Snowdrop Festival taking place. One of the best places to see them in bloom is at Edinburghs Royal Botanic Garden. <br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Often dry and sunny</li>\n<li>Six Nations in full swing</li>\n<li>Hebrides ferry schedules reopen</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\nMarch in Scotland sees the snow beginning to melt away at lower altitudes. This month generally sees ferry timetables around the Hebrides and Orkney returning to normality as well. The Six Nations rugby championship is underway, with pubs packed when Scotland are playing. Weather-wise, it can be surprisingly dry and sunny. Its a good time to visit Glasgow, which is in festival mode in March, celebrating everything from film to comedy and country music.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Early bird cruising in the Hebrides</li>\n<li>Spring rail tours</li>\n<li>Beltane Fire Festival</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\nIntrepid hikers and cyclists risking the weather will delight at the number of lambs jumping around the fields in April. Meanwhile, the winter sport season draws to a close, with ski areas closing. April in Scotland is the start of the small ship cruising season, but its also a good time to see the Highlands by rail; the spring foliage through the windows is glorious. Gaelic arts and rituals are honoured at the Beltane Fire Festival, which celebrates the fertility of the land.<div style=\"margin-top: 15px;\"></div>\n<bullet><b>April is great for a</b> <a href=\"/holiday/12269/scotland-by-railway-holiday\">Scotland railway holiday</a></bullet><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Small ship cruising</li>\n<li>Whisky tastings</li>\n<li>Highland Games begin</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\nMay in Scotland is Whisky Month. As the Scots celebrate the water of life, you will find many distilleries offering special tasting sessions. May is also the month when small ship cruising around the islands off the west coast in search of marine wildlife begins in earnest  and when midges become a bit of a hassle, especially close to water at dusk. And if youve ever wanted to see a caber being tossed by a chap in a kilt, nows your chance, with Highland Games taking place from May to September. <div style=\"margin-top: 15px;\"></div>\n<bullet><b>May is great for a</b> <a href=\"/holiday/12265/wildlife-holiday-in-isle-of-mull-scotland\">wildlife holiday on Mull</a></bullet><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Dolphins off the west coast and islands</li>\n<li>Ideal walking and cycling weather</li>\n<li>Lovely time for travelling by rail</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\nJune can be the best time of year to visit Scotland for outdoors-lovers. Hikers and cyclists are flocking to Highland trails and there are crowds in Edinburgh, but its not quite peak season yet. The Scottish weather is generally warm and clement (though we recommend packing for all seasons because its so changeable). June in Scotland is one of the best months for wildlife watching too, especially for dolphins which can be seen both from land and cruises.\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Orcas and seals</li>\n<li>Head to quieter Outer Hebrides islands </li>\n<li>Deer stalking season</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\nDeer stalking season (hunting on foot) is from 1 July to 20 October, with a hind season until 15 February  meaning large swathes of the countryside are unsuitable for walkers. <a href=\"https://www.outdooraccess-scotland.scot/practical-guide-all/deer-management/heading-scottish-hills\" target=\"_blank\">Heading for the Scottish Hills</a> is invaluable for keeping you up to date on which estates to avoid and when. July in Scotland means the Inner Hebrides are getting busy, but you can still find peace and quiet with more far-flung cruises to the Outer Hebrides. Orcas (killer whales) are sometimes seen in Shetlands waters in July, while common seals give birth to pups around this time of year.<div style=\"margin-top: 15px;\"></div>\n<bullet><b>July is great for</b> <a href=\"/holiday/20076/st-kilda-outer-hebrides-cruise-scotland\">cruising the Outer Hebrides</a></bullet><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Edinburgh festivals</li>\n<li>Peak wildlife watching season</li>\n<li>Great weather for island hopping</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\nThe legendary Edinburgh International and Fringe festivals take over the Scottish capital in August, as well as the Royal Military Tattoo. For a more chilled out Edinburgh, go later in the year. August in Scotland, out in the countryside, the wildlife is at its most active, with hides and specialist guides helping you track deer, red squirrels, pine martens and eagles. Offshore, meanwhile, small ship cruises deliver magnificent rewards when it comes to sightings of dolphins, whales, seals and seabirds.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Mild weather, ideal for walking</li>\n<li>Last chance for dolphin watching</li>\n<li>Highland Games finish with Braemar Gathering</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\nDespite this traditionally being the wettest month of the year, September in Scotland can be a fantastic time for walking, as even the most popular trails are far less busy, while the weather is still warm and there is a great deal of wildlife about. Its the end of peak season, which means dolphins are waving goodbye (not literally) for the winter and the Braemar Gathering, one of the last and most popular Highland Games events, takes place.<div style=\"margin-top: 15px;\"></div>\n<bullet><b>September is great for a</b> <a href=\"/holiday/15620/orkney-and-shetland-self-drive-holiday-scotland\">self drive holiday in Orkney</a></bullet><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Autumnal colours</li>\n<li>Great food and drink</li>\n<li>End of small ship cruising season</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\nFoodies love October in Scotland. Seafood is superb, from lobster and langoustines to monkfish and mussels. And the game is on, with wild duck, grouse and pheasant very much flight to fork. If you want to travel to the Scottish islands between October and March, check the ferry timetables as a lot of them slow down to a stop during months out of the main tourist season. Walkers risking the changeable weather will nevertheless relish the glorious golds, reds and yellows in the foliage.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Early snows in mountains and Highlands</li>\n<li>St. Andrews Day</li>\n<li>Many tourism businesses shut</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\nScottish tourism is seasonal in many places, with some hotels and restaurants, and some popular visitor attractions, closing for the winter, usually around late October or November to Easter. This mostly affects the islands, however, and during November in Scotland most of the mainland, including the Cairngorms National Park, remains open for business. Scots celebrate their patron saint, Saint Andrew, on 30 November  another excuse to raise a few drams of whisky.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Winter activity season starts</li>\n<li>Christmas markets</li>\n<li>Hogmanay</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\nHogmanay  or New Year  is a countrywide festival with community ceilidhs, music and whisky flowing throughout the night on 31 December, with a truly Scottish Auld Lang Syne to see you into January. Ski lifts start up (dependent on snowfall) from December in Scotland, but wed recommend more eco-friendly winter activities such as hiking or cross country skiing. Scotlands Christmas markets are delightful  an opportunity to find handmade arts and crafts like handmade knits or tartan scarves for stocking fillers.",
