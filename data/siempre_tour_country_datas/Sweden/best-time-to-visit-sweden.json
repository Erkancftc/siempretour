    "Main_Paragraph": "Winter and summer both count as the best time to visit Sweden! January and February offer winter wonders: stalking wolves and aurora in the north plus Sami festivals; skating frozen lakes in the south. June to August brings long warm sunny days for exploring islands and lakes, or scoffing seafood in ravishing coastal villages. October offers autumn colour and a dramatic thinning of crowds, while December is a season of celebratory hot spiced wine and cosy candle-lit interiors.",

To experience snowy landscapes, Northern Lights and Sami culture, I would go in \"Spring-Winter\", which is basically February-April when the light has returned to Sapmi (Lapland).”",

Mass consumption of pickled herring with potatoes and sour cream  lessens the next day national hangover. Note many museums and tourist facilities close for the day."
