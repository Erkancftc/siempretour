        "Main_Paragraph": "Known as the ‘Roof of the World’, Tibet is home to towering mountains, stunning scenery and a warm and welcoming people. Bound by Buddhism, it has been occupied by China since 1949 and is a country besieged by change. Much of traditional Tibet – its territory, its architecture, and, crucially, its people – has been suppressed and subjugated. By backing tourism on our Tibet holidays you can show your support for the nation. Whether you’re exploring the awe-inspiring scale of the fragile and important Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, or heading up to Everest Base Camp, our Tibet tours support local Tibetan people. Visiting villages and taking cooking classes is a great way to support a Tibetan family. As is our use of Tibetan businesses, including guest houses – and even homestays, plus restaurants, and local guides and drivers.",

        "Title1": "Visit Lhasas monasteries & palaces",
        "Paragraph1": "At 3,490m, Lhasa is one of the highest cities on earth  but this has not deterred its inhabitants from constructing some of the worlds most astounding religious buildings here. The most famous of all is Potala Palace, the stunning former residence of the Dalai Lamas since the 7th century. Sat atop a hill in the middle of the city, this red and white palace dominates the landscape and its rammed earth walls contain over 1,000 rooms.",

        "Title2": "",
        "Paragraph2": "5km west of Lhasa, Drepung Monastery is the largest in Tibet; in its heyday it housed some 10,000 monks. Drepung was founded in 1416 and its name means collecting rice  a reference to the appearance of this sprawling white building from afar. There are grand entrances, colourful hallways, statues of Buddha and impressive woodcarvings. The second largest monastery in Tibet is Sera, built in 1419. Covering over 11 hectares, Sera lies in Lhasas northern suburbs and contains many statues, scriptures written in gold, and beautiful murals. You can join the monks debates from 3pm each Monday-Friday, in which they discuss Buddhist doctrines in order to reach deeper understanding. You might not comprehend a word  but the traditional spectacle is enlightening in itself. As if that wasnt enough, Lhasa is also home to Norbulingka  the Dalai Lamas summer palace, and Jokhang  Tibets oldest and most sacred temple.",
        "image2": "",
        "Title3": "Marvel at Everests might",
        "Paragraph3": "Tibets Everest Base Camp approaches the mountain from its north slope, and, unlike its Nepalese equivalent, this route is usually carried out in a vehicle  making it much more accessible, despite its 5,150m altitude. Youll have sweeping views of Mount Everest from base camp, as well as from the nearby Rongbuk Monastery, founded in 1902. Rongbuks monks and nuns, and the meditation caves punctuating the surrounding cliff faces, somehow make this incredible encounter even more spiritual and stirring.",
        "Title4": "Combine countries",
        "Paragraph4": "Two weeks in the Himalayas is enough to cross borders, exploring these three neighbouring countries: Tibet, Nepal and Bhutan, with shared cultures but very different backgrounds, politics and beliefs. Buddhist rituals, extraordinary palaces, temples and monasteries, Gross National Happiness, struggles for freedom and a constant backdrop of snowcapped peaks ensure that this type of holiday will be as enlightening as it is memorable.",
        "image3": "",
        "Title5": "",
        "Paragraph5": "Alternatively, take the train to Lhasa from Beijing, with a 32-hour stretch from Xian on the highest railway in the world  the sky train  introducing you to some of the Earths most dramatic landscapes outside your window. Its also a great way to acclimatise gently!"

        "Main_Paragraph": "Sat up on the worlds highest and largest plateau, Tibet is dry much of the year round as the mountains catch most of the rainfall. It can get very cold and dry though, especially during winter (November  March). May  October is considered the best time to visit Tibet, when the weather is warmer (above 10°C) and the ice has melted, unblocking roads out of the cities. September  October is the ideal time to trek, and rich autumnal colours make for fantastic photos  if you want to get a clear, cloud-free view of Mount Everest, travel then, or during April and May.",

Travelling at the beginning of this season allows you to enjoy snow outside of Lhasa without too much disruption. Towards the end, autumn foliage colours the landscapes, and harvest festivals are held in October.\r\n</bullet>\n<bullet>Winter in Tibet certainly has its charms, with snowy scenes and lower prices proving a draw for many. But in December, January and February, <b>the mountains and trekking routes are inaccessible, and many roads may be blocked as well.</b>\n</bullet>\n<bullet><b>You can still visit Lhasa in winter</b>. Days will be dry and bright but cold  with wind chill making it feel even chillier. Nights plummet below freezing from November to February.\r\n</bullet>\n<bullet>There are plenty of festivals in Tibet, one of the biggest being <b>Losar  or Tibetan New Year</b>. This takes place in either February or March, and is celebrated for 15 days  with the first three being the most important. However, the Chinese government periodically restricts the issue of visas during Losar  so do check if they are available before planning your trip at this time.\r\n</bullet>\n<bullet>If youre heading to Everest Base Camp, <b>April, May and early June as well as late September to early December tend to promise the clearest views across to Mount Everest</b>. July and August can be overcast, leaving the mighty mountain shrouded in cloud.</bullet>",

The event begins with the unfurling of a giant, 500m<sup>2</sup> thangka painting in Drepung Monastery and commemorates the yogurt that was brought to the devout monks by the Tibetan people. The monks would spend many weeks in the monasteries during the summer to avoid stepping on and killing insects outside; not killing any living being is one of the five precepts of Buddhism."
