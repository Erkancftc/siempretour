    "Main_Paragraph": "Summer and winter are extreme in Kazakhstan, with the most intense heat and cold found in the central steppe and around the capital, Astana. In Jun-Aug, temperatures can soar over 40°C, plunging to -20°C in Dec-Feb. The southern regions, around pleasant Almaty, are generally more hospitable, while the Altai Mountains receive the heaviest rainfall. The best time to go to Kazakhstan is in Apr-May or Sep-Oct, between scorching heat and heavy snow.",

    "paragraph3": "There are always plenty of opportunities to meet and interact with local people but the most authentic experiences will be away from big cities like Almaty and Astana. There are still villages of Old Believers in Kazakhstan which is an opportunity to see quite a traditional way of life, and in some parts nomadic families live, although these tend to be fairly remote.",
    "title4": "Keeping an open mind",
    "paragraph4": "Dont expect everything to go as planned. It doesnt have the infrastructure or experience with tourism as somewhere like Uzbekistan. This can throw up a few surprises and frustrations, so be patient, flexible and adaptable. Its a great destination for adventurous sorts who like the outdoors and great scenery, dont expect luxury, and are looking to explore perhaps the least known stan.",
    "title5": "Landscapes & launch sites",
    "paragraph5": "Theres a lot to surprise people about Kazakhstan, from the stark and desolate beauty of the Ust Urt plateau in the west to the Altai Mountains in the north east  its not all endless steppe. The Cosmodrome at Baikonur is fairly unique - a fully functional space launch site"
