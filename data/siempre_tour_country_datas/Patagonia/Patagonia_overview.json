    "Main_Title": "Our Patagonia holidays & tours",
    "Main_Paragraph": "With landscapes composed of volcanoes, glaciers and ice fields, Patagonia is to be savoured, not rushed. With our small group tours and tailor made holidays you can explore this epic wilderness, which is shared by Argentina and Chile. Our local guides can enlighten walkers with their knowledge of the region’s flora and fauna. You’ll also find out about the impact of climate change on these fragile ecosystems and how park entrance fees aid their conservation. You’ll get a feel for Patagonian culture and traditional hospitality too, with warm welcomes at our selection of family-owned lodges and gaucho ranches.",
    "Subtitle": "About our Patagonia holidays",
    "Title1": "Wilderness experiences",
    "Paragraph1": "For all its dramatic highlights – and the scenery here really is extraordinary – at its heart, Patagonia is actually very empty. Mountain ranges cast vast rain shadows, and wildlife is shy and hard to spot among the echoing valleys and wind-blighted pampas. On the Argentine side, there are swathes of estancia-dotted ranching territory, whilst in Chile, thousands of islands exist untroubled by visitors. You can visit on hut to hut hikes between simple refugios, or on our really epic fly drive holidays, spotting high-soaring condors through the sun roof. Our holidays visit remote communities who benefit hugely from tourism income.",

    "Title2": "Torres del Paine",
    "Paragraph2": "The sight of rose-hued sunlight striking the three granite towers of Torres del Paine is reserved for those who get up early. On our walking holidays you can hike to Mirador Base las Torres to catch the sunrise; it’s just one of the scenic marvels in this Chilean national park, which also hosts Lago Grey, Grey Glacier and the tri-spiked crown of Cuernos del Paine. Our walking holidays along the famous W trek, a five-day hike, are fuelled by local provisions from Puerto Natales, a small town just before the beautiful wilderness.",

    "Title3": "Los Glaciares National Park",
    "Paragraph3": "Los Glaciares National Park is aptly named, home to 40 glaciers that cling to the side of its mountains like diamonds sticking out of bedrock. The most famous is Glacier Perito Moreno, a wall of ice that calves into the water beneath to the stunned murmurs of the assembled crowd. Reach it from the town of El Calafate, where our trips encourage you to explore and support local businesses. A little further north is the town of El Chalten, gateway to the Fitz Roy Range, a series of granite fingers with frozen lakes in the palms of their hands.",
    "Title4": "Family holidays in Patagonia",
    "Paragraph4": "Our family holidays show that Patagonia is a safe and friendly destination, but the big distances present a challenge. To minimise the amount of walking, on our tours you can cross the Patagonia steppe in a 4WD vehicle, and little ones will love looking out for cuddly alpaca-like guanaco on the way. Young children won’t get much out of Patagonia’s long hikes, but adventurous teenagers will be able to appreciate the brooding peaks. Children can even walk on Glacier Perito Moreno in a set of kiddie-sized crampons on our holidays, and in doing so, learn about the importance of protecting them.",

    "Title5": "Types of tours & holidays in Patagonia",
    "Paragraph5": "Patagonia is synonymous with\nadventure holidays\n. Skirt glaciers on boat trips, scramble up scree-littered slopes to reach windswept viewpoints, and just relish the sheer remoteness of it all. A hiking fanatic could live in Patagonia for years and still never complete more than a small portion of its walks – there are just too many – but one of our\nwalking holidays\nis a good start. Torres del Paine is a great place for long distance trails, but there are also plenty of day walks. Our\nsmall group tours\nare led by fantastic local guides and feature homestays and home-cooked, low-carbon-footprint food."
