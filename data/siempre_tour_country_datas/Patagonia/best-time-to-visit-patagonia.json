    "Main_Paragraph": "November to March\nis the best time to visit Patagonia, with warmth and longer days on both the Chile and Argentina sides. Southern nights last a scant six hours, although night frosts and sleet can occur in the highlands even in summer. Mid-November to mid-December is less crowded, with spring blooms. April and May are the best months to visit Patagonia for colourful autumn foliage and fewer crowds, with northern regions still retaining some warmth against the milder temperatures of the south. When to go to Patagonia also depends on the region  it is huge and there are great variations all over. Coasts are wetter and milder; the inland steppe is chillier and arid.",

However, this is a massive area and if you dont mind sharing, booking well in advance or getting further off the beaten track there are a great many Patagonia adventures to go round.</bullet>",

The cold encourages them to descend from chilly mountaintops into warmer valleys  which are no longer filled with tourists who might scare them away."
