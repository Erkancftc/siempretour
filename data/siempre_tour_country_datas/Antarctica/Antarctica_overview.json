    "Main_Title": "Our Antarctica holidays & cruises",
    "Main_Paragraph": "Our Antarctica holidays roam the Great White Continent, a vast polar desert exposed to near-constant sunlight in summer, then veiled in darkness for another six months of the year. Its an otherworldly place, as hostile to visitors as it is fascinating. Our Antarctica explorers are made up of wildlife lovers, avid birdwatchers and photographers, but what they all have in common is that they are looking for adventure. Yes, youll sail aboard a comfortable small ship with excellent amenities an expert crew, but its an adventure nonetheless. In fact, wed go so far as to say you dont go on an Antarctica holiday  you go on an expedition.",

    "Title1": "Cruises",
    "Paragraph1": "Although cruise ships carrying up to 500 passengers can land in Antarctica, our holidays only use vessels that carry a maximum of 250. That means they dont overwhelm the communities that they visit, and it also means a better experience for you. Small ships can access narrower channels, reaching more remote areas that much larger ships cannot. And with just 250 or fewer passengers, you wont be queuing up for ages for your daily activities, either. Hop into a Zodiac for a shore excursion to visit a bustling penguin colony, or take to kayaks to paddle around glaciers. And when youre not on land, our Antarctica holidays also entertain with expert lectures from onboard naturalists, geologists and other experienced polar hands.",

    "Title2": "Whales",
    "Paragraph2": "Antarctica is fantastic for whale watching, which is amazing when you consider how many were tragically slaughtered by sailors throughout the 20th century. Although sightings can never be guaranteed, youd be disappointed not to see any whales at all, given that there are seven species in these waters, including blue whales, along with orcas. February and March are prime time for whales, but you can see them right the way through the cruising season. Our holidays in Antarctica are accompanied by onboard experts who can fill you in on what kind of whale youre seeing, what their behaviours mean, and the threats they face, from boat propellers to warming seas.",

    "Title3": "Birdwatching",
    "Paragraph3": "There are no fewer than 18 species of penguin in Antarctica, and watching them waddle around, somehow clumsy and dignified at the same time, is a big highlight of our holidays in the region. Colonies are often roped off so as not to cause the birds any undue stress, but even from a distance the noise and the, er, smell, are staggering. Among the other birdlife youre likely to encounter in Antarctica are albatrosses on South Georgia. They can fly up to 1,000km in a day  or about 1,000km more than a penguin can.\nSouth Georgia is also a safe breeding and nesting spot for many species of petrel, while in the Falkland Islands you can see all of these, plus skuas, flightless steamer ducks, and a number of striated caracara, birds of prey unique to the region. Sadly, bird flu has ravaged many colonies in the region, but Antarctica remains one of the finest places in the world for birdwatching."
