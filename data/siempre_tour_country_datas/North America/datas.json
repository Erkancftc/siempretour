        "Main_Paragraph": "North America is often thought of as fairly homogenous in comparison to other continents  but this is highly misleading. West to east, there are six time zones on the mainland alone (while Hawaii is another two hours behind), and north to south the continent stretches from the polar bear inhabited reaches of the Arctic Circle to the sweltering swamps of the Everglades. In-between are towering mountain ranges, one of the earths hottest deserts, vast forests and Pacific, Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coastlines. In other words, when it comes to working out the best time to go to North America, there is always some time.",

        "paragraph2": "It’s hard to talk about the weather in North America without mentioning the climate crisis. In 2021, North America sweated through its hottest June on record. This “heat dome” triggered Canada’s highest recorded temperature (49.6°C), 180 wildfires and 500 excess deaths in British Columbia alone. Another anomaly: the heatwave effected the Pacific Northwest, a region known for its temperate climate and reliable rainfall. Scientists concluded that climate change accelerated by human activity made the heatwave <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01869-0\" target=\"_blank\">150 times more likely</a>.<br/><br/>\r\nFlooding is even more common and costly. Increasingly intense hurricanes soak the east coast, where low-lying communities like New Orleans are also exposed to rising sea levels and storm surges.<br/><br/>\r\nIt all sounds frighteningly out of our control, but in fact <b>our holiday choices make a difference to how local people cope with and combat the climate crisis.</b> Tourism is often a source of income to the communities most vulnerable to climate change. When people visit, it encourages governments to protect landscapes that might otherwise be used for oil drilling and mining. We’re also big believers that experiencing our amazing world inspires us to take the actions needed to save it. <br/><br/>\r\nWith that in mind, here are our tips for climate-conscious travel in North America.",

You’ll also end up with more insight and some great stories.\nChoose a nature positive trip; perhaps kayaking with orcas in British Columbia or watching the\nsalmon run in Alaska\n.\nVisit the national parks.\nIt’s hard to imagine how quickly glaciers are retreating without witnessing the year markers at the Athabasca Glacier in Jasper National Park, for instance. Seeing these for yourself is a real call to action to do what we can to slow global warming.\nEat locally\nto reduce the need to transport food. Of course, it’s a real hardship in a continent that serves\nchilaquiles\n(cheese tortillas) for breakfast and pecan pies for dessert... Avoiding all-you-can eat buffets reduces food waste, too.\nFly less and stay for longer.\nAvoid internal flights where you can.\nWatch\nour video\non how to curb your carbon.",

        "paragraph5": "Mainly celebrated in Mexico, the <a href=\"/holidays/mexico/travel-guide/day-of-the-dead\">Day of the Dead</a> (31 October-2 November) is a bit of a misnomer. It’s in fact a celebration of life – and it lasts more than a day. Decorated <i>calavera</i> skulls and dance-till-you-drop street parades are part of it, but you’re more likely to be moved by the tiny courtyard altars decorated with offerings for loved ones. Go with a guide to fully understand the mix of indigenous and Catholic traditions at play here. <br/><br/>\r\nGo north for summer solstice festivals (June 21) that squeeze every drop out of almost 24 hours of sunlight. The <b>Summer Solstice Indigenous Festival</b> in Ontario, Canada, brings together local chefs, musicians and dancers, and culminates in a pow-wow. Even further north, concerts, cookouts and late-night trail hiking go on into the eerily light early hours in Alaska. Fairbanks and Anchorage put on the most events, including <b>Downtown Days</b> and the <b>Midnight Sun Baseball Game</b>, which has been played since 1906. <br/><br/>\r\nHead to Hawaii in May for <b>Mele Mei</b>, when the islands are alive with the sound of ukuleles and <i>mele hula</i> chants. To get the most out of this music festival, finish off your holiday with a few extra days on Honolulu, where you can take your pick of surfside grills and cafés hosting live music nights.",

        "paragraph7": "<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<bullet>The USA invented the concept of the national park, so itd rude not to visit several while youre here. Yellowstone and Banff are two of the oldest, but <b>remember the lesser-known national parks</b> too. Kenai Fjords in Alaska and Loreto Bay National Marine Park in Mexico are just as dazzling as the big-hitters. </bullet>\n<bullet>North America brings cetaceans in droves, so its a great place for <b>whale watching</b>. Dolphins, blue whales, sperm whales and orcas come to play along the coastline of Baja California between February and May. Thousands of grey whales glide from Mexico to Alaska every spring. On the Atlantic Coast, whales follow the warm waters from their Florida calving grounds to the Canadian Maritimes. </bullet>\n<bullet><b>Camping</b> is one of the most exciting ways to embrace North America. Snoozing al fresco is practically a religion in the US and Canada, involving campfires and cookouts, and the ubiquitous RV parks. Campsites range from family-friendly (think kids clubs and communal barbecues) to wilderness mountain plateaus for serious hikers. </bullet>\n<bullet><b>Watch out for bears</b> by treading in the quiet (but not too quiet  no one wants to surprise a 300-kilo grizzly) footsteps of expert trackers. Unusually, you can go bear watching by boat in British Columbia; bears rummaging for clams along the shoreline will barely give you a second glance when youre on the water. </bullet>",

In the desert, days might be sizzling, while evenings are freezing, so research what to pack too. Don’t worry – our travel partners are experts in their fields and will advise exactly what you need to explore safely, matching you up with guides and tailored packing lists.\nStick to the mainland.\nVancouver Island – a mere slip on the map of Canada – is a quarter of the size of England; you could easily spend your whole holiday exploring its long surf beaches and first-growth rainforests. A six-hour flight south-west, the 50th US state, Hawaii, has more in common with Polynesia than the mainland.\nGet caught up in national myths.\nThe idea that America was “discovered” by Columbus is the most obvious tale to dismiss. But also cast a critical eye at the mythologised\nConfederacy symbols\nwhen travelling in the American South and delve beyond the triumphant colonial history of Mexican capitals built from the ruins of Mayan cities.
