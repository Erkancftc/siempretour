        "Main_Paragraph": "Roam from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City on our Vietnam holidays – small group trips and tailor made tours that combine effervescent cities with excursions into remote and tranquil countryside, where rice paddies cushion stilt-house villages. Our low-carbon cycling holidays in Vietnam are a popular way to explore, encouraging you to slow down in small rural communities and savour cultural exchanges for which other tours move too quickly. And with over 3,000km of coastline and many near-deserted islands, Vietnam is always a favourite with families too. Got more time at your disposal? We can also help you combine Vietnam with Cambodia, Laos or Thailand, to explore the similarities and contrasts between them.",
        "Subtitle": "About our Vietnam holidays",
        "Title1": "Culture, food, history & beaches",
        "Paragraph1": "Vietnam is an intoxicating country to travel. You can trace the country’s recent journey from colonialism to communism through fading French, Spanish and Portuguese architecture, and the sobering remnants of the war all around you. There are idyllic beaches, especially those just outside Hoi An. Vietnam has over 50 ethnic minority groups, each with their own distinct cultures. Visiting Indigenous communities and sailing to river markets around the Mekong Delta offer many chances for meaningful interactions. And everywhere you go, that healthy, aromatic, inexpensive cuisine: seafood in the north; kicking spices in the centre; delicious comfort food in the south.",
        "image1": "",
        "Title2": "Cultural journeys in Vietnam",
        "Paragraph2": "Rural areas of Vietnam feel a world apart from the hectic cities, with remote communities carrying on peacefully much as they have done for centuries. Many of our Vietnam holidays will include time among Indigenous communities such as the Hmong, often involving some hiking to reach near-inaccessible villages through highlands, rice terraces and forest. In some cases you may be able to overnight in a family’s stilt home. This is a highly recommended chance to learn about rural ways of life through exploring folklore, music and dance, rice farming or weaving, sharing your hosts’ food and, if you’re up to it, their fiery rice whisky.",
        "image2": "",
        "Title3": "Family holidays in Vietnam",
        "Paragraph3": "The Vietnamese are extremely welcoming of children, and while Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City can be overwhelming at times, our family holidays in Vietnam ensure there is plenty of time factored in to relax. From the age of around eight kids should love travel in Vietnam, though they might need to adapt to some challenges, from spicy foods to busy urban areas. But there are also fun rides on cyclos and sampans, enchanting water puppet theatre, and lots of beach resorts where you can decompress for a few days.",
        "Title4": "Cycling holidays in Vietnam",
        "Paragraph4": "Our cycling holidays in Vietnam, including those that cross borders into Laos or Cambodia, are usually small group trips. Since many venture into rural areas where little – if any – English is spoken, our brilliant local guides help with everything from translating menus to explaining the significance of roadside shrines. Trips will often involve early starts and 10 or more days in the saddle covering a lot of ground, so you will want to be decently fit. But cycling through Vietnam is unquestionably one of the best ways to get an authentic take on the culture, often taking you to communities that see very few tourists and thus see great financial benefits from your group’s passing visit.",
        "image3": "",
        "Title5": "Types of tours & holidays in Vietnam",
        "Paragraph5": "Vietnam’s cities can be sensory overload, and you’ll need to negotiate language barriers to visit remote villages. So our small group holidays to Vietnam are popular because you have a fantastic local guide with you throughout – the best way to enjoy both sides of Vietnam.. And in a country where even crossing the street can be dramatic, all holidays are adventure holidays, but some can get a little more exciting still.",
        "Title6": "See Vietnam & Cambodia together",
        "Paragraph6": "Our combined Vietnam and Cambodia holidays make a great deal of sense, not least to save money. It’s fascinating to see how each country’s respective histories and cultures have threaded and diverged, and to explore the differences in pace of life (Vietnam often hectic; Cambodia much more relaxed), and cuisine. And while Vietnam’s historic sites are impressive, nothing prepares you for the scale and majesty of Angkor Wat. You can cross the border by boat, getting to Phnom Penh from the Mekong Delta. These are typically small group trips with set itineraries, and local tour leaders providing cultural insights while ensuring everything runs smoothly."

        "Main_Paragraph": "The humid south of Vietnam is warm year-round and the May-November monsoon season brings brief, heavy showers that rarely disrupt travel  though regions around the Mekong River may flood. The cold monsoon along the central coast occurs from October-April and is much less pleasant. October-December are warm, sunny months in the north, while from March it can get almost unbearably hot. May, June and September are the best times to visit Vietnam to avoid the crowds.",

Its much cooler in the north around Hanoi and Halong Bay than it is further south. In the mountainous far north it can get decidedly chilly in the mornings and evenings, with temperatures as low as 5°C. Tet Nguyen Dan, the Lunar New Year, often falls in January. Hotels fill up for this major celebration, while many restaurants and shops draw their shutters. <br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<ul><bullet>Beach resorts popular</bullet>\n<bullet>Warm, dry conditions in most areas</bullet>\n<bullet>Superb trekking and cycling weather</bullet></ul>\r\nFebruary is a popular month for travel to Vietnam, with warm, dry and sunny weather across much of the country. Vietnam in February is superb for cycling and trekking  sunscreen is essential, as is a warm jacket for evenings. Coastal destinations such as Hoi An and Danang are busy with sunseekers on the beaches. Tet Nguyen Dan (Lunar New Year) can fall in February, meaning hotels book up and many shops and restaurants close for this country-wide celebration.<br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<ul><bullet>Start of peak season</bullet>\n<bullet>South Vietnam heating up</bullet>\n<bullet>Trekking and cycling in north and central Vietnam</bullet></ul>\r\nThe warm, dry weather of Vietnam in March sees the onset of peak season, although it starts to get uncomfortably hot in the south by the end of the month. Beach resorts are very busy, while March is also considered the best month to cruise around the magnificent limestone islands of Halong Bay under clear, rain-free skies. Trekking and cycling in northern and central Vietnam are fantastic at this time of year.<br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<ul><bullet>Beach resorts busy</bullet>\n<bullet>Great for family holidays</bullet>\n<bullet>Spring flowers in mountains</bullet></ul>\r\nWeather-wise, Vietnam in April is idyllic. Trekking in the mountainous north, where spring flowers can still be seen, or cycling in the countryside are the best ways to escape the crowds. Sun worshippers can get their kicks on the coast, although in the south the mercury is creeping up even in the shade. You do get the odd shower as monsoon approaches, but April is a good time to go to Vietnam with the family.<br/><br/>\n<b>April is great for a</b> <a href=\"/holiday/2161/hanoi-to-ho-chi-minh-holiday-in-vietnam\">Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City adventure</a><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<ul><bullet>Peak season drops off</bullet>\n<bullet>Uncomfortably hot in the south</bullet>\n<bullet>Expect occasional afternoon showers</bullet></ul>\r\nWith temperatures in south Vietnam climbing to 40°C at times, you want to be further north, in the mountains, Hanoi or the central coast, in May. Ho Chi Minh City is hot and humid as monsoon season approaches, with short afternoon showers likely. Youll also get the odd burst of rain in northern Vietnam, but the temperatures are much more manageable. Hiking and cycling are still very pleasant in Vietnam in May and you can often snag a bargain with peak season winding down.<br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<ul><bullet>Vietnam monsoon season starts in the south</bullet>\n<bullet>Rain and storms rule out trekking in the north</bullet>\n<bullet>Look to cities and central Vietnam beaches</bullet></ul>\r\nIf youre after a low season bargain, Vietnam in June could be a winner. The steamy south is experiencing short, sharp showers that rarely affect travel too much and can lead to sporadic flooding in some parts of the Mekong Delta. Trekking in northern Vietnam is inadvisable, with heavy rainfall bogging up the trails and the occasional storm in the mountains. In central Vietnam, however, the coast is warm and usually dry  head for Hoi An and Da Nang and bring your beach towel. \r\nVietnams culture is influenced by its past links with China. The lunar calendar is used for most festivals.\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<ul><bullet>Wet at both ends of the country</bullet>\n<bullet>Ideal time to be on the central coast</bullet>\n<bullet>Trekking and cycling ruled out by weather</bullet></ul>\r\nVietnam in July is much the same as it is in June  both the north and south see a lot of rain, as do the central Highlands, so trekking and cycling holidays arent suitable. Its also not unknown for the Mekong Delta to flood. The beaches of the central coast remain idyllic however, reaching 30°C at times. Its very hot and humid, and sometimes heavy downpours mean that some more remote areas become difficult if not impossible to reach. <br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<ul><bullet>Central coast beaches still lovely</bullet>\n<bullet>South is hot with regular showers</bullet>\n<bullet>Peak rainfall in north and central Highlands</bullet></ul>\r\nIn August, the best place to be is Vietnams beautiful central coast. Both Da Nang and Hoi An are still basking in sunny weather. Trekking in remote and mountainous regions is ruled out due to heavy rain, though. In southern Vietnam, while you will still get plenty of showers, its still dry enough to enjoy yourself. Vietnam in August sees Wandering Souls Day take place, with prayers and offerings given for deceased friends and relatives in the hope that those sent to hell will be released. <br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<ul><bullet>Showers and storms on central coast</bullet>\n<bullet>North and south drier by end of the month</bullet>\n<bullet>Mid-Autumn Festival on the full moon</bullet></ul>\r\nVietnam in September means a shoulder month. Its still wet in the north and south, though by the end of September things are drying up. Central Vietnam is a different story altogether: you might squeeze in a beach holiday in early September, but typhoon season is approaching, and as the month goes on the coast and highlands can be battered by rain and storms. The full moon between September and October sees a major harvest festival taking place, with children bearing lanterns in parades and traditional lion dances. <br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<ul><bullet>Rice paddy harvest</bullet>\n<bullet>Trekking and cycling weather returns</bullet>\n<bullet>Wet and stormy in central Vietnam</bullet></ul>\r\nVietnam in October can be lovely in both the north and south, with the rains easing off, warm but not oppressive temperatures, and the next peak season still a way off. Central Vietnam is a no-no, with heavy rains and showers still, but trekking and cycling holidays are popular around this time. In the countryside youll see villagers hard at work bringing the rice harvest in, while the floating markets of the Mekong Delta are flush with produce. <br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<ul><bullet>Ideal month to cruise Halong Bay</bullet>\n<bullet>Beaches in south; trekking in north</bullet>\n<bullet>Central Vietnam still very wet</bullet></ul>\r\nVietnam in November sees the approach of another high season. This month also experiences some of the best weather in Vietnam  hot and dry in both the north and the south. Trekking in the mountainous north around Sapa is very pleasant, while the southern beaches are stunning at this time of year. Clear skies mean that we consider November the best time of year to visit Vietnam if you want to enjoy a day or two cruising around Halong Bay. <br/><br/>\n<b>November is great for a</b> <a href=\"/holiday/11030/vietnam-small-group-cycling-holiday\">small group cycling holiday in Vietnam</a><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<ul><bullet>Rains ease gently in central Vietnam</bullet>\n<bullet>Hot and dry but gradually cooling off</bullet>\n<bullet>Christmas a busy time to travel  book early</bullet></ul>\r\nIt pays to book early for Vietnam in December if you plan to spend the festivities in one of the souths beautiful beach resorts, as this is a popular time to visit, especially around Christmas. Its warm and dry in northern and southern Vietnam, although at higher altitudes its getting distinctly chilly at night. Towards the end of December, the rains slow in central Vietnam but you can still expect some showers.",

This is a very exciting time to visit Vietnam. People clean their homes, cook special dishes and give children lucky money in red envelopes. The festivities last up to a month, including firecrackers, fireworks and masked dances. Youll also see flowers everywhere.",

Pilgrimages to the pagoda take place in either mid-February or mid-March, on the 15th day of the first lunar month, with devotees flocking to light incense and pray for prosperity and romance in the year ahead.
