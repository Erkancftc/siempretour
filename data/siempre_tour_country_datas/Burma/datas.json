        "Main_Paragraph": "The best time to visit Burma, therefore, is during the drier winter months of October to March. It's hot during the daytime, and lowland temperatures remain pleasant at night  although bring much warmer layers for the highlands and hill stations as they are chilly in the evenings. Bagan and Mandalay are the hottest, driest regions  temperatures can peak at over 40°C  but rainfall is still light here in the wetter season, and with more bearable temperatures this is the best time to visit Burma to avoid the winter crowds.",

Its just after the rainy season, the land is very lush and vibrant and temperatures are perfect.\n\nHot air balloon festivals\nEach November, hot air balloons crafted from handmade paper are released into the sky to mark the end of the rainy season and honour Buddhist and Hindu deities. There are competitions for the most elaborately decorated balloons and the best firework display. Taunggyi hosts the largest festival, but there are smaller versions across Shan State.",
