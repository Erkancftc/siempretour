    "Main_Paragraph": "The best time to visit Australia is either\nSeptember to November or March to May\n, though in truth theres never really a bad time  theres always somewhere basking in glorious weather. June to August is very pleasant, though chilly in the evenings. These winter months can be the best time to go to Northern Australia, which is sweltering and humid much of the year. Spring begins in September, with wildflowers blooming across Western Australia, and this season is the best time to travel to Australia for walking. Our month-by-month guide outlines when to visit Tasmania, the Great Barrier Reef and Queensland for ideal weather.",

    "when_to_go_html": "<bullet><b>January and February are hot and humid</b> in northern Australia so head to Tasmania, Perth or Melbourne for a much more comfortable climate. School holidays, Australia Day and Chinese New Year all mean time off for Australians so public parks and beaches will much be busier in January. \r\n</bullet>\n<bullet>After the <b>tropical rains die down in March</b>, the north is at its most luscious, with rainforests in Queensland alive with colour and places like Kakadu National Park featuring vibrant wetlands, bulging rivers and tumultuous waterfalls.\r\n</bullet>\n<bullet>\n<b>March is also the start of whale watching season</b> off the Victoria coast with Adelaide, Kangaroo Island and Barossa Valley all great locations to visit. \r\n</bullet>\n<bullet>\r\nAlthough <b>temperatures are starting to drop during April and May</b> it's hardly noticeable for visitors from the Northern Hemisphere with whales still appearing off Victoria while the east coast, either side of Brisbane, tends to be dry, clear and sunny.\r\n</bullet>\n<bullet><b>Autumn is in full swing during June and July</b> with Sydney's parks and nearby wine regions, such as Hunter Valley, ablaze with fiery foliage.\r\n</bullet>\n<bullet><b>The decreasing temperatures make this the best time to visit Australia's Northern Territory</b> with Uluru, Nitmiluk National Park and Darwin all much more comfortable over the winter months. Winter is also the best time to visit the Great Barrier Reef for clearer water and milder currents, and whales make the journey north from New South Wales into Queensland.\r\n</bullet>\n<bullet><b>The best time to visit Western Australia is in August and September</b> as wild flowers appear across the countryside around Perth as spring kicks into gear. Spring is also a great to visit Sydney and the Blue Mountains as temperatures are creeping up but hiking is still pleasant before the warmer months of October and November.\r\n</bullet>\n<bullet><b>November is notorious for schoolies on the Gold Coast</b> so avoid New South Wales and head south to South Australia or Tasmania, especially before things really start to get busy during December.</bullet>",

    "paragraph2": "The Great Barrier Reef is well worth a visit all year round, though the rainy season, Jan  March, can get very hot, with a few more 'stingers', and water visibility won't be as clear due to run off from the rivers. After the rains have passed, during April and May, conditions are more comfortable and water clarity is at its best, ideal for snorkelling. The calmest seas follow in June to November to coincide with the arrival of humpback whales which migrate from Antarctica to give birth from May to September where they give birth.",
