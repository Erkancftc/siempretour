    "Main_Title": "Our El Salvador holidays & tours",
    "Main_Paragraph": "Our El Salvador holidays explore a tiny country with a huge history, and one that remains very much tourist-free. That means that youll have stunning destinations such as Bosque El Imposible National Park or Montecristo Cloud Forest almost to yourself. The volcanic region of San Miguel is only beginning to erupt with ecotourism, while the Mayan sites of Tazumal, San Andrés and Joya de Cerén still feel timeless. Visit the tiny rainforest community of La Cinqera and your guide may be a former guerilla who fought in the countrys civil war and is now part of a fledgling tourism initiative here. And the La Ruta de Las Flores trail through colonial towns and coffee plantations continues to be a wonderful way to support local artisans, with the craft shops and food markets here a highlight of many tours.",

    "Title1": "",
    "Paragraph1": "Little El Salvador is surprisingly packed with colonial, cultural and coastal treats; there is more than enough here to keep you busy for a couple of weeks, especially as the laid back vibe means that hours easily drift into days. It is possible to spend a week or two here exclusively, but many holidays combine the country with Honduras, or as part of longer Central American overland tours, crossing over from Guatemala or Honduras. El Salvadors compact size means that in just a few days you can visit colonial towns, volcanoes and wildlife-rich coast, with the Ruta de las Flores providing an excellent tour-within-a-tour which can be completed in a day. Long drives are, happily, minimised, and the proximity of many attractions means you can often spend two or three nights based in one town.",

    "Title2": "1. Jiquilisco Bay",
    "Paragraph2": "This network of mangroves, islets and natural canals is El Salvadors most important marine ecosystem, hosting a huge number of native birds and reptiles, as well as endangered hawksbill turtles, which nest here from May to September. Kayak though the mangroves, hike through the forest, learn about turtle conservation projects or visit a nearby cocoa plantation to learn how chocolate is made.",

    "Title3": "2. Joya de Cerén",
    "Paragraph3": "In 600AD, the Laguna Caldera volcano erupted, burying a nearby farming community. Today, the site is known  unsurprisingly  as the Pompeii of the Americas. Unlike Pompeii, however, it seems that all inhabitants escaped. This is the best preserved example of pre-Hispanic life in the region, as homes, a sauna, agricultural tools, religious items, sleeping mats and even fields have been found virtually intact.",
    "Title4": "3. Ruta de las Flores",
    "Paragraph4": "The pretty name is somewhat misleading, as the real gems along this 36km route are not the flora, but the many colourful artisan villages. If you can, visit at the weekend, when the markets and plazas really come alive with traders and food festivals. This is also prime coffee country, so you can visit a plantation en route, and learn how to harvest and roast the beans. Dont miss the museums, churches and craft galleries.",
    "image3": "",
    "Title5": "4. Ruta de la Paz",
    "Paragraph5": "To learn more about El Salvadors more recent  and tragic  history, head to the Ruta de la Paz  the Route of Peace. The Museum of the Revolution tells the story of the civil war, while a scenic hike up Cerro Pericón traverses landscapes that were once guerrilla strongholds. The village of El Mozote was the scene of one of the wars bloodiest massacres; today, residents do their best to spread messages of peace to visitors.",
    "Title6": "5. San Salvador",
    "Paragraph6": "While many Central American capitals are best whizzed through, this 500-year-old city is chaotic but surprisingly attractive, with plenty of trees and an impressive cathedral overlooking the main plaza. Walking tours reveal a jumble of architectural styles, as San Salvador was rebuilt several times following historic earthquakes. Visit the national palace, the excellent museums and buzzing marketplaces.",
    "Title7": "6. Suchitoto",
    "Paragraph7": "Suchitoto was at the centre of a thriving indigo trade during colonial times, and you can still visit a functioning workshop today. Wander through its cobbled streets with pretty, painted houses, learn to prepare the national dish of\npupusas\n, visit the galleries and laid back cafes, or head to the adjacent Lake Suchitlan where you can kayak and look out for the migratory birdlife, particularly birds of prey.",
    "Title8": "7. Tazumal",
    "Paragraph8": "Tazumal was once a thriving Mayan city, which was abandoned some eight centuries ago. In its heyday its trade and cultural networks reached as far as Copan in Honduras and Chichén Itzá in Mexico. The most important structures are two large pyramids, and artifacts recovered from the site can be seen in the onsite museum as well as in San Salvadors Museum of Anthropology."
