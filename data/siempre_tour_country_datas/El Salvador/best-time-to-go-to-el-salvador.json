    "Main_Paragraph": "El verano\n summer  in El Salvador is from Nov-Mar. This is the best time to go to El Salvador, as its the driest time, and youll avoid the worst of the heat in March and April, before the rains hit in May, lasting through to Oct. However, overall the temperatures vary little throughout the year; and youll find greater shifts in heat depending on the altitude than the season. The coast and lowlands are consistently hot, while the mountains are much cooler, with the highest regions sometimes dropping almost to freezing.",

    "when_to_go_html": "<bullet>In <b>December </b>, the weather is dry, but the landscapes are still lush and green following the recent rains. However, this is peak season in El Salvador; book well in advance and expect higher prices. December is also the coolest month; expect near freezing temperatures overnight if staying in the mountains. </bullet>\n<bullet> <b>March </b> and <b>April </b>, too, are particularly busy months thanks to Easter holy week, or Semana Santa. Expect international tourists as well as plenty of holidaying Salvadorians; book well in advance. </bullet>\n<bullet> <b>January </b> to <b>February </b> promise sunny days, lower humidity and slightly cooler temperatures. They still fall within peak season, but without the peak crowds of Christmas and Easter. Remember, though, that this is the tropics; sudden downpours can occur at any time, so come prepared. </bullet>\n<bullet>The end of <b>November </b> is also a great time to visit El Salvador, as its much quieter  and without peak season prices  but the rains have eased off. </bullet>\n<bullet>By late <b>April </b> into <b>May </b>, things start hotting up  and the rainy season arrives. The downpours last through to early <b>November </b>, and some national parks, such as Montecristo, may close at this time. </bullet>\n<bullet> <b>June </b>, <b>July </b> and <b>August </b> are very wet, with precipitation peaking in September. Hurricanes are very rare, as the country is on Central Americas Pacific coast, rather than the Caribbean. Confusingly, Salvadorians refer to this hot, wet season as <i>invierno</i>  winter. <i>Verano </i> summer  is from <b>November </b> to <b>April </b>. </bullet>\n<bullet> <b>August</b>  is particularly busy in El Salvador despite the rains, as some of the biggest festivals take place during this month.  These include Fiestas Agostinas in San Salvador, with parades, marching bands and food stalls, as well as the Balls of Fire festival in Nejapa, during which fire throwers commemorate the eruption of a nearby volcano  with quite alarming results. </bullet>\n<bullet>Sea turtles nest from <b>May </b> to <b>September</b>, with the hatchlings emerging around eight weeks later. The idyllic Jiquilisco Bay is one of the best areas to witness them on the beach. </bullet>",

    "paragraph2": "El Salvador has much fewer safety concerns than Honduras, for example, and loads of really cool things to do. In such a small country, theres plenty to see and its easy to travel around  it has volcanoes, beaches (great surfing and diving), nesting turtles, jungles, waterfalls, small time charm and delicious food. They have their own weird version of Pompeii  the Joya de Cerén, just outside San Salvador. It was a small town, and about 565AD a volcano eruption covered the entire town in ash and essentially buried and preserved it. It was only rediscovered in 1978.",
    "title3": "Tips on visiting Suchitoto",
    "paragraph3": "Suchitoto is a small sleepy place with very friendly and welcoming locals. It has great colonial architecture and a sort of sleepy vibe, so its a great place to chill out. Its on the shore of Lake Suchitlán which is really cool  we did a boat trip and saw sloths, monkeys and iguanas, as well as loads of birds.",
    "title4": "Why join a small group tour?",
    "paragraph4": "Were with the driver and Central American tour leader, and we have made links with local excursion providers so that we know who to use in each location. Border crossings can be a bit of a nightmare in many countries, sometimes quite intimidating and always long and laborious. This is much easier if youre travelling with a tour leader so that you dont have to think about it!",
    "title5": "What to eat in El Salvador",
    "paragraph5": "El Salvador is famous for\npupusas\n, which are not found anywhere else in Central America! They are classic tortillas, but stuffed with a mix of cheese, mince meat, veg (carrots and cabbage mainly) and spicy sauce. You see them on the streets everywhere, with ladies doing a sort of clapping motion  theyve stuffed the dough, and then clap to flatten it out before putting it on the hot plate. Really good. Otherwise the food is pretty classic Central American fare: tortillas, rice, beans, lots of seafood on the coast, pork and chicken too. Its all really fresh and tasty."
