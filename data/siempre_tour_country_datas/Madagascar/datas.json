        "Main_Title": "Our Madagascar holidays & tours",
        "Main_Paragraph": "Our small group and tailor made holidays in Madagascar reveal the natural beauty of this huge island off Africa, with many species of wildlife found nowhere else. You’ll tour national parks in search of lemurs with expert local guides, who work with the surrounding communities to protect often fragile habitats. Your guide’s knowledge also comes in handy when visiting remote villages and trying to understand complex cultural beliefs such as fady, which result from Madagascar’s unique and diverse heritage. Adventurous families will love it here too, especially when you combine your wildlife watching with a few days on the beach.",
        "Subtitle": "About our Madagascar holidays",
        "Title1": "Lemurs & other wildlife",
        "Paragraph1": "Lemurs are the characterful icons of Madagascar, with many species critically endangered. From the ring-taileds and singing indri to miniscule mouse lemurs and dancing sifaka, our holidays explore the best places to see lemurs in Madagascar. Madagascar was an isolated island for around 70 million years, so around 70 percent of the fauna is endemic, including the panther chameleon, blue coua, mongoose-like fossa, and the intriguingly named satanic leaf-tailed gecko. Sadly, much of Madagascar’s precious wildlife is at risk due to rampant deforestation – our holidays help counter this by providing income through wildlife tourism.",
        "image1": "",
        "Title2": "Walking holidays in Madagascar",
        "Paragraph2": "Uncontrolled deforestation is a serious threat in Madagascar, and our walking holidays help to prove that forests have an economic value besides vanilla farming or charcoal. These adventures explore the rarely trod paths of the south-central and eastern corner of the island. Expect limestone massifs, lunar-like national parks, and rare intact tracts of rainforest that shelter hundreds of endemic species. No need to worry about finding your way, either – you’ll be accompanied by a local guide who can navigate unmapped trails with ease.",
        "image2": "",
        "Title3": "National parks in Madagascar",
        "Paragraph3": "Madagascar’s boasts some 25 national parks, and they are like little arks – wildlife rescue boats moored on an island where around 90 percent of the forest has been destroyed. They display varied landscapes: the toothy massif of Andringitra National Park, the waterfalls and canyons of Isalo National Park, and the green hills and cloud forest in Ranomafana. On our holidays your park entrance fees directly contribute to conservation efforts, and at times specific community projects. Visiting Ranomafana, for instance, you’ll spend an evening in a guest house that provides training and support for agriculture, healthcare and female empowerment projects.",
        "Title4": "Culture & tradition",
        "Paragraph4": "Madagascan culture is a mix of Malagasy tradition and others brought later by arrivals from seafaring nations, from Arabic traders to French colonists. Our holidays employ local guides wherever possible, providing you with unique and first-hand cultural insights from people who have lived here all their lives. They’ll lead you around trails on community-run nature reserves that they grew up on as children, and take you to cattle markets and silk factories. With their tips on where to buy traditional (and responsibly sourced) wood carvings and the freshest mangoes, your money will fall directly into the hands of the communities you meet.",
        "image3": "",
        "Title5": "Types of tours & holidays in Madagascar",
        "Paragraph5": "Most of our Madagascar trips are wildlife holidays that seek out lemurs but also reveal and explain the spectacular yet fragile biodiversity of an island that’s home to five percent of the planet’s species of plants and animals. They’re adventure holidays by nature, but they adventure lightly, respectful of the ecosystems you’re exploring and the communities who defend and depend on them. The lemurs are rarely easy to find, and a guided hike through the rainforest is as rewarding as a sighting of a ring-tail. Our small group holidays place you in the hands of real experts: you’ll follow a set itinerary designed and led by those who know Madagascar best.",
        "Title6": "Family holidays in Madagascar",
        "Paragraph6": "For families prepared to do without the little luxuries, our family trips to Madagascar are incredible, and incredibly rewarding. Think rainforest hikes to spot wildlife, kayaking, camping and treehouse stays, river expeditions and snorkelling – real adventures in a really interesting place. Our holidays combine the fun with guided community visits where you and your kids will also get a deeper understanding of life and culture in Madagascar."

        "Main_Paragraph": "The best time to visit Madagascar is generally from\nJuly to October\nwhen its quite dry and mild   though much depends on the reason for your trip. The Central Highlands are cold and wet between May and October, but these months are ideal for exploring Madagascars arid southwest, where summer temperatures (November to January) are unbearably hot. July to December is the best time to visit Madagascar for wildlife, with baby lemurs on display from October, birds breeding between September and December, and humpback whales arriving at Ile St Marie in July and August. Rainy season in Madagascar is January to March, with cyclones likely in February.",

December is definitely the best time to visit Madagascar if youre hoping to hit the beach.</bullet>\n\n\"My favourite time of year is May because the rains have finished so everything is lush and green. You dont see many other tourists as they tend to go in September and October, but everything is just beautiful  its pretty perfect.\"\n\nTheatre, dance, storytelling and music are combined in these traditional Malagasy performances. Held each July, particularly by the Merina of the highlands, the tradition began in the 1700s when the royals appointed troupes to perform for their subjects. The audience participates, showing their approval  or disapproval!  for the troupes.",
