    "Main_Paragraph": "Outside of the foreboding winter the country thaws out, with Jul-Aug the best time to visit Latvia if you fancy dipping a toe into the Baltic. Spring and autumn bring bird migrations with geese, ducks and divers overtaking much of the western shoreline as well as the wetlands and forests inland. Showers can occur at any time of year so keep this in mind as well as an overcoat. As half of Latvia is forested, autumn is gorgeous with Gauja National Park showcasing the changing foliage, albeit over shorter days.",

The gardens at Rundāle Palace are exceptional, as are the palace rooms, which were featured in the BBCs adaptation of War & Peace. The Old Town district of Cesis is small but quaint and the castle grounds have re-enactments during the summer with traditional medieval food, music and dressing up.",
