    "Main_Paragraph": "Its a good idea to keep your eye on Antipodean school holidays when looking for the best time to visit Fiji as resorts and flights tend to fill up and prices are at a premium, especially during July, August, and Christmas holidays. Fiji weather falls into two categories: hot and humid (Nov-April) and dry and mild (May-Oct). Generally, mid-October to mid-November is the best time to visit Fiji as prices are reasonable, there are fewer crowds and weather conditions are dry, settled and pleasantly warm. Finally, in general, the leeward sides of larger islands are where youll find better conditions alongside the majority of resorts.",

    "paragraph2": "Linzi Bird, Fiji specialist at our partner Audley Travel, shares her Fiji travel advice:\nKava is a traditional Fijian welcome drink made from the roots of trees. Although it works a bit like an antiseptic, in as much as it will make your mouth go numb, it's a real honour to be involved in one of the village ceremonies that tend to take place about once a week.",
    "title3": "",
    "paragraph3": "Kirsty Bamby from on of our partners:\nFijians are extremely laid back and Fiji Time is an actual thing: an island attitude thats cool, relaxed and totally chilled out. The sort of feeling that if Im going to be late then, why worry? Its not going to affect world peace or anything dramatic like that. Time zones also change year on year as sometimes they dont add on the daylight saving hours and sometimes they do!",
    "title4": "Advice on where to go",
    "paragraph4": "Kirsty Bamby:\nPersonally, for me, Taveuni is my favourite Fijian island as it has maintained its rural integrity despite having its own airport and a twice-weekly public ferry service from Suva. Booking flights in advance for July and August is a must as the planes are tiny and get filled up very quickly during high season.",
    "title5": "",
    "paragraph5": "Linzi Bird shares her itinerary tips:\nExploring the main island of Viti Levu is a great idea and you'll find lots of guided tours departing from Nadi to take you around the coast or inland to places like Sleeping Giant Mountain that features gardens that are literally covered in thousands of orchids.",
    "title6": "Responsible tourism",
    "paragraph6": "Kirsty Bamby:\nResponsible tourism on Fiji is about listening to the needs of local communities and finding out how an experience can be beneficial to both sides. Gaining access to a village via a locally owned tour company is all about trust and respect as youll find explained by village elders in an authentic welcoming ceremony. Tourism in Fiji is happening, and if its not done with respect and integrity by companies that have an environmental and responsible travel ethos then its going to be done by yet another faceless international corporation who are only interested in one thing: money.",
