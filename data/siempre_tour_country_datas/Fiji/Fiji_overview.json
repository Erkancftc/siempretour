    "Main_Title": "Our Fiji holidays & tours",
    "Main_Paragraph": "Dramatic scenery, sensationally soft sand and friendly locals make our Fiji holidays the ultimate South Pacific experience. The beautiful beaches are unrivalled, but our trips offer so much more than just a picturesque peek at paradise. Plunge into the waters at Kadavu, explore the spectacular coastal trails of Yasawa, and give back to the communities who live here. Our holidays visit island villages, where you might take part in a rewarding volunteer project or be welcomed to try cooking classes or basket weaving. By working with village elders we ensure that money stays with families, and you get to experience an authentic Fijian welcome when you come.",

    "Title1": "",
    "Paragraph1": "Fiji consists of just over 330 volcanic islands, about a third of which are inhabited. The two largest islands, Viti Levu and Vanua Levu, are also the most populated with the township of Nadi, on Viti Levu, offering travellers a place to get their bearings after long haul flights. Due to the relatively close proximity to Nadi, the Mamanuca Islands and Sacred Islands often appear on small ship itineraries with the films Castaway (Monuriki Island) and the Blue Lagoon (Nanuya Levu aka: Turtle Island) enticing explorers to search for set locations to see if the real thing measures up to the big screen.",

    "Title2": "1. Drawaqa Island",
    "Paragraph2": "Encountering the underwater ecology of Drawaqa Island in the company of a marine biologist is just about the best biology lesson ever, especially when combined with inland conservation projects and trips to local schools. Escorted manta ray and reef safari trips are out of this world and abseiling from the islands cliff tops will leave you in fine fettle for an evening of barbecues and Bula Bula dancing.",
    "image2": "",
    "Title3": "2. The Mamanuca Islands",
    "Paragraph3": "At low tide the Mamanuca Islands are about 20 strong but, as the Pacific rises, numbers drop to about 13 with Monuriki and Bounty islands showcasing a couple of the chains coral fringed crown jewels. The relatively easy access and proximity to Port Denarau make Mamanuca popular for day trippers and overnight guests with a good choice of shiny resorts and traditional accommodation to suit all tropical tastes.",
    "Title4": "3. Monuriki Island",
    "Paragraph4": "Familiarity in Fiji comes in many guises and just like spotting a yellow cab in New York City, catching your first glimpse of the coconut-dotted white sands of Monuriki Island is bound to conjure up a scene that youre sure youve seen somewhere before. Castaway was filmed on Monuriki and theres no better location to indulge your entire back catalogue of uninhabited desert island fantasises.",
    "image3": "",
    "Title5": "4. The Sacred Islands",
    "Paragraph5": "The canoe that brought Tui Na Revurevu and his followers to Fiji, landed on the deserted shores of one of a five-island archipelago and hence the Narokorokoyawa Sacred Islands originated. Evidence still remains of the settlements and ceremonial caves that were integral to the cultural history of Fiji, and kayaking offshore will help you imagine what such a discovery must have meant to the early settlers.",
    "Title6": "5. Taveuni Island",
    "Paragraph6": "As Fijis third largest island, Taveuni offers far more than simple seclusion and white sand loveliness (they have black sand here). This is an inhabited, fertile and lesser visited volcanic landscape that supports an assortment of indigenous animals and exciting activities; with kayaking to Nacawa River Falls, the Lavena Costal Walk and cycling in Bouma National Heritage Park all excellent alternatives to days at the beach.",
    "Title7": "6. The Yasawa Islands",
    "Paragraph7": "Due to their location, to the northeast of the Mamanuca archipelago, the Yasawa Islands require a little more effort to get to but can still be reached on a seven-night small ship cruise itinerary, no problem. The seclusion and sense of escape that youll experience upon arrival is just magical and its still easy to see why Nanuya Levu was chosen as the set for the 1980s desert island romance, the Blue Lagoon."
