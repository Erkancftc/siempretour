        "Main_Paragraph": "Our Papua New Guinea holidays are captivating. Rainforest hikes lead to lands of tree kangaroos and Raggiana birds-of-paradise, and you can devote 11 days to the Kokoda Track, a route that takes you not only through dramatically steep valleys with gushing rivers, but along a pilgrimage trail. Meanwhile wildlife safaris along the Sepik River reveal crocodiles, freshwater sharks and barramundi. But it’s not only Papua Guinea’s natural wonders that beguile the visitor – our holidays here also take in thrilling tribal gatherings such as Hagen and Goroka where you’ll witness music and dance performances as well as traditional rituals. And, in return for these communities welcoming our travellers, our holidays make financial donations that help fund education and healthcare projects.",
        "Subtitle": "Papua New Guinea highlights",
        "Title1": "",
        "Paragraph1": "Its a long way to Papua New Guinea, and the shortest trips here last nine days (not including the long journey either side) but you can easily spend three weeks here to recover from the flight, jetlag and really get immersed in PNG life. Tours focus on the northeast coast of the main island and hop over to New Britain; these are wild and unspoilt regions, but still far more accessible than the densely forested and mountainous interior. Infrastructure outside the capital, Port Moresby, is virtually nonexistent, with potholed roads and minimal electricity, so youll need to take domestic flights to get around. The Kokoda Track takes you through the jungles of the southeast peninsula, or for something completely different, opt for a small ship cruise across the Bismarck and Solomon Seas, stopping off at offshore islands before continuing on to the Solomon Islands.",
        "image1": "",
        "Title2": "1. Asaro Mudmen Village",
        "Paragraph2": "The ‘Mudmen’, are so called due to the tradition of plastering their bodies with mud, and creating mud masks called\nholosa\n. This is said to date back to when an attacking tribe saw them covered in it after emerging from the river, and fled – assuming they were spirits. On village visits you can observe fire making ceremonies and dance performances, as well as joining the villagers for a\nmumu\nlunch, cooked in a fire pit.",
        "image2": "",
        "Title3": "2. Kokoda Track",
        "Paragraph3": "This 100km, nine-day route is the most exhilarating long distance trek youve never heard of. Muddy terrain, steep gradients and relentless heat and humidity mean the Kokoda Track is a serious undertaking, but the phenomenal views and opportunity to get deep into the heart of PNG make it all worthwhile. More poignantly, the route traces the WW2 battles fought between Japanese and Australian forces.",
        "Title4": "3. Madang Region",
        "Paragraph4": "Madang shelters many of the 780 species of birds which have been identified in PNG  the most sought after being its birds of paradise. But Madang caters to more than just twitchers. Take a scenic cruise in its harbour or take advantage of the world class snorkelling and scuba diving. Discover the regions cultural heritage in Madang Museum, on tours of Hobe villages and through community homestays.",
        "image3": "",
        "Title5": "4. Mount Gurupoka",
        "Paragraph5": "An enjoyable, three-hour hike to the top of Gurupoka is rewarded with epic views across the surrounding peaks and valleys. Youll be accompanied by a local mountain spirit guide in traditional dress, who can share stories about the plants and special locations on this sacred mountain, including an ancestral cave. Nearby Goroka town is worth a visit afterwards, for the JK McCarthy Museum, market and coffee factory.",
        "Title6": "5. New Britain",
        "Paragraph6": "This island proffers plenty of natural attractions pockmarked with WW2 history. Visit Rabaul harbour, a flooded caldera ringed by six volcanoes, and explore the nearby U-boat tunnel complete with Japanese landing barges, as well as WW2 tunnels. Kokopo Beach is the natural stage for the Kinavai Ceremony, featuring drumming and masked dancers, who commemorate the arrival of their ancestors on the island.",
        "Title7": "6. Offshore islands",
        "Paragraph7": "The islands of Manus, Mussa, Nissan and Bougainville are remote, rarely visited and utterly ravishing. The only way to visit these is on a small cruise ship (max. 50 passengers). Thanks to their isolation, the islands boast astonishing biodiversity above and below the water; snorkellers and birdwatchers will be in their element. You can also spend time with local villagers to learn how life unfolds in this distant tropical paradise.",
        "Title8": "7. Sepik River",
        "Paragraph8": "Sepik is PNGs longest river, and it acts as a lifeline into the islands dense and otherwise little explored forests. Zodiac tours take you along the rivers many channels and tributaries, as you keep an eye out for birds and crocodiles. Stop at riverside villages to discover a way of life that has changed little in centuries, and meet the artisans who create elaborate wood carvings."

        "Main_Paragraph": "The best time to go to Papua New Guinea is from Apr-Oct, when the rains ease off somewhat. Its never dry here though, so be prepared with lightweight waterproofs, and keep an open mind should rain stop play. Most festivals take place during the dry season, so check dates if there are any you are particularly interested in. This is also the best time to take on the Kokoda Track. Small ship cruises tend to take place at the end of the dry season, while scuba divers will enjoy good visibility and warm water all year round.",

        "when_to_go_html": "<bullet>December, January, February and March are the rainiest months. Small group tours and trekking expeditions tend to avoid this period.</bullet>\n<bullet>Late May or early June through to October are the best months to visit Papua New Guinea as there is less chance of rain. Average temperatures may be <i>slightly</i> cooler  think mid to high 20°Cs rather than low 30°Cs. July tends to be the coolest month, followed by August.</bullet>\n<bullet>It is hot here all year round, but if you are heading up into the mountains it can get surprisingly cold, particularly at night. Bring a warm layer as well as a light rain jacket.</bullet>\n<bullet>The shoulder seasons of April and November can be a good time to get slightly cheaper deals on flights and accommodation.</bullet>\n<bullet>Visit in mid July to join the Warwagira and Mask Festival on East New Britains Kokopo Beach. The four-day festival celebrates the regions many mask cultures, with energetic dances, rituals, storytelling and art and craft displays. Dont miss the opening Kinavai Ceremony at dawn on the first day, or the dramatic fire dances performed by initiated young Baining men, which involve running and jumping barefoot through huge flames.</bullet>",

        "title2": "Culture & festivals",
        "paragraph2": "Alan Manning, a Papua New Guinea expert from our supplier Intrepid, shares his advice on visiting the country and on walking the Kokoda Track:\nPNG is an intrepid travellers paradise, and the abundance of cultures is one of its unique selling points. Many of our travellers, after being on trips to other festivals in the world, have mentioned that the Goroka Show and the Rabaul Mask Festival are up there with the top three cultural events they have seen. The main reasons for this are the raw nature of the performances and the diversity.",
        "title3": "What is special about PNG?",
        "paragraph3": "PNG is the destination for those travellers who have been to Africa, done India tours and so on. It is for people who want to travel to unique destinations that are not off the stock standard template I believe. This is a pioneer destination for people to visit; it isnt mainstream and you wont be dealing with mass travel and the crowds associated with mass travel destinations.",
        "title4": "Porters on the Kokoda Track",
        "paragraph4": "Each trekker has a personal porter who carries the trekkers pack. We have a 1:1 trekker to porter ratio to. Our aim is to provide greater employment opportunities for porters. Our intention is also that relationship building between the trekkers and the porters becomes one of the most important experiences of the trip, reflecting the wartime bonds between Australian troops and the Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels.",
        "title5": "Why hike the Kokoda Trail?",
        "paragraph5": "Travellers undertaking the Kokoda Track can expect a sense of achievement at having completed one of the worlds most famous walks. They will have firsthand observation of unique and spectacular natural features of the land, as well as some understanding of what the Australian soldiers must have gone through in their fight to protect our country. Similarly, they can also achieve a sense of comradeship that can only be gained by a group of people who have worked under trying conditions to attain a common goal.",
        "title6": "Safety on the Kokoda Track",
        "paragraph6": "The track is isolated and backup medical and rescue services are not easily available, but we have drawn up a contingency plan for evacuation from along the track in the unlikely event of a serious problem occurring.  The focal point of any communication with the outside is our satellite telephone and two way radio. We track all our groups with a GPS tracker which give us a 10 min ping location of the group. And of course, we have a medical first aid kit on track at all times."
