    "Main_Paragraph": "The best time to visit Asia isnt easily summed up  its a huge continent of different regions each with their own weather patterns and microclimates. So think about whether you prefer heat, or cooler weather; think about why youre going  local culture, historical sights, trekking  and what the optimum conditions are to enjoy that (its likely youd rather not appreciate the splendour of the Taj Mahal during the monsoon, for example). Consider crowds, too.",

    "when_to_go_html": "<bullet><b>If you want to see blue whales in Sri Lanka, the beginning of March is the best time.</b> But for other species, head there from <b>October until April.</b></bullet>\n<bullet><b>January is an exceptional month in which to visit Cambodia</b> - you can expect good weather conditions throughout the country, with blue skies, little or no rain and temperatures set at a balmy 26°C; likewise, Laos is a dream in <b>February.</b></bullet>\n<bullet><b>During Nepals summer monsoon season (June, July, August, September), it doesnt necessarily rain all day, but it does rain every day.</b> More rain falls at night than during the day, so the mornings are often crisp and beautiful, but the season is sadly often avoided by trekkers  <b>if you do want to trek then, avoid Nepals more popular circuits and head to Manang, Mustang or Dolpo,</b> Himalayan areas that sit in rain shadows.</bullet>\n<bullet>Chinas Golden Week, or National Day Holiday is held from <b>29th September to 10th October</b> and everyone in the country  thats 1.4 billion people  has this week off. Most travel to domestic cities causing logistical chaos. Avoid it, unless of course your idea of fun is getting caught in a confusion of camera straps.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>The rainy season in Southeast Asia runs from around May until late October</b>, and can deter travellers. However, Borneo is a great Southeast Asian call during this time as it sits outside of the monsoon belt.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>The term typhoon denotes a particular type of tropical storm that hits the northwest Pacific Ocean (pretty much all of Southeast Asia).</b> A majority of typhoons happen between May and October, though they can strike year round.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>Towards the end of Southeast Asias dry season, starting in around March, temperatures begin to rise. By April,</b> it can top 40°C, with high humidity  which is extremely uncomfortable and difficult to take in any sights or activities.</bullet>\n<bullet>If you want to go hiking in Keralas Western Ghats, <b>the monsoon peak of July and August is not the best time to visit India.</b> Houseboats arent much fun during this time either.</bullet>\n<bullet>Even though Sri Lankas Cultural Triangle is in a drier region, it does still get hit by the monsoon in <b>November and December.</b></bullet>",

Its a huge, week-long street party celebrating the end of the dry season and the start of the rains. Everyone has a water gun, so theres no hiding behind anyone to escape from getting wet; theyll soak you through while belly laughing. A 90-year-old granny in the street? Dont trust her."
