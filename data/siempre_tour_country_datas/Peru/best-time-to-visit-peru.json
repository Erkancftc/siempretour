    "Main_Paragraph": "The best time to visit Peru is the dry season\nbetween May and September\n, when theres ideal weather for trekking in the Peruvian Highlands. The dry season is also the best time of year to visit Peru for wildlife watching in the Amazon, as animals congregate along shrinking rivers and mosquitoes are fewer, while the arid coast is also pleasantly cooler at this time. Just be prepared for falling temperatures in the mountains at night, and pack appropriately. As youll see from our guide to when to go to Peru, December to March is the rainy season, when youll find it hard going on the Inca Trail.",

    "when_to_go_html": "<bullet>In a nutshell: Peru is wet from <b>November to March</b> and dry for the rest of the year. The coast - especially in the south - tends to be drier, but the Amazon is always hot and wet. It is the world's largest rainforest, after all...</bullet>\n<bullet><b>January</b> is one of the wettest months in the highlands of Peru and the Inca Trail tends to close for cleaning and maintenance at the end of the month and throughout <b>February</b>. Machu Picchu is still open at this time, though, for hikers following other routes, and those arriving by train.</bullet>\n<bullet>A few other national parks in Peru also close in <b>February</b>. However, the beaches are always open and this is the best time of year for heat on the coast.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>March and April</b> are still wet within the highlands. However, youll find few other travellers on the trails and permits won't book out so far in advance. This is probably the best time of year to visit Arequipa, in the southwest, as temperatures are pleasant and rainfall is low.</bullet>\n<bullet>Amazon areas, such as Puerto Maldonado, are hot and humid all year round although there will be a little less rain from <b>May through to September</b>.</bullet>\n<bullet>Heading along the coast south of Lima in <b>June</b> will introduce you to the drizzle and thick fog caused by the dry <i>garúa</i> winds. If youre searching for sunshine at this time, then head north to Trujillo for conditions more akin to spring.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>July and August</b> are peak times to visit Machu Picchu; you will need to book at least six months in advance to secure a permit.</bullet>\n<bullet>If you'd rather visit after the biggest crowds have dispersed, then <b>September and October</b> could be the best months to get on the Inca Trail.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>November and December</b> find the rains returning to the highlands and Cuzco, as well as Amazon areas in and around Puerto Maldonado. A mini high season towards the end of the year pushes prices up as travellers head to the beach over the holidays.</bullet>",

    "paragraph3": "\"For me personally, the best time to go and see the mountains is mid to late April, because it's after the rainy season and everything is green. But it's the end of summer, so it's still a bit warmer. My least favourite time is in July and August when it's filled with local families as well as tourists - it's just too crowded, and very cold. Also, if you arrive in Lima during April, it's just finishing summer - so it doesn't have the grey skies you can expect to find there for the rest of the year.\"",

Throughout February you are likely to get drenched - as\nPeruvians indulge in traditional water fights.\nTo mark the end of carnival, a symbolic tree - called a\nyunsa\n- is adorned with gifts. Couples compete to fell it with an axe, releasing the gifts. Cajamarca and Puno have some of the biggest carnivals."
