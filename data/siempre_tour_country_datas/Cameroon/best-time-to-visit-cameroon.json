    "Main_Paragraph": "Tropical Cameroon spans the dense, lush forests in the south, to the far drier north, nudging up towards the Sahel. Rains fall across the country from May to November, with July onwards seeing the heaviest downpours; part of the Ring Road simply disappears at this time. Mount Cameroon is by far its wettest region (particularly the western slopes), along with the coast  expect uncomfortable humidity here, too. The drier north can reach 40°C in the hottest months of March  May, and the rainy season is shorter, from around May to September.",

    "paragraph2": "Jim OBrien, founder of our West Africa partner Native Eye Travel, shares his top tips for travellers in Cameroon:\nOne of the highlights is the Mandara Mountains. Theyre on the border with Nigeria and there are a lot of animist ethnic groups. I went to a place called Rhumsiki and theyve got a guy there who they call the Crab Sorcerer who predicts the future using crabs. He puts them in an urn along with some sticks, and depending on how the crabs move around and move the sticks, hell tell the future or answer your questions from that.",

    "paragraph3": "The surrounding landscape is volcanic plugs, so the lavas come up and solidified and the mountains have eroded around them so youve got these striking outcrops. Its a beautiful area, its really, really nice with lots of little villages, and the ethnicities change very, very quickly.\"",
    "title4": "Take the train",
    "paragraph4": "One thing I really enjoyed doing in Cameroon is taking the overnight train from Yaoundé to Ngaondere in the far north. The north and the south are terribly connected in terms of roads, so the only real effective way to get there is by train. Its quite an atmospheric journey because you go through the forest at night and youre surrounded by these big trees. When I went through there was this big thunderstorm, so youve got these towering trees above and lightning coming down. The train is quite comfortable, a nice sleeper train  its a different element, you get to meet local people outside of the tourism experience. It takes something like three days to drive the journey that it would take the overnight sleeper train to do, so most people take the train or fly. The trains work quite well in Cameroon, theres not a massive network but what they have works reasonably well.",
    "title5": "Advice on seeing primates",
    "paragraph5": "Theres a sanctuary near Kribi called Pongo Songo for chimps rescued from the bush trade. Its on the banks of a river and there are a couple of islands where theyve reintroduced these chimps to a semi-wild environment. Theyre accustomed to humans because people are coming in to see them; the baby chimps are running around and theyre quite curious  sometimes they run up and jump on you! Because theyre orphaned they need some sort of adult contact before they can be reintroduced, they need looking after. When they get to a certain age they are reintroduced into the semi-wild environment with the adult groups. Its very difficult to take an orphaned chimp and reintroduce it into the wild, especially if its been kept for the pet trade; its used to humans and its not going to have that fear of them that they really need. So at Pongo Songo they live as wild a life as they can."
