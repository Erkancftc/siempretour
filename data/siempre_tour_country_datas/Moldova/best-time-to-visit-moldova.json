    "Main_Title": "BEST TIME TO VISIT MOLDOVA",
    "Main_Paragraph": "Winters in Moldova tend to be dry which makes ideal weather for wrapping up on city sightseeing tours and seeking out warming bowls of\nciorba\n(soup). The Black Sea has a big part to play in Moldovas climate helping to create milder winters and longer summers, perfect for grape growing and rich agriculture. The best time to visit Moldova for walking with wildflowers or bird watching is May to June but remember a raincoat as heavy showers can be frequent. Independence Day at the end of August is also worth experiencing, and October finds the countryside alive with colour but, again, dont forget your mac and brolly.",

    "paragraph2": "Linda Maguire, travel consultant at our partner Undiscovered Destinations, shares some travel advice and personal experiences of Moldova.",
    "title3": "City sightseeing",
    "paragraph3": "Chisinau is very diverse and safe, and contains several examples of Soviet architecture interspersed with parks and green spaces, as well as several wide, three-lane boulevards aligned with mulberry and acacia trees to support well-maintained roads and a good public transport system.",
    "title4": "How much does it cost?",
    "paragraph4": "Prices, even in the capital, are reasonable with a three course meal in a decent restaurant costing around 20 Euros. I'd recommend taking US Dollars or Euros rather than Sterling as I found exchanging British Pounds quite difficult; and although there were a couple of ATMs, it's probably better to bring currency rather than relying on credit and cash cards.",
    "title5": "Be brave with food",
    "paragraph5": "There are lots of different dishes to try that might not sound particularity appealing at first but are actually rather delicious; prune based desserts, for example.",
    "title6": "Consider Transnistria",
    "paragraph6": "Transnistria is a breakaway republic and has its own border. The people consider it to be part of Russia and as such a separate country. They speak Russian as their first language although English is also spoken, and it is this outlook and allegiance that makes it different to the rest of Moldova. Its an interesting place to visit with overnight homestays offering a unique insight into rural life."
