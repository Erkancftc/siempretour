    "Main_Paragraph": "Temperatures rarely drop below 23°C in Brunei and high humidity is a factor all year. You can visit any time, but Feb and Mar are driest, and perhaps the best time to go with National Day celebrated on 23 February. From Mar-late Oct expect average temperatures in the high 20°Cs, pushing into the low 30°Cs sometimes. Its fractionally cooler from late Oct-Jan, but these are also the wettest months and rains can restrict access to Temburong. The Sultans birthday (15 July) is marked with festivities around the country, including fireworks and parades.",

In the capital, Id suggest visiting the museums, particularly the Royal Regalia, and take a half day tour of the city which includes a boat visit to the water village of Kampong Ayer.",

    "paragraph3": "People might think Brunei is just about wealth and oil. Thats mostly true! But the mentality is changing inside Brunei since the oil price dropped and the government is now looking for ways to have a more sustainable economy  one way of doing that is through tourism. Although tourism has not been helped by the country adopting Sharia Law, Brunei is in itself a very unique country in Southeast Asia, home to the wealthiest man who is also a functioning monarch. Not known to many, Brunei has great national parks with many of its virgin forests intact. Most importantly, Brunei is a fascinating contrast with neighbouring Malaysia. Our Brunei friends offer an insight into the cultural and social differences between the Brunei and Malaysian sides of the border. And being an outsider visiting is a great experience in itself."
