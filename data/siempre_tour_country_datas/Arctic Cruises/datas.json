        "Main_Paragraph": "Our Arctic cruise holidays stick to small ships, meaning less impact on the fragile landscapes and small communities they visit, and less time waiting around to disembark for your thrilling daily activities, like hikes to polar research stations, kayaking between icebergs, or even learning how to mush a team of huskies. And we keep itineraries very flexible. Why? Because on an Arctic cruise you never know what adventures the day might hold. It could be a polar bear and her cubs parading along the shore. It could be a pod of orcas on the hunt. Travelling on a small ship means that you can quickly change direction to follow the action.\nOur Arctic cruise tours treat this immensely beautiful and fragile place with the respect it deserves. They keep a safe distance from wildlife, of course, but they also seek to minimise their own environmental impact. That means minimising the use of electricity and water (and encouraging their passengers to do likewise) and being careful about where and when they land, to avoid overcrowding tiny townships. Thats because we know how amazing the Arctic is, and we want people to continue being wowed by it for many years to come.",

        "Title1": "Svalbard",
        "Paragraph1": "Many of our Arctic cruises make for this icy archipelago that lies beyond the Arctic Circle, perhaps spending some time in Norways Lofoten Islands en route. Svalbard is home to walruses, reindeer, bearded seals and Arctic foxes. Some 3,000 polar bears prowl landscapes blanketed with snow and lit by the midnight sun in summer, while the freezing waters are home to beluga, humpback and fin whales. The largest island in the Svalbard archipelago is Spitsbergen. Here you might sail past icebergs along the fjords, trek across the rugged tundra, or visit the capital, Longyearbyen, to try some dog sledding.",

        "Title2": "Choosing the right ship",
        "Paragraph2": "Choosing the right ship\r\nWhen it comes to Arctic cruise holidays, no two ships are the same. There are icebreakers, with strengthened hulls, suitable for cruising outside the main summer season. Others are more modern vessels, with sleek lines and luxurious amenities. There are no official limits on passenger numbers as there are in Antarctica, but our cruises have no more than 250 passengers, and sometimes as few as 50 depending on the trip.\nIf you have limited mobility or require the use of a wheelchair, we have accessible Arctic cruises where the ship has lifts between decks, and the crew are trained to assist during shore excursions. If you have any particular requirements, just let our friendly Travel Team know, and we can match you with a suitable vessel.\nPerhaps the most important consideration when choosing a ship on an Arctic cruise is the itinerary. You need to know if you want something active, with plenty of shore excursions and experiences such as kayaking or hikes, or something more sedate that will be mostly ship-based.",

        "Title3": "Life onboard",
        "Paragraph3": "The ships on our Arctic cruises are equipped with everything youll\nneed\nfor your voyage, but little else besides. Theyre comfortable, and more luxurious vessels might have amenities such as saunas and fitness centres, but thats about it. Thats because youll be focusing your attention outwards rather than inwards. Much of your day will be spent on the observation deck simply admiring the spectacular Arctic scenery  huge icebergs floating creakily by, the occasional animal \r\nsighting, and birds framed against the vast skies. Most of our trips have onboard experts who can give fascinating insights on everything from glaciers to Arctic plant life and photography, and they will often provide inspiring discussions and talks in the evenings as well.\nA typical Arctic cruise ship will have a range of cabins, and perhaps a few suites. Solo travellers will be sharing a twin with someone of the same sex unless they pay a single supplement. But most people will see nothing of their cabins beyond sleeping and showering. Instead, youll likely spend much of your time in ships communal areas, where you can get to know your fellow passengers a little. Cruise holidays are by their nature sociable affairs, but on our small ships youll begin recognising faces very quickly. Ships rarely have Wi-Fi so in the evenings people will chat, edit photos, or read. You dont want to be too using too much energy anyway, because the next day always brings a fresh adventure, from walks through noisy seabird colonies to kayaking along a fjord between icebergs.",
        "Title4": "Arctic wildlife",
        "Paragraph4": "On our Arctic cruise holidays, the crew will ask you if you want to be woken up at night if theres been a wildlife sighting. Almost everyone says yes. You never know when a pod of whales will be reported, or when a polar bear will be spotted sleeping on an ice floe. This is the reason why itineraries are deliberately kept flexible, and why its a good option to choose a small ship cruise that can quickly change direction to follow a tip.\nPolar bears are the big-ticket sighting that everyone wants, but you might also see huge walruses, or Arctic foxes loping agilely across the snow. And then there are whales  belugas, bowheads and narwhals are all resident in the Arctic year-round, with at least 14 other species making regular appearances too  even blue whales. Svalbard is an excellent area for whale-spotting, its cold waters full of nutrients. Our Arctic cruise holidays ensure that all crew are trained to prioritise the interests of wildlife. For instance, ships will always slow down near whales and avoid separating mothers and their calves. Much of the news we read about nature can be very depressing, but you can expect to come home from one of our Arctic holidays full of wonder for the natural world, and with renewed vigour to help protect it.",
