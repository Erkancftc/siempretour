    "Main_Paragraph": "Winter can be cold in Hungary, dropping to -3°C in January. Bird watching holidays still run then, but for non-twitchers the best time to visit Hungary is spring and early autumn, when its mild. July and August are hottest, at between 15-25°C  not too hot for a cycling holiday, especially if you pedal out in the early mornings. If youre only heading to Budapest, though, avoid these midsummer months, when its flooded with tourists. Most rain falls in spring, particularly May, but showers are a feature of summer, too, so take an umbrella. December and January offer Christmas markets and the chance of snow.",

    "when_to_go_html": "<bullet>Not many people would choose to stick around during Hungarys sub-zero <b>January</b>...apart from <a href=\"/holidays/hungary/travel-guide/bird-watching\">bird watchers</a>. Wishbones of geese winter here, plus owls and eagles (including magnificent eagle owls) are easier to spot on leafless lookouts. <b>February</b> rings in woodpeckers a-pecking everywhere from Budapest parks to the frosty forests of the Bukk Mountains.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>April</b> is blossom season  and boy, do they bloom. Castle and Gellert Hills in Budapest bulge with cherry blossom trees. A perfect match for the side dish of grey, chilly rain showers. The blossom season is unpredictable, so its best not to book your flight by them. Treat them as a (pretty spectacular) bonus. </bullet>\n<bullet><b>May</b> is one of the best times to be in Hungary, as the rains (partially) recede and the temperatures warm. The coach tours and river cruises havent quite picked up pace yet, either, making it a good time to be on the Danube.</bullet>\n<bullet>Budapests Fozdefeszt celebrates Hungarian beers and street food for three days in <b>June</b>. Solid weather and long days make midsummer good conditions for cycling, too.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>July and August</b> are the hottest months of the year, averaging at 25°C, with the odd jump to towards 30°C. The Danube Cycle Path is at its busiest, thanks to the summer holidays, although many say the pint-sized peddlers add to the gleeful vibe. Kelly Reid, from our holiday company Exodus Travels, says: During the height of summer, there can be quite hot temperatures, so people should be prepared for this. If you plan to cycle, make sure the trip is a mix of cycling, culture and seeing other sights as well, so you arent on the bike all day every day!</bullet>\n<bullet>The crowds in Budapest and on the Danube scale down in <b>September and October</b>  as do the temperatures. The forests and vineyards in rural Hungary turn autumnal.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>November and December</b> is Christmas market season. Its busy, but its also incredibly atmospheric. Hit the small town markets to avoid the crowds of Budapest.</bullet>",
