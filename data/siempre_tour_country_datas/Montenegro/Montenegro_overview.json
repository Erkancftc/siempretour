    "Main_Title": "Our Montenegro holidays & tours",
    "Main_Paragraph": "Montenegro’s beauty lies in its coast, mountains and lakes – and the warm welcomes you’ll receive. Multi activity adventures are led by expert local instructors, from kayaking on Lake Skadar to mountain biking along forest tracks. These trips are perfect for active families too. Our walking trips, meanwhile, explore around and above the Bay of Kotor, where you can avoid the cruise crowds of July and August. For those who prefer more independence, we have self drive holidays that offer an easy way to get off the beaten track. It’s no coincidence that our top Montenegro holidays are designed and run by local people – their knowledge and connections make for brilliantly smooth adventures.",

    "Title1": "Action-packed adventures",
    "Paragraph1": "You would struggle to find better adventure holidays than our bunch. (Just look at the reviews!) Our partners have crafted itineraries where every day promises a new challenge: white water rafting on the Tara River in Durmitor National Park; kayaking on the river or in the sea; canyoning with expert instructors; hiking in the mountains, with the promise of a deserted lake to dive into once youve worked up a sweat. And all while handling the spectacular landscapes with care. Choose a small group holiday or tailor made trip where you can pick-and-mix your activities.",

    "Title2": "Walk with us",
    "Paragraph2": "Walking holidays are the best way to discover Montenegros mountains, lakes, forests and coast. Our itineraries are typically a week long, and you can either join a guided small group trip with like-minded ramblers or opt for a tailor made jaunt. Both promise a mix of challenging steep climbs and gentle downhills, so youll need plenty of puff as well as a head for heights. Youll be led by passionate local guides keen to show off their countrys manifold charms  expect diverse and picturesque landscapes dotted with old fortresses, villages and waterfalls.",

    "Title3": "Roads made for cycling",
    "Paragraph3": "You might look at those mountains and think, Do I really want to cycle in Montenegro? The answer, if youre comfortable with a few hours in the saddle, is most definitely yes. This Balkan beauty is a relatively under-visited cycling destination, but perfectly suited to two-wheeling it. Our holidays are designed by cycling experts and tackle flexible routes that ease you from mountains to coast and from forests to lakes, with a refreshing drink or swim never too far away. Plus, were big fans of electric bikes  join e-bike trips designed by our local partners on a mission to share their love of cycling in Montenegro with more people.",
    "Title4": "Family-friendly fun",
    "Paragraph4": "Families with active kids particularly suit Montenegro. There are mountains everywhere, gorgeous beaches, and activities that range from rafting and kayaking to canyoning and mountain biking. Join our expertly organised family holidays where local hosts and guides are in charge of getting you from A to B. Our trips favour small, locally run accommodation such as stone villas and forest cabins.",

    "Title5": "Small ship cruises that care",
    "Paragraph5": "The Bay of Kotor is one of the most popular locations to spend a few days on a small ship cruising holiday. This UNESCO-listed flooded river valley is studded with tiny islands and pretty little towns  and our small ships can access ports and bays that larger, more intrusive vessels cannot. Plus, theyve got style. Luxury yachts come with sun decks and sleek gulets have the option to unfurl the sails if the conditions are right. If you want to see as much of the region as possible in a short time, our cruises of the Adriatic also take in parts of Croatias Dalmatian Coast."
