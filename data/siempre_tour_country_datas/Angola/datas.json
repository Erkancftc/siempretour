        "Main_Paragraph": "When you travel on our Angola holidays, you are travelling with experts. This vast southern African country has a 1,600km coastline, desert wilderness and a population comprised of many different tribes, from the Himba to the Muila. We’ve worked with community leaders, conservationists and elders to pave the way for sensitive travel. After years of civil strife, tourism is very new and infrastructure sparse, and travelling independently is very difficult. Our trips are expeditions lead by highly experienced teams who providing crucial support, so that you can have a rewarding expedition into the amazing hinterlands of southern Angola, and meet the many peoples who make this country so interesting.",

        "Title1": "1. Chibia",
        "Paragraph1": "Chibia is a centre for the Muila people, known for their incredible body decorations. The Muila (also Mumuila or Mumuhuila) are semi nomadic and follow an animistic religion. The women are famous for their thick\nnontombi\n– mud-coated dreadlocks, and their mud necklaces, made in various styles. Each one of the necklaces worn by the women corresponding to a life stage, and they are never removed.",

        "Title2": "2. Luanda",
        "Paragraph2": "Lubango is the main city in southern Angola, sitting in a large valley overlooked by a statue of Christ and the Chela Hills. Lubango‘s centre is dominated by the Art Deco style Cathedral of St Joseph, and the city has a relaxed feel. It’s the chief jumping off point for exploration of this region and its traditional tribespeople. Nearby, the Tunda-Vala, a breathtaking kilometre-deep gorge, offers views out across the region.",

        "Title4": "4. Namibe",
        "Paragraph4": "This quiet fishing town on the Atlantic coast is the capital of the remote Namibe Province. It was founded by the Portuguese in 1840, and is still home to fading relics of their empire. Most interesting of these is the cemetery, which has both Portuguese tombs and a curiously colourful collection of ornamental tombs, decorated in ‘Namibe style’, which is a fusion of Portuguese and African symbolism.",
        "image3": "",
        "Title5": "5. Oncocua",
        "Paragraph5": "Oncocua is a former Portuguese settlement in the middle of a cultural island, where three different ethnic groups live: the Himba, the Mucawana and the Mutua. Its a full days drive south of Lubango, passing villages belonging the Mugambue people. This is one of the most traditional places in southern Angola, and visitors are rare, although you can expect a warm welcome.",
        "Title6": "6. Tchitundo Hulo",
        "Paragraph6": "The prehistoric rock art here includes paintings of animals, plants and men, possibly dating back 20,000 years. Drive here from Namibe across desert landscapes and see bizarre welwitschia plants, which can live for 1,000 years. Enroute, stop in Virei, a centre for the Mucubal people, whose women wear wicker-framed headdresses, iron anklets and an\noyonduthi\nstring around their breasts, which serves as a bra."

        "Main_Paragraph": "Broadly speaking, Angola has two distinct seasons  rainy and dry. As its so huge, there are variations, with the southern coast around Namibe cooler, for instance, averaging 17°C in July. Organised tours focus on the south, where the best time to go is June, July, August and September; our 10 day trip departs annually in July. This is the coolest and driest season, with highs of around 23°C in Luanda in July. November to May is Angolas hot, rainy season, with April seeing the heaviest downpours and often violent storms. The water that falls now in the Angolan Highlands eventually flows into Botswana to form the Okavango Delta.",

        "title2": "Why visit Angola?",
        "paragraph2": "Angola offers some incredible landscapes, fascinating ethnic groups and very little in the way of tourism, so its a great destination for someone looking for something different. One of its key appeals is its ethnic diversity. It holds some of the most traditional ethnic groups in southern Africa, so for those interested in different cultures its an amazing place to visit. Theres also ancient rock art, Portuguese colonial architecture, Africas third biggest waterfall I could go on.",
        "title3": "How challenging is travel in Angola?",
        "paragraph3": "The infrastructure here isnt too bad in many parts, but getting off the beaten track often involves going off road on difficult tracks and camping, which doesnt suit everyone. The authorities here are getting a little more used to tourism and by and large are fairly welcoming, but its not necessarily as polished a destination as others, which is part of its appeal, in our eyes.",
        "title4": "Do tribespeople welcome visits?",
        "paragraph4": "The different ethnic groups are welcoming of visitors, if a little curious. However it is incredibly important that we try to make our visits as culturally sensitive as possible. We have noticed a trend in recent years of a small minority of people being uninterested in the culture and customs of the people visited, only in taking photographs  much like a trophy hunter. This does nothing for the cause of responsible tourism, and is offensive and dehumanising towards tribal groups, so we do not encourage this type of traveller to join our trips.",
        "title5": "Do you see Angola opening up to tourism more in future years?",
        "paragraph5": "Angola is opening up to tourism. In recent years they finally introduced a tourism visa and in 2018 they introduced an online visa process to (supposedly) make the process simpler. As the reputation of Angola being a war torn country starts to fade, more people are keen to explore this previously hidden country."
