    "Main_Title": "Best time to visit Ghana",
    "Main_Paragraph": "Ghanas location close to the equator means it does not experience huge variations in temperature throughout the year; seasons are instead dictated by rain and wind. The best time to visit Ghana is the dry season, from October to March. Thanks to its largely paved roads, Ghana is one of the easiest West African countries to travel through in the wet season  but rain does make travel less pleasant, and summer is hot and very sticky. Wildlife is easier to spot in Mole National Park when its dry, with elephants seen particularly between December and March. Be aware of the arid harmattan wind, though, which blows in from the Sahara from December.",

    "when_to_go_html": "<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Dry weather</li>\n<li>Wildlife watching</li>\n<li>Low visibility</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nDry weather is the norm in Ghana in January  rain is a rarity in the north at this time of year, and the landscape is parched. In Mole National Park wildlife including elephants and hippos congregate around water. Lions are less common, but dry season makes it easier to spot them. The harmattan winds blow sand from the Sahara  pack sunglasses and face scarves.<div style=\"margin-top: 15px;\"></div>\n<bullet><b>January is great for our</b> <a href=\"/holiday/15355/ghana-togo-and-benin-holiday-gold-and-magic\">Ghana, Togo and Benin holiday</a></bullet><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Walking</li>\n<li>Beach breaks</li>\n<li>Hot, dry and sunny</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nGhana in February is fantastic for walking, particularly in the south, whether between caves and waterfalls in the mountainous Volta region, or beaches and fishing villages on the coast. February is warm and dry, the Sahara winds dying down, and visibility improves both for walkers and for those catching some rays on gorgeous beaches such as those of Ada Foah.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Hottest month</li>\n<li>Sporadic rain</li>\n<li>Peak season ending</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nMarch is the hottest month in Ghana. Temperatures nudge 30°C on the south coast but can top 40°C further north. You can feel the rain in the air in Ghana in March, so do expect the occasional shower, especially in central regions, with the north seeing storms of increasing strength and frequency from later in the month. Squalls  short, powerful bursts of wind, are also likely.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Rains begin</li>\n<li>Homowo Festival</li>\n<li>Shoulder season</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nApril sees the weather break, but the heaviest rain is yet to come. When it does, getting around by road can be more difficult, but Ghana in April is still good for wildlife, and travel deals. The Ga people of Greater Accra celebrate Homowo, or laughing at hunger, which commemorates a time of famine and seeks to avoid another by placating the gods with many traditional rituals and prayers.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Low season</li>\n<li>Wet and humid</li>\n<li>Mosquitos</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nGhana in May holds little appeal. This month sees heavy rain throughout the country, particularly in the south. Some intrepid travellers are tempted by the prospect of going north, given that the rains lower temperatures there slightly, but it is also humid, and youll encounter plenty of mosquitos. Another strike against May is that some roads may be washed out, impeding travel.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Accra</li>\n<li>Wettest month</li>\n<li>Flooding in north</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nThink lightweight, easy-drying clothes if you travel to Ghana in June. This is the wettest month in Ghana, and one of the worst times to travel. In the north, which is hot and dry for much of the year, flooding is a serious risk. Its a different picture in the south, which tends to have two wet seasons every year. By late-June it is usually much drier on the coast, making travel perfectly pleasant.\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Panafest (biannual)</li>\n<li>Dry in south</li>\n<li>Cool(ish) in north</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nThe wet weather briefly relents in southern Ghana in July. The north remains sodden, but with temperatures falling to the low 30s°C travel here is not an unattractive prospect. If venturing to the south, bear in mind that every other year people flock from across the continent and further afield for Panafest, a moving celebration of African culture and a reminder of the historical slave trade.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Coldest month</li>\n<li>Variable weather</li>\n<li>Founders Day</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nWhile its rarely cool in Ghana, August is the coolest month of the year, though daytime temperatures in the north still top 30°C. Ghana in August is marked with changeable weather  but generally think hot and dry in the south, wet and slightly milder in the north. August also sees Founders Day, commemorating Ghanas struggle for independence from British colonial rule.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Harvest festivals</li>\n<li>Rains in south</li>\n<li>Shoulder season</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nSeptember can be a good time of year to visit Ghana, especially the north where temperatures are marginally lower than normal. Ghana in September is a shoulder month. Its not quite the dry season yet, and the south is entering another brief rainy period, but its definitely fine to travel. There are fewer tourists around, and a lot of lively harvest festivals taking place around the country.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Rains slowing</li>\n<li>Wildlife viewing</li>\n<li>Coffee harvest</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nOctober is a good time to visit Ghana. Its drying out in the south, and the rains are also slowing in northern and central regions. Ghana in October is popular for wildlife watching, and there are lots of migratory birds around. But its also a great month for cultural tours  coffee plantations are in harvest, and rural communities are full of life.<div style=\"margin-top: 15px;\"></div>\n<bullet><b>October is a great for our</b> <a href=\"/holiday/4003/cultural-history-holiday-in-ghana\">cultural history holiday</a></bullet><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>High and dry season</li>\n<li>Harmattan winds</li>\n<li>Hogbetsotso Festival</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nGhana in November is distinguished by the harmattan winds that blow south from the Sahara and continue until March. They can cool things down a little, but they can also result in tickly throats and itchy eyes, as well as poor visibility which inhibits photography and can even delay flights. This is the dry season, though, and November is a great time to travel to Ghana especially for wildlife watching.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>AfroFuture Festival</li>\n<li>Mole National Park</li>\n<li>Busy hotels</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nDecember is a good time to visit Ghana, with fewer mosquitos and sunny weather. Accra sees temperatures around 32°C as it hosts the vibrant AfroFuture Festival  dress to impress. And as Christmas approaches, many Ghanaians visit from abroad. Hotels and flights are busy, but with festive celebrations around the country Ghana in December has much to offer cultural travellers.",

    "title6": "Our travellers also ask",
    "paragraph6": "",
    "title7": "What is the best month to travel to Ghana?",
    "paragraph7": "<b>The best month to visit Ghana is January</b>, midway through the dry season, when travel around the country is easy and there is excellent wildlife watching to be had in Mole National Park. You could also make a good case for October. At the tail end of the rainy season, holidays in October wont be affected by the harmattan winds. Humidity is lower, and there are harvest festivals around the country where visitors are very welcome.",
    "title8": "What is the rainy season in Ghana?",
    "paragraph8": "<b>Ghanas rainy season is between April and September</b>, though it varies depending on where you are in the country. In the centre and south of Ghana, rains usually fall in April, May and June, with a brief respite from July to August. There is then a shorter rainy season in September, October and the first half of November. In the more desert-like north, the rains arrive from March to September. Thanks to the dry earth, when the rain does fall it can cause terrible flooding and blocked roads.",
    "title9": "What is the cheapest time of year to go to Ghana?",
    "paragraph9": "<b>April to September can be the cheapest time to visit Ghana.</b> This is the rainy season, when travel in the interior can sometimes be difficult due to flooding that damages roads. But that doesnt stop visitors from coming, as the rains bring relief from the perpetual heat, and lush foliage. You can also often find travel deals in shoulder months like September, where the rains are dying down but the peak dry season is still some way off.",
    "title10": "What is the hottest month in Ghana?",
    "paragraph10": "<b>March is the hottest month in Ghana.</b> The countrys low altitude and proximity to the equator gives it a typical tropical climate. Daytime temperatures are high throughout the year, approaching or topping 30°C on most days, and humidity is generally upwards of 80 percent along the coast. In northern Ghana, March can often bring daytime temperatures above 40°C, as well as intermittent showers and storms with the fast-approaching rainy season."
