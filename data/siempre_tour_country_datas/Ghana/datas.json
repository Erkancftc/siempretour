        "Main_Paragraph": "Our Ghana holidays are a fantastic way to explore the distinctive and vibrant cultural heritage of this West African nation, from tribal festivals and funerals that welcome visitors, to craft villages and the chance to meet a community of so-called witches and learn about their lives. As well as visiting locations such as Accra, the Cape Coast, and the wildlife-rich Mole National Park, our Ghana tours also take you to many less-visited parts of the country where rural communities benefit substantially from tourism. Around Ashanti, our holidays have contributed to the building of a school for almost 300 village children who previously had no access to formal education. And on the Cape Coast, our trips support a vocational foundation working with vulnerable Cape Coast children who sleep on the streets and do not attend school. Our walking holidays are a great way to enjoy some relaxed cultural immersion. Our trips financially contribute to tree-planting projects that not only help protect the environment, such as by preventing coastal erosion, but also provide income for local communities.",

        "Title1": "Ashanti",
        "Paragraph1": "The Ashanti region, in southern Ghana, is known for its craftsmanship. There are several craft villages, including Adanwomase, Ahwiaa, and Ntonso, dotted around the regional capital, Kumasi, where you can visit workshops for kente weaving, textile printing and wood carving, among other skills. You can learn the meanings and stories behind different designs, pick up unique souvenirs that support local creators, and even have a go yourself.\nThe Ashanti festival of Akwasidae takes place on a Sunday every six weeks, for people to honour their ancestors with dancing, drumming and song. The king and chiefs are out in their gold and finery, and visitors are welcome  you may even be invited to meet with one of the chiefs.",
        "image1": "",
        "Title2": "Mole National Park",
        "Paragraph2": "Ghana is more of a destination for the cultural traveller than the safari-goer, but Mole National Park in the north of the country is home to some of the last remaining elephants in West Africa. On our walking safaris you can admire the elephants along with wildlife including antelopes, warthogs, baboons and other monkeys. You can also see some immense termite mounds, fascinating natural construction that can be as wide as 30m across.\nMole is also a first-class location for birders, with more than 300 identified species in the park including egrets, flycatchers, martial eagles and white-headed vultures. There are concerns here about poaching and illegal rosewood logging in Mole. By visiting, tourists help to encourage wildlife protection and conservation.",
        "image2": "",
        "Title3": "Ghanaian culture",
        "Paragraph3": "To Ghanaians, funerals, particularly those of elderly people, are not sad events. Death is seen as a natural part of life, and family members believe they will be reunited in the afterlife. As such, funerals in Ghana arent sombre affairs, but a chance to celebrate someones life with dancing and colourful dress. If you receive an invite to attend one  dont pass it up. Ghanaians advertise their funerals and its an honour for guests to come and help celebrate the deceased.\nOne of the most unusual aspects of Ghanaian funerals are the fantasy coffins; bespoke coffins are constructed for important members of society. A pilot may be sent off in a giant wooden plane; a teacher in a giant pen. If you cant attend a funeral, try and arrange a visit to a coffin workshop in Accra, where these works of art are painstakingly carved from hardwood by hand.\nTribal culture is still very much at the heart of Ghanaian life, and there are few better ways to experience it than by visiting a traditional festival. Held every May in Winneba on the coast, the Aboakyer Festival is a commemoration of the Efutu and Winneba peoples migration to Ghana. Visitors are invited to watch the ceremonial deer hunt, as well as to take part in the ritual feasting, dancing and drumming.\nOther opportunities to explore Ghanaian culture on our holidays including market visits, where you might buy a length of cloth and chat to the stallholder about the meaning of the adinkra symbols or how the batik is made. Our local guides can help you take your fabric to a local seamstress and she can make a shirt or trousers or dress in your chosen style. Alternatively, you might head to a kente workshop to see the weavers working on long, narrow looms, and learn about the symbolism behind this heavy fabric that adorns kings and chiefs to this day.\nIn northern Ghana around Mole you can spend time with a womens cooperative as they make shea butter, and learn about the process of extracting the fat from the shea tree nut. You can see how the nuts are washed, pounded and roasted, turned into a paste, purified and heated to extract the vitamin-rich oils, a process which has been carried out in much the same way for centuries.",
        "Title4": "Walking",
        "Paragraph4": "Our walking holidays are a chance to explore Ghanaian nature and culture at a relaxed pace, allowing for a greater degree of immersion. You can trek between fishing villages on the Cape Three Points peninsula, staying in a succession of eco lodges. Youll be walking on trails used for centuries by the Ahanta people to negotiate passage through bamboo forest, and plantations of coconut and rubber. When not on the trail your options include everything from a canoe safari in search of crocodiles, to a Ghanaian cookery lesson.\nYou can also walk in the Volta region, perhaps pausing to try rock climbing in the Shai Hills Game Reserve, which is home to zebras, baboons and antelopes, or to cool off with a dip beneath the Wli Waterfalls, the highest in Ghana.\nWhile walking youll be accompanied throughout by brilliant guides from the communities youre passing through, which allows for plenty of conversation and cultural insight.",

        "Main_Paragraph": "Ghanas location close to the equator means it does not experience huge variations in temperature throughout the year; seasons are instead dictated by rain and wind. The best time to visit Ghana is the dry season, from October to March. Thanks to its largely paved roads, Ghana is one of the easiest West African countries to travel through in the wet season  but rain does make travel less pleasant, and summer is hot and very sticky. Wildlife is easier to spot in Mole National Park when its dry, with elephants seen particularly between December and March. Be aware of the arid harmattan wind, though, which blows in from the Sahara from December.",

In Mole National Park wildlife including elephants and hippos congregate around water. Lions are less common, but dry season makes it easier to spot them. The harmattan winds blow sand from the Sahara  pack sunglasses and face scarves.<div style=\"margin-top: 15px;\"></div>\n<bullet><b>January is great for our</b> <a href=\"/holiday/15355/ghana-togo-and-benin-holiday-gold-and-magic\">Ghana, Togo and Benin holiday</a></bullet><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Walking</li>\n<li>Beach breaks</li>\n<li>Hot, dry and sunny</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nGhana in February is fantastic for walking, particularly in the south, whether between caves and waterfalls in the mountainous Volta region, or beaches and fishing villages on the coast. February is warm and dry, the Sahara winds dying down, and visibility improves both for walkers and for those catching some rays on gorgeous beaches such as those of Ada Foah.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Hottest month</li>\n<li>Sporadic rain</li>\n<li>Peak season ending</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nMarch is the hottest month in Ghana. Temperatures nudge 30°C on the south coast but can top 40°C further north. You can feel the rain in the air in Ghana in March, so do expect the occasional shower, especially in central regions, with the north seeing storms of increasing strength and frequency from later in the month. Squalls  short, powerful bursts of wind, are also likely.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Rains begin</li>\n<li>Homowo Festival</li>\n<li>Shoulder season</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nApril sees the weather break, but the heaviest rain is yet to come. When it does, getting around by road can be more difficult, but Ghana in April is still good for wildlife, and travel deals. The Ga people of Greater Accra celebrate Homowo, or laughing at hunger, which commemorates a time of famine and seeks to avoid another by placating the gods with many traditional rituals and prayers.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Low season</li>\n<li>Wet and humid</li>\n<li>Mosquitos</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nGhana in May holds little appeal. This month sees heavy rain throughout the country, particularly in the south. Some intrepid travellers are tempted by the prospect of going north, given that the rains lower temperatures there slightly, but it is also humid, and youll encounter plenty of mosquitos. Another strike against May is that some roads may be washed out, impeding travel.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Accra</li>\n<li>Wettest month</li>\n<li>Flooding in north</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nThink lightweight, easy-drying clothes if you travel to Ghana in June. This is the wettest month in Ghana, and one of the worst times to travel. In the north, which is hot and dry for much of the year, flooding is a serious risk. Its a different picture in the south, which tends to have two wet seasons every year. By late-June it is usually much drier on the coast, making travel perfectly pleasant.\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Panafest (biannual)</li>\n<li>Dry in south</li>\n<li>Cool(ish) in north</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nThe wet weather briefly relents in southern Ghana in July. The north remains sodden, but with temperatures falling to the low 30s°C travel here is not an unattractive prospect. If venturing to the south, bear in mind that every other year people flock from across the continent and further afield for Panafest, a moving celebration of African culture and a reminder of the historical slave trade.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Coldest month</li>\n<li>Variable weather</li>\n<li>Founders Day</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nWhile its rarely cool in Ghana, August is the coolest month of the year, though daytime temperatures in the north still top 30°C. Ghana in August is marked with changeable weather  but generally think hot and dry in the south, wet and slightly milder in the north. August also sees Founders Day, commemorating Ghanas struggle for independence from British colonial rule.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Harvest festivals</li>\n<li>Rains in south</li>\n<li>Shoulder season</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nSeptember can be a good time of year to visit Ghana, especially the north where temperatures are marginally lower than normal. Ghana in September is a shoulder month. Its not quite the dry season yet, and the south is entering another brief rainy period, but its definitely fine to travel. There are fewer tourists around, and a lot of lively harvest festivals taking place around the country.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Rains slowing</li>\n<li>Wildlife viewing</li>\n<li>Coffee harvest</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nOctober is a good time to visit Ghana. Its drying out in the south, and the rains are also slowing in northern and central regions. Ghana in October is popular for wildlife watching, and there are lots of migratory birds around. But its also a great month for cultural tours  coffee plantations are in harvest, and rural communities are full of life.<div style=\"margin-top: 15px;\"></div>\n<bullet><b>October is a great for our</b> <a href=\"/holiday/4003/cultural-history-holiday-in-ghana\">cultural history holiday</a></bullet><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>High and dry season</li>\n<li>Harmattan winds</li>\n<li>Hogbetsotso Festival</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nGhana in November is distinguished by the harmattan winds that blow south from the Sahara and continue until March. They can cool things down a little, but they can also result in tickly throats and itchy eyes, as well as poor visibility which inhibits photography and can even delay flights. This is the dry season, though, and November is a great time to travel to Ghana especially for wildlife watching.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>AfroFuture Festival</li>\n<li>Mole National Park</li>\n<li>Busy hotels</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nDecember is a good time to visit Ghana, with fewer mosquitos and sunny weather. Accra sees temperatures around 32°C as it hosts the vibrant AfroFuture Festival  dress to impress. And as Christmas approaches, many Ghanaians visit from abroad. Hotels and flights are busy, but with festive celebrations around the country Ghana in December has much to offer cultural travellers.",

        "title10": "What is the hottest month in Ghana?",
        "paragraph10": "<b>March is the hottest month in Ghana.</b> The countrys low altitude and proximity to the equator gives it a typical tropical climate. Daytime temperatures are high throughout the year, approaching or topping 30°C on most days, and humidity is generally upwards of 80 percent along the coast. In northern Ghana, March can often bring daytime temperatures above 40°C, as well as intermittent showers and storms with the fast-approaching rainy season."
