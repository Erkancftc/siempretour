        "Main_Paragraph": "Youll find the Svalbard Archipelago up where the Arctic Ocean meets the Atlantic, far north of mainland northern Norway. At first, Spitsbergen, the largest and only inhabited island in the archipelago, presents a forbidding prospect  a polar-bear stalked island where its dark for half the year, and reaches average temperature lows of -20°C. But come in early spring on our Spitsbergen holidays for a little more daylight, for the chance to see the Northern Lights dazzling overhead as you explore on land beneath by husky sled or snowmobile. In the summer months, the sun barely sets, the islands sea ice melts away, and on small ship cruises round the island, you can watch the waters and shores erupt with bird and marine life. Our Spitsbergen holidays dont shy away from the big issues; guides can tell you about the impacts of climate change and the importance of conservation, all whilst ensuring your holiday benefits nature and communities as you go.",

        "Title1": "Svalbard Archipelago",
        "Paragraph1": "The Svalbard Archipelago consists of the main island of Spitsbergen, the only inhabited island, and smaller islands, including Nordaustlandet, Edgeoya, Barentsoya, which are nature reserves, and more remote, smaller islands. The best way to explore the archipelago beyond Spitsbergen is by small ship cruise, where you might find areas abandoned by people – like old whaling settlements, or brimming with wildlife – like long-established bird and walrus colonies. With a population of around 3,000 people, most in Longyearbyen, the capital, Spitsbergen is a place with few roads and few settlements where wilderness is easy to find, but difficult to navigate. Leaving the towns by snowmobile, you must travel armed in case of polar bears. Whether you go by land or sea, it’s an exciting place for a holiday.",
        "image1": "",
        "Title2": "Wildlife watching",
        "Paragraph2": "If you thought the snow was white, wait until a pod of beluga whales surface by your boat in the icy waters around Spitsbergen. And if you thought a snowmobile was noisy, wait until you meet a massive colony of seabirds on a cliff  like guillemot-laden Alkefjellet. Svalbard is one of the best places in the world to see arctic wildlife and famously has a population of around 3,000 resident polar bears who roam the archipelago. Then there are walruses, whales, and little arctic foxes. Our Spitsbergen holidays not only follow the strict guidelines for wildlife viewing and cruising on the islands, but make monetary contributions to conservation charities when you book, and also support local bird protection and waste removal projects.",
        "image2": "",
        "Title3": "Small ship cruises",
        "Paragraph3": "Breaking the ice around the island, finding whales breaching the surface near the bow, sailing deep into fjords and disembarking for hikes: think of touring Spitsbergen by boat as an expedition, rather than a cruise.  The best way to see wildlife might be by small ship cruise, rather than bigger boat, where Zodiac trips from the main vessel get you even closer to the shore. Small boats are quicker to disembark, meaning you can spend more time exploring on land. Our small ship cruises are led by experts  marine biologists, scientists and, on our photography-centred trips, expert artists. Expect illuminating on-board lectures in between all manner of exciting sightings.",
        "Title4": "Dog sledding",
        "Paragraph4": "Ever had six huge huskies howling in happiness to see you? Sledding, the original way of getting round Spitsbergen is surely still the best, especially if youre a dog person. On our Spitsbergen holidays you can learn to drive your own sled and then take it on an epic expedition  covering distances of 50 km a day through the snow  getting off to push on inclines and through drifts  before setting up camp each night. Our overland sledding holidays strive to be as low impact as possible, through responsible camping, but also in choosing accommodation that runs on renewable energy sources and local food as much as possible  whether thats solar panels in Spitsbergens long summers, or locally-brewed beer and arctic delicacies: reindeer sausage and smoked seal.",

        "Main_Paragraph": "The best time to visit Spitsbergen is midsummer, when the sun never dips below the horizon  though it never quite warms the chilly landscape, either. The ice floes disperse, allowing ships to cruise right around the island, and July-Aug is prime polar bear viewing season. The endless days allow for plenty of wildlife watching amid the wildflowers, plus activities such as kayaking or diving  though there is little snow. For winter sports, choose April or May, when the island is still ice-clad, days are longer and there are few other visitors; the Northern Lights make their appearance from late Sep.",

        "when_to_go_html": "<bullet>Think of winter in two parts. You have the dark polar night from around <b>mid November to late January</b>, which is pitch dark around the clock  broken up only by the Northern Lights. Not surprisingly, you dont get many holidays during this time. The other part of winter is sometimes called sunny winter which is when the sun comes up over the horizon again around the <b>beginning of March</b>. It is still totally snow covered, however.</bullet>\n<bullet>There is a stunning period before and after polar night, which is generally in <b>February and early October</b>. This is, for many photographers, the best time to visit Spitsbergen, as there is a sort of blue light everywhere, pre-empting total darkness. You can still see the Northern Lights during this time as well. </bullet>\n<bullet><b>March, April and May</b> in Spitsbergen bring blue skies, longer days and freezing temperatures. This is a great time for outdoor activities such as snowmobiling and husky mushing as the sea is still frozen. But you need high quality winter gear to be out there in the cold; tour operators provide this. During these months, the daytime sky is often a pastel pink, which is superb for photography. The midnight sun season starts around <b>20 April</b> and continues right through until <b>late August</b>.</bullet>\n<bullet>Polar summer kicks in <b>17 May</b> until end of <b>September</b>. This is the best time for small ship cruises or sea kayaking, and also for sighting wildlife, including polar bears, polar foxes and reindeer. </bullet>\n<bullet>Just to put things into perspective, the normal summer months of <b>July and August</b> mean that temperatures may deign to go over the zero mark. However, the Arctic winds do calm a lot during this time, as does rainfall.</bullet>\n<bullet>If you are considering a <b>December</b> trip to Spitsbergen, and it is possible, be prepared to do activities with head torches but also for the strong possibility of Northern Lights. It is also a good idea to check the lunar calendar, as a full moon will bleach out the lights.</bullet>",

        "paragraph2": "My personal favourite aspect of Spitsbergen is June and July when there are plenty of birds and wildlife in the area. For example, Isfjord Radio has a bird sanctuary right outside the door, which also means the foxes coming by every morning and evening to hunt for eggs. During summer we also have the midnight sun.",
        "title3": "",
        "paragraph3": "The seasons are very different. In June, theres a lot of snow and ice, so youre able only to visit parts of Spitsbergen. As the season goes on, you get a melting of the ice so you can do a circumnavigation. Its a longer trip and youre getting very different aspects of the Arctic. By September, theres no longer 24-hour daylight; youll get more evening time. The birdlife stays from around June into early September  theres a lot of food around and the breeding activity is really high. So you have to think: what do I want to see? How long do I want to be there? Which parts do I want to explore?",
        "title4": "",
        "paragraph4": "Our summer voyages to the Arctic are in 24 hours of daylight! This makes for stunning wildlife viewing  but expect to get woken up at 3am if we see polar bears on the horizon or a pod of whales emerging from the bows of the ship."
