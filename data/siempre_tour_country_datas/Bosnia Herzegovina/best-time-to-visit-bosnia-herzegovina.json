    "Main_Paragraph": "For hiking, the best time to go to Bosnia-Herzegovina is May, June or September, as it is less hot, although it never maxes out the thermometer in the same way as neighbouring Croatia. In winter you can have snow for up to six months, but February and March are perfect, with more sunshine and clearer days to take in the views. Sarajevo is surrounded by mountains, so always bring a coat, as you can get four seasons in a day. For hiking, spring brings a fiesta of fresh flora, and autumn sees the ancient woodland cover the gamut of glorious reds and gold.",

Better to have multiple layers to take on and off, and check the conditions before you go. Also, it can get surprisingly hot in summer, perhaps not something people associate with BiH (it can of course have changeable mountain weather too, and rain etc) so youll need a different set of duds for walking around Sarajevo in August to when scaling Maglic, which is of course pretty high.",
