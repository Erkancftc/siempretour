        "Main_Paragraph": "Our Guatemala holidays are just gorgeous. Mayan archaeology abounds at famous Tikal, Topoxte and Yaxha ruins. For those who want nature, trek through cloud forest up to volcanic peaks in the Zunil mountains. Lake Atitlan, enveloped by volcanoes and Indigenous lands is close to ethereal. And yes, Pacific beaches await too. Our Guatemala holidays don’t just show you a good time, but ensure your trip is doing good, too, whether that’s by visiting inspiring textile cooperatives, supporting local markets, meeting the Maya community or using local guides at archaeological sites, who will take you off the beaten track on routes designed to avoid the crowds.",
        "Subtitle": "Guatemala holiday highlights",
        "Title1": "Follow the Ruta Maya",
        "Paragraph1": "Guatemala sits squarely on the Ruta Maya, running through the Yucatán Peninsula and Belize. The incredible archaeological site of Tikal shows the power of the Mayan civilisation. A sprawling city that stretched through many kilometres of jungle, much of which is still being excavated, there are five towering temples to climb for a panoramic view over the site. Less well known is the site of Iximché, capital of an ancient Kaqchikel Maya kingdom, with pyramids, temples and evidence of human sacrifice.",
        "image1": "",
        "Title2": "Take an overland tour",
        "Paragraph2": "If you are lucky enough to have two weeks holiday or longer, then make the most of Central Americas tightly clustered borders and cross over into Mexicos Yucatán Peninsula for more Mayan exploration at Tulum and Chichen Itzá, at as well as a dip in a cenote. Travel overland to Belize, where you can relax on paradise cays, snorkel or scuba.\nBelize also hides a Mayan underworld in the incredible Actun Tunichil Muknal Cave  complete with ancient ceramics and the calcified and crystallised skeletal remains of sacrifice victims. A longer tour can take you all the way along the isthmus, through Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica, to the Panama Canal, using a combination of public transport, minibuses and purpose built overland vehicles. These little countries may seem superficially similar, but when you begin to look beneath the surface, they each have their own unique histories, indigenous cultures, coasts, jungles and wildlife.\nThese tours are made even easier by the Shengen-style Central America Border Control Agreement, which means that tourists can cross borders between Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua for 90 days without lengthy entry and exit formalities.",
        "image2": "",
        "Title3": "Meet the Maya",
        "Paragraph3": "Maya is not a homogenous term; over 21 Mayan languages are spoken in Guatemala alone, and the elaborately embroidered textiles and clothing will vary from community to community. Visitors can meet the Maya in thriving textile and food markets, during homestays and during village tours, particularly around Lake Atitlán, in which you might learn to grind blue corn or weave reed mats.",
        "Title4": "Spend time on the water",
        "Paragraph4": "Beaches may not feature in a Guate itinerary, but there are plenty of opportunities to spend time on the water. Cruise down the Río Dulce to Livingston to meet the Garifuna people and look out for manatees in the mangroves. Kayak around Lake Atitlán, or boat across the lake beneath the looming volcanoes. Take a dip in the pristine natural pools of Semuc Champey, with Coban as your base, soaking up those jungle views.\nYou can also try some tubing – underground – in the vast Candelaria Caves, one of the largest cave systems in Latin America. Bob gently along the river connecting the seven caves in the darkness, with guides from the local Mayan community leading the way.",

        "Main_Paragraph": "The best time to visit Guatemala is Nov-Apr, when the rain ceases and the sun shines. Christmas and Easter holidays are very busy, so book well ahead if travelling at this time  especially for Antigua. The May-Oct rainy season is still warm but very humid, especially in lower regions including Tikal and Petén, and road travel can be disrupted. Rains usually fall in the afternoon and evening  so make the most of your mornings! Nov is a good month to travel as the scenery remains green, and All Saints Day on Nov 1st is worth experiencing  without being as crazy as celebrations in neighbouring Mexico.",

        "when_to_go_html": "<b>The rainy season typically lasts from May to October</b>, but in some regions it can continue until November or even as late as December  particularly around Petén, which is hot and stuffy all year round.<br/><br/>\n<b>December, January and February are damp and cool in the highlands</b>  with cold nights in the highest regions. Bring very warm layers if travelling here  at any time of year. <br/><br/>\r\nThe mid-elevation regions, such as Antigua and Lake Atitlán, live up to <b>Guatemalas reputation as the Land of the Eternal Spring </b>, with warm, sunny days, refreshing nights and low humidity. <br/><br/>\r\nIf you are tied to travelling in the holiday season, then <b>the March or April Easter break is one of the best times to go to Guatemala</b> as temperatures begin to warm up and the rains are still a way off. <br/><br/>\r\nSchool summer holidays in July and August are possible too, depending on your itinerary  <b>the heaviest rainfall occurs in September and October</b>. Often during the rainy season, the rain will fall during a couple of hours. Your holiday company and tour leader will be aware of this and will plan itineraries accordingly. <br/><br/>\r\nIf travelling during the peak seasons of December and January, the Easter spring break, or July and August, be sure to book well in advance as it can get busy. <b>Expect to pay higher prices at these times, too</b>. <br/><br/>\n<b>If travelling on a tighter budget, May and June can be a good time to explore Guatemala</b>  without the crowds and high prices of Easter and midsummer, or the heavier downpours in autumn. <br/><br/>\n<b>El Día de Todos los Santos  All Saints Day  takes place on 1st November</b>. While not quite as huge a celebration as in neighbouring Mexico (the Day of the Dead falls the following day), there are plenty of smaller events taking place around the country, as families spend time in cemeteries remembering loved ones, prepare a special dish called fiambre, and fly extraordinary, huge kites. This is a busy time, and some places may shut down.",

        "paragraph2": "As part of the celebrations on November 1st, elaborate, colourful kites are created from paper, fabric and bamboo. As these enormous artworks  some spanning over 20 metres  fill the skies, they are said to connect Guatemalans with their deceased ancestors. The kites designs allow family members to be recognised from the afterlife, as well as sharing political and cultural messages. Following traditions dating back over 2,000 years, the kites will later be burned near cemeteries. Head to Santiago Sacatepéquez and Sumpango for the most extravagant celebrations."
