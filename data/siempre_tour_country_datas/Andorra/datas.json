        "Main_Paragraph": "Our Andorra holidays take you beyond its ski resorts and show you the country behind all the glamour and powder, for low impact hiking, mountain biking and rafting holidays in this portion of the Pyrenees. This independent state has an area of just 468 km², a population of less than 80,000 and more than 10,000 years of history. Tucked between Spain and France, with 65 peaks over 2,000m high, the country is known internationally for its ski resorts, yet the rugged landscape, mountain lakes, steep valleys, and sub-Mediterranean climate make our Andorra holidays an ideal summer escape, too. Our local guides will show you how to get the very best out of the mountainsides.",
        "Subtitle": "Andorra highlights",
        "Title1": "1. Incles Valley",
        "Paragraph1": "Walk right out of Soldeu and into the pine forests of the Incles Valley, an idyllic region for hiking. Rhododendrons paint the landscape in June, with forest fruits ripening late into the summer. Keep an eye out for mountain horses  with bells around their necks  as you ascend to the picturesque Cabana Sorda Lake at 2,300m, set beneath a natural rock amphitheatre, or brave the trek to a nearby summit at 2,600m.",
        "image1": "",
        "Title2": "2. The Iron Route",
        "Paragraph2": "Linking up the old iron mines, mills and forges that lie at the foot of the Pyrenees, the Ruta del Ferro  the Iron Route  is now a car-free dirt track which is perfect for easy mountain biking. The countryside here is lush, green and bucolic  with a more dramatic backdrop of snow capped peaks. Rides finish in the very pretty medieval town of Ordino at the foot of the Casamanya Mountain.",
        "image2": "",
        "Title3": "3. Siscaró Lake",
        "Paragraph3": "Around the stunning, high altitude Siscaró Lake is one of the best regions for walking in Andorra. There are in fact 13 lakes within the vicinity, many of which you can swim in. Drive high into the mountains and summit its peak, Pic Maia, before spending the rest of the day on an often steep descent, admiring the Pyrenean views and looking out for resident marmots and griffon vultures.",
        "Title4": "4. Vallnord Pal  Arinsal",
        "Paragraph4": "Vallnord Mountain Park, at the top of the cable car from La Massana, is a one stop shop for thrilling activities in Andorra. Its hiking and mountain bike routes are of varying difficulty and take in high mountain lakes, flowing rivers and alpine meadows. For a greater adrenaline rush, try the rope swings, mountain cart descents or husky mushing for something a bit different in this stunning setting.",
        "image3": "",
        "Title5": "5. Soldeu",
        "Paragraph5": "This ski resort is a convenient base for activity holidays throughout the year  and is so much more than a place to pose on the pistes. The glorious winter sunshine here provides the perfect opportunity to snow shoe or cross country ski through the surrounding Christmas card landscapes  or even learn how to drive your own pack of dogs for an exhilarating sled ride along a forest trail.",
        "Title6": "6. White water rafting",
        "Paragraph6": "Cross a breathtakingly high mountain pass into Spain and spend a day whitewater rafting on Noguera Pallaresa  a world-renowned Catalonian river. You can arrive here by biking downhill  or relax and enjoy the scenic drive. You dont need previous rafting experience to participate in the exhilarating 14km route with rapids up to Class III, and all clothing and safety equipment is provided."

        "Main_Paragraph": "The best time to go to Andorra is from May to mid-July, and in September, when youll benefit from the Mediterranean sunshine and warmer weather on the Pyrenean slopes. June sees rhododendrons in full bloom, with fruits ripening midsummer and mushrooms emerging in autumn. Winter trips here take advantage of the heavy snow and blue skies, with opportunities to explore snow clad landscapes on snow shoes or cross country skis.",

        "title2": "Why choose Andorra?",
        "paragraph2": "Andorra is quite unique as it is bordered and surrounded by both France and Spain but has managed to keep its independence over the years. Andorra has a great mixture of rural high altitude mountains and a very modern and stylish capital city. It is one of the average highest areas in the Pyrenees and Spain, making it great for skiing in the winter, but as it is south along the Pyrenean range and close to the Mediterranean sea it enjoys many days of sunshine and it makes it a perfect climate for summer activities averaging most days in the 20°Cs - very comfortable for walking and biking throughout the day.",
        "title3": "Family travel tips",
        "paragraph3": "Andorra is one large playground. Its largest industry is tourism and with skiing as its backbone things are set up and designed to be ideal for families, with a large range of fun activities from hiking to off road biking and then zip wires, rafting (just over the border in Spain), rock climbing, tax free shopping and its famous spa centre the Caldea. It is a great place for families not wanting a beach holiday but wanting plenty of entertainment.",
        "title4": "The best time to go to Andorra",
        "paragraph4": "Being at high altitude, spring arrives late here; so the most amazing time to visit is in June when the mountain are a technicolour of wild flowers  though being spring you can expect a few wet days. July is still green, many flowers are still around and with the drier weather it would probably be the best month; however, even though it can be a little hotter in August, it is never too hot to enjoy.",
        "title5": "Basing yourself in Soldeu",
        "paragraph5": "My personal favourite place is Soldeu where the hotel is located  right on the door step we have Incles Valley with many marked treks up to the numerous mountain lakes and the then possibilities of scrambling up to a peak of nearly 3,000m, and then on the opposite side of the valley we have the ski resort which have lifts open in the summer for mountain biking. Soldeu is also only a 30min bus ride to the capital where there are shops, a spa centre and plenty of great restaurants  all you would find in a modern city."
