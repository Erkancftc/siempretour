    "Main_Paragraph": "The best time to go to Andorra is from May to mid-July, and in September, when youll benefit from the Mediterranean sunshine and warmer weather on the Pyrenean slopes. June sees rhododendrons in full bloom, with fruits ripening midsummer and mushrooms emerging in autumn. Winter trips here take advantage of the heavy snow and blue skies, with opportunities to explore snow clad landscapes on snow shoes or cross country skis.",

    "title2": "Why choose Andorra?",
    "paragraph2": "Andorra is quite unique as it is bordered and surrounded by both France and Spain but has managed to keep its independence over the years. Andorra has a great mixture of rural high altitude mountains and a very modern and stylish capital city. It is one of the average highest areas in the Pyrenees and Spain, making it great for skiing in the winter, but as it is south along the Pyrenean range and close to the Mediterranean sea it enjoys many days of sunshine and it makes it a perfect climate for summer activities averaging most days in the 20°Cs - very comfortable for walking and biking throughout the day.",
    "title3": "Family travel tips",
    "paragraph3": "Andorra is one large playground. Its largest industry is tourism and with skiing as its backbone things are set up and designed to be ideal for families, with a large range of fun activities from hiking to off road biking and then zip wires, rafting (just over the border in Spain), rock climbing, tax free shopping and its famous spa centre the Caldea. It is a great place for families not wanting a beach holiday but wanting plenty of entertainment.",
    "title4": "The best time to go to Andorra",
    "paragraph4": "Being at high altitude, spring arrives late here; so the most amazing time to visit is in June when the mountain are a technicolour of wild flowers  though being spring you can expect a few wet days. July is still green, many flowers are still around and with the drier weather it would probably be the best month; however, even though it can be a little hotter in August, it is never too hot to enjoy.",
    "title5": "Basing yourself in Soldeu",
    "paragraph5": "My personal favourite place is Soldeu where the hotel is located  right on the door step we have Incles Valley with many marked treks up to the numerous mountain lakes and the then possibilities of scrambling up to a peak of nearly 3,000m, and then on the opposite side of the valley we have the ski resort which have lifts open in the summer for mountain biking. Soldeu is also only a 30min bus ride to the capital where there are shops, a spa centre and plenty of great restaurants  all you would find in a modern city."
