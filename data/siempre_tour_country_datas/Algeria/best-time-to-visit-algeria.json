    "Main_Paragraph": "Algeria's coast, including Algiers and Oran, has a fairly typical Mediterranean climate so expect it to be hot from June-September; however, it's certainly not as hot as the desert regions to the south where temperatures rocket to unbearable levels. The best time to visit Algeria for a Saharan safari is April-May or October-November as conditions are less fierce and the rest of the country is dry and relatively warm. October also coincides with the annual date harvest, whilst in spring the hillsides of the north bound with new life and there are far fewer crowds around key cultural sites and beach resorts.",

    "paragraph1": "<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<bullet>From the ancient amphitheatre in Djémila to Trajan's Arch in Timgad, no <b>history tour of Algeria</b> would be complete without finding out more about the Roman Empire's foray into North Africa. Algeria's archaeological and UNESCO sites are dotted across the country with Algiers, Constantine, Tiddis and Oran offering endless historical intrigue as well as a chance to witness the French, Roman and Moorish influences that still play an important part in the country's cultural landscape today.</bullet>\n<bullet>Presiding over roofs adorned with satellite dishes, aerials and corrugated iron, the<b> Kasbah of Algiers</b> stands as testament to the strategic town planning of previous centuries. Today, 50,000 people live within its walls. Going on a guided tour of one of the world's largest kasbahs leads you past the mosques, souks and hammams, many decorated with beautiful tiles.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>Trips into the Sahara</b> on the Circuit de Sebkha offer an incredible experience. The Grand Erg Occidental (erg = continuous desert) covers an area large enough to be seen from space. Oasis towns of Taghit, Beni Abbes and Timimoun, once the battlegrounds for Algeria's most legendary scraps between Berber tribes and the French army, provide great starting points. Explore their mud brick houses, twisting streets and weather-beaten, ksars (castles).</bullet>",

    "paragraph2": "Most visits are trouble free, however terrorism is sadly a reality of travelling in these times.\nAlgeria has suffered at the hands of terrorists activities for many years. Its complex history of violence dates back to its independence from France in 1962. Over recent years, the threat has been from Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL), with attacks against the state, and very occasionally against civilians.\nAlways get up to date information at the\nForeign and Commonwealth Office (FCO)\ntravel advisory department before travelling to Algeria.\nThese include staying away from areas within 30km of Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger and Tunisia.",
    "title3": "",
    "paragraph3": "Although Algiers is fascinating, it would be a shame not to explore more of Algeria. Explore nearby Tipazas Roman ruins and Berber tombs prior to heading off to Oran, or in the other direction to Constantine.\nStaying in one place\nis just not the done thing in Algeria, so fly into the desert or drive overland. Algeria offers an array of historical sites and cultural treasures just waiting to be unveiled.",
    "title4": "",
    "paragraph4": "Arabic and Berber are the official languages of Algeria. Around a third of Algerians\nparlent français\nand many more understand French far better than English so dont\nforget your phrasebook.\nChat to local guides, drivers and accommodation hosts in French or Arabic, and you'll find smiles broaden and heads nod more naturally. Itll also give you the chance to haggle in the souks or order food in the streets."
