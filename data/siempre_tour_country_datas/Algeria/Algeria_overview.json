    "Main_Title": "Our Algeria holidays & tours",
    "Main_Paragraph": "Our Algeria holidays explore Africa’s largest country, from the Islamic architecture of cities like Algiers, Oran and Constantine, to the vast expanses of the Algerian Sahara Desert, where you can admire ancient rock paintings, enjoy sunset over the sand dunes, and camp out beneath an epic canvas of stars. Our holidays tread carefully: on natural landscapes, ensuring footprints are all that’s left behind in the amazing places they visit, such as Tassili n'Ajjer National Park; and in Algerian communities. Local guides are on hand to explain traditional customs and beliefs, while encounters with nomadic Bedouin people in the Sahara are always spontaneous, and on their terms.",
    "Subtitle": "Algeria highlights",
    "Title1": "1. Algiers",
    "Paragraph1": "Wind your way from the whitewashed waterfront through narrow side streets and expansive boulevards and Algiers will reveal Islamic and French colonial influences, seemingly stacked at random. Rooftop views over the Bay of Algiers from Notre Dame d'Afrique, the Kasbah and Maqam Echahid captivate, especially during the evening call to prayer.",

    "Title2": "2. Constantine",
    "Paragraph2": "Coined the 'City of Bridges' thanks to the canyon that cuts through its centre, Constantine offers an exciting yet ancient ambience. Mosque minarets stretch skywards whilst the Rhumel River flows below. Despite the dramatic setting, Constantine has remained off the tourist trail, making visits to the old town kasbah and market, and the Palace of Ahmed Bey, all the more enlightening.",

    "Title3": "3. Djémila",
    "Paragraph3": "The mountain village of Djémila boasts some of North Africa's best kept ancient ruins. An impressive Roman amphitheatre and numerous arches, columns and paved piazzas can be found straddling its slopes, some 60km inland from the sea. This is a unique example of a Roman citadel built on a mountainous landscape, and you’ll appreciate its dramatic views just as much as its ancient architecture.",
    "Title4": "4. Oran",
    "Paragraph4": "The coastal setting adds impact to a trip to Oran with the gigantic market at Medina Jedida, the 17th century mosque at Sidi El Houari and the all-encompassing views from Santa Cruz Fort, on top of Mount Murdjadjo, all to be found on a sightseeing tour of the city. Seaside resorts and ancient forts vie for space with modern structures as Oran tries to cope with an increasing number of visitors.",
    "image3": "",
    "Title5": "5. Taghit",
    "Paragraph5": "Overlooked by the dunes of the Grand Erg Occidental, the extreme conditions in which it is couched make the oasis town of Taghit, between Béchar and Beni Abess, all the more fascinating; a belt of date palms is all that stands between the buildings and the Algerian Sahara. Nearby Neolithic rock carvings and ancient mud brick houses show you the different ways of life conducted on the desert’s edge.",
    "Title6": "6. Tlemcen",
    "Paragraph6": "Amazigh (Berber), Andalucian and Moorish influences have turned Tlemcen into an epicentre for art and architecture; a fine example being the mausoleum and adjoining mosque of Sidi Boumedienne. Leather and textile workshops can also be found throughout the city. The fortified citadel of Mechouar, with its still imposing palace walls, offers a calm oasis beyond the city streets."
