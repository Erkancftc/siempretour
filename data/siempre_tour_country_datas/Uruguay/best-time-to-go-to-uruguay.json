    "Main_Paragraph": "Uruguay is a four seasons kind of country, with the sun shining from Oct-Mar, without the searing heat of the tropics further north. Youll encounter plenty of Argentine, Brazilian and Uruguayan tourists in the height of summer (late Dec-Feb), particularly around beach resorts such as Punta del Este, so Oct-mid Dec is the best time to visit Uruguay for good weather and emptier beaches. Expect crowds and price hikes around Easter and Carnival (mid-Jan to late Feb). Atlantic breezes keep temperatures mild all year, with low-mid 20°Cs in summer, and an average of 12°C in winter, but do expect fierce coastal winds.",

    "paragraph2": "David Nichols, from our partner, Journey Latin America, shares his top Uruguay travel tips:\nRemember Uruguay is a major producer of high quality wine. Plan to spend a night or two in the Carmelo region so that you can sample the local blends without having to drive. I love the province of Rocha, in eastern Uruguay. Everything is wilder, greener and even more relaxed. The coastline is perfect for long walks on the beach.",
    "title3": "Why Uruguay?",
    "paragraph3": "Uruguay is perhaps overlooked by most tourists because its a small country in a continent of giants. This is also what makes it a unique destination; unlike some larger countries you can experience its attractions without taking internal flights. You can get a real feel for a country whilst out on the road.  Uruguay has a population roughly the size of Greater Manchester so the roads are amazingly quiet compared to what we are used to in the UK. Beyond the well known resort of Punta del Este, the country is lined with quiet beaches and dotted with rural\nestancias\n, wineries and excellent hotels in often remote settings. It all makes having your own wheels very useful.",
    "title4": "The best time to go to Uruguay",
    "paragraph4": "If you plan to spend time on the coast, personally I would choose mid November to mid December, or February and March. The weather is warm, hotels good value and driving should be a pleasure. Its worth remembering things can get hectic on the coast between Christmas and mid January, and during Carnival, when Uruguay is hugely popular with South American sunseekers. The outside world is also beginning to discover Uruguay hosts an exuberant Carnival. You might consider timing your visit to coincide with the big parades in Montevideo in the days leading up to Ash Wednesday.",
    "title5": "Packing advice",
    "paragraph5": "Take binoculars. Although little known as a destination for birders, Uruguay has 550 types of bird and being overwhelmingly rural you notice them everywhere. Spring (September to October) and autumn (March to April) is best time, with lots of migrating species."
