    "Main_Title": "Our Uruguay holidays & tours",
    "Main_Paragraph": "From the promenades, yacht harbours and regional craft shops of the capital Montevideo to the rich diversity of bird and animal life along the coast in the lagoons close to Jose Ignacio, Uruguay is much more than just a filling in a South American sandwich. In this diverse country, our Uruguay holidays will have you wine tasting and wandering: through cobbled market places, along the ridges of sand dunes and up mountain trails. Small is beautiful on our trips: stay at boutique hotels and visit family-run vineyards and olive farmers. Our Uruguay tours employ the services of expert local guides to enhance your visit, and ensure that local people always benefit, too.",

    "Title1": "",
    "Paragraph1": "While its difficult to fly directly into Uruguay, most holidays here start in the pretty port town of Colonia which is just a short hydrofoil ride away from Buenos Aires. From here, drive west to Carmelo and the wine region, or head straight out east, with a couple of days in Montevideo, the capital, before venturing to the glorious wetlands, desert and windswept Atlantic coast. Itineraries tend to hug the coast, rarely venturing inland, unless part of a longer trip around South America  when youll head north on your way to Iguazú Falls on the Brazil-Argentina border. Group tours will travel in private vehicles along well maintained roads, or take a self drive trip for extra flexibility and independence.",

    "Title2": "1. Anastasio Lagoon & José Ignacio",
    "Paragraph2": "Discover Uruguays natural offerings within the lagoons surrounding the village of José Ignacio. Spend a morning canoeing across Anastasio Lagoon, a great place to spot abundant birdlife. Take a leisurely bike ride to the village, have a picnic beside the lagoon, stroll around its shores, climb the nearby lighthouse or head to the beach and relax to the sound of the crashing Atlantic waves.",

    "Title3": "2. Cabo Polonio",
    "Paragraph3": "At Cabo Polonio, the long, sandy beaches widen out into a thick wedge of dunes, forming the Uruguayan desert. If you trek up to the highest point at the appropriately named Cerro de la Buena Vista, youll be rewarded with contrasting views across the desert, wetlands and Atlantic. One of South Americas largest sea lion colonies is here, and whales pass offshore from September to November.",
    "Title4": "3. Carmelo",
    "Paragraph4": "Situated at the point where the River Plate meets the Atlantic Ocean, this pretty port town has jacaranda shaded streets and a ruined Jesuit mission. Its also the gateway to Uruguays wine region. Take a daytrip to one of the vineyards, or spend a night or two at a beautifully restored wine lodge, with the option to cycle round the estate and enjoy bucolic countryside in all directions.",
    "image3": "",
    "Title5": "4. Colonia del Sacramento",
    "Paragraph5": "Usually the first stop on a Uruguay holiday, Colonia is just three hours by ferry from Buenos Aires and youll notice the shift in pace immediately. Its Barrio Histórico is a UNESCO site, the streets are cobbled and quiet and highlights include a 19th century lighthouse, the beachside promenade and little museums. Lose yourself in the Old Town, with its art shops and superb restaurants.",
    "Title6": "5. Estancia stays",
    "Paragraph6": "Ranches are serious business, and staying on one is the best way to experience Uruguayan life. Dont expect five-star frills; these are working ranches and most offer dorm beds with limited electricity. Youll work for your keep, too, with plenty of chores to keep you busy, from herding cattle to vaccinating lambs. For many guests though, this is the most memorable and treasured part of their Uruguay tour.",
    "Title7": "6. Montevideo",
    "Paragraph7": "Montevideo is one of those cities that make you think, I could live here. Its a cosmopolitan capital with architectural influences from across Europe, and a thriving market, the Mercado del Puerto. But it also lacks the traffic and chaos of most capitals, has its own city beach, and is a real mecca for artists and musicians. And youre never more than a short hop from rolling countryside."
