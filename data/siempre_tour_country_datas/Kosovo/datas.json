        "Main_Paragraph": "An independent country, it is still known by some as a ‘disputed territory’ post Balkan wars. But on our Kosovo holidays you will find that it is conviviality that truly reigns here. With a relatively small area, its Damned (really) and Sharri Mountains’ magnificence conquers all, its ancient architecture in the capital Pristina is masterful, and its people – from the Albanians to the Gorani – all have stories to share. Come on our self guided walking holidays to walk the Dinaric Way, staying in mountain huts along the route, or explore with our local guides, who can help you see the very best of the country via family-run guest houses, local wineries and home-cooked cuisine.",
        "Subtitle": "Kosovo highlights",
        "Title1": "1. Boge",
        "Paragraph1": "This must be one of the smallest ski resorts in Europe, nestled into the Rugova Valley in the Prokletije (aka Accursed) Mountains with a maze of stunning hiking trails that follow ancient, and indeed contemporary shepherds paths, and hardly a tourist in sight. Stay in a traditional wooden house, and hike out to the likes of Little Lake Lićenat, at an elevation of 2,341m.",
        "image1": "",
        "Title2": "2. Gjakova",
        "Paragraph2": "An Ottoman city close to the border with Albania it was badly hit during the Kosovo War of 1998-99, when many of the towns ethnic Albanians were driven out, and homes destroyed. Now home again and making up almost all of the population, buildings are still being rebuilt, although many ancient ones also perished. Still, it is a town to learn about these difficult times, and support its restoration projects.",
        "image2": "",
        "Title3": "3. Peja",
        "Paragraph3": "A dramatic location at the entrance to the Rugova Canyon and the Accursed Mountains, but is also a wonderful place from which to find traditional rural villages such as Goradevac, with ancient log dwellings, including a 16th century log cabin church. Dont miss a chance to visit the Banja e Pejes natural hot springs, and cool down afterwards back in town with the local brew, Birra Peja.",
        "Title4": "4. Pristina",
        "Paragraph4": "The capitals ancient architecture was badly hit under Soviet rule, although there are still Ottoman mosques and an old town to explore. Today, its the culture, youthful joie de vivre around Rexhep Ruci main street, music and peacemaking history that attract. Also outdoor pools in summer, such as in Gërmia Park. Buy local handicrafts such as traditional silver and artisan foods here to support the local economy.",
        "image3": "",
        "Title5": "5. Prizren",
        "Paragraph5": "An ancient city, and Kosovos second largest, Prizren has architecture dating back to Roman, medieval and Ottoman times. Buildings stretch out around the River Bistrica, overlooked by the ar Mountains. An elegant town with a hefty history, the Ottoman fortress, Orthodox Cathedral, UNESCO Church of Our Lady of Ljevi and Ottoman Sofi Sinan Pasha Mosque are multicultural marvels.",
        "Title6": "6. Visoki Decani Monastery",
        "Paragraph6": "At the foot of the Prokletije Mountains, this serene Serbian Orthodox place of worship is home to an exquisite collection of Byzantine frescoes. When it snows, Decani Brotherhood monks, in long black robes, make a striking sight walking through the glistening white. Throughout the war, they gave refuge to people of all ethnicities in a church still protected by UN Peacekeepers."

        "Main_Paragraph": "Sometimes people forget that Kosovo is located in southern Europe, so temperatures can get really hot in summer, although the average in July and August is the high 20s centigrade. Similarly it snows in winter, so the best times to visit Kosovo are April to September. As this is lovely walking territory, it will be cooler in April, May or September generally. Do bring rain gear if going into mountains though. Two big cultural events include the NGOM Music Festival in June/July and Docufest Film Festival in August, both in Prizren. Easter is a special, sacred time throughout the country too.",

        "paragraph1": "<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<bullet><b>Monasteries and mosques</b> are just some of Kosovos unheard of gems. It has Ottoman influences everywhere, such as the fortress in Prizren or the ancient city of Gjakova. One of the most stunning monasteries is Serbian Orthodox Visoki De?ani, a UNESCO site boasting some of Europes best preserved Byzantine frescoes. Many buildings were destroyed by Soviets or during the 1990s war. Check out Heritage Without Borders, who support restoration projects.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>Walk in the Prokletije Mountains. </b>Also known as the Accursed Mountains, the only thing you will be cursing here is that you dont have more time to enjoy it. This countrywide network of ancient shepherds trails is devoid of tourists and the mountain village of Bogë is a perfect place for chalet style accommodation surrounded by peaks. If you hike around the Mirusha Waterfalls, you will also be rewarded with some fine wild swimming.</bullet>\n<bullet>If ever there was a place to raise a toast to a future, Kosovo is it. And with 270 days of sunshine a year, it has always proffered perfect terroirs for vines. <b>The leading wine producing area </b>is the Rahovec Valley, also known as Orahovac , where you can do a tour of four vintners, the most famous being Stone Castle Winery.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>Enjoy café life.</b> There is a lot of emphasis on the ancient in Kosovo. But it is also vital to show its young, dynamic city life too, and the coffee shop scene in Pristina is gaining a fine reputation, not only for quality macchiato, but also for bohemian cool. Check out the Santea neighbourhood to see where ancient has been upstaged by all things au courant.</bullet>",

        "paragraph2": "Underestimate the summer heat.\nJust because it isnt coastal, doesnt mean you wont overheat. Stay hydrated, especially in the mountains, and always wear a hat. Water is safe to drink, and there are plenty of old drinking fountains in small, rural towns.\nOverlook the culture,\nwhich is very much driven by its very youthful population with 75 percent of people under 35 years old. The café life in Pristina is very cool indeed, but Prizren is the cultural hub, with a multi-ethnic population, lots of bars and cafes, and a prestigious documentary festival every year called\nDocufest\n. The Shadervan, or main square, is café and street food central and with Albanian, Turkish, Roma, Ashkali and Serbian influences, the emphasis is definitely on fusion. And fun.\nThe war and struggle for independence were both very recent, so dont\nbarge in with a political debate\nbecause, for many people the scars are far from healed. Read up on the history before you go, recognise that there are many ethnic groups, and just be sensitive. Mind you, once you get them started, there is no stopping them. Kosovar people are far from shy, and welcome not only visitors wholeheartedly but also a good old chinwag.\nThink that because it is a predominantly Muslim country there is a shortage of alcohol.\nFrom beer to wine to raki, grapes and grain play an important role in Kosovars default status of all round gregariousness. But there is little alcohol related trouble. In fact Kosovo is a very peaceful country, with little crime or corruption. Too many international peacekeepers over the years maybe. So, raise your glass to that and say Gëzuar! Or cheers, Kosovo."
