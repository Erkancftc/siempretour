    "Main_Title": "Our Italy holidays",
    "Main_Paragraph": "Anyone that has visited Italy knows the intense passions it can inspire, but our holidays take you beyond the sublime (yet frequently overcrowded) cities and into the bellissima countryside instead. Sociable small group tours, as well as tailor made holidays, roam the magnificent landscapes of the Amalfi Coast, Puglia, Umbria, Tuscany and Sicily, often walking or cycling, the better to drink in the scenery. And the wine, of course, the perfect accompaniment to one of the world’s great cuisines, which our sumptuous Italy cooking holidays allow you to explore under the guidance of expert local chefs.",
    "Subtitle": "About our Italy holidays",
    "Title1": "Italy holidays, Culture",
    "Paragraph1": "Italy has spent thousands of years exporting its culture around the world, but there’s nothing more satisfying than seeing it in situ – which is why Roman ruins at Pompeii, Renaissance art in Florence, and opera in Verona are always popular. But while Italy’s ancient sites and great works of art are undeniably impressive, they’re also so crowded it can be hard to enjoy a good view. For a much more pleasant take on Italian culture we recommend you stop pounding the city pavements and instead slip into the rhythms of daily life. Our agriturismo holidays are a perfect example, slowing things down while bringing local, seasonal produce to the fore.",

    "Title2": "Walking holidays in Italy",
    "Paragraph2": "Much of Italy is mountainous, and when the mountains offer views as good as this, there are sure to be hikers. You can’t go wrong in the Dolomites, where there’s snowshoeing in winter, too. Ambitious hikers can try the Italian Alps and the famous Mont Blanc circuit trek. If you prefer gentle hills to gigantic mountains, our Italy walking holidays also explore the rolling slopes of Tuscany (complete with wine tasting breaks). Meanwhile Cinque Terre and the Amalfi Coast boast undulating coastal walks, where a sea breeze and a sea view make the high points heavenly. Yes, they’re deservedly popular, but our knowledgeable local guides seek out quieter routes and timings to avoid the worst of the crowds.",

    "Title3": "Cycling holidays in Italy",
    "Paragraph3": "Our Italy cycling holiday are a sublime way to explore countryside, medieval towns and glorious coastlines, with popular routes including Lake Garda to Venice through the Veneto region. If you’re happy on hills, there are challenging rides in Lombardy, but if you prefer it flat, then lakeside cycles in the Dolomites, pretty routes in Puglia, and e-biking in Tuscany will make you want to pack your panniers and saddle up. And Responsible Travel’s cycling holidays don’t need to be feats of endurance – there’s plenty of time between rides to explore along the way, with routes threaded between cycle-friendly, locally run hotels.",
    "Title4": "Family holidays in Italy",
    "Paragraph4": "From pizza and gelato to gondolas and gladiators – Italy is wonderfully child-friendly. This is a country where it's tradition to visit grandparents every week for family dinner, and children are welcome in restaurants – often way past their bedtime. Italy’s varied landscapes present a natural playground where active kids enjoy everything from canyoning to kayaking under the watchful eye of local guides who’ve known these landscapes since their own childhoods. With our Italy family holidays you can take the kids up an active volcano in Sicily or hike and zipline through Tuscany. For other families, a one-stop self catering holiday is often the way to go. Your bambini will have a blast.",

    "Title5": "Where to go on holiday in Italy",
    "Paragraph5": "You don’t need to own a superyacht to enjoy Italy’s magnificent Amalfi Coast – our walking holidays seek out quieter but no less spectacular trails. Similarly, the granita in Sicily somehow tastes better when bought from a little independent shop known only to the locals, like our guides. If you want to explore quintessential Italian countryside, then Tuscany’s hill towns are a high point – literally – on a hiking or biking holiday, but for somewhere more peaceful, try Umbria next door. Fewer people head here, and we can arrange cookery lessons and market tours with local chefs, and Orvieto wine tasting at source.",
    "Title6": "Types of tours & holidays in Italy",
    "Paragraph6": "If Italy’s dreamy coast and dramatic mountains inspire , consider our adventure holidays that offer a thrilling introduction to Italian landscapes, and culture, through activities such as hiking, sailing and kayaking. Happiest over handlebars? Our cycling holidays explore Puglia, Tuscany and Sardinia, with leisurely or more challenging options available. And while our walking holidays might cover less ground, they focus on some of the most beautiful parts of the country: try the Dolomites or Sicily. If you’re travelling solo but would enjoy having some friends alongside to compare notes on your wine and gelato tastings, then our sociable small group tours are just the thing, with local guides introducing you to neighbourhood producers."
