        "Main_Paragraph": "Our Botswana safari holidays explore some of Africas most wildlife-rich landscapes, from the Okavango Delta to Moremi Game Reserve and Chobe National Park. You can bask in luxurious safari lodges or immerse yourself in nature by wild camping, with exciting and illuminating bush walks into the Kalahari led by local guides. Often combined with neighbouring Namibia, our Botswana holidays protect traditional lifestyles, for example by working with the mokoro canoe polers of the Okavango Delta. Your holiday can also make a difference by contributing to educational safaris for Botswana schoolchildren or supporting wildlife protection initiatives, including the Khama Rhino Sanctuary.",
        "Subtitle": "Botswana holiday highlights",
        "Title1": "Safaris in Chobe, Moremi & beyond",
        "Paragraph1": "All our Botswana holidays are safaris at heart. Youll stay in lodges and camps that invest in their communities  and pitch up where you can sip a sundowner within roaring distance of the lions waterhole.\nJoin us on a trip to Chobe National Park, an oldie but a goodie. It was the first national park in Botswana, laying out rivers, marshes and deserts that are home to the largest population of elephants on the planet. Elsewhere, our holidays take you to see the zebra, giraffes and hippos of the Okavango Delta by mokoro canoe, discover how residents created the Moremi Game Reserve to fight back against hunting and uncontrolled farming, and see how rhino numbers are being boosted at Khama Rhino Sanctuary.\nChoose between a tailor made or small group safari that places you with a group of like-minded travellers; its often a case of the more eyes the merrier when seeking out wildlife on safari. As well as a set itinerary designed by experts who know and love Botswana, youll travel with local guides who can tell a coppery-tailed coucal from an African fish eagle at 100 paces.",
        "image1": "",
        "Title2": "Mokoro boat rides in the Delta",
        "Paragraph2": "The Okavango is the worlds largest inland delta  an oasis in the middle of the colossal Kalahari Desert, attracting wildlife in unrivalled numbers. Its the watery landscape that brings animals here; think of it as a giant desert waterhole pieced together by swampland, islands, forests and papyrus-lined rivers. Floating along the deltas reed channels in a mokoro dugout canoe is a wonderfully tranquil contrast to a dusty game drive, and a relaxing way to spot riverside wildlife, including hippos, crocodiles and birds.\nLocal guides are both expert navigators  known as polers  and extremely knowledgeable about the animals and their habitat. This is a great thing to do in Botswana for animal lovers, as the near-silent mokoros dont startle the wildlife, so you can just sit back and float past the incredible scenery of the Okavango.",
        "image2": "",
        "Title3": "Bushwalks with local guides",
        "Paragraph3": "For an adventurous addition to your Okavango cruise, disembark from your mokoro for a walking safari. Youll follow the fresh tracks of lions and elephants through the bush in the wake of local guides wholl put you eye-to-eye with the wildlife on the ground. Everything seems to grow to fill out the landscapes here  including the elephant herds, which are some of the largest in Africa.\nWalking through the bush with an Indigenous San guide allows you to see culture and nature like never before. Their intimate knowledge of the Kalahari remains unrivalled, as Bruce Taylor, from our partner Sunway Safaris, discovered: Going on a walk with these guys is amazing. Theyll look at a twig  literally a twig  and stop. Somebody will dig up the tuber below it, scrape the skin off, squeeze the pulp and drink from it. Then they put the skin back, pat the mud back onto it and bury it again so that the plant can continue to grow. Later, theyll make a fire. Hard wood, soft wood, hand roll, bit of bark... and suddenly theyre all huddled round a fire while youre freezing in your jacket. Its really impressive.\nMakgadikgadi Pan is another great spot for a hike. Dotted with giant, 100-year-old baobabs, the Makgadikgadi floods following the rains, attracting zebra, wildebeest and tens of thousands of flamingos. Also within the reserve is the sacred Kubu Island and Nata Sanctuary, which is fantastic for birding.",
        "Title4": "Family-friendly activities",
        "Paragraph4": "Our family holidays adapt safaris to childrens energy and attention spans. Younger children will enjoy wildlife spotting from jeeps, while Botswanas specialities  bushwalking and canoeing  mean that the older the child, the more theyll get out of it. Teenagers in particular will love it, as well as being able to withstand any longer overland drives. Lodges are well-prepped for families, with extra-large tents and bush schools  a bit like forest schools  for children.",
        "image3": "",
        "Title5": "Luxury lodges",
        "Paragraph5": "Traveller and bed numbers are restricted in Botswana, so you dont have to worry about being just another face in the crowd. Our camping holidays use campsites hidden away on private concessions, while unobtrusive luxury lodges offer comfort and calm while living up to demanding environmental principles. The 47-room Chobe Game Lodge is one of the biggest, complete with electric safari vehicles and great benefits for local staff. This luxury accommodation invests your money where it makes a real, direct difference: youll help support communities, protect wildlife and preserve the environment. We reckon thats money well spent.",
        "Title6": "Border-hopping to Namibia & Victoria Falls",
        "Paragraph6": "Make like a migrating buffalo and forgo country borders to explore a larger swathe of Southern Africa. Namibia, to the west, is a great pairing. Our holidays allow you to compare the watery Okavango Delta with the mountainous dunes of the Namib desert, or the seal colonies of Cape Cross with the elephants of Chobe National Park. Alternatively, let us plot a course north-east to Zimbabwe, where Victoria Falls crashes tantalisingly close to the Botswana border and Hwange National Park is a mere extension of Chobe National Park to the 100,000-plus elephants that roam here. The long overland drives are all part of the fun."

        "Main_Paragraph": "August to October\nis often the best time to visit Botswana for first-time visitors. This is the dry winter season, when youre most likely to see huge herds of elephants bustling around waterholes and get unobstructed views across foliage-free plains. Just be prepared for hot days, chilly nights and busy lodges. Some of our local safari experts prefer the green season from November to March. Wildlife disperses and water levels drop in the Okavango Delta, but the climate is pleasant. Thunderstorms tend to occur in the late afternoon, dulling the heat yet leaving time for sunshine. Migratory birds and baby antelope are best seen then too.",

The Kalahari is particularly stifling. However, theres plenty of greenery, as well as the chance to see newborn animals alongside an abundance of migratory birds. The beauty of the rains in Botswana is that theyre generally late afternoon thunderstorms that come rolling through then pass on, says Bruce Taylor, guide and founder of our partner Sunway Safaris. You can still have gloriously sunny days.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Often rainiest month</li>\n<li>Wildlife with young and zebra migration</li>\n<li>Great for Southern Africa road trips</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\nBotswana in February is often Botswana at its rainiest. Showers persist for longer, with some tracks closed or bogged down. However, the clouds do create brilliantly moody backdrops for photographers. The rain cools things down a bit, adds Bruce. There are a lot of young animals around and all the migratory birds are in the Okavango Delta at this time  and theyre spectacular. The zebra migration from the Boteti River to the Makgadikgadi and Nxai pans is a must-see.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Green rainy season finishing</li>\n<li>Excellent bird watching</li>\n<li>Explore Southern Africa</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\nThe heat climbs down from the heights of summer in March, with temperatures in the 30°Cs and nights cooling. Botswana in March can be wet, although rainstorms are usually confined to afternoon showers that clear the air. Elephants appear in the Okavango Delta to hoover up dropped fruit, but water levels can be too low for mokoro canoe trips. Mosquitos and insects love March too; keep topping up your repellent and pack long-sleeved shirts and trousers.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Camping safaris</li>\n<li>Increased wildlife viewings</li>\n<li>Cheaper shoulder season</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\nTravel starts to pick up a little in Botswana in April. Camping safaris become more popular as drier, sunny days roll in. Temperatures hold steady at about 30°C although they can halve at night, lending a chill to morning wildlife viewings. Youll see more land mammals if the rains stay away, especially rhinos. The green scenery and sunshine in April are great for photographers seeking bright light. The rains start to trickle back into the Okavango Delta in April too.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Start of dry season</li>\n<li>Okavango Delta wildlife perks up</li>\n<li>Peaceful lodges and campsites</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\nMay signals the start of the dry season, with clear skies and moderate temperatures. Botswana in May can be arid and extremely chilly at night, especially in the Kalahari; be prepared for some sub-zero nights. Elephants return to Chobe and Moremi national parks. The water is slowly moving through the Okavango Delta, so the north-west will have fuller rivers than the south-east  and the wildlife goes where the water does. This is a great time to expand your adventure to Victoria Falls, Namibia and Mozambique.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Peak season begins</li>\n<li>Sunny with cold nights</li>\n<li>African wild dogs, lions and elephants</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\nThe number of visitors continues to climb. Lodges and campsites can get very busy from mid-June, when many schools break up in Southern Africa. Nights are cold across Botswana in June, but are especially biting in the Kalahari Desert. Wrap up for your morning game drives wherever you are. Daytimes, however, are a pleasant 20-25°C and even a little warmer in the north. Wildlife viewings increase as lions and elephants seek out waterholes.\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Most popular month</li>\n<li>Family adventures</li>\n<li>Coolest month, but dry and sunny</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\nCooler, bone-dry weather, amazing wildlife viewings and school holidays combine to make July the most popular month to visit Botswana. You can take your pick of safaris in Botswana in July, from luxury fly-in experiences to camping and family-friendly lodges. Youve just got to remember to book well in advance to nab a spot. Elephants, big cats and birds (and mokoro canoe trips) navigate the rising water levels in the Okavango Delta and crowd around ever-shrinking waterholes elsewhere.<div style=\"margin-top: 15px;\"></div>\n<bullet><b>July and August are great for a</b> <a href=\"/holiday/11783/botswana-camping-safaris\">Botswana camping safari</a></bullet><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Busy month</li>\n<li>Rising temperatures</li>\n<li>Peak wildlife viewing at the Okavango Delta</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\nIncreasingly sizzling days and cold nights dont put off visitors to Botswana in August. Book well in advance to get a spot at a lodge or campsite during this popular month. Water levels are at their highest in August in the Okavango Delta, drawing out the wildlife in droves. This is an excellent  if busy  time for canoe trips and safaris. Those with a couple of weeks to play with often choose to expand their explorations across Southern Africa in August.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Camping safaris</li>\n<li>Fantastic wildlife viewing</li>\n<li>Hot, generally dry weather</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\nBotswana in September is dry, hot and dusty, with not much in the way of bird watching but also not many mosquitoes and less vegetation. However, this lack of coverage means that September is often considered the best time to visit Botswana for big animals like hippos and black-maned lions. Wildlife clusters around diminished waterholes and rivers and there is little greenery to block fantastic scenes. Evenings start to warm up as winter wraps up and occasional thunderstorms rumble in the afternoons.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Hottest month (too hot for some)</li>\n<li>Great for elephants and hippos</li>\n<li>Cooler in the Okavango Delta</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\nThe heat peaks in October, with cloudless skies providing little respite from the sun and temperatures that hover around the mid-30°Cs and can hit 40°C (and then some) in northern Botswana. The nights are warm too. The Okavango Delta offers more bearable temperatures in October, thanks to the full waterways. Enormous herds of elephants gather around the last waterholes all over Botswana in October. Its also a good month to see hippos soaking.<div style=\"margin-top: 15px;\"></div>\n<bullet><b>October and November are great for</b> <a href=\"/holiday/11786/namibia-and-botswana-safari-holiday\">pairing Namibia with Botswana</a></bullet><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Cheaper prices</li>\n<li>Baby antelopes and hunting lions</li>\n<li>Usually the beginning of rainy season</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\nSpring has sprung in Botswana in November. That means more rain, but by no means lots of it. Look up for leopards  theyll be lazing along tree branches to escape the heat during the hot (35°C -40°C) days. The rainy season in Botswana doesnt always run to schedule, but often starts in November. When the clouds do arrive, though, the rain revives grasses for grazing antelope during calving season. Where there are baby antelopes, there are prowling big cats. Elephants and hippos spread out across Botswana as the water available increases.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Rainy green season</li>\n<li>Excellent wildlife viewing in the north</li>\n<li>Explore Southern Africa</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\nI enjoy the green season from December to April, because theres no dust, says Bruce Taylor, guide and founder of our partner Sunway Safaris. Botswana in December also welcomes excellent wildlife viewing in the north as predators stalk newborn antelopes and migratory birds return. Hot, humid mornings trigger afternoon thunderstorms that cool temperatures a touch before the humid nights return. Photographers will appreciate the dramatic skies and blooming flora.",

The <b>green season (November-May)</b> is great for seeing migratory birds and newborn antelopes against less parched landscapes as well as the predators that stalk them.",

World Wetlands Day falls on the date Botswana (among others) signed the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance. A free festival in Maun peppered with music and environmental talks celebrates the lifegiving delta, as well as educating attendees about our reliance on wetlands for the health of both us and the planet.",

        "paragraph5": "This two-day holiday was recently cut to a single day  but you wouldnt know it if youre in Botswana. Most places shut down for longer to give people the chance return to their hometowns to party with their families.

This causes a feeding frenzy amongst the larger barbels (catfish) and tigerfish, which slap the water with their tails, terrorising the smaller fish out from the reeds and into their own mouths or the beaks of the stalking herons and eagles. Its a fly fishermans dream  and a fascinating show even for those not armed with a rod.",

        "paragraph9": "The green season brings new life to Savuti in Chobe National Park as herbivores, including impala and wildebeest, begin to calve. But its not all cooing at wide-eyed babies.
