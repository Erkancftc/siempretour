    "Main_Title": "Our St Helena holidays & tours",
    "Main_Paragraph": "The beaten track ends long before you get here; our St Helena holidays celebrate all that is fascinating about one of the most remote islands in the world. Britain’s second-oldest overseas territory was used to imprison Napoleon Bonaparte and its first airport only opened in 2017. If you've made the effort to get here, you want to be sure that your holiday is the best it can be. Our trips support island residents, the Saints, through the use of local guides and services, and in doing so help them protect their land, and the remaining biodiversity of this unique, isolated island.",

    "Title1": "1. Dianas Peak National Park",
    "Paragraph1": "The island’s national park covers its central highlands, and the last remaining forest – just 16 hectares of it. Since rain is rare, these slow-growing native species are adept at pulling water from clouds and supply most of the island’s drinking water this way, in lieu of other water sources. Look far for panoramic views. Look near, and you might see the peak’s endemic yellow spiky woodlouse.",

    "Title2": "2. Jamestown",
    "Paragraph2": "Crammed into a narrow valley, Jamestown, the capital, is the location of historic buildings and a museum full of shipwreck finds. Youll get used to greeting everyone you pass  cars, pedestrians and the fairy terns nesting on the window ledges. There are fewer people to greet on Jacobs Ladder, the 699-step climb out of town with amazing views, and a certificate for those who complete the journey.",

    "Title3": "3. Longwood House",
    "Paragraph3": "Napoleon did not enjoy his tenure as master of Longwood House, the draughty manor to which he was exiled, and lived his last days, between 1815 and 1821. Now a museum, Longwood House has been restored to show how the emperor of France lived, featuring his beds, bath and goldfish ponds. His original grave (he was moved to Paris) can be found in a flower-filled valley where he used to take his walks.",
    "Title4": "4. St Helena Marine Protected Area",
    "Paragraph4": "Popular with pelagic marine life, and therefore popular with divers too, the waters around St Helena dont have coral reefs, but they do have shipwrecks populated by many fish. Migrating humpbacks pass the island, whilst gatherings of equal numbers of male and female whale sharks around St Helena suggest this might be a breeding ground for the species. If so, its the first ever discovered.",
    "image3": "",
    "Title5": "5. Plantation House",
    "Paragraph5": "Plantation House was built by the East India Company who governed the island from the 1650s, employing enslaved people on the island. The house is still the home of St Helenas governor, who must share the honour with Jonathan, a giant Seychelles tortoise. Jonathan is currently the oldest living land animal in existence, at over 190 years old, living through the reigns of eight British monarchs and meeting some of them, too.",
    "Title6": "6. The South",
    "Paragraph6": "Whilst most Saints live in the north of the island, the south features one of the islands only sandy beach  Sandy Bay  plus hiking trails to the distinctive rock pillars Lot and Lots Wife, which add to the islands dramatic topography. Theres no swimming, as the water is too rough, but theres lots of looking: for nesting masked boobies, at the babies toes  a weird endemic plant  and at the dramatic scenery."
