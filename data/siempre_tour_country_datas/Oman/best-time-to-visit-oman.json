    "Main_Paragraph": "The best time to visit Oman is, quite simply, when you arent going to bake. If getting a sun tan is all you are after, Oman probably isnt the right place for you anyway, as sauntering around in a swimsuit all day is so not the done thing here. Plus, it is just too hot from June to August, so you will get serious skin damage. Or just pass out. Head to Oman from October to March, when the temperatures subside a little, and you can enjoy all the wilderness wonders that it offers.",

Omanis head here during this time to enjoy the rain and mist, and so prices push up to peak season silliness in this region. However, its also green and lush during this time, so a wonderful sight in the otherwise desert landscape. </bullet>\n<bullet>You will bake here in summer, with temperatures reaching 38°C during the day and dipping to about 29°C at night. So if you want to trek, stay clear of <b>May, June, July and August</b>. However, if you just want to hang by the pool, the hotels all drop their rates hugely at this time. Just dont head into the interior. Seems a shame to come all this way and not see the country though. </bullet>\n<bullet>If you want to see turtles, come from late <b>May to September</b> to see several species on Omans beaches. Nesting takes place early on in the season, with hatchling emerging a few weeks later; if you visit in <b>July and August</b>, you may be lucky enough to observe both nesting mothers and tiny new hatchlings. </bullet>\n<bullet>A lot of places close during the Muslim period of Ramadan, so it is good to discuss that with your tour operator. </bullet>",
