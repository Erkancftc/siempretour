    "Main_Paragraph": "Armenias mountains, valleys, canyons and forests result in a range of microclimates, with weather conditions varying significantly by altitude. The south broadly has a subtropical climate, whereas the north tends to be more continental. Spring can be a case of blink-and-youll-miss-it, with the heavy snow of January to February quickly turning to rain in March, before the heat ramps up from June onwards. Autumn takes longer to change, so drier September to October is usually a good time to holiday in Armenia, especially in Dilijan National Park where the foliage moves to rich shades of orange and yellow.",

    "when_to_go_html": "<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Armenian Christmas</li>\n<li>Ice skating, hot springs and skiing</li>\n<li>Coldest month</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nIn January in Armenia the temperatures can fall as low as -14°C in the mountains. People head into the snow for skiing at nearby Tsaghkadzor, and at Jermuk; you may prefer to stay in the capital, Yerevan, where ice skating is a popular winter activity. Sights like Amberd Fortress may be closed as they are snowbound. Many roads, already not well-maintained, can be difficult to travel.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Slightly warmer than January</li>\n<li>Lots of snow on the mountains</li>\n<li>Quiet time of year</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nSnow will have accumulated to its highest levels in Armenia in February. Its still very cold, with an average high of 1°C. Yet spring is coming: instead of Valentines Day, Armenians mark 14 February with Trndez  a Christian celebration with pagan roots. Purifying bonfires are lit to ward off winter and prepare for a fertile growing season  and couples jump over the flames for luck.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Short spring begins</li>\n<li>Snowmelt swells rivers</li>\n<li>Still quite chilly</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nSpring begins in Armenia in March. This season is usually quite short, though the scenery is undeniably lush, and snowmelt swells the rivers and waterfalls. The weather can be unpredictable with rain showers common, though Armenia is a relatively dry country. Typical March maximum temperatures average around 9°C in Yerevan but are cooler at higher altitudes.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Getting warm</li>\n<li>Easter celebrations</li>\n<li>Spring greens and herbs</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nArmenia in April is in the middle of spring. Later in the month the country is a lot warmer, with spring flowers and apricot trees blooming. Our highlights tours of Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan run from now. Local people gather spring greens and herbs  the latter makes great, healing teas. On 24 April every year, Armenians across the world honour Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day, marking the horrific events of 1915-17.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Summer begins</li>\n<li>Walking holidays begin</li>\n<li>Some rain about</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nSummer is in full swing in Armenia in May. By the middle of the month, poppies are blooming around Etchmiadzin Cathedral and higher passes are accessible now that most of the snow has gone. More small group tours begin this month such as our walking holidays, which run until September. May is the wettest month in Armenia, with an average of 15 days with some rain. Temperatures rise to the 20°Cs.\r\n\r\n<bullet><b>May is a great month for our</b> <a href=\"/holiday/27654/azerbaijan-georgia-and-armenia-holiday\">Azerbaijan, Georgia and Armenia holiday</a></bullet><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Long summer days</li>\n<li>Dry, settled weather</li>\n<li>Hiking and activity holidays</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nSummer is a fantastic time to take an outdoorsy holiday. In Armenia in June the days tend to be long, balmy and dry. Brilliant blue skies and green landscapes make an idyllic setting for hiking, hot air ballooning, and water sports on Lake Sevan. Its lovely in Yerevan, with an average high of 26°C. Enjoy the citys outdoor concerts and café terraces, and try and get your hands on some apricots  theyre in season.\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Hot and dry</li>\n<li>Armenians on holiday</li>\n<li>Busy mountain resorts</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nIts high summer in Armenia in July. This is one of its hottest months; there are average highs of 30°C across the country, but at higher altitudes in the mountains it can be cooler. Follow the footsteps of Armenians, who escape the heat at health resorts and spa towns like Dilijan, Jermuk, or Lake Sevan  one of the worlds largest high-altitude lakes and site of this landlocked countrys only beaches.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Walking holidays</li>\n<li>Busy in resort areas</li>\n<li>Temperatures in the 30°Cs</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nArmenia in August is a time for barbecued fish on Lake Sevan as the thermometer creeps into the 30°Cs, yet Mount Ararat, over the border in Turkey, remains firmly snow-capped on the horizon. Despite this being another hot month and peak summer, hiking holidays will take you to cooler climes, like the summit of Mount Aragats, the highest mountain in the country.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Lovely time to visit</li>\n<li>Seasonal produce</li>\n<li>Dry, settled weather\r\n</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\nSpring might be short, but other seasons arent. Armenia in September stands at the start of a long and beautiful autumn where there is generally settled, dry weather. Its a lovely time to visit. Its a great time to enjoy the spoils of the harvest  for wine, or just for eating Armenias delicious grapes by the bunch; theyre harvested at the end of the month. Some small group tours stop this month. \r\n\r\n<bullet><b>September is a great month for our</b> <a href=\"/holiday/22073/armenia-walking-holiday-small-group\">Armenia walking holiday</a></bullet><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Autumn colours</li>\n<li>Harvest celebrations</li>\n<li>Last month for small group tours</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nTemperatures start to fall in Armenia in October, but its still a good time for photographers and hikers to explore areas such as Dilijan National Park, where the trees are changing colour. As with spring, frosts are also likely in the late autumn. Its the harvest season  celebrated by communities across the country. Our remaining small group tours stop this month.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Snow starts to fall</li>\n<li>Winter delicacies</li>\n<li>Cold, quiet season</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nHunker down in Armenia in November. Its low season, with far fewer tourists coming. Snow starts to fall, high mountains are blocked, as are some sights. The average high is 10°C. Its time to start enjoying winter specialties: summer fruits are dried to make winter snacks or made into vodka. Theres also <i>khash</i> to try; this meaty Armenian soup is a classic winter dish.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Christmas festivities start</li>\n<li>Quiet time for visitors</li>\n<li>Cold and icy</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nChristmas festivities start ramping up in Armenia in December, though Armenian Christmas is celebrated in early January. Its a quiet time for visitors. Temperatures drop  precipitously in some places  from December onwards and heavy snow is likely in mountainous regions as well as Yerevan, which is cold and icy. Ski resorts open, but the best snow is to come in the new year.",

    "paragraph2": "Merry Fishmas! Armenia is unique in the world in celebrating Christmas and Epiphany on the same day. Traditionally fish, alongside rice and other dishes, comprise the festive meal. Families gather and the candlelit church services and Christmas lights add a warm glow to this icy time of year. Armenia was the first country in the world to adopt Christianity as a state religion and over 95 percent of the country identifies as Christian.",
    "title3": "Surb Zatik  Easter (March or April)",
    "paragraph3": "Visting Armenias medieval cathedrals and old churches around Easter is a fantastic way to immerse yourself in old Christian traditions  from foot washing on Maundy Thursday to Good Friday, Easter Eve and Easter Day itself. Armenians also celebrate at home with their families. Its traditional to dye eggs red and display them on a carpet of newly sprouted shoots, and Easter Sunday means a big family meal of rice and fish.",
    "title4": "Yerevan Wine Days (early June)",
    "paragraph4": "Rightly asserting Armenia as the birthplace of wine cultivation, Yerevan Wine Days is a festival that takes over streets in the capital citys centre, featuring wine tasting, plus food and music. Established in 2017, Yerevan Wine Days has become a fixture in the calendar, and a way to promote Armenian wine.",
    "title5": "Vardavar (three months after Easter)",
    "paragraph5": "Varadavar is a Christian festival taking place 98 days after Easter, but its origins date back to pagan times. Associated with Astghik, goddess of water, the one-day festival sees Armenians throwing water over friends, family and random strangers with gleeful abandon.",
    "title6": "Gata Festival (September)",
    "paragraph6": "Its just flour, butter and sugar  but\ngata\n, a delicious traditional Armenian pastry, is one of the most popular desserts in the country. In September, the beloved sweet treat becomes the focal point of its own festival in the village of Khachik. The worlds largest\ngata\nis made, cut up and served to a happy crowd. Theres also music, dancing and other traditional local food  just dont spoil your appetite before pudding.",
    "title7": "Areni Wine Festival (October)",
    "paragraph7": "Areni is a small village two hours drive from Yerevan. Every year its home to Armenias most famous, best-loved wine festival. You can taste everything from Armenias indigenous grape varieties to apricot wine. Its all quite fitting for the site of the oldest winery. Some of the worlds oldest known winemaking equipment was found in the nearby Areni-1 Cave in 2007, including a wine press and storage jars dating back to 4100 BC.",
    "title8": "Yerevan International Balloon Festival (October)",
    "paragraph8": "As if to demonstrate just how stable and sunny the weather can be in autumn, Yerevan has a balloon festival October, seeing 20 or so balloons fly over the city at once. Its not on the same scale as other balloon festivals across the globe, but it does add even more colour and interest to the capital. Beyond the festival, hot air ballooning is available year-round in Armenia as an unusual way to enjoy the countrys mountainous scenery.",

    "title10": "Which season is the best time to visit Armenia?",
    "paragraph10": "Autumn\nis a good time to visit Armenia. Its a long season with stable weather, and its not too hot. That said, spring, summer and autumn all have their merits, depending on what you want to see.\nFor culture and history lovers, the best time is April to June and September to October, says Nune Tatunts from our Yerevan-based partner Cascade Travel. For food and wine lovers, June and September to October is the best time, as we celebrate Yerevan Wine Days in the beginning of June and have a grape harvest in the end of September, and a wine festival in the first week of October. Summer has its place, too. For hiking and trekking lovers, says Nune, summer months (June-September) are better.",
    "title11": "What is the hottest month in Armenia?",
    "paragraph11": "July and August\ntie for the hottest months in Armenia. The average daily high in Yerevan is 30°C. These are both the sunniest months too.",
    "title12": "What is the wettest month in Armenia?",
    "paragraph12": "May\nis the wettest month in Armenia, with an average rainfall of 65mm and with some rain arriving around half the days of the month. Armenia is a mountainous country and this can mean storms and heavy rain, and lots of variation from valley to valley. Spring can be wet but other seasons are drier; December and January only receive around 15mm of precipitation."
