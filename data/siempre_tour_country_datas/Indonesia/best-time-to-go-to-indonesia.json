    "Main_Paragraph": "The best time to visit Indonesia is\nbetween April and October\n, when youll find warm and sunny weather for beach-hopping, temple touring and walking, as well as snorkelling and diving. Despite its vast size, the country has a fairly even climate. The rainy season in Indonesia is between November and March, when you can expect sudden tropical downpours most days. For trekkers, especially, we would suggest considering the shoulder months of March to May and October to November as the best time to travel to Indonesia, with temperatures, crowds and prices lower if youre prepared to risk the odd shower.",

    "when_to_go_html": "<bullet>During the wet season (<b>late November, December - April</b>), roads can be blocked and trekking routes closed for safety reasons, so its best to double check how much this will affect your chosen itinerary.</bullet>\n<bullet>The shoulder season (<b>March, April, May, October and November</b>) is fairly unpredictable weather-wise, but both prices and crowds drop and temperatures are ideal for trekking.</bullet>\n<bullet>During <b>December, January and February</b> rain makes areas such as Sumatra and Flores virtually inaccessible due to closed ferries and washed out roads. There are plenty of other places to see at this time though - with Bali and Kalimantan enjoying much more stable climates.</bullet>\n<bullet>If you're heading to the Mount Rinjani National Park on Lombok to see the infamous volcano, plan your Indonesia holiday outside of <b>January  March</b>, when the park closes.</bullet>\n<bullet>If youre heading to Java, avoid the end of <b>July</b>  these are the final days of Indonesias Lebaran celebrations and transport is utter chaos.</bullet>\n<bullet>Indonesians often choose to take holidays at the end of Ramadan (dates vary by year, so best to check according to your chosen year of travel) which can mean more crowds and higher prices.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>September in Indonesia brings the favourable weather conditions of August</b>, but without the crowds and high season prices, making it a brilliant time to visit.</bullet>",
