    "Main_Paragraph": "It rarely rains in Egypt and neither does it get very cold – visiting in winter can get chilly at night, but nothing a few extra layers can’t conquer. The best time to visit Egypt is in two seasons: spring (Feb-Apr) and autumn (Oct-Nov); it’s cooler then than in high summer, when\nEgypt is really hot - around 40°C-plus\n. Of course ‘cooler’ here is a relative concept when you're talking about Egypt’s weather. During spring and autumn daytime temperatures will still hit 25-30°C, but you’ll get relief in the evenings.",

    "when_to_go_html": "<bullet>March until November are the <b>best months for seeing dolphins</b> off the Dahab coral reef. </bullet>\n<bullet>The <b>diving in Egypt is good all year</b> round. </bullet>\n<bullet>Peak season for giant cruise ships is October to May, when it is cooler. Visiting the main tourist sites <b>early in the morning or late in the day </b>during these months is better, as the coach groups head back to port. </bullet>\n<bullet><b>May until August are steaming, but not humid</b>, so it is still manageable, if you drink lots of water and plaster on the eco friendly sun screen. August is the peak month being, in the words of Stevie Wonder, hotter than July. </bullet>\n<bullet><b>30th June is now a public holiday in Egypt</b>, celebrating the Uprising of 2011. </bullet>\n<bullet><b>In September, temperatures start to dip a little </b>and tourist numbers go down at the major sites as school holidays end. </bullet>\n<bullet><b>15th August is Flooding of the Nile Day</b>, or <i>Leylet en Nuktah</i>, based on the ancient traditions of the Nile waters coming back, and young girls were sacrificed. The only things sacrificed nowadays are diets, as people feast in picnics along the banks.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>We'd recommend avoiding Egypt tours during July and August unless you're headed for the coast</b>. It's simply uncomfortably hot, and as the climate crisis continues, that will only get worse. The lack of rain also puts great strain on water supplies, which are often prioritised for tourists over local people. </bullet>\n<bullet><b>Winter in Egypt is October to February,</b> which means a jacket or long sleeved top. It is warmer in the south, however, but evenings can be cool.</bullet>\n<bullet>There is a lot of hot air around towards the end March and into April, when <i><b>the 'Khamsin'</b></i> <b>wind blows from the desert in the south. </b></bullet>\n<bullet>Christmas isnt celebrated on 25th December by Coptic Christians, who make up 15 percent of people in Egypt, but <b>sometime around 7th January</b>. The festivities are a wonderful sight to behold. </bullet>\n<bullet><b>Ramadan is a 30 day religious observance period</b>, and the start date varies each year. A period of fasting, many sites and shops close early. However, when the fast breaks at sunset, and the special feast of <i>Eftar</i> begins, things liven up somewhat.</bullet>\n\n<b>Danniell Saunders, also from our partner, Encounters Travel:</b><br/> What we often do, especially in the summer months if weve got a set itinerary and its really hot, is adapt the itinerary accordingly, so perhaps not visit the Valley of the Kings during the day when the temp peaks, but get everyone up two hours earlier and have them visit when its cooler and theres no crowds. Things are subject to change, so be flexible.",
