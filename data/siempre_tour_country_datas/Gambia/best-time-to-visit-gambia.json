    "Main_Paragraph": "Gambia is typically tropical and has two seasons: hot, rainy and short, and hot, dry and long. Since its close to the equator, temperatures remain pretty steady all year round. During the day, its usually between 24°C and 35°C, although sea breezes in the south mean it can be a little cooler, particularly at night. The best time to visit Gambia for birding is in Oct-Dec, after the wet season but before the dusts of the harmattan blow in, making things hazy and uncomfortably dry.",

    "when_to_go_html": "<bullet><b>October to June</b> is the dry season, and the best time to travel to Gambia, as its usually cooler at night, there are fewer mosquitoes around, and dirt roads upcountry are less likely to be blocked.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>October to April</b> is also the high season for Western tourists, with cheap, all inclusive coastal resorts filling up.</bullet>\n<bullet>For birders, the early dry season of <b>October, November and December</b> is the best time to visit, as following the rainy season most wetland habitats will be at their most lush, attracting large numbers of migrant birds from Europe.</bullet>\n<bullet>The harmattan wind blows down from the Sahara in <b>January, February, March and April</b>, bringing dusty haze and uncomfortable dryness, as well as reduced visibility for both photography and sightseeing.</bullet>\n<bullet>Visit in <b>May and June</b> and youll escape both the rains and the high tourist season, and the coastal resorts will be much quieter.</bullet>\n<bullet>In <b>July, August and September</b>, heavy rains hit Gambia and access to more remote rural areas becomes almost impossible, as dirt roads are turned into muddy bogs by gushing waters. Its also peak mosquito season so theres a higher risk of contracting malaria, while the hot and humid nights can make sleeping very difficult.</bullet>",

    "paragraph2": "Go local and explore upriver. The good news about Gambia at the moment is that a massive amount of funding is going into highlighting the beauty of the Gambia River rather than the beach areas, which sometimes have a poor reputation. With local guides its easy to explore the rest of the country.",
    "title3": "Gambia's best beaches",
    "paragraph3": "We have a beautiful one right on our doorstep, just 25 minutes away where you often dont see anyone else on the beach at all. In general, you dont have to go far from the tourist areas to find an empty beach. From Cape Point to Senegambia the beaches are quite busy, but once you get to Brufut, down to Tanji and on to Gunjur, all of those beaches will be pretty much empty.",
    "title4": "Cultural highlights",
    "paragraph4": "Gunjur Village Museum is excellent; its a cultural and historical museum full of all kinds of artefacts and its made all the more interesting by the fact that it was developed by a local man, Lamin M Bojang. Otherwise, Tanji Museum is also good, as is the main museum in Banjul.",
    "title5": "Birdwatching tips",
    "paragraph5": "\"The birding is superb and we have own dedicated birding trips. Abuko Nature Reserve is one place Id recommend and then theres the Tanji Bird Reserve and Marakissa River Camp. The majority of the birding guides are local. I think there are 20 to 30 really excellent local guides in Gambia, although if you ask around many people will claim to be experts so make sure you get sound advice before choosing a guide.",
    "title6": "Local food",
    "paragraph6": "My favourite dish is\ndomoda\n, which is a peanut chilli dish. Its not very hot, its just a little bit spicy, and you can have it with vegetables, chicken, fish or meat. My other favourite is\nbenechin\n, which is like a bit like a risotto.\nYassa\nis a favourite with the local people in country, which is usually chicken or fish with a mustard onion sauce. The food in Gambia is generally very good, the standard is certainly a lot better than when I arrived 18 years ago.",
    "title7": "Safety",
    "paragraph7": "Many people would be wary of getting away from the main tourist areas, but Gambia is a very safe place indeed. The people are generally kind, trustworthy, happy to get to know you and will usually do anything for you.",

Very good food, glass of wine or two, early bed and we came back feeling rejuvenated! Dont go for action, do go for an authenticate experience of Gambia.<b>  Nicola Curl, in our Gambia Holiday Accommodation</b>\n<br/><br/>This is a fairly basic holiday  don't bother with hairdryers, electronic gadgets, etc. One major tip  DO NOT under any circumstances ignore your GP's advice with regard to anti-malaria tablets and anti-mozzy sprays etc. No matter what anyone says  take them as prescribed! Make sure you use a mosquito net over the bed at night. <b> Amanda Cooper</b>"
