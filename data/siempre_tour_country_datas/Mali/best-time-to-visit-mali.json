    "Main_Paragraph": "Malis weather depends very much on where you are in the country. The south is hot and humid, and the Sahel and Sahara of the north are even hotter and much drier. It experiences little variation in temperature, with seasons restricted to wet and dry, or windy. Southwest, around Bamako, rains last from June to September. In the northeast they are less predictable and may arrive at any time during that period. Read on to find out the best time to go to Mali.",

    "when_to_go_html": "<bullet><b>October, November, December</b> and <b>January</b> are the best time to visit Mali. This is the dry season, but the harmattan has yet to fully kick in, so its the most pleasant time to travel. </bullet>\n<bullet>The harmattan wind blows down from the Sahara in <b>January, February, March, April</b> and <b>May</b>. It can cool temperatures a little but be prepared for dusty haze and uncomfortable dryness, as well as reduced visibility for both photography and sightseeing. </bullet>\n<bullet>The rainy season descends in <b>June, July, August</b> and <b>September</b>. During this time, you could have issues with blocked roads from floods, there are more malaria carrying mosquitoes and the water level of the Niger River could prevent travel by boat. On the plus side, the landscape is lush and green. </bullet>\n<bullet>In <b>February</b> the Festival of the Niger takes place in Ségou.</bullet>",

    "title2": "What does the UK Foreign Office say?",
    "paragraph2": "FCO advice\ncurrently advise against all but essential travel to 25 km around the capital of Bamako. FCDO also advises against all travel to the rest of Mali.",
    "title3": "Challenges on the road",
    "paragraph3": "Due to the lack of visitors in recent years, the tourism sector has been affected. Hotels  especially outside of the capital  have often not been able to maintain upkeep as they once did, so standards arent always as high as one might like. As well as this, travellers need to prepare themselves for the usual challenges of West Africa - bad roads, different attitudes towards customer service, and the need for a great deal of patience at times!",
    "title4": "Why travel in a group",
    "paragraph4": "On an organised tour, the group is accompanied by a Malian guide, who bridges the gap of languages and cultures and is able to explain a lot about what you are seeing; you often miss out on the subtle intricacies of local culture as an independent traveller. The guide will share lots of information about his country and take you to places that you wont easily find when travelling on your own.",
    "title5": "Cultural highlights",
    "paragraph5": "Malis cultural treasures include the Great Mosque of Djenné and Dogon Country; Djennés old town and the Bandiagara Escarpment are both listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. As well as this there are many lesser known highlights, such as villages known for their handicrafts and local festivals. The River Niger may not particularly be a cultural highlight, but a trip through Mali would not be complete without some time on the river.",
    "title6": "Weather",
    "paragraph6": "While most people opt for November to February for the climate, the rainy season (late June to late September) is an amazing time of year to visit Mali. There can be an occasional tropical shower of a couple of hours (usually once every two to four days) but seeing the country green and with lush vegetation is an entirely different experience.",
    "title7": "And some tips from one of our Mali holiday reviews, by Susan Achim:",
    "paragraph7": "We named it the 5000 Star Hotel under the full moon on a windy night as we told stories around a small fire. That was on the very edge of the Bandiagara Cliff in Dogon Country. The rocks and the edge of the cliffs were right there, and the stories told and laughter were very precious. Our guide Aly and his Dogon friends made a conversation in multiple broken languages fun and enlightening. It truly felt like the mythical Shangri-La.<br/><br/>\r\nThe more French you have the better, although we had to learn different greetings every so often as we moved from one tribal area to another. If you like camping, youll get a bit of that as well as some lovely hotels and accommodations that are a mix of the two!<br/><br/>\r\nAs much as we could we tried to eat the local food, not imported or processed stuff. We ate lots of fresh fruit, dates and peanuts, too. Bottled water is required and helped us stay healthy. The empty bottles were a hot item for reuse and gifts for the children. Seems like it would be pretty hard to improve on the compost toilets built in to the mud houses. We could see that very little is wasted on our journey. It was humbling."
