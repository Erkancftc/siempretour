        "Main_Paragraph": "If you don’t know the song already, search ‘Welcome to Mali’ by Malian musicians Amadou & Mariam. Our Mali holidays make you feel just that: welcome, whether you’re here for a world-renowned music festival or a cultural tour. When you arrive in this landlocked West African mega-land of Sahara Desert and ancient trading cities, your visit will be much appreciated by local artisans and musicians. Our tours use local multilingual guides who can bring you closer to the communities you speak with, whether you’re visiting the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Timbuktu, diverse Djenné, capital Bamako, eating fresh fish skewers in Mopti, or visiting women’s cooperatives to buy beautiful pottery.\nSince the UN withdrew in 2023, the security conditions in Mali have been unpredictable and terrorist groups have been blockading roads and intercepting fuel trucks. Always refer to FCO advice before travelling.",
        "Subtitle": "Mali highlights",
        "Title1": "",
        "Paragraph1": "Historically and geographically, landlocked Mali is West Africas centrepiece: a bridge between the deserts of the north and the forests of the south. The largest country in West Africa, its butterfly-shape covers some 240,000 sq km and shares a border with seven other nations. To the south are rolling grasslands and dramatic highlands, including the cliffs and escarpments of the Dogon Plateau. Northern and central Mali are made up of Sahel and Sahara, broken up only by the Iforas Massif, a sandstone plateau thats an extension of the mountainous Hoggar region of the Algerian Sahara. The Niger River flows through the interior, functioning as the countrys main trading and transport artery.",
        "image1": "",
        "Title2": "1. Bamako",
        "Paragraph2": "For many travellers, the hot, dusty and crowded capital is just a place to rest before moving on to the rest of the country, but those who do take time to explore will quickly be drawn in by the citys dynamic live music scene, sprawling markets and the buzz of motorbikes swarming along the banks of the Niger River.",
        "image2": "",
        "Title3": "2. Djenné",
        "Paragraph3": "Set alongside the Bani River, Djenné is the most beautiful town in the Sahel, and was once an important link in the trans-Saharan gold trade. Cut off by the rising waters of the Niger Delta for several months a year, its smooth buildings are built in the Sudanic style, and include the Great Mosque, whose towers and characteristic protruding beams are beautiful and striking.",
        "Title4": "3. Dogon Country",
        "Paragraph4": "A fairy tale of dusky pink villages, wide open skies, sacred crocodiles and sandstone cliffs, Dogon Country is a rugged and remote area in eastern Mali. Its major feature is the towering Bandiagara Escarpment, a 500m high, 150km long line of cliffs that cuts through the Sahel; and where mud-brick houses cling to the rock faces.",
        "image3": "",
        "Title5": "4. Mopti",
        "Paragraph5": "Built on three islands connected by dykes across the Niger River, Mopti is the countrys biggest port and is often called the Venice of Africa thanks to its busy canals. While the town may lack Venetian beauty, its a fun and engaging destination, teeming with trading activity and colour and home to a vibrant cultural mix of people from across Mali.",
        "Title6": "5. Ségou",
        "Paragraph6": "The third largest town in Mali sits alongside the Niger River and is home to a thriving community of artisans, including cotton weavers, potters and rug makers. It also features beautiful examples of traditional Bamana architecture and graceful old colonial buildings. Plus, its the site of the annual Festival Sur le Niger  a lively music festival in the first week of February.",
        "Title7": "6. Timbuktu",
        "Paragraph7": "The UNESCO World Heritage city of Timbuktu has long been a compelling place to outsiders, associated with beauty, learning and wealth. Sending a postcard with a Timbuktu stamp ranks high on the list of quirky travel experiences. Once the seat of a formidable empire this city has suffered many ups and downs, most recently the implementation of Sharia law and the destruction of some of its heritage."

        "Main_Paragraph": "Malis weather depends very much on where you are in the country. The south is hot and humid, and the Sahel and Sahara of the north are even hotter and much drier. It experiences little variation in temperature, with seasons restricted to wet and dry, or windy. Southwest, around Bamako, rains last from June to September. In the northeast they are less predictable and may arrive at any time during that period. Read on to find out the best time to go to Mali.",

        "paragraph2": "FCO advice\ncurrently advise against all but essential travel to 25 km around the capital of Bamako. FCDO also advises against all travel to the rest of Mali.",
        "title3": "Challenges on the road",
        "paragraph3": "Due to the lack of visitors in recent years, the tourism sector has been affected. Hotels  especially outside of the capital  have often not been able to maintain upkeep as they once did, so standards arent always as high as one might like. As well as this, travellers need to prepare themselves for the usual challenges of West Africa - bad roads, different attitudes towards customer service, and the need for a great deal of patience at times!",
        "title4": "Why travel in a group",
        "paragraph4": "On an organised tour, the group is accompanied by a Malian guide, who bridges the gap of languages and cultures and is able to explain a lot about what you are seeing; you often miss out on the subtle intricacies of local culture as an independent traveller. The guide will share lots of information about his country and take you to places that you wont easily find when travelling on your own.",
        "title5": "Cultural highlights",
        "paragraph5": "Malis cultural treasures include the Great Mosque of Djenné and Dogon Country; Djennés old town and the Bandiagara Escarpment are both listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. As well as this there are many lesser known highlights, such as villages known for their handicrafts and local festivals. The River Niger may not particularly be a cultural highlight, but a trip through Mali would not be complete without some time on the river.",
        "title6": "Weather",
        "paragraph6": "While most people opt for November to February for the climate, the rainy season (late June to late September) is an amazing time of year to visit Mali. There can be an occasional tropical shower of a couple of hours (usually once every two to four days) but seeing the country green and with lush vegetation is an entirely different experience.",
        "title7": "And some tips from one of our Mali holiday reviews, by Susan Achim:",
        "paragraph7": "We named it the 5000 Star Hotel under the full moon on a windy night as we told stories around a small fire. That was on the very edge of the Bandiagara Cliff in Dogon Country. The rocks and the edge of the cliffs were right there, and the stories told and laughter were very precious. Our guide Aly and his Dogon friends made a conversation in multiple broken languages fun and enlightening. It truly felt like the mythical Shangri-La.<br/><br/>\r\nThe more French you have the better, although we had to learn different greetings every so often as we moved from one tribal area to another. If you like camping, youll get a bit of that as well as some lovely hotels and accommodations that are a mix of the two!<br/><br/>\r\nAs much as we could we tried to eat the local food, not imported or processed stuff. We ate lots of fresh fruit, dates and peanuts, too. Bottled water is required and helped us stay healthy. The empty bottles were a hot item for reuse and gifts for the children. Seems like it would be pretty hard to improve on the compost toilets built in to the mud houses. We could see that very little is wasted on our journey. It was humbling."
