    "Main_Paragraph": "Romania scorches in summer, especially in the southern and eastern low lands, with the beach often the best place to be during July and August. May can be rainy - but it's also when twitchers start to flock to the\nDanube Delta\n. In April, trees and wildflowers blossom are complemented by beautiful Easter celebrations. September is the best time to visit Romania for autumn colour, plus an explosion of mushrooms - and days still long and warm. January and February are great for winter activities, whether snow sports or slower explorations of pristine white wilderness.",

In the spring the flowers are amazing and it is usually warm. The colour of the trees in autumn takes your breath away - it is definitely the country I would chose to go to for the autumn. And if you come in the cooler months it would be a crime not to have one of the amazing soups!",

    "paragraph5": "Easter is celebrated with wonderful traditions. A week before Easter Sunday, Romanians decorate churches with flowers while bearing willow branches (symbols of fertility). Great Thursday is when the dead supposedly return for Easter with loved ones, reputedly waiting on roofs - so outdoor bonfires are lit to warm their souls. Colourful Easter eggs are painted, while special Easter dishes include lamb stew with green onion and sweet pasca cake."
