        "Main_Paragraph": "Pakistan is a land of snow leopards, silk roads, of historic cities wrapped in metropolis, of great food and even greater stories. And our Pakistan holidays ensure that you are getting those stories straight from the source. Our holidays prioritise authentic cultural experiences, by using local guides, family-run accommodation, organising experiences that support female entrepreneurs, and allowing you to engage with talented local craftspeople. So, you won’t just skim Pakistan, you will be able to dive right in. Whether you want to trek in the Karakoram Mountains and meadows, or watch a game of polo or cricket, get ready for incredible cultural heritage with awe-inspiring backdrops.",
        "Subtitle": "Pakistan highlights",
        "Title1": "",
        "Paragraph1": "The few travel companies that have adventured back into these magical landscapes following the last difficult decade and a half, will lead you on a classic circuit through northern mountains that tower over 7,000m, alpine pastures almost devoid of people and remote mountain valleys inhabited by the Kalash people, who have a different religion, language and culture to the rest of Pakistan. You will also follow in the footsteps of ancient travellers along the Karakoram Highway (KKH), or Pakistani section of the Silk Road linking Kashgar in China with Islamabad. All tourist trails also lead to the cultural capital of Lahore, where you descend from the mountains into a world where Mughal magnificence is fused with modern metropolis.",
        "image1": "",
        "Title2": "1. Chitral & Kalash Valley",
        "Paragraph2": "A mountain town in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, lying at the foot of Tirich Mir, the highest peak of Hindu Kush Mountains (7,708 m), it boasts a wonderful juxtaposition of cultures. On one hand home to a polo ground and, on the other, gateway to the Kalash Valley, home to the ancient and pagan Kalash people. The nearby Shandur Pass, leading to Gilgit is a stunning 4,000m plateau.",
        "image2": "",
        "Title3": "2. Fairy Meadows National Park",
        "Paragraph3": "It may sound lightweight, but far from it. Fierce rather than fairy comes to mind, given its the point where the three great Himalaya, Karakoram and Hindu Kush mountain ranges meet. The jewel in the crown is Nanga Parbat, the ninth highest mountain in the world (8,126m). Camp here to fall asleep under the stars, wake up with giants, get to grips with greatness and feel reduced to fairy status.",
        "Title4": "3. Karakoram Highway",
        "Paragraph4": "The KKH is the Pakistani section of the Silk Road, linking Kashgar in China with Islamabad, Pakistans capital. Although no longer packed with silk traders and occidental caravans, it is crammed with cultural and natural highlights. And high peaks, such as the seven-thousanders of the Hunza Valley, Fairy Meadows at the foot of Himalayan Nanga Parbat as well as Chitral Gol National Park.",
        "image3": "",
        "Title5": "4. Karimabad & Hunza Valley",
        "Paragraph5": "Looking up at the 60-year-old Baltit castle overlooking Karimabad, the capital of the mountainous Hunza Valley, you realise you are in one of the worlds very special places. In fact, it was an independent princely state until the 70s, with views up to majestic peaks of the Karakoram Range, the highest being Rakaposhi (7,788m). Accessible via the Karakoram Highway, a highway to heaven if ever there was one.",
        "Title6": "5. Lahore",
        "Paragraph6": "Known as the cultural capital, the ancient walled city is its heart, with a modern metropolis pumping all around. It became the architectural hub of all things Mughal in the mid 1500s, with the majestic Lahore Fort, gobsmackingly gorgeous Ajaib Ghar Museum and Shalimar Gardens with their fecundity of fountains. Very close to the Indian border, the bizarre Closing of the Gate ceremony at the Wagah border is a must.",
        "Title7": "6. Skardu & Karakoram Mountains",
        "Paragraph7": "Capital of Baltistan region and gateway to Karakoram Mountains. Balti people have Tibetan roots and although now mostly Muslim, you can see their influences in culture and architecture. Perhaps still influenced by the spirituality of these mountains. One particularly ethereal spot is Gilgit and Indus River confluence, where the Karakorum, Himalaya and Hindu Kush mountains meet. Yep, Ill have the Balti please."

        "Main_Paragraph": "The elevation of northern Pakistan, where most holidays occur, mean that travel is influenced by snow. The best time to go to Pakistan is May-Oct. Cities can hit over 40°C in midsummer, as can the Chitral Valley; while the Hunza Valley might dip below 20°C at the same time. Most trips reach over 3,000m, so have fleeces ready. Shandur Pass, for example, can see snow in July. Youll need many layers for the Kalash Winter Solstice Festival but, as visitors are rare, you will be well wrapped in the warmth of their welcome. And wine.",

        "paragraph2": "Jonny Bealby from our leading Pakistan partner, Wild Frontiers, named after Pakistans North West Frontier:\nOne thing that surprises people is that there are very good quality hotels. Particularly in the Skardu area, there are two exceptional, palace style boutique hotels. What people forget is that if you go back to the early 1990s there was a large tourist population throughout the summer. And indeed, when I started running trips there, I had to book hotels and experiences a year in advance. Travelling between Chitral and Gilgit, you would find rafting parties, trekking parties, mountain bikers, horse riders, even people paragliding. You name it. I am not talking mass tourism, but large numbers of adventure tourists. But since the troubles and 9/11, it has really dried up. So, the brilliant thing about travelling in northern Pakistan at the moment is that you have all these wonderful experiences to yourself. And as a consequence, travellers feel more special and the people you are meeting havent been in any way changed by tourism.",
        "title3": "",
        "paragraph3": "Everyone who goes to Pakistan, the word that always comes back is surprise. Everyone is always surprised by how hospitable, how friendly and  I know it is a bit of a cliché  at just how welcomed you are made to feel by the Pakistanis. I think there is a sense of gratitude that you are going to their country and treating them normally. And experiencing their country and going home with good stories about it. And theyll possibly come up to you and say, wow, thank you for visiting, you are very welcome.",
        "title4": "Cultural tip",
        "paragraph4": "Pakistan is where our company started. I wrote a book about it, and it was from that book that I started the company. Wild Frontiers is named after the North West Frontier, which is the province that runs along the Afghan border. I even have a small log cabin in the Kalash Valley and I go up there every year. One of the big draws that people dont know too much about here is the pagan tribe the Kalash, and we usually spend three days with them on most of our trips. Its an extraordinary phenomenon that they are still around, really. And one of the main reasons why I started in the travel business.",

        "paragraph6": "At Responsible Travel, we think the best people to advise our travellers are often... other travellers. They always return from our tours with\npacking tips, weather reports, ideas about what to do - and opinions about what not to\n.\nWe have selected some of the most useful tips on Pakistan's highlights that our guests have provided over the years to\nhelp you make the very most of your holiday\n.",
        "title7": "",
        "paragraph7": "Think about what you want before you are there. In this fantastic environment, you can also white water raft, trek, climb, mountaineer... 4 wheel drive etc. I was more than content with the cultural touring, some walking/trekking, however there is so much more there if you are younger and more active than me. Because it is so beautiful and unique you need to plan the other activities in advance. There is no security problem, the food is great and not overly spicy, accommodation is good. I rate it - For beauty 10 out of10. For hospitality and friendliness 10 out of 10. For adventure 9 out of 10, (I took it easy..), could be 11 out of 10 with minimal effort. Comfort, 9 out of 10. Food 8 out of 10, nothing wrong with that, the street food is particularly good, sometimes not a big range to choose from, but for isolated regions it is good. Safety, 10 out of 10! <b> Jim Troy</b>"
