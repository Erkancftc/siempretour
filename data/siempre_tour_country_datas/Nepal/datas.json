        "Main_Title": "Our Nepal holidays & tours",
        "Main_Paragraph": "Nepal is trekking nirvana, its soaring Himalayan peaks dotted with tiny villages, where cinematic views spread in every direction. Our holidays help create an even tourism industry, that takes trekkers not only on the popular routes, but to remoter, less visited places too. Whether exploring the Annapurna range, tracking rhinos and tigers in Chitwan, or venturing to Everest Base Camp, our Nepal holidays ensure your visit makes a powerful difference. We support fair pay and rights for hard-working porters, use local guides who know the importance of leaving no trace, and seek out homestays and tea houses in less-visited communities for a more genuine take on Nepalese culture.",
        "Subtitle": "Nepal holiday highlights",
        "Title1": "Nepal's best treks",
        "Paragraph1": "Topping the list of things to do in Nepal is trekking. The Himalayas are an area 10 times the size of France and a landscape of superlatives: the highest mountains, seemingly bottomless gorges, and some of the greatest biodiversity on the planet.",
        "image1": "",
        "Title2": "",
        "Paragraph2": "Everest Base Camp is the leader of the pack, but the breathtaking Annapurna Range is popular too. This horseshoe-shaped, 210km route wanders through traditional Hindu villages and wild forests of oak and rhododendron. And then theres Manaslu, a long and challenging trek thats higher than Annapurna and making great strides as a relative new kid on the block. Its the eighth highest mountain in the world and a brilliant teahouse trek, taking in as much culture as it does bright glacial terrain.\nThe alpine scenery of the Langtang Valley and the sacred valleys of Helambu, just outside Kathmandu, are popular, too. They are shorter, lower altitude, and more accessible, requiring no acclimatisation. But, of course, the best trekking holidays in Nepal are the ones that treat the trails with respect, as well as the porters and sherpas who tread the routes at your side.",
        "image2": "",
        "Title3": "Everest Base Camp",
        "Paragraph3": "Though the route to the top of Everest itself has captivated (and killed) intrepid climbers for decades, and not everyone has the fortitude, or the means, to summit the worlds highest peak, the Base Camp is nowadays accessible to us mere mortals. Reaching Everest Base Camp South is an achievement in itself. Trekking here is a 12-day odyssey: starting with a white-knuckle plane ride and then a trail that passes plunging river canyons, forests of blue pines, vast glaciers, ancient monasteries, and tiny mountain villages where colourful prayer flags flutter in the breeze.\nPeak season can bring crowds, but takes nothing away from the sheer wonder and freedom of climbing to the foot of the worlds highest mountain. Our local guides bring this scenery to life, sharing their knowledge of Buddhism, Sherpa culture, and tales of derring-do. You are, after all, following in the footsteps of mountaineering history.",
        "Title4": "Annapurna region",
        "Paragraph4": "Apt to leave even experienced walkers lost for words, the\nAnnapurna region\nis the most popular trekking destination in Nepal, and the full 125km circuit is considered one of the best routes in the world. One reason is the variety of terrain, from rhododendron woods to rice paddies, alpine forests to wide, arid plateaus, with the mountains as a constant backdrop, shimmering pink in the sunset.\nYou need 18 days to complete the circuit, but there are plenty of shorter routes in the region. Even these are strenuous, though, and you’ll be glad for the company and expertise of the porters, sherpas and guides. Our trips make sure that your local team on the trek are getting fair pay, carry baggage of a sensible weight, and are provided with good equipment – support porters, just as they support you.",
        "image3": "",
        "Title5": "Sharing stories with sherpas",
        "Paragraph5": "Whether youre trekking in Nepal, or seeing the country at a gentle pace, the countrys deeply ingrained culture will play a part in everything you do: it can be seen in the temple-lined city squares of Kathmandu and Patan; listened to on a spiritual walk with Buddhist pilgrims around the ancient stupas of the Kathmandu Valley; and learned about directly from the Newars and the Sherpas, two tribes of original Nepalese settlers whose cultural experience of the country spans decades of change. You will be as curious to meet them as they are to meet you, so smile and say namaste.",
        "Title6": "Taking the family",
        "Paragraph6": "Contending with the challenges and privations of travelling with young children doesnt appeal to everyone, but for those with intrepid, active kids over the age of six, Nepal is an adventure playground.  Youll only admire the tall pointy bits from the bottom, but there are lots of smaller bumps that kids can comfortably scale on foot or two wheels. There are rivers to raft, wildlife to spot in Chitwan National Park, and colourful bazaars to wander in search of souvenirs.\nOur family holidays in Nepal are imbued with warm, welcoming Buddhist hospitality  our excellent guides can help everyone learn cultural customs and a bit of the language, to enrich your experience. Your family can help support Nepali families too, by staying in their guest houses, eating their locally-grown produce, and buying their handicrafts.",
        "Title7": "Wildlife watching",
        "Paragraph7": "Theres a line in Nepals national anthem that describes a shawl of natures wealth unending, and while most people visit this tiny Nepalese kingdom to trek, there are also plenty of wildlife holidays.\nSouthern Nepal is home to its wild and woolly national parks, where the treetops teem with exotic bird species and rhinos roam the jungle alongside lumbering Indian elephants. Bengal tigers stalk lowland riverbanks, and can be tracked on foot or from dugout canoe. One-horned Indian rhinos thrive in the dense jungle of Chitwan National Park. And in the remote Royal Bardia National Park some 80 migratory elephants are joined by crocodiles, swamp deer and river dolphins.\nJungle walks are an eco-friendly alternative to jeep safaris, so theyre cheap, plus youll get a much more personal experience and the benefit of local knowledge. It takes six hours to drive from Kathmandu to Chitwan, so its likely youll want to stretch your legs anyway. Our specialist guides will help you spot wildlife youd never manage to track on your own. You can even see endangered red pandas in the Himalayan foothills. And on our holidays you will help nature, too  by contributing to tree-planting projects.",
        "Title8": "Rafting",
        "Paragraph8": "Active adventurers can look beyond trekking and get their kicks white water rafting down Nepal's rivers. As well as being exciting, rafting is a great way to view wildlife and birdlife. Winding through the mid hills of Nepal, the Seti River flows through steep forested canyons before joining the raging Trisuli River. Here, the Terai plains open up, but the water remains challenging, with grade II and III rapids to navigate. Paddles up!"

        "Main_Title": "Best time to visit Nepal",
        "Main_Paragraph": "October to December is the best time to visit Nepal, as dry days make trekking easier and offer good visibility. Spring (late February to mid-April) is also a great season to trek in Nepal. Autumn brings exceptional clarity, the dust washed away by the monsoon; spring days are warmer and longer. The summer monsoon is between June and September, so these usually arent the best months to visit, especially as June is the hottest month in Nepal. However, it is an incredible time to see the country alive with growth and freshness. Winter  especially January and February  is very chilly. Wrap up warm and youll be some of the only visitors in the mountains.",

        "when_to_go_html": "<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Tiger safaris start</li>\n<li>Coldest month</li>\n<li>Low season for trekking</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nNepal in January is very cold. It very rarely snows in Kathmandu  even in this, the coldest month of the year  but the average low is around 1°C. Tiger watching season starts mid-January. In Bandipur National Park, villagers cut the long grasses for thatch, meaning wildlife is easier to spot. Few people trek. High passes are blocked with snow  so check before setting out, stay low, or prepare for detours. <br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Warming up at the end of the month</li>\n<li>Still cold at night</li>\n<li>Few crowds</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nIts a chilly start in Nepal in February, but as the month progresses it starts to get spring-like. Late February is the start of trekking season. There are very few crowds, but the high peaks might not be visible because of cloud; lower-altitude treks might be most comfortable. Holi festival can fall at the end of February, adding a splash of colour to precede the spring flowers that come next month. <br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Spring flowers in the Langtang Valley</li>\n<li>Start of spring trekking season</li>\n<li>Second most popular time after autumn</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nThe start of spring proper. Flowers bloom in Nepal in March, and there are longer days and longer trekking opportunities, though views might sometimes be obscured by cloud. Lots of small group trips start: everything from wildlife watching to an Everest circuit, and its the busy season in popular trekking areas. In lowlands like Bandipur, its the start of summer, and its getting warm on tiger tracking trips.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>High-altitude trekking</li>\n<li>Rhododendrons</li>\n<li>Hot at low altitude  for tiger watching</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nRhododendrons welcome trekkers into Nepal in April.  Kathmandu is sunny and in the lowland areas its starting to get hot. If you dont mind temperatures in the 30°Cs and 40°Cs, you might be lucky enough to see tigers coming to water sources in Chitwan National Park. For cooler climes, go trekking and go high, as snow has melted from the passes and you can rise above any low cloud.<div style=\"margin-top: 15px;\"></div>\n<bullet><b>April is a great time for</b> <a href=\"/holiday/5014/nepal-trek-with-chitwan-national-park-safari\">our Nepal trek with Chitwan National Park safari holiday</a></bullet><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Warm to very hot</li>\n<li>Last good month for hiking and wildlife</li>\n<li>Monsoon approaching</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nNepal in May is enjoying the warmest months. It is also the calm before the storm: clouds begin to gather and showers begin to fall as a precursor to the monsoon season. It can be hot and humid in Pokhara and Kathmandu, with afternoon showers, and it can be 35°C in Chitwan National Park. Sneak to Everest Base Camp just before the monsoon comes for the chance run into lots of interesting trekking parties heading for the summit.<div style=\"margin-top: 15px;\"></div>\n<bullet><b>May is a good time for</b> <a href=\"/holiday/3180/himalayan-cultural-tours-bhutan-tibet-and-nepal\">combining Bhutan, Tibet and Nepal</a></bullet><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Start of monsoon</li>\n<li>Upper Mustang remains dry</li>\n<li>Some trekking trails and roads closed</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nJune means monsoon across most of Nepal, except for in the far north: the Mustang and Dolpo regions lie in a rain shadow and this is a good opportunity to visit areas which are very cold outside of summer. As for trekking elsewhere in Nepal in June: its off. Trails and roads are closed by landslides and floods; leeches thrive. National parks are closed for wildlife watching as the roads are not driveable.\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Peak monsoon</li>\n<li>Farmers hard at work in rice paddies</li>\n<li>Trekking trails and tea houses closed</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nIts the wettest month of the monsoon across Nepal in July. In Pokhara, one of the rainiest places in the country, nearly 80cm of rain falls in the month. Between June and July, you might encounter the Ropain Festival, which marks the start of rice paddy planting season  the monsoon is essential for farmers. If you want to trek, go to the dry and remote Upper Dolpo or Upper Mustang, or hop over to neighbouring Ladakh, as these lie in rain shadow areas. <br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Still hot and wet</li>\n<li>Last monsoon month</li>\n<li>Trekking trails and tea houses closed</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nNepal in August is still hot and wet. As with all monsoon months here, it doesnt necessarily rain all day, but it does rain every day; the monsoon rains tend to fall in the late afternoon or at night, and mornings can be sparkling and clear. Rice paddies are lush with green shoots and water rushes through the valleys. Its still a good time to go to the Dolpo and Mustang regions.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Start of autumn trekking season</li>\n<li>Some rain might stick around</li>\n<li>Better at end of the month</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nThe teahouses on the trekking trails are open again to visitors. Nepal in September sees the monsoon disappearing, and by the end of the month, rain has totally cleared and the country is fresh: insects, dust and cloud washed away. Months of stable weather and clear skies are to follow. As September progresses, the weather just gets better and better.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Most popular trekking month</li>\n<li>Stable weather</li>\n<li>Loads of walking options</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nThe way the replenished landscapes spring to life during autumn is spectacular. Dont forget your camera. This is the best and most popular month for trekking, but for something different, Nepal in October is also a great time for rafting. As climate change extends the monsoon, October remains the most reliable dry, cloud-free trekking month.<div style=\"margin-top: 15px;\"></div>\n<bullet><b>October is a great time for</b> <a href=\"/holiday/16249/small-group-holiday-to-nepal\">our small group holiday to Nepal</a></bullet><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Clear skies</li>\n<li>Stable weather</li>\n<li>Great for trekking</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nNepal in November might be experiencing its clearest skies of the year, which means great views of mountain peaks. There are easy trekking conditions all the way through this month before the quieter season begins in colder December. Tihar, the Diwali-like festival of lights, lasts for five days around this time of year. In Nepal, it particularly celebrates animals, and its a lovely time to be in the country. <br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Snow leopard spotting</li>\n<li>Trekking in popular areas still possible</li>\n<li>Colder and quieter</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nIn Nepal in December, its getting cold and its the end of the busy trekking season. However, its not unbearably cold, and its still possible to trek if youre prepared to be flexible about the colder weather at altitude, and the possibility of detouring due to snow. You can do the Annapurna Circuit or walk in the Everest region. Its also a great time to look for snow leopards.<div style=\"margin-top: 15px;\"></div>\n<bullet><b>December is a great time to go on</b> <a href=\"/holiday/27471/snow-leopard-trek-in-nepal\">our snow leopard trek in Nepal</a></bullet><br/><br/>",

This three-day Buddhist festival sees monks banish evils through ceremony and dance in Lo Manthang, the capital of Upper Mustang, an isolated and less-visited region in the north-west of Nepal. Villagers might also fire off guns to ensure that the demons have truly fled.",
        "title4": "Ropain (June)",
        "paragraph4": "Not many travellers visit Nepal during its monsoon but its the time of year where the rice paddies are planted, and with this comes a festival to celebrate the arrival of green shoots and swelling waters. At Ropain, people go out in the rice paddies to prepare them for planting. Songs are sung  and perhaps a bit of mud is slung as people play in the wet fields. Beaten rice and yoghurt is the traditional food of choice.",
        "title5": "Teej (August or September)",
        "paragraph5": "With red sarees and red tika, Hindu women in Nepal celebrate Teej with feasting and dancing. Whilst prayers are offered to the longevity and health of their spouses, its a time for women  they get a public holiday and do not work, and married women return to their childhood homes. Its also a time of sisterhood, and for self-expression in a society where womens voices are not often heard.",
        "title6": "Dashain (September or October)",
        "paragraph6": "One of the countrys biggest festivals, Dashain is a Hindu celebration of the harvest and the victory of good over evil, particularly the victory of the goddess Durga over the demon Mahishasura. Its celebrations can last for 15 days and each day has a special significance and events. Animal sacrifice is an important part of the festivities and occurs on the eighth day.",
        "title7": "Tihar (October or November)",
        "paragraph7": "Expect five days of festivities in Nepal for the festival of light. In Nepal, Hindus especially celebrate animals. Crows, dogs, cows and ox are worshipped on different days, and dogs, ox and cows adorned with garlands. On the fifth day, its time to turn attention to non-furry parties.

        "paragraph10": "The monsoon in Nepal is from\nJune to early September\n, but rains can start in May. The rainiest months are July and August and by mid-September clouds have cleared, leaving a dry, bright autumn. However, climate change is making the rainy season  Nepals monsoon season  last longer and become more unreliable.",
        "title11": "When is the worst time to visit Nepal?",
        "paragraph11": "Not many people fancy visiting Nepal in the monsoon months of\nJune, July and August\n. Although its very lush and it doesnt rain all the time, its a bad time for wildlife watching and for trekking, and lots of paths are closed  or might even be washed away. The other quiet season is winter, as it can be very cold on trekking paths, especially at night, though people still come in fewer numbers to experience the paths in the quiet."
