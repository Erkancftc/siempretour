    "Main_Title": "Best time to visit Sudan",
    "Main_Paragraph": "The best time to visit Sudan is when it deigns to cool just a tad, the lowest temperatures being in Jan, averaging 30°C. However, temperatures can halve at night during Dec-Feb, making travel a lot more bearable. In the desert itself, temperatures can dip a lot, with cold winds whipping your fleeces and down jackets out of your bag in an instant. Rain falls between May-Sept, and the Nile can start to fill its floodplains during that time, but tour companies tend to avoid these times, as transport can become very difficult.",

    "title3": "Food & drink advice",
    "paragraph3": "There are lots of fresh fruit and veg on offer. And for veggies, there are plenty of different beans, such as \nFul medames\n, which are fava beans, falafel and so on. There is no booze, although there is alcohol free Bavaria beer, which is OK if you are desperate.",
    "title4": "Photography advice",
    "paragraph4": "Dont take photos in public places, although security staff are generally friendly and arent going to rip your camera off you. However, expect other people to want to take their pictures of you when you take photos of them  this can be great fun.",
    "title5": "Packing tips",
    "paragraph5": "Dont take your best clothes. It will be dusty everywhere  youre in the desert, it cant be avoided. Take a wide brimmed hat  it will be bright.",
    "title6": "Shopping tips",
    "paragraph6": "Sudan is NOT a touristy place. Youll hardly see any other tourists around and frequently will be the only people at the sites youre visiting. This is great, as you can wander around at leisure, without getting hassled. There arent any souvenir hawkers hassling you which does mean that not many souvenirs are available. So, if you want to bring things home, then local sweets, snacks, nuts & seeds  things youll have eaten and seen in the local shops, are good options.",

    "paragraph7": "Katherine Tory from our partner, Exodus Travels, shares her Sudan travel tips:\nFor me nothing can beat spending a few days exploring the Western desert by 4WD; it is tough these days to travel to somewhere really remote  no phone signal, no light pollution, fabulous night skys, exploring huge sand dunes. Perfect!",
    "title8": "Cultural tips",
    "paragraph8": "I believe its important to be respectful of the culture no matter where you travel to, and this certainly goes for Sudan. Women should wear long skirts/trousers and have their shoulders covered. If entering mosques women will also be expected to cover their head. Men can wear knee-length shorts but may prefer to wear long trousers.",

    "paragraph11": "\"You don`t need loo rolls or torches if you are on the 8 day trip as all accommodation has it all with no squat loos. Take a fly whisk as there are many flies in the countryside especially by the Nile. If you are into history and archaeology and don`t mind piles of stone ruins, you will appreciate all the other sites, which are fantastic. Don`t expect to see fossils, because there are not fossils other than fossilized trees when you stay in the Nubian rest house, you are in for a treat. Beautiful and peaceful and if you have a chance, then climb the big rock opposite at sunset. It is worth the effort for the view and history at your feet\" <b>- Geoffrey Hermsen</b><br/><br/>\r\n\r\n\"Just book it, don't ponder about it and worry about safety, I never felt as safe and for me it was a trip of a lifetimeThe most memorable part of my journey in Sudan was the Sudanese people, I have never experienced just a warm welcome in my life, it will forever stay with me.\" <b>- Cathal Murphy</b>"
