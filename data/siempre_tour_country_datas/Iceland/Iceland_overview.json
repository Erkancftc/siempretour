    "Main_Title": "Our Iceland holidays & tours",
    "Main_Paragraph": "Our Iceland holidays explore beyond the Golden Circle, introducing you to off-road hot springs, glacier hikes and the peace of the lesser visited east. Their secret? Excellent itineraries and expert guides wholl help you navigate these otherworldly and fragile landscapes with care  whether thats on a small group tour that swings by a local tree-planting project or a cruise aboard a hybrid electric small ship. Our trips take their time, too, with most offering you a whole week  or more  to experience Icelands elemental wonders.",
    "Subtitle": "About our Iceland holidays",
    "Title1": "One Ring Road to rule them all",
    "Paragraph1": "Route 1 circles the whole of Iceland, rolling thorough epic, fantastical landscapes that inspired\nThe Lord of the Rings\n. Our best self drive trips give you a week or two to see it all  or focus on oft-overlooked routes like the wild Westfjords or waterfall-splashed Diamond Circle. With more time and flexible timings, you dont have to resist the hot spring simmering to your right or the track heading to the waterfall on the horizon. Our experts also organise everything from car hire to accommodation, which can be tailored to your preferences. Youve just got to decide if you prefer cosy family-run guest houses or design hotels with in-house restaurants serving creative takes on Icelandic cuisine or a sprinkling of both.",

    "Title2": "Aurora nights with local guides",
    "Paragraph2": "What with jumping into 4x4s and listening avidly to weather forecasts, chasing the Northern Lights is like going on safari. As with safaris, viewings are likely but never guaranteed  however, youll get your best chance by travelling with a guide who knows the best and most peaceful viewing points. Our holidays are led by such guides and ensconce you beneath some of the unpolluted skies in Europe. Here, away from Reykjaviks city lights, glass-walled cabins and hotels with aurora alerts maximise viewing opportunities. Many of our trips sweeten the pot with photography workshops or whale watching trips on fishing boats",

    "Title3": "Wild walks",
    "Paragraph3": "Walking in Iceland is wild. Youll thread past bubbling hot springs and glacier-dotted lakes, and hike to the sounds of rushing waterfalls. Our holidays match you up with knowledgeable guides who share a huge respect for the ever-changing landscape. And if theres anything that Icelanders are good at, its telling a good tale. Youll also learn which rock formations are petrified trolls, where the\nhuldufolk\n(hidden people) reside  and why you\nreally\nshouldnt step off that path. We have self guided options too; great for adventurers whod like a little more freedom to roam but with the comfort of route notes tailored to your fitness levels and interests.",
    "Title4": "Small ships; big adventures",
    "Paragraph4": "Some of the Icelandic coast is so inaccessible and the cliffs so sheer that the best way to see them is by boat. Our small ship cruises are your best bet  a far cry from the leviathan liners laden with 3,000-plus passengers. The skippers of smaller ships can sneak you into whale-friendly fjords and drop anchor at working ports that most cruise visitors dont get to see. Theyre quieter, too  especially the newest hybrid electric ships  so you can breeze past puffin cliffs without disturbing the colony. Want to see it all while learning about it all? Our week-long circumnavigations have conservationists and scientists on-board to offer presentations on cetaceans, reveal the secrets of volcanology, and explain the effect of climate change on Icelands disappearing glaciers.",

    "Title5": "Halting Icelands whaling industry one holiday at a time",
    "Paragraph5": "Minke is all over menus in Reykjavik, so its easy to think that its a beloved foodstuff in Iceland. But only one percent of Icelanders eat whale regularly. Tourists looking for a traditional dish are far more likely to eat whale than Icelanders. Until 2019, most of the whale meat was shipped to Japan, but when Japan restarted hunting in its own waters, Icelandic whalers lost profits  together with their appetite for whaling. Instead of propping up the industrys dying days, go on one of our whale watching tours that give you a taste of the wonder of wild whales instead. Together, we can help show that whales are more valuable in the ocean than diced up on a plate.",
    "Title6": "Adventure made easy",
    "Paragraph6": "Our holidays make Icelandic adventures easy  really easy. Most of our trips are well-organised small group holidays steered by tour leaders and local guides. Adventuring with new friends is especially great for solo travellers and reduces costs if youre keeping an eye on your krona. Tailor made trips, meanwhile, tend to be self drive and walking adventures where you can choose your own route, but with the invaluable advice of our Iceland experts  many of whom live in Iceland and know it like the back of their mittened hand."
