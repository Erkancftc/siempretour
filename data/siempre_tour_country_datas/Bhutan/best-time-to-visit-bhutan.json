    "Main_Paragraph": "October to December is the best time to visit Bhutan, with the weather at its driest and brightest. Autumn months (September-November) also see less rainfall and clear skies. Winter (December-February) is a photographers dream; prayer flags flutter against snowy backdrops. However, road closures are common and temperatures can drop below zero at night. Spring (March-May) can be wet, but the birds are in song and the wildflowers  including rhododendrons  are out, which can make it the best season to visit Bhutan for hiking. The soaking monsoon season (June-August) is best avoided, although some people still travel in the hottest month of July. Also note that Bhutans weather varies dramatically depending on the elevation.",

Its not as snowy as you think in the lower altitudes of Bhutan in January, but it is cold, with lows of -6°C in Paro at night and an average high of just 7°C. Up above 3,000m the snow can block the roads. This off-season time is very quiet in terms of visitors, but its dry, and you might have views of the white peaks of Himalayan mountains.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Warms up at the end of the month</li>\n<li>Still cold at night</li>\n<li>High trails blocked with snow</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nThe last month of winter has highs of 8°C and lows of -5°C. In Bhutan in February, its quiet and there are few trekkers about (not that its ever very busy in the first place). Those who come might get views of Himalayan mountains covered in snow, and be able enjoy them all for themselves, though high trails will still be blocked with snow.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Second most popular time after autumn</li>\n<li>Spring flowers </li>\n<li>Start of spring trekking season</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nMarch marks the start of spring with a flourish. Its the start of trekking season, and clear skies combined with colourful flowering hills make for splendid accompanying scenery. After chilly mornings, the temperature becomes pleasant in the day  great for sightseeing tours. You can trek the Druk Path in Bhutan in March, and many other trekking routes are open, too.<div style=\"margin-top: 15px;\"></div>\n<bullet><b>March is a good time for combining countries on</b> <a href=\"/holiday/3180/himalayan-cultural-tours-bhutan-tibet-and-nepal\">our tour to Bhutan, Tibet and Nepal</a></bullet><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Great walking season</li>\n<li>Rhododendrons</li>\n<li>Birdlife</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nMagenta rhododendrons bloom on the hills, while magnolia, jacaranda, primroses and violets add their own displays to the valleys of Bhutan in April. Its a beautiful time for our small group tours and a good time to look out for birds and other wildlife. This is also a popular trekking month. There are lows of 4°C and highs of 15°C in Paro and hikers will find it nicely dry and comfortable for walking.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Last good month for trekking</li>\n<li>Humid with some rain</li>\n<li>Monsoon approaching</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nThe late spring brings higher humidity to the valleys in Bhutan in May, as well as a bit more warmth, cloud and rain, especially as the month progresses. But the rhododendrons are still in bloom, making this a picture-perfect time for photographers and nature lovers, and its nice and warm for trekkers. Our small group tours are still running this month  the final few before monsoon season kicks off.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Start of the monsoon</li>\n<li>Greenery and flowers</li>\n<li>Some trekking trails and roads closed</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nBhutan in June is experiencing monsoon season. Its wetter than in other areas of the Himalayas, but the result is lots of fresh homegrown produce, and greenery and flowers in the valleys. The monsoon brings lots of rain, landslides, view-obscuring clouds, and leeches  yes, leeches. There are good deals to be had, but small group tours tend to pause until September or October.\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Swap hiking for cultural tours</li>\n<li>Peak monsoon</li>\n<li>Lots of rain</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nIts peak monsoon season and half a metre of rain falls on Paro. Bhutan in July is also experiencing its warmest temperatures of the year, with average highs of 18°C in Paro and 22°C further east in Trashigang. If youre travelling, youre probably not hiking as paths might well be washed away, but you could pack a raincoat and do a cultural tour.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Cultural tours and spa trips</li>\n<li>Last monsoon month; rainy throughout</li>\n<li>Few visitors </li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nThe monsoon pours on and temperatures are still warm, reaching the high 20°Cs in some areas. Bhutan in August is experiencing its last full month of monsoon, but the rainfall is lower than the preceding month. Still, since paths get washed away in the monsoon season, hiking is out for most people  whilst cultural tours, or some time in a spa, might be tempting.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Start of autumn trekking season</li>\n<li>Some rain might stick around</li>\n<li>Drier end of the month</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nA month of two halves. The first half of September is rainy as the monsoon ends; trekkers might find muddy, washed-out paths and cloudy skies. But the second half of the month is drier, the skies clear up, and its warm, with highs of 17°C and lows of 8°C. Bhutan in September is entering the main tourist season, and youll find our small group cultural tours and trekking departures gearing up.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Stable weather</li>\n<li>Festivals</li>\n<li>Most popular trekking month</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nMost people visit Bhutan in October, so you will want to book your holiday in advance as flights can sell out. That said, its still quiet in Bhutan. October is one of the best months for hiking, and youll find our small group departures for the Snowman Trek are in October. Small group cultural tours take off, too.<div style=\"margin-top: 15px;\"></div>\n<bullet><b>October is a great time for</b> <a href=\"/holiday/17143/bhutan-small-group-tours\">our Bhutan small group tour</a></bullet><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Very dry and clear</li>\n<li>Good for wildlife </li>\n<li>A popular trekking month</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nSince there are many November festivals to visit, lots of our small group tours depart this month. Its a good time for wildlife, too: tiger watching, plus the endangered black-necked cranes arrive for winter, prompting (you guessed it) a festival. Theres a nip in the air in Bhutan in November and it starts to get cold at night  but the skies are clear, its drier than October, and its another wonderful month for trekking.<div style=\"margin-top: 15px;\"></div>\n<bullet><b>November is a great time for</b> <a href=\"/holiday/16928/bhutan-holiday-culture-and-festivals\">our Bhutan culture and festivals holiday</a></bullet><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Dry and cold</li>\n<li>Beautiful snowy mountains</li>\n<li>Off season for trekking</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nThe first part of December isnt too cold, but it does get colder. This is the off season  the Bhutanese winter, which lasts until the start of March. Bhutan in December is dry, the skies are blissfully crisp and clear, and the valleys are sunny with far-reaching views across the Himalayas  well worth it for those who can brave the chill. Visiting photographers will delight in capturing the snowy backdrops.",
