    "Main_Title": "Our Mauritius holidays & tours",
    "Main_Paragraph": "Glittering like the crown jewels of the Indian Ocean, the island nation of Mauritius never ceases to amaze. There are pure white sand beaches, colourful tropical gardens and jade-coated mountain slopes. If you simply stayed in an all inclusive resort, you’d miss out. Instead, our Mauritius holidays and Mauritius tours support local businesses that are eschewing the fly-and-flop model. Try a cooking lesson with a local family, a tour by electric bike, or let a local nature guide lead you to a waterfall. Our holidays explore the island’s endemic dry forest, and in doing so, help justify its continued protection so that the island can be enjoyed for years to come.",

    "Paragraph1": "He soon learned that the top things on TripAdvisor werent often the places he wanted people to see. Its not the visitors fault. They dont know it, because the brochure doesnt say it Growing up, I really felt that people were not experiencing the best my country had to offer.",

    "Title2": "",
    "Paragraph2": "It was one of the reasons why he co-founded Mauritius Conscious with his partner Romina. The Mauritius holidays that they organise for us check off what they consider to be the\nreal\nbest activities in Mauritius, from exploring Port Louis through its street food and camping in the mountains to sailing in a traditional\npirogue\nor sea kayaking to Amber Island. Keep reading to find out what they recommend",

    "Title3": "Go canyoning in Seven Cascades",
    "Paragraph3": "Also known as Tamarind Falls, the Seven Cascades is a waterfall with  you guessed it  seven falls between 45m and 10m high. After a mix of canyoning and hiking through wild forest and along the riverbank, youll get to reward yourself with a dive into the final plunge pool for a swim. Youll need a guide to introduce you to the twisted terrain here.",
    "Title4": "",
    "Paragraph4": "Outside the city, you can visit a permaculture forest by the beach or join a cooking lesson with one of the Mauritian\nmamans\n  after she shows you how to pick the best produce in the market. Youll share the meal and get a recipe to take home with you; the best kind of souvenir.",
    "image3": "",
    "Title5": "",
    "Paragraph5": "You wont find Mauritian wine at your local  theres only one vineyard in Mauritius, and it swaps grapes for organically grown lychees. Its practically artisanal: each lychee is peeled by hand before fermentation. White and pink lychee wines range from dry to sweet, and include a candied dessert wine.",
    "Title6": "Snooze in a river lodge, mountain camp or Creole guest house",
    "Paragraph6": "Beach resorts should be your last resort when it comes to accommodation in Mauritius  especially when the alternatives are so interesting. You could stay in a hotel with a well-loved organic café near Le Morne, a beach guest house on Rodrigues Island, a family-run Creole auberge, or a forest ecolodge.",
    "Title7": "",
    "Paragraph7": "Most holidays to Mauritius are tailor made, so you can even choose to camp on the mountain for the night. You hike the mountain, you camp on it, and you watch the sunrise, says Gerald. You see the first rays of sunrise lighting up the whole horizon. The infinity of the Indian Ocean and the colours are amazing.",
    "Title8": "",
    "Paragraph8": "You dont have to set aside a whole day for transferring between hotels, either. Mauritius is petite, so you can drive from the northern to the southern tip in around an hour.",
    "Title9": "Follow the leader around Port Louis",
    "Paragraph9": "As tempting as it is to retreat to the beaches and forests, youll get to know Mauritius better by spending time in the capital, Port Louis, too. About a sixth of the population live in this little city squashed between the green Moka Mountains and a sheltered bay.",
    "Title10": "",
    "Paragraph10": "The best tours place the local people front and centre. Guides can introduce you to the people who still make shoes, steam dumplings, print books and create jewellery by hand in the shadow of the skyscraping financial district.",
    "Title11": "",
    "Paragraph11": "Youll see colonial-era buildings like the Penny Museum and Aapravasi Ghat, and learn about the enslaved people and indentured servants who built them under Dutch, French and British rule. The variety of holy places gives you an idea of the mix of religions here, too: marbled Jummah Masjid Mosque, St Louis Cathedral, Kwan Tee Pagoda and the Tamil temple, Sockalingum Meenatchee Ammen Kovil.",
    "Title12": "",
    "Paragraph12": "If youve got kids in tow, theyll help out with guiding  the tour will transform into a treasure hunt. The adults will be captivated by the story and everything behind the story of a building or an area of the city, says Gerald, and at the same time the kids will be learning fun facts around the story of Mauritius."
