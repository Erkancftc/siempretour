    "Main_Paragraph": "The best time to visit Serbia is when snow, rain and slush have stopped. April onwards things start to heat up, with highs of 17°C perfect for taking in the cultural highlights. With the Dinaric Alps, trekkers might want to wait until the summer, when temperatures can hit high 20s, but these are the mountains, so always be prepared for wind chill and rain, albeit in summer thunderstorm bursts. Rain is highest in May- June throughout the country. Festival highlights include Dragačevo Trumpet Festival, with gypsy brass bands in Guča every Aug, Belgrade Music Festival in Oct, just in time for the wine harvest, and EXIT Music Festival in July.",

On the journey from the airport it may not look like the prettiest of cities but when you get into the centre things vastly improve. Belgrade Fortress & Kalemegdan Park is a very nice place to explore with some good views of where the Sava & Danube rivers meet. Outside of Belgrade, I enjoyed the train ride to Mokra Gora and my stay in the village of Sirogojno. Sirogojno is a little village to the west of the country where you can enjoy the tranquil setting as well as learn about how the community used to live.",
