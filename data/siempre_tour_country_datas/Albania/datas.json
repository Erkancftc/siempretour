        "Main_Paragraph": "After half a century cut off from the world by a Communist dictatorship, Albania has reopened to tourism, and in style. Our Albania holidays explore UNESCO-listed Ottoman towns perched on mountainsides, plunging valleys threaded with wild rivers, and ancient villages where hospitality to guests is a matter of deep personal honour. Perhaps the best way to experience Albania is on foot, with walking holidays in the Accursed Mountains to the north taking in the Valbona and Theth national parks, where you can stay in rustic guest houses. Brilliant local guides accompany activity holidays where you can enjoy kayaking, paddleboarding out to see pelicans, and canyoning. And while Albania’s weaving industry suffered greatly when the Soviet factories closed, many independent artisans are still at the loom – our tours show you their nimble hands at work, and by doing so help this traditional craft survive.",

        "Title1": "Walking  in sunshine or snow",
        "Paragraph1": "In rural northern Albania, snow shoeing is used by farmers to get around their land in winter. But wait until the snow melts for your travels, and you'll cover more ground. The Albanian Alps feature some of Europe’s least-visited landscapes and there is only one way to discover them: on foot. In Theth National Park you can follow a valley between dramatic mountain peaks, and discover a stone “lock-in tower” which was once used to protect those involved in generations-long intra-family disputes. There are natural wonders here too, including waterfalls and the “Blue Eye of Kapre”, a stunning turquoise pool with its own waterfall – perfect for a dip. Along the way, you’ll meet friendly villagers, horses and carts, and your luggage can be transported by horse. You’ll learn about life in this isolated region, once characterised by feuds and fortresses – but now a peaceful winter wonderland of beech and pine forests and incredible rural hospitality.",
        "image1": "",
        "Title2": "Cycling holidays",
        "Paragraph2": "Cycling holidays in Albania take you from remote mountain ranges, past beautiful Ottoman towns, through picturesque villages and down to the Albanian Riviera, where you can sooth your pedal-weary calves with a dip in the Ionian Sea.\nGuided, small group cycling holidays cover adventurous routes  high mountain passes, meadow-covered plateaus and isolated hamlets that see few tourists. Cycling along lush valleys and past idyllic waterfalls takes you away from big roads and big crowds  into places where traditional dress is still worn, guesthouse owners welcome you like long-lost friends and food is grown just a few metres from where it is served. Daily distances average 45-70km, so you can cover some serious ground, though e-bike hire is sometimes offered too, and there is a support vehicle to transport luggage. You can always hop in if the going gets tough.\nCycling is most enjoyable in April-June or in September, either side of the searing summer months, and away from the coastal crowds of July and August.",
        "image2": "",
        "Title3": "Eat, & eat some more",
        "Paragraph3": "Although the country is slowly opening up, this subsistence culture still lingers, and todays visitors are likely to find that their meals have travelled metres rather than miles. This hasnt resulted in a limited diet, however, as this Mediterranean nation has fish-filled lakes and seas, fertile valleys (with vines as well as veg) and wild mountains  a hugely varied terrain offering up seasonal fruits, locally produced cheeses, goat and lamb, fresh olives and oil, and crisp salads.",
        "Title4": "Become a Balkan explorer",
        "Paragraph4": "Albania, Kosovo, Montenegro and Macedonia are all tantalisingly close as well as equally diminutive, meaning it’s possible to see two or even three of these countries in just a few days. The stunning town of Prizren in Kosovo is well worth a visit, with its well preserved Ottoman houses, Turkish baths and 11th century fortress; while Montenegro is best reached via the shores of stunning Lake Skadar, shared by the two countries. North Macedonia combines well with northern Albania and Kosovo – why not take in Mavrovo National Park and Lake Ohrid?",

        "Main_Paragraph": "April-June and September-October are the best time to go to Albania  youll avoid scorching coastal summer heat and bitter winter mountain cold, making these months ideal for walking, cycling, sightseeing, watersports and flopping on the beach. If youre tied to travelling in the summer holidays, dont fret; many beaches get a fraction of the visitors of their Mediterranean neighbours, despite being possibly even more beautiful. The crisp winter in the mountains is great for snowshoeing  though the rest of the country is cold and damp.",

This is the coldest month of the year, with thick snow in mountainous areas ruling out walking, though snowshoeing is possible. Temperatures here can drop below freezing. Elsewhere, such as on the coast, the climate is milder but damp, and most tourism businesses will be closed for the winter. The cities are very quiet  ideal if you want to completely avoid the crowds and dont mind the dreary weather.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Low season</li>\n<li>Cold, damp weather</li>\n<li>Mountain passes closed</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nThe grim winter weather continues throughout Albania in February, with little to recommend visiting at this time of year bar a smattering of winter sports in mountainous regions. This is the low season, and consequently you can find very good travel deals, but many hotels and restaurants simply close for the duration of the winter. <br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Peaceful city touring</li>\n<li>Cool and quiet Riviera</li>\n<li>Spring Day</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nBy March its still very quiet across Albania, but towards the end of the month there are signs of spring approaching  including the nationwide Spring Day pagan festival. Albania in March can be good for relaxed city sightseeing. The Albanian Riviera is damp and cool at this time of year, but you can enjoy the scenery without the crowds. Keep in mind that most shops, bars and restaurants will still not be open.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Quiet and inexpensive</li>\n<li>Small group tours</li>\n<li>Rainy but mild</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nApril is when Albanias tourist season gets into gear. Our small group walking and cycling tours begin from now, and while Albania in April can be rainy its great for seeing popular locations such as Berat and Lake Ohrid before they get busy. You can walk in lovely, peaceful rural areas in April, but higher elevations in the Accursed Alps will still be snowbound for some time; some popular walks such as the Theth to Valbona route are often inaccessible.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Walking and cycling</li>\n<li>Snow thawing</li>\n<li>Albanian Riviera</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nMay can be the best time to visit Albanias beaches. Theres a balmy Mediterranean climate and tourist resorts open for the summer. The weather is distinctly warmer across Albania in May, most notably on the coast and in central areas. In the mountains, where walkers and cyclists are by now a common sight, it can still be chilly, especially after dark. Meltwater rivers and waterfalls are at the peak of their powers in May, whilst mountain meadows are starting to sing with wildflowers.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Summer warmth</li>\n<li>Alpine walking</li>\n<li>Coast gets busy</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nAlbania in June is lovely, basking in a climate thats perfect for walking, cycling, sightseeing or simply relaxing on the beach. Youll have plenty of company, though. Albania has 400km of Mediterranean coastline and the popular beaches get very busy. June to September is also the best time to be in the Albanian Alps  though, again, dont expect solitude in places like Theth and Valbona.<div style=\"margin-top: 15px;\"></div>\n<bullet><b>June is great for</b> <a href=\"/holiday/12182/albania-walking-holiday\">our Albania walking holiday </a></bullet><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Walking and cycling</li>\n<li>Hot, sunny weather</li>\n<li>Busy on the coast</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nJuly is fiendishly hot along the coast and inland. This peak holiday month sees the popular coastal hub of Saranda packed with people escaping Tirana, and tourists heading over on day trips from Corfu. Long spoken of as off the beaten tourist track Albania is now very firmly on it, and its coastal charms are no secret. Prices are higher in Albania in July, though even then its usually significantly less expensive than other more established summer destinations in Europe.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Warm, sunny and dry</li>\n<li>Activity holidays</li>\n<li>Korca Beer Fest</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nWith a hot, sunny and dry climate, activity holidays are popular across Albania in August. Temperatures on the coast in the south can reach the mid-30°Cs and Tirana, a little inland, has a similar climate, though it tends to be cooler in the evenings. Mountainous areas in northern Albania are also lovely and warm, with occasional afternoon thunderstorms not unknown. You can cool off at one of the countrys biggest beer festivals, in Korca, in mid-August.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Autumn foliage</li>\n<li>Quieter on coast</li>\n<li>Still warm</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nAlbania in September can be fairly hot, but seasonal showers and constant sea breezes cool things down a little. Sea temperatures are glorious and the beaches are much quieter when school holidays are over. Temperatures dip towards the end of the month but not hugely, and you can expect a little more rain. As autumn nears, walkers in the Albanian Alps will enjoy some fabulous colours in the foliage.<div style=\"margin-top: 15px;\"></div>\n<bullet><b>September is great for</b> <a href=\"/holiday/8616/small-group-albania-holiday\">our small group Albania holiday </a></bullet><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Shoulder month</li>\n<li>Apple Festival</li>\n<li>Tourism slowing</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nOctober can be a great time of year to visit Albania. This is a month of harvest festivals, of wine tasting, and of enjoying the countrys magnificent natural beauty with few other people around. Days are mostly warm and sunny in Albania in October, though evenings are chilly, so after a days walking in the mountains a steaming bowl of bean and butternut broth will be a welcome sight. By the end of the month, many places are closing for the winter.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Rainiest month</li>\n<li>Snow at heights</li>\n<li>Brar Olive Festival</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nNovember is typically the cheapest time to visit Albania, though with good reason. Darkness and damp descend, with snow falling heavily in the mountains, ending the walking season. Our tailor made tours are still available and some accommodation is open, but Albania in November can be quite bleak, with cold, wet weather to be expected.<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<b><li>Start of winter</li>\n<li>Freezing in mountains</li>\n<li>Very little tourism</li></b><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"></div>\r\n\r\nAlbania in December is largely quiet, though there is a small winter sports scene in the mountains. The national parks in the Albanian Alps provide a range of trails for cross country skiing and snowshoeing. Its the least busy time of year to visit Albania, and outside the cities and a few parts of the Alps, many tourism businesses are closed. Saranda hosts a lovely Christmas market on the coast.",

        "paragraph2": "Spring Day is a national holiday in Albania. This pagan festival is celebrated across the country  with a particularly large following in the central region of Elbasan and in Tirana, where the park fills with musicians, acrobats and other performances. From 1 March youll see young people wearing braided red and white bracelets, which are hung on trees for good luck following the celebrations. Dont miss the traditional\nballokume\ncornflour biscuits.",
        "title3": "Za Fest (July)",
        "paragraph3": "The mountain village of Theth is well-known as a base for walking in the Albanian Alps. In July, it also hosts the brilliant Za Fest, created by Albanian singer-songwriter Vlashent Sata, which fuses folk music with poetry, film, hiking and yoga. Not all at the same time though, sadly. Performances are not confined to the stages. You could be walking through a copse of trees and encounter a poetry reading or find someone strumming their guitar to a backdrop of tinkling goat bells.",
        "title4": "Korca Beer Fest (August)",
        "paragraph4": "You can enjoy sampling an impressive range of brews both local and international at one of Albanias largest festivals, held in the mountainous city of Korca. Over five nights in August, the city welcomes around 100,000 people to share a drink and enjoy a host of live music performances and DJ sets. One of Albanias oldest beer brands originated in Korca, so its a fitting setting, and the citys elegant architecture only adds to the atmosphere.",
        "title5": "Apple Festival (October)",
        "paragraph5": "Held in the village of Dvoran near Korca every August, this long-established harvest festival is a celebration of one of the regions biggest crops, with a great number of apple varieties available. It also serves another useful purpose in promoting the fruit, and local producers, who often struggle to make a profit. Tourists, especially hungry tourists, are very welcome  come early to take part in the symbolic apple-picking in one of the villages orchards.",
        "title6": "Wine & Stories of Berat (October)",
        "paragraph6": "The charmingly named Wine and Stories of Berat festival is held in the riverside city of Berat, a UNESCO World Heritage Site with centuries of winemaking heritage. Dozens of wineries set up stalls in the city centre, with expert sommeliers leading tasting sessions. This is also an opportunity to sample traditional Albanian cuisine, and to hear some interesting stories about the history of Albanian viniculture, cheese, olives and dried figs.",

        "paragraph8": "April to early June\nand\nSeptember and October\nare the best months to visit Albania. These months tend to enjoy warm, pleasant weather, and are nowhere near as busy as the peak summer season. Spring means wildflowers in the mountains, a bit of a chill in the air still, and some areas at higher elevations still closed off due to snow. Autumn is harvest festivals, wonderful sea temperatures, and vivid colours in the landscapes. Both are ideal for walking and cycling holidays.",
        "title9": "What is the hottest month in Albania?",
        "paragraph9": "July and August\nare the hottest months in Albania. Daytime temperatures on the Mediterranean coast can easily get into the mid-30°Cs, so the resorts strung along the Albanian Riviera are enormously popular and get very busy. Its typically a bit cooler in the mountains, and summer is great for walking, cycling and other activity breaks, though well-known areas such as Theth and Valbona do attract crowds.",
        "title10": "What is the driest month in Albania?",
        "paragraph10": "July and August\nare the driest months of the year in Albania. Rainfall is low across the country and the Albanian Riviera is immensely popular during the summer for beach retreats. If youre heading up into mountainous areas like the Albanian Alps, remember its not unusual to encounter a thunderstorm in the afternoons now and again. These are usually very short, though, and shouldnt impact on your activities."
