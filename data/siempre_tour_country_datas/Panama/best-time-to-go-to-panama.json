    "Main_Paragraph": "The best time to visit Panama is Dec-Apr, officially the dry season. However, the rainy season is lusher, quieter and cheaper  with downpours mainly occurring in the afternoon The Pacific Coast, especially around Panama City, is much drier than the Caribbean, with humidity less fierce. The lowlands are seriously hot year round, day and night  sunhats and siestas are a must. The highlands are fresher, especially at night, but like all mountains, weather can change on a sixpence so come prepared. Be prepared for the celebrations for carnival (Feb/Mar) and Independence Day on 3rd Nov.",

    "paragraph2": "<b>Annie Young, proud Panamanian: </b>Panama is a bridge between continents and has been a bridge of life since its formation.  This isthmus made it easier for animals and plants to migrate between the continents.  Also, the history of Panama is unique, travelers will be able to discover the path that was used by the Spanish Crown to move the treasures from the Americas to Europe and admire some UNESCO sites that still stand today. We are also a country of diversity, that started before the arrival of the Europeans to the Isthmus, continued during the Canal Construction and still does today.",
    "title3": "Wildlife & birding advice",
    "paragraph3": "Vicki Brown, Responsible Travels travel writer and editor, shares her top Panama travel tips:\nThe wildlife in Bocas del Toro is extraordinary. Youll just be heading back to your hotel in a water taxi, and a manta ray will cruise by. Or wandering to a bar for a sundowner, and a sloth will be dangling from a tree in front of you. There are plenty of places in the world to see wildlife but Ive never encountered it at quite such close range! And dont miss the poison dart frogs. The species has evolved to be a different colour on every island  red with black spots, golden yellow, green  and the blue jean frog which ready does look like hes wearing denim!",

    "paragraph4": "Annie Young explains why her home country is a paradise for birders:\nWe have more than 1,000 bird species in the country out of 10,000 existent in the world. A world class spot for bird watching in Panama is Pipeline road. At only 50 minutes from the City, these trails located in the Panama Canal Watershed give opportunities to admire species such as blue cotinga, pheasant cuckoo and crested eagle. Boquete also offers also great opportunities for a different type of birds, such as the resplendent quetzal, volcano hummingbird, ruddy treerunner and blue-throated (emerald) toucanet.",
    "title5": "Shopping tips",
    "paragraph5": "<b>Vicki shares her top Panama travel tips: </b>Panamas shopping reputation comes from its super cheap malls  a result of the canals imports. But there are much more exciting places to shop for souvenirs. The Ngobe-Buglé make chacara bags  woven from the fibres of leaves and coloured with natural dyes. The Kuna women stitch fabrics called molas which were traditionally worn, but are now usually decorative. They are extremely detailed and beautiful. They also weave stunning baskets from plant fibres in gorgeous designs. Shop from the communities if you can  or from the craft market in Panama Citys Casco Viejo.",
    "title6": "Food tips",
    "paragraph6": "Annie Young:\nOur gastronomy reflects our rich historical influences of the Afro Antillean, Amerindian, Chinese, Spanish, French, American and other cultures that have played essential role that makes Panama what it is today. My favorite dishes are\nhojaldra\n(sweet fried dough), tortilla (thick corn cakes),\ntasajo\n(beef stew) and\ncarimañola\n(cassava fritter stuffed with meat or chicken and cheese). And you cant miss a fresh ceviche at the local fish market."
