    "Main_Title": "Our Panama holidays & tours",
    "Main_Paragraph": "Easily combined with neighbouring Costa Rica, Panama is no slouch in the natural wonders department. There is superb snorkelling to be had around the San Blas archipelago, home to the indigenous Kuna people, as well as exquisite birdwatching here in the cloud forests of the Boquete Highlands. Agriculture is woven into the fabric of Panama; Boquete is also prime coffee-growing territory – our Panama holidays ensure that when you visit to learn the journey of coffee from fruit to cup, the local farmers benefit directly. And cacao is widely grown across this tiny country – spending time with the Ngobe Bugle people in the Bocas del Toro archipelago is a chance not only to see how they use it, but also to explore their culture and ways of life. Panama – a lot more than just a canal and a hat.",

    "Title1": "1. Bocas Del Toro",
    "Paragraph1": "Once youve set foot on these little islands, they never quite leave your heart or mind. The names of Red Frog Beach, Dolphin Bay, Coral Cay and Starfish Beach all give clues as to their enchanting inhabitants, who live alongside indigenous Ngobe-Buglé, Guari-Guari-speaking Afro Caribbeans and Latinos. Snorkel, swim, sunbathe and surf  then salsa the night away in open air bars, perched over the water.",

    "Title2": "2. Boquete & Chiriqui Highlands",
    "Paragraph2": "This is classic Central America; a highland town surrounded by hiking trails which lead into the mountains, through cloud forest, past creeks and around the base of Volcán Barú. Look out for resplendent quetzals and harpy eagles as well as howler monkeys and sloths. Raft the Chiriquí River, zipline through the canopy or mountain bike down the hillsides  then refuel at a local coffee farm.",
    "image2": "",
    "Title3": "3. Panama Canal",
    "Paragraph3": "I say Panama, you say Canal. This incredible engineering feat carves 77km through the country, flooding acres of rainforest and changing the face of international trade. Visit the Miraflores Locks to see enormous cargo ships travelling between the Pacific and Caribbean, discover the macabre history in the nearby museum, or cruise the canal through the locks and the tropical Lake Gatún, for the full experience.",
    "Title4": "4. Panama City",
    "Paragraph4": "There are three distinct sides to Panama City. Start in the glam and glass-filled center, where skyscrapers tower ever higher. Spend a day wandering the Casco Viejo (Old Quarter), with its crumbling colonial mansions, cobbled streets and Spanish convents. Then head further back in time with the ruins of Panama Viejo  dating back to 1519, and the first European settlement on the Pacific coast.",
    "image3": "",
    "Title5": "5. San Blas Islands",
    "Paragraph5": "The San Blas are the dictionary definition of desert island. These 365 sandy islets, dripping with coconut palms, and surrounded by bathtub-warm waters, belong to the Indigenous Kuna people, who lead largely traditional lifestyles, stitching beautiful mola textiles. All tourism here is controlled by the Kuna  its a fabulously immersive experience.",
    "Title6": "6. Santa Catalina",
    "Paragraph6": "Laid back even by Panamanian standards, this little fishing village remains undeveloped and tranquil, with the vibe further enhanced by the surfers who flock here for the countrys best waves. Base yourself here for daytrips to nearby Coiba National Marine Park, for super snorkelling and encounters with turtles, rays and tropical fish. Or grab a board and sign up for a surf lesson  no experience needed."
