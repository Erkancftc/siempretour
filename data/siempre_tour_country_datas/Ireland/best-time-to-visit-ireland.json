    "Main_Paragraph": "Everyone loves the Emerald Isle, but not everyone loves the reason why it is so green. The rain. The east coast averages 150 days of rain a year and the west, 225. It can happen any time, but the best times to visit Ireland to avoid it are, according to records, April and June. The secret is not to worry. Ireland is one of those four seasons in a day countries. In summer, temps top 20°C. Kerry and the Antrim Coast are busy in July-Aug, but hiking routes are never crowded. St. Patricks Day is fun, but go rural for the most traditional events.",

    "when_to_go_html": "<bullet><b>January and February aren't the best months to be Ireland</b>. It's damp and dark and snow's not uncommon, especially inland and on higher ground. There won't be any tourists but the pubs will still be open.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>March is a bit milder</b> but the weather can be very unpredictable. Prepare for the worst and hope for the best. It might still be winter, or spring might have sprung. One thing's for sure, it will be raining and there will be lambs bouncing about all over the place.</bullet>\n<bullet>The clocks go forward at the end of March, which means more daylight as Ireland moves into April. The <b>rain also eases up a tad in April, it's all relative really, and by May you can expect ideal conditions for cycling or hiking</b> with lush green meadows adorned with endemic orchids.</bullet>\n<bullet>The public cycling event, the Tour de Connemara, takes place towards the end of May. It's great to watch but bear in mind that accommodation around this time will get booked up months in advance. Entries for the race usually get snapped up in 24hrs, so best of luck with that one.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>June is another best time to explore outdoors in Ireland</b> and you'll be treated to near endless daylight, well past 9pm at any rate; pop your head out of the pub door to catch the sunset. </bullet>\n<bullet><b>July and August can get busy</b> during the school holidays, especially in Kerry and Cork, and Northern Ireland's Antrim Coast. Larger villages and towns will be decked out in bunting to celebrate summer festivals, and coastal roads to the more popular beaches will be busier than at other times of the year.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>July is generally the driest month of the year</b>, but you never know.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>Travelling in September can be an absolute pleasure</b> with misty mornings and woodlands on the turn. There might even be some sunshine as late as the end of the month and into early October.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>November and December</b> are as <b>dark, damp and cold</b> as the start of the year. <b>Not the best time to be outdoors</b> unless you're made of stern stuff.</bullet>",

    "paragraph2": "Robert Kidd from our Ireland holidays supplier, McKinlay Kidd:\nIreland attracts large number of tourists but the vast majority focuses on a handful of key places, some of which can feel rather over- run. So my main recommendation is to step slightly away from the main routes and there you will find a very authentic experience. So the ring of Kerry is a massive draw, but right next door is the much less visited ring of Beara; in Galway the south of Connemara is much quieter than the north; Sligo sees most visitors at its wide sandy beaches but the hinterland of lakes and valleys is usually missed.",
    "title3": "",
    "paragraph3": "\"Then there is Northern Ireland  which is still very undeveloped. Here the Giants Causeway is the major draw while the coastline of Antrim is fabulous  Murlough Bay and Cushendun are particular favourites. And County Down, the area around Strangford Lough especially is hardly touched by visitors from outside Northern Ireland itself. I am also a fan of islands  and Ireland offers quite a few, from Rathlin off the Antrim coast, to Cape Clear in West Cork. Even the Aran islands  hugely popular with day trippers, see far fewer overnight stays. ",

    "paragraph5": "Catherine Mack, author of Responsible Travels guides, and of Irelands first Ecotourism Handbook:\nDont worry if you have dietary needs when travelling in Ireland. They are way ahead of the game in terms of gluten free, dairy free and so on, compared with across the water. And my other tip is dont be shy. The Irish love to talk, tell stories and share stories. It is part of the Irish way. As is listening to music in pubs. Ask a local person where the best music can be heard, rather than going for tourist traps. Oh and one big faux pas to be aware of. Never describe England as the mainland. Ireland is Irelands mainland.",

It was wonderful\" - <b>Diana Howie on a walking in Northern Ireland holiday</b>"
