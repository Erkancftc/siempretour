    "Main_Title": "Our Ireland holidays & tours",
    "Main_Paragraph": "Escaping the car is the best way to experience Ireland’s natural beauty, or the warmth of its culture. Our Ireland holidays, both small group and tailor made tours, will entice those looking to explore the Emerald Isle under their own steam. Relaxed cycling holidays abound, taking you to lesser-known and quieter parts of the country. Meanwhile walking routes such as the Dingle Way or the Ring of Kerry follow well-maintained trails through wonderfully picturesque landscapes. And for those looking to take a more sedate approach, there are train journeys encompassing Dublin, Galway and Belfast, or the stunning Wild Atlantic Way. However you travel, you’ll receive a friendly welcome in locally owned accommodation throughout.",

    "Title1": "",
    "Paragraph1": "When planning a trip to Ireland, there are a few keys things to remember. First, that it is an island. The coast is never far. The capital cities of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, Dublin and Belfast, are on the coast. There are hundreds of islands, myriad remote peninsulas, and a cornucopia of coves and cliff walks. Second thing, when it comes to beautiful landscapes, forget that there is a border. None of them stop because of a line on the map. And third, bring your walking boots, raingear, and a wetsuit. The walking trails are superb, and the beaches are bliss. But wetsuits are recommended.",

    "Title2": "1. Aran Islands",
    "Paragraph2": "Ireland has hundreds of offshore islands, but the Aran Islands of Inis Mór, Inis Meáin and Inis Oirr are three of the most accessible. They also have some of the finest archaeology, including world famous Dún Aonghasa fort on Inis Mór. Dont just do the daytripper thing, but stay overnight. Trust us, you wont want to leave these car free idylls where cycling and hiking trails transport you into laidback, lore-filled lands.",
    "image2": "",
    "Title3": "2. The Dingle Peninsula & the Dingle Way",
    "Paragraph3": "County Kerry can be packed with tourist filled coaches negotiating the Ring of Kerry. But Kerry is a place for walking. And the Dingle Peninsula, with long distance walking trail the Dingle Way, 162km of beaches, pubs, coves, pubs, cliffs, pubs and rural villages, with pubs, is hard to beat. Hike it all in nine days, depending on how many pub stops you make. And dont miss a trip out to the Blasket Islands.",
    "Title4": "3. Giants Causeway & Antrim Coast",
    "Paragraph4": "As well as visiting the rightly lauded basalt beauties that make up the UNESCO Site, Giants Causeway, escape the crowds and hike along the Causeway Coast Path. One beautiful headland beckons after another, dipping down to sumptuous strands such as White Park Bay, diverting around the magnificent ruins of Dunluce Castle, and diverting out to the bird watching haven of Rathlin Island.",
    "image3": "",
    "Title5": "4. Glens of Antrim",
    "Paragraph5": "The Antrim Coast attracts crowds, but if you turn your back on the sea for a minute, you can take in some of the nine verdant valleys sweeping down to the coast from the Antrim Plateau. These are the Glens of Antrim. Game of Thrones land for some. Hiking kingdoms for others. Made easier by the fact that the Ulster Way, a 1,000km Northern Irish trail, cuts through them. Nothing stark here. Just stunning.",
    "Title6": "5. The Kerry Way",
    "Paragraph6": "Theres the N70, a road that circumnavigates the Ring of Kerry, and then there is the Iveragh Peninsulas Kerry Way National Walking Trail, 170km of not only emeralds, such as the luscious green Glencar Valley, but also Killarneys sapphire blue lakes, diamond-like waterfalls, ruby red bog and brush of Macgillycuddy's Reeks at sunrise, and pearl-like sandy coves, one of the top ones being at Caherdaniel.",
    "Title7": "6. Tri-cities by train",
    "Paragraph7": "Forget car hires and take in both of the islands capital cities, the west coast, plus an island or two, all by train (and quick ferry). Take a guided walking tour in Dublin, the city of literary greats, from Joyce to Wilde. Or in Belfast, to learn about its years of political divide. In contrast, Galway is about traditional music, Irish language, coastal walks and an escape to the nearby Aran Islands.",
    "Title8": "About our Ireland holidays",
    "Paragraph8": "",
    "Title9": "Walking holidays in Ireland",
    "Paragraph9": "Ireland is made for walkers. The Ring of Kerry might be crowded with tourist buses, but our holidays lead you to a much more peaceful walking path, the Kerry Way, broadly following the same route and allowing you to step into the scenery, not just admire it through a window. You can find stunning routes in the Aran Islands and the Dingle Way is another superb long-distance route in Kerry. Walking in Ireland does mean taking your chances with the weather, so aim for April to June for your best chance of dodging the rain as well as the crowds.",
    "Title10": "Ireland by bike",
    "Paragraph10": "Both the Wild Atlantic Way and the Irish Greenways’ repurposed railway lines have been immensely successful in promoting cycling in Ireland. Our self guided holidays take you along these well-surfaced routes through magnificent countryside and coast, and between welcoming B&Bs. The Greenways in particular has boosted incomes in rural communities with the opportunity to serve passing cyclists, and also to commute more easily on two wheels. Cycling is a way to not only explore the Emerald Isle’s dramatically beautiful landscapes up close and personal, but also to indulge in culture, cuisine, and craic outside the big towns and cities.",
    "Title11": "Rail holidays in Ireland",
    "Paragraph11": "Our rail tours in Ireland allow you to see a lot of the country in a short space of time, travelling in comfort between pre-booked accommodation in superb locations. Dramatic views can be enjoyed on routes along the Wild Atlantic Way, but if you’d like to throw some culture in alongside the scenery, opt for a Tri-Cities rail tour. You’ll have plenty of time to explore Dublin and Galway as well as nipping over the border to Belfast, and even taking a short ferry out to the beautiful Aran Islands. And the great thing about exploring by train is that there is a constantly rotating cast of fellow passengers with whom you can enjoy a friendly chat."
