    "Main_Paragraph": "There may be peak times to visit, but there is no best time to visit Nicaragua; it has something glorious all year round. The dry season is Nov-April and the wet season May-Oct so generally, it is busier in the former. In the rainy season the Caribbean is wetter than the Pacific, where afternoon showers last an hour or two. Easter week is very busy, but as local people head to the coast or lakes, the towns are empty. Check out Purísima Festival at the beginning of Dec, with fireworks throughout the month and into New Year.",

    "paragraph2": "Jessica Schugel from our partner;\nNicaragua is caliente  not just in temperature, but also in the culture and the people. There is something very special about it. Its a hot climate so everyone is out on the street, enjoying the breeze. There is a lot of talk and gossip. Its a bit like the Latin American telenovelas, or soap operas, but a living one. They also just put their sexuality out there. Its natural, its not taboo, and they are very open generally. However, dress respectfully, because even though Nicaraguans are comfortable revealing their bodies, that tends to be on top. The women always wear longer dresses or jeans. They show off their tops, but legs are covered. So wearing skimpy skirts or shorts will make tourists stick out like sore thumbs.",
    "title3": "Shopping tip",
    "paragraph3": "Scott Marquardt, tour leader:\nOne of the best things you can buy is a beautiful handcrafted hammock made by deaf workers at the Café de Sonrisas in León, Nicaragua. By purchasing a hammock youre supporting a fantastic non-profit organisation that helps the deaf, and theyll ship to anywhere in the world.",
    "title4": "Food tips",
    "paragraph4": "Jessica Schugel:\nI think that there is a greater wealth of really interesting food in Nicaragua than in surrounding countries. But if you dont know what is out there, you wont find it. You have to go in search of it, but it is diverse. Which is why I run foodie tours. Also, because the Nicaraguans find something to celebrate every day of the year, it always revolves around food.",

These give a much better exchange rate than banks or the Cambio at the airport. <b>- Stephen Osgerby</b>\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe most memorable bit? - The kayaking trip itself - fantastic. Brilliant guides, good food, comfortable camping and accomodation, saw lots of wildlife. Go for it! Be prepared for quite basic accommodation & amenities at times (although we did not mind it at all). Bring some wet-wipes as in some places washing facilities. Also consider bringing small roll of toilet paper. <b> Kam Datta on a river canoeing holiday</b>"
