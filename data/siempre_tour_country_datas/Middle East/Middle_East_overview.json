    "Main_Paragraph": "Petra, pyramids and ancient Persia make our Middle East holidays a feast for the mind as well as the soul. Educate yourself through our amazing first-hand experiences in Egypt, Oman, Iran and Jordan. And if you’re longing to include a dusty desert adventure or Islamic artistry in your next itinerary, our organised Middle East tours hold the key to the kingdom. On our holidays you’ll see the countries from all angles on trips that benefit nature and communities and bring you closer to both – you’ll meet minority groups and nomadic peoples, camp in deserts, eat street food, wildlife watch in the deserts and hike in the mountains.",

    "Title1": "",
    "Paragraph1": "Rich in history and blessed with starkly beautiful landscapes and dazzling seas, the Middle East wont disappoint when it comes to keeping you active. Whether you want to get your kicks underwater, with top notch diving and snorkelling, or above ground, with desert hiking and biking, there are plenty of exciting options. And, of course, history and archaeology buffs are endlessly entertained by the living, breathing monuments to the past that exist all around them.",

    "Title2": "Ancient history",
    "Paragraph2": "You cant visit the Middle East without being aware of the regions past glories  they are all around you. Lebanons storied town of Tyre, for example, is home to sprawling Roman ruins dating to the 2nd century AD, while in Jordan youll find Roman ruins at Jerash in addition to the rock hewn tombs of Petra, built by the Nabataeans millennia ago.",

    "Title3": "",
    "Paragraph3": "Egypts\nValley of the Kings\nand\npyramids\nare amongst the most impressive ancient structures in the world, and are testament to the power, organisation and engineering genius of their makers. Persepolis in Iran, begun by Darius the Great in the 6th century BC, is one of the most magnificent ruined cities around, spreading out over 13 hectares. Israel, meanwhile, boasts masses of sites and digs covering the Persian, Byzantine, Roman and Hellenic periods, including Caesaria, where incredible ancient harbour ruins and beautiful beaches sit side-by-side.",
    "Title4": "",
    "Paragraph4": "There are also castles and fortresses dating back to the time of the crusades. Jordans Karnak has stood the test of time impressively well, as has the Nimrod Fortress in the Golan Heights. Omans imposing, 17th century Nizwa Fort is no less impressive, and offers dramatic views over date plantations and mountains from its tower.",

    "Title5": "Desert safaris",
    "Paragraph5": "Looking out over endless swathes of creamy sands and twisted rocks is one of the highlights of a visit to this region. Deserts are places to ponder peace, camp under an explosion of stars, and spend time with the Bedouin tribes, travelling in a caravan of camels, taking tea and listening to music and folk tales around an open fire.",
    "Title6": "",
    "Paragraph6": "Omans desert is dotted with isolated settlements of semi-nomadic Bedouin people, and highlights include the Empty Quarter, or 'Rub Al Khali', which is part of the world's largest sand desert, and Wahiba Sands, famed for towering sand dunes that reach up to 100m. Jordans Wadi Rum hides jagged mountains and huge, empty plains, while Egypts striking White Desert not only features white chalk rock and limestone formations, but also tombs, carvings and caves.",
    "Title7": "",
    "Paragraph7": "The Middle Easts deserts can be explored in many ways. Popular options include 4X4 safaris, hiking or biking trips and camel trekking.",
    "Title8": "Shopping the souks",
    "Paragraph8": "Omans Mutrah, a short distance from Muscat, is great for hand carved silver and gold jewellery; Cairos Byzantine Khal al Khalili is tousity but good fun and authentic; while Jordans Jabal Amman, a buzzing district stretching out along Ammans Rainbow Street, offers books, handmade soaps, wall hangings and olive oil. In Iran, Tehrans Grand Bazaar has 10km of corridors, and Tabrizs historic covered market even contains mosques.",
    "Title9": "Scuba diving",
    "Paragraph9": "Jordan may have just 27km of coastline, but there are 21 designated dive sites along the fringing coral reef of the Red Sea near Aqaba. If you like the idea of relaxed scuba diving in small groups just a short walk from the water then Dahab, in Egypt is spot on. Diving here is mainly shore-based as the Red Sea drops quickly down to great depths, making it an ideal destination for beginners."
