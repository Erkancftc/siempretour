    "Main_Paragraph": "The best time to visit Lapland? Anytime. Really. Jan brings the crystal clear light that you only imagine in dreams, Feb's deep, crisp snow is best for winter sports, and March has optimum aurora conditions. Apr-Aug's melting snow exposes the beautiful landscape beneath, before an autumnal patchwork of burnt red, orange and yellow in Sep. Nov-Dec bring big snow and a community propelled by cross-country skis and snowshoes; look beyond the fly in, fly out Christmas crowds and there are brilliant festive trips to be had.",

    "when_to_go_html": "<bullet><b>Early November is a strange time in Lapland</b> because autumn is definitely becoming winter by this time of year, but the transition is not always complete, so there’s a sort of half-hearted rain/snow weather front. It can be pretty depressing for a few short weeks but is a very small price to pay for the pristine winter landscape that follows, <b>plus in late November the local community come out in a force of snowshoeing and socialising, which is a wonderful experience to be part of.</b></bullet>\n<bullet><b>Anyone with more than a touch of bah humbug about them won’t like Lapland in December</b> – it’s not Lapland’s fault, it’s the fault of cheap, overcrowded, fly in-fly out Christmas trips, but nonetheless it’s a landscape less of ethereal beauty and more of saccharine Santa seekers. Keep in mind too that the sun will peek above the horizon for just a couple of hours a day - making outdoor pursuits difficult.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>September and October</b> enjoy neither the summer warmth nor the winter snow. <b>This is not the best time to visit Lapland unless you are looking for super cheap bargains</b> – the changing season also means that many tours and attractions are closed. However, photographers may relish the <b>New England-style burst of autumnal colour, </b>prices may be lower  - and <b>the Northern Lights make their dramatic appearance,</b> especially around the September equinox.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>January, February and March bring dreamlike conditions to Lapland</b>: crystal clear light, massive deep snow that’s crying out for winter sports fans and, in March especially (again, around the spring equinox), optimum viewing conditions for those hunting the Northern Lights.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>April, May and June’s</b> melting snow gives a hint of what phenomenal landscape the snow has been covering.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>Not to be outshone by the lure of winter sports, Lapland in the summer months of July and August reveals an incredible landscape</b> of mountains, water and endless space that can be explored almost 24 hours a day. The midnight sun, an iconic Polar phenomenon where the sun remains visible at midnight during June and early July in the far north, makes day and night interchangeable, so you can hike or go sea kayaking, all past the stroke of midnight!</bullet>",
