    "Main_Paragraph": "Eswatini (formerly Swaziland) is a year-round destination, but if youre hoping to see wildlife, the best time to go to Eswatini is in the dry winter months of May-September. Summer (October-April) is hot and wet, but the scenery is gorgeously green and theres abundant birdlife and local culture. In terms of temperatures, the Lowveld in the east experiences days that hit around 33°C (and there is malaria here), while the Highveld, home to capital Mbabane, stays cooler thanks to its altitude  rarely more than 25°C. Winter mornings and evenings can be chilly, dropping as low as 5°C in Jun-Jul, so bring layers for dawn game drives.",

Its great to have a wish list of what you want to see, but dont be disappointed if you dont get to see everything  its a great excuse to go back again. There is as much joy to be had in viewing a warthog (one of my favourites) as there is having your first glimpse of a leopard.",

    "paragraph3": "Dirk Reiche, from our partner Sunway Safaris, says:\nMkhaya Game Reserve is my favourite place to view wildlife, at any time of the year. Mainly because of the walking safaris you can take there to get close to both species of rhino found in Southern Africa. I always love seeing black rhino. I have walked into them many times and they are really unpredictable. One day they will be very chilled and let you get nice and close, but on other days they can be gone just like that or charging down on you! Now that is what a buzz feels like in Africa  when a 950kg black rhino charges through the bush at you...",
    "title4": "Tips on temperatures",
    "paragraph4": "<b>Dirk Reiche recommends bringing layers:</b> Getting up early is a must for game viewing no matter which part of Africa youre in. Its cooler and the animals are moving around. Later in the day, they disappear into thick bush to escape the heat. So if youre visiting in summer, bring light cool clothes. In winter, it can get fairly cold so something warm that can be removed when it starts to heat up is a good idea. If you are going on game drives, its always good to have a wind breaker to keep the chill out.",

    "paragraph6": "<b>Our travel writer, Sarah Faith, has taught and travelled in Eswatini: </b><br/>The Swazis take a real pride in their culture and in welcoming people to Eswatini. You see this even without going to any official cultural events. Everyone speaks English and its taught in schools, but its a nice idea to learn a few SiSwati words. People really respond  they laugh and smile. Remember when you shake hands, support your right arm with your left hand. Its polite and a sign of respect.",

    "paragraph9": "Our guides made an effort to take us to places where we could buy things where the money would go back into the community rather than to corporates. I also found it charming that the guides always offered any extra food we had to local workers, be they staff in the guest houses at dinnertime or guys out on the roads at lunchtime. No waste created, and lots of happy customers! There are some long days in the truck, so Id suggest getting up early to walk or run. Its a beautiful time to be up and about. <b> Christina Stephenson</b><br/><br/>\r\n\r\nA totally amazing and uplifting experience. A lot of fun, a lot of new things learnt, a new appreciation of another country and its culture, and new friends made. <b> Cathy McCall</b><br/><br/>\r\n\r\nI had not expected to enjoy the safari part of my trip as much as I did. I loved seeing the animals in their natural habitat. One day we watched a mother cheetah hunting for her cub. It was thrilling. <b>  Patricia Ruble</b>"
