    "Main_Title": "Our Sierra Leone holidays & tours",
    "Main_Paragraph": "A small West African country packed with beaches, tiny communities and a plethora of wildlife, Sierra Leone’s horrific civil war, which ended in 2002, prevented mass tourism from arriving in the country. Tourism development has been slow, but, as our Sierra Leone holidays show, there are opportunities to shape a tourism here that benefits both nature and communities. Take Tiwai Island, home to pygmy hippopotami, and a large number of primate and bird species, which is also home to inspiring community-based tourism projects. Our amazing trips comprise small beach lodges, solitary snorkelling, island hopping and river canoeing. And wherever you go, our holidays use local guides – there’s no better source of insight into the country’s history and into its everyday customs.",

    "Title1": "1. Banana Islands",
    "Paragraph1": "At southern tip of the Freetown peninsula, Banana Islands are three islands connected by a stone causeway. Its a perfect tropical hideaway and a jumping off point for numerous water based activities, including snorkelling, diving, spear fishing and kayaking. Walks around the island reveal a smattering of ruins from its time as a slaving post and European settlement.",

    "Title2": "2. Bunce Island",
    "Paragraph2": "An hours boat ride from Freetown, Bunce Island is a monument to the darkest time in the countrys history. It was set up as a major slave trading fortress and castle in 1670, and over 30,000 men, women and children were held here before boarding slave ships bound for the southern United States. Today, the castle and its cells lie in ruins, swallowed up by vines, weeds and grasses.",

    "Title3": "3. Freetown",
    "Paragraph3": "Squeezed into a small space between mountains and ocean, Freetown is a hectic metropolis. Red dust, charcoal smoke and music billow around narrow city streets, and tumbledown clapboard houses are a reminder of the citys founders: freed enslaved people returning from Nova Scotia in 1787, where they had fled after the American War of Independence. They gave birth to local language Krio, an English based creole.",
    "Title4": "4. Tacugama Chimp Sanctuary",
    "Paragraph4": "Set in thick forest a 30-minute drive from Freetown, Tacugama Chimpanzee Sanctuary was set up in 1995 to rescue and rehabilitate endangered primates. Dedicated staff offer tours of the sanctuary, which is part of a 100-acre reserve. Theyll tell you all about their work and youll get to see chimpanzees during the different stages of rehabilitation  the last of which is a vast, semi-wild setting.",

    "Title5": "5. Tiwai Island Wildlife Sanctuary",
    "Paragraph5": "One of West Africas few remaining areas of pristine rainforest, 12km² Tiwai Island is set in the Moa River in eastern Sierra Leone. The countrys first ecotourism enterprise, it has a high concentration of primates, including chimpanzees, black and white Diana monkeys and red colobus monkeys. It's also home to almost 100 rare and elusive pygmy hippos."
