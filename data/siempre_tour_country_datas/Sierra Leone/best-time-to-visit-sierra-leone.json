    "Main_Paragraph": "Sierra Leone is typically tropical and has two seasons: hot and wet, and hot, dry and dusty. Since its close to the equator, temperatures remain pretty steady. During the day, its usually between 27°C and 32°C, although in the centre of the country it can be a little cooler, particularly at night. Read on for further detail on the best time to visit Sierra Leone.",

    "when_to_go_html": "<bullet>November to April is the dry season, and the most pleasant time to travel, as you wont have issues with blocked roads from floods and there are fewer malaria carrying mosquitoes.</bullet>\n<bullet>However, the harmattan wind blows down from the Sahara in December, January and February bringing dusty haze and uncomfortable dryness, as well as reduced visibility for both photography and sightseeing.</bullet>\n<bullet>In March and April, temperatures are at their highest and can reach an uncomfortable 38°C. Visit in May and youll escape the worst of the rains and also get to see (or take part in) Street Child's award-winning Sierra Leone Marathon.</bullet>\n<bullet>The heavy rains last from June to October, and are at their most brutal in July and August. For some time afterwards, access to more remote rural areas becomes almost impossible, as dirt roads are turned into muddy bogs by gushing waters and even Freetown suffers sometimes catastrophic flooding.</bullet>\n<bullet>The beaches are at their beautiful best towards the end of the wet season in late September to October, when the worst of the rain has subsided but the skies are still blue.</bullet>",

    "paragraph2": "Travelling independently means you have to worry every day about your movement from place to place, as situations in Sierra Leone can be very fluid and inconsistent. There are a lot of structures not really in place, for example, scheduled and reliable bus services. On an organised tour, you have a dedicated professional tour guide and driver to move around and this also gives travellers the opportunity to ask more questions directly to our expert tour guides for in depth information. While travelling independently you will need to be stopping passersby or always asking the locals to information which is not always reliable or possible.",
    "title3": "Safety",
    "paragraph3": "Sierra Leone is safe and with a stable democracy. Not much credit has been given to the progress attained over the years. Bad things happen in other countries too, such as the crime rate in South Africa for example, or Kenyas political issues. Despite this, the pull for tourists in these countries is very strong; a big difference is the PR machine. Sierra Leone has not been as proactive in making as much positive news coverage. Hopefully we can change this!",
    "title4": "Cultural highlights",
    "paragraph4": "There are local artists, music festivals (such as Ma Dengn), festivals like the Lantern Festival, and sites like Rogbonko Village Retreat. The hospitality to strangers is certainly a highlight."
