    "Main_Paragraph": "The best time to visit Rwanda is usually in the dry seasons in\nJune-September and December-early February\n. That said, most visitors travel to Rwanda to see gorillas, and so the best time is often whenever you can get a highly in-demand permit. Dont be put off by the rainy season in Rwanda, either. The shorter rains in November and longer rains from March to May will give you the forests, lakes and mountains all to yourself, plus gorilla permits are occasionally cheaper. Photographers may even prefer the rainy season, with less light contrast in the forests allowing you to focus on your subject matter.",

    "when_to_go_html": "<bullet><b>March</b> is the beginning of the longer rainy season which goes on through <b>April and May</b>. The end of <b>May</b> can often be dry already, however, and yet still devoid of visitors avoiding the big rains.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>June to mid-September</b> is the long dry season and the most popular time to visit. You may still get showers during this time though.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>September</b> sees a very special event take place in Musanze: <em>Kwita Izina</em>, which is a gorilla naming ceremony and celebration of mountain gorilla births.</bullet>\n<bullet><a href=\"http://www.kigalimarathon.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The Kigali International Peace Marathon</a> takes place in <b>May</b> and is a very special event. If you are taking part or just watching. There are three races, a full marathon, half marathon and a 10km run for peace.</bullet>\n<bullet>Tutsi Genocide Memorial Day is <b>7 April</b>, a public holiday and understandably a very solemn day indeed.</bullet>\n<bullet>If you are going gorilla trekking, things have dried up again in <b>December</b> after the short rains of <b>October</b> and <b>November</b>. So if youre looking for alternative<b> Christmas holiday ideas</b> then you could do at lot worse than heading to Rwanda to go gorilla watching. Same thing goes for <b>January</b> for a spectacular <b>New Year</b> celebration.</bullet>\n<bullet>The <a href=\"https://www.tourdurwanda.rw/\">Tour du Rwanda</a> is a spectacular country-wide race run by the Rwanda Cycling Federation. Frustratingly however it keeps changing dates, so keep an eye on their website. It's a good one though, just a bit of a moveable feast.</bullet>\n<bullet>Independence Day takes place <b>1 July</b> every year in Rwanda, celebrating the day in 1962 when Rwanda was freed from Belgian colonial rule.</bullet>\n\nThe dry season goes from June to mid-September so this is generally the best time to visit as rain may make some of the activities such as the gorillas and chimps treks much harder due to the mud. There is also a short dry season from December to February. It is quite special to spend New Years Eve in front of a group of 12 gorillas so those looking to spend a different Christmas and NYE have this choice.",
