    "Main_Paragraph": "On Malawi’s market stalls, stacks of air-dried\nusipa\n(sardines) lie all crisp and golden. This is the land of the lake, one third of Malawi is made up of its eponymous body of water, which provides fish for the table. The lake is so large that there’s a dragon’s hoard of golden beaches, plus your pick of lodges with freshwater scuba diving. On dry land, the country is easily navigable by road, with some good safari destinations: Liwonde and Nyika, along the way. In Malawi, where you stay matters, which is why our Malawi holidays use lodges that are giving back to their local area, whether they are funding conservation projects, following responsible practices with their energy and food supplies, or training and employing local staff.",

    "Title1": "Wildlife watching in Malawi",
    "Paragraph1": "Any\nsafari in Malawi\nis fantastic. You could choose to watch wildlife on foot or by bike  in Nyika National Park or Kuti Wildlife Reserve, for example, where youll notice smaller animals and their behaviours up close. Or, opt for a 4x4 drive in Majete Wildlife Reserve or Liwonde National Park, where bigger game such as elephants, rhino and recently reintroduced lions are on the menu. A boat safari along the Shire River adds an extra thrilling dimension as you find yourself just feet away from an elephant, a hippo, or a crocodile sidling into the water to see what youre up to.",

    "Paragraph2": "What makes Malawi so wonderful is the combination of safari and beach thats available to travellers  make the most of game drives, boat safaris and nature walks for a few days before chilling out on the pristine shores of Lake Malawi and exploring the underwater world  maybe factoring in a day or two seeing some city sights if you have time.",

    "Title3": "",
    "Paragraph3": "Malawi is safe, compact and has a decent road network, which makes it an ideal destination for a self drive holiday, allowing you to be in control of what you see, for how long, where and when. There is no signage in Malawis more rural areas, but a tailor made holiday company will kit you out with all of the information and maps you need. Alternatively, hire a local driver-guide  theyll know the roads back to front and can fill you in on local life, customs and culture as you go.",
    "Title4": "",
    "Paragraph4": "While wildlife watching and hiking are both worthy pursuits, many travellers are drawn to Malawi because of its famous lake. A shimmering mass of clear water, its depths are full of colourful cichlid fish, providing excellent opportunities for diving, snorkelling and kayaking. And when youre done there are plenty of sandy beaches to chill out on and friendly lakeside villages to explore.",
