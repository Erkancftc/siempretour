    "Main_Paragraph": "Your tolerance for the heat is important to keep in mind when considering the best time to visit Portugal, as during the summer months of June to August it can reach 40°C inland, though the coasts are cooler. For walking or cycling, the best time to go to Portugal is usually May or September, when temperatures ease off, as do the crowds. May brings wildflowers, while autumn has glorious colour plus harvest bounty. Even midwinter sees 4-6 hours of sun, albeit with occasional morning frost. In February, almond blossom lights up the Alentejo and Algarve, and during November and December the aroma of roasted chestnuts wafts temptingly along city streets.",

    "when_to_go_html": "<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<ul><bullet>City sightseeing</bullet>\n<bullet>Walking in Algarve and Alentejo</bullet>\n<bullet>Wet, cool weather likely</bullet></ul>\r\nAt first glance there may not be much to recommend Portugal in January  this is the coldest month of the year and one of the wettest. But cold in Portugal means average daytime temperatures up to 15°C, which is very manageable. Showers are interspersed with sunny periods, making this a good month for exploring cities such as Lisbon and Porto or self guided routes in the Algarve.<br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<ul><bullet>Street parties as Carnival begins</bullet>\n<bullet>Cities and walking trails pleasantly quiet</bullet>\n<bullet>Changeable weather</bullet></ul>\r\nWrap up warm and Portugal in February can be lovely for walking  popular routes such as the dramatic coastal Fishermans Trail are crowd-free. Expect the weather to be as up and down as the terrain, with patches of warm sun along with chilly days. Carnival celebrations begin in the days leading up to Lent (and sometimes in March), with colourful street parties, parades and feasts around the country.<br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<ul><bullet>Wildflowers and walkers</bullet>\n<bullet>Carnival celebrations continue</bullet>\n<bullet>Calmer walks on the Portugal Way</bullet></ul>\r\nPortugal in March welcomes the beginning of spring and is the last month before walking routes like the Portugal Way and Rota Vicentina are thronged with walkers. Walking in Peneda-Geres National Park and the Douro Valley is beautiful, with hillsides draped in wildflowers, and many trails are shared with cyclists on self guided holidays following their GPS between guest houses.<br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<ul><bullet>Sunny and warm</bullet>\n<bullet>Cycling and walking holidays</bullet>\n<bullet>Freedom Day marks Carnation Revolution</bullet></ul>\r\nSpring has well and truly sprung by April, with daytime temperatures regularly around 19°C, fewer showers, and bright sunshine the norm. Portugal in April sees busy walking and cycling trails with the Atlantic Coast, Algarve and Douro Valley all popular spots. Freedom Day on 25 April marks the end of Portugals near 50-year-long dictatorship, with countrywide celebrations. <br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<ul><bullet>Cycling</bullet>\n<bullet>The Algarve</bullet>\n<bullet>Fatima pilgrimage</bullet></ul>\r\nIf you want to know the best time to visit Portugal weather-wise, wed suggest May. Portugal in May is lovely, with temperatures climbing to 22°C and beyond, and coastal areas not yet seeing peak summertime crowds. May is ideal for self-guided cycling holidays, and for visiting the Algarve before the crowds when schools finish. The Fatima Pilgrimage from 11-13 May is a highlight of Portugals Catholic calendar.<br/><br/>\n<b>May is great for our</b> <a href=\"/holiday/22456/porto-to-lisbon-cycling-holiday-self-guided\">Porto to Lisbon cycling holiday</a><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<ul><bullet>Hot and sunny weather throughout</bullet>\n<bullet>Best time to visit Portugal beaches</bullet>\n<bullet>Santos Populares festivals across Portugal</bullet></ul>\r\nA wave of festivals sweeps Portugal in June celebrating saints Anthony, John and Peter. June is ideal for exploring Lisbon and Porto especially, as well as smaller towns and villages, with these fun events bringing together communities for feasting and revelry. The aroma of grilled sardines hangs thickly in the air throughout June. Or escape the crowds with a quiet and scenic Douro Valley kayak tour.\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<ul><bullet>Hottest month of the year</bullet>\n<bullet>Packed Algarve beaches</bullet>\n<bullet>Head north for cooler weather and fewer crowds</bullet></ul>\r\nPortugal in July is hot and busy, with daytime temperatures topping 28°C in Lisbon, while local people and visitors alike flock to the coasts. The southern Algarve is one of Europes most popular family summer destinations, but our family activity holidays aim to avoid the crowds and the busiest locations. Head north to the Costa Verde and Peneda-Geres National Park for cooler weather.<br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<ul><bullet>Family holidays on the coast</bullet>\n<bullet>Soaring temperatures</bullet>\n<bullet>Seek shade from midday</bullet></ul>\r\nAugust draws the crowds, particularly families, who spread out along the coast of Portugal for holidays full of sun and fun. But opt for the charms of our locally run villas and <i>quintas</i> over plasticky and busy resorts. The temperatures, up to 28°C, can be oppressive, especially in the cities. Walking and cycling holidays are inadvisable  Portugal in August is too hot to be out and about for prolonged periods.<br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<ul><bullet>End of peak season</bullet>\n<bullet>Walking and cycling</bullet>\n<bullet>Sea temperatures still warm</bullet></ul>\r\nWith kids returning to school and the weather still hot but not stinking hot, September can be the best time of year to travel to Portugal. The Algarve and Alentejo are blissful at this time of year, and walkers and cyclists will be in their element. Meanwhile, the Porto to Lisbon cycling route along the Atlantic Coast is particularly appealing. All told, Portugal in September is pretty dreamy.<br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<ul><bullet>Wine tasting</bullet>\n<bullet>Glorious for walking and cycling</bullet>\n<bullet>Big Waves season in Nazare</bullet></ul>\r\nBalmy weather continues into October, though youll want a jacket for the evenings  temperatures drop to around 15°C at night. The sea is still delightfully warm for swimming, but its getting choppier. Good news for surfers, who barrel into Nazare near Lisbon to ride some of the worlds biggest waves. If youre more comfortable on bike than board, Portugal in October is ideal for cycling and wine tasting.<br/><br/>\n<b>October is great for our</b> <a href=\"/holiday/12031/alentejo-algarve-self-guided-walking-holiday-portugal\">self guided walking holiday in the Algarve and Alentejo</a><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<ul><bullet>Southern Portugal fine for walking</bullet>\n<bullet>Beginning of winter</bullet>\n<bullet>Chilly, damp weather</bullet></ul>\r\nNovember is the start of the rainy season in Portugal, but dont let that put you off. Temperatures are still quite mild and there are regular patches of sunshine. Walking holidays in the Alentejo and Algarve regions are still possible, though youll want to bring waterproofs. Small group cultural tours offer relaxed city sightseeing in Portugal in November, between the bustle of summer and Christmas. The scent of roasted chestnuts is everywhere.<br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<ul><bullet>Wettest month</bullet>\n<bullet>Christmas season</bullet>\n<bullet>Algarve still quite mild</bullet></ul>\r\nPortugal in December is often wet, grey and chilly, especially in the north of the country. The dull weather is offset, however, by the onset of the Christmas season. The Portuguese love this time of year, with lights and decorations springing up to illuminate lively Christmas markets. Stay warm as you shop with a sachet of roasted chestnuts or a cup of <i>ginjinha</i>, a cherry-flavoured liqueur.",

    "image2": "",
    "title2": "Carnival (February or March)",
    "paragraph2": "Portugal’s Carnival festivities offer historic tradition as well as spangly costumes. Alongside pork-led feasting, different regions add distinctive spins. The Algarve goes in for egg-throwing, while in northern Portugal – most famously, Lazarim – local people in wooden masks\n(caretos)\nindulge in street japery before the burning of giant godfather and godmother figures linked to ancient fertility rites.",
    "title3": "Freedom Day (25 April)",
    "paragraph3": "A national holiday, Freedom Day marks the Carnation Revolution of 1974, when Portugal threw off the shackles of dictatorship – demonstrators placed carnations in the barrels of revolutionary soldiers’ guns. You can watch parades and concerts, and follow the Revolution Day route via 14 historical sites across Lisbon.",
    "title4": "Fatima Pilgrimage (12 & 13 May)",
    "paragraph4": "The 13 May is a good time to visit Fatima town if you don’t mind the crowds. On this day in 1917, three local children reported seeing a vision of the Virgin Mary, and believers have flocked to the city ever since. Come on the evening of 12 May to watch a moving candlelight procession, while on the following day the faithful wave white handkerchiefs as a statue of the Virgin May is borne aloft through the streets.",
    "title5": "Feast of Saint John (23 June)",
    "paragraph5": "The Feast of Saint John is most strongly celebrated in Porto. Families get together to share a meal and crowds gather to watch a huge fireworks display at the Dom Luis I Bridge. The fireworks are actually a tribute to the sun; this Christian festival has its roots in pagan rites. The partying goes on until the early hours – don’t be unnerved by the traditional greeting of gently tapping someone with a leek or a small plastic hammer.",
    "title6": "Sintra Festival (June & July)",
    "paragraph6": "An hour west of Lisbon, the town of Sintra is renowned for its magnificent architecture. The royal palaces, historic estates, and gardens are like something from Cinderella. Every summer this fantastical setting plays host to a renowned festival of classical music. Make a day of it if visiting from Lisbon – and do try to use public transport to get there, as the roads in get fiendishly busy. Our\nSintra travel guide\nhas more details.",
    "title7": "Festival of the Trays (July; every four years)",
    "paragraph7": "Tomar, 90 minutes’ drive north of Lisbon, hosts the Festival of the Trays, one of the oldest festivals in Portugal. The event sees the women of the town bearing wicker baskets full of bread rolls in tribute to Saint Isabel. It’s not as easy as it sounds, though. The baskets are about the same height as the bearer, weigh up to 16kg, and must be carried for around 5km. No wonder they only do it every four years.",
    "title8": "Olhao Seafood Festival (August)",
    "paragraph8": "What’s on the menu at the Olhao Seafood Festival in August? Anything that can be caught in the Rio Formosa, from oysters and clams to prawns, cockles and even lobsters.\nCataplana\nis a seafood stew, while\narroz de marisco\nis seafood rice, a similar dish to paella. Load a plateful, crack open a chilled bottle of\nvinho verde\n, and settle down to watch a local band at one of the Algarve’s finest food festivals.",
    "title9": "Our travellers also ask",
    "paragraph9": "",
    "title10": "What are the hottest months in Portugal?",
    "paragraph10": "July and August\nare the hottest months in Portugal  daytime temperatures can get to 28°C and beyond, though inland it can feel warmer still. Local people and visitors alike make for the coast, and the beaches of the Algarve get very busy during the summer. For a calmer atmosphere, opt for a stay on a locally owned\nquinta\nin the countryside  many have their own swimming pools. You can also find a more peaceful atmosphere, and milder weather, in northern Portugal.",
    "title11": "Where is the best weather in Portugal?",
    "paragraph11": "The Algarve enjoys warm, sunny and dry weather\npretty much year-round. Between September and May, you can enjoy sublime walking and cycling holidays in this region and in the neighbouring Alentejo. However, summer (June to August) can be stiflingly hot, and most people stick close to the beaches. If you prefer things a little cooler, look to the north of Portugal, where the green and lush vegetation indicates a milder climate.",
    "title12": "What is the rainiest month in Portugal?",
    "paragraph12": "December is the rainiest month in Portugal\n, but the north sees most of it. Even in December, however, its rare for a day to be a total washout. While walking and cycling holidays wont be much fun, in the cities a waterproof coat and an umbrella should ensure you can continue exploring in comfort. The southern Algarve region has a Mediterranean climate  very dry and hot for much of the year. By contrast, northern Portugal is much cooler and wetter, influenced by the Atlantic Ocean. The landscape there is much more green and lush.",
    "title13": "What is the coldest month in Portugal?",
    "paragraph13": "The coldest month in Portugal is January\n, when daytime temperatures average just 9°C. The south of the country tends to be significantly warmer  up to 15°C around Faro. Winter (December to February) can still be a very good time to visit Portugal, with not many other tourists around. While rain can be expected, much of the time the weather is sunny and crisp.",
    "title14": "What time of year is Portugal cheapest?",
    "paragraph14": "November to March is the cheapest time to visit Portugal\n, with lower flight costs and good deals available on accommodation. While the weather can be changeable, both November and March are good months to visit Portugal, as it is generally mild, and you can enjoy some pleasant walking. During the winter (December to February) the weather is rarely too wet or cold to enjoy yourself. But you will find many restaurants and shops are closed for the low season, particularly in more rural areas."
