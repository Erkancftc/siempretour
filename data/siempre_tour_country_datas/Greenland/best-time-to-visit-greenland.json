    "Main_Title": "Best time to visit Greenland",
    "Main_Paragraph": "Greenland is gargantuan so although it has an Arctic climate, it certainly varies. Most trips are in summer which gets up to 10°C, with big freeze setting in from Nov-April. Northern Lights start to shimmer in Sep, so get in before the pack ice does if you want Aurora and aqua fun. Bowhead whales appear March-May, as it is krill feeding time. But there are whales of various species here year round. Enjoy the benefits of the midnight sun in late April-late Aug, depending on latitude, but most tourist regions are lit up 24/7 from early June-mid July.",

    "when_to_go_html": "<bullet>As Greenland is so huge, temperatures vary around the country – and even locally, from fjord to fjord – but <b>everywhere is below freezing from November through to April.</b></bullet>\n<bullet><b>In January, February and March, the temperature drops to an average of -16°C</b> to the north around Ittoqqortoormiit, but it’s slightly milder further south and milder still if you are inland, away from the colder coast. </bullet>\n<bullet><b>In Ilulissat, people celebrate the return of the sun on around the 12 or 13 January with songs</b>. The sun’s only up for about half an hour, but by the end of January daylight lasts for just over five hours.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>February, March and April are a great time to see the Northern Lights</b> and spot wildlife including musk oxen and reindeer. This is also the best time for dog sledding.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>Once May arrives, average temperatures finally pull above freezing</b>, hitting 2°C.</bullet>\n<bullet>In Ilulissat, just north of the Arctic Circle, a<b> day lasts 24 hours in June, nearly 24 hours in May and July, and 20 hours in August.</b></bullet>\n<bullet> <b>The longest day, 21 June, is also Greenland’s National Day</b>, celebrated with songs, speeches, music and dancing.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>In the summer months – June, July and August – temperatures don’t tend to go above 10°C</b>, but down south and particularly inland on the long fjords you can get occasional highs of 20°C. Thanks to the low humidity, it can even feel surprisingly warm. A t-shirt is often enough when the sun’s out.</bullet>\n<bullet>The summer months are the best time for photography holidays and small ship cruises, with <b>some cruises departing in September</b>, too. Expect to see polar bears, whales, walrus and lots of birdlife.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>Few tours run in October, November, December and January</b>. Temperatures return below freezing in early October and stay there right through the winter. Fjords freeze solid, making small ship cruises impossible.</bullet>\n<bullet>Winter is dark in Greenland, but daylight hours vary around the country. <b>On the shortest day in December, southern Greenland experiences just four hours of daylight</b>, while further north around Ilulissat, the sun goes down at the end of November and doesn’t rise again until mid January.</bullet>",

Quite often they're bred as working dogs and not quite so keen for pre-sledding cuddles! But they're incredibly hard-working and a husky sledding adventure with Greenlandic dogs is a very different and rewarding experience.\nExperiencing the ice cap below your feet is not to be missed  whether its a short hike or an overnight camping expedition. Seeing and touching the glacier is something that stays with you.",
