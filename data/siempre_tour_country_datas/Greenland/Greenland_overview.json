    "Main_Title": "Our Greenland holidays & tours",
    "Main_Paragraph": "The warmth of welcome that local people offer visitors on our Greenland holidays could not be a greater contrast to the inhospitability of the landscapes, beautiful as they are. But tours here expertly navigate fjords bordered by 2,000m high mountains that shelter narwhals and walrus, vivid turquoise glaciers that splinter into the 100m-high 'Iceberg Alley', and Northeast Greenland, the world’s largest national park, ensuring you tread carefully in these immensely fragile landscapes. Go trekking for magnificent views, or visit Uummannaq with its colourful mountainside homes. And scan the horizon for the Northern Lights, polar bears and whales from the deck of your small ship cruise, with knowledgeable scientific researchers aboard and ready to answer your questions.",

    "Title1": "",
    "Paragraph1": "If any place merits the re prefix, its Greenland. The all encompassing Arctic air is rejuvenating. The hiking terrain that proffers prolific views over never ending glaciers or icy peaks revives not only the explorer within, but also our faith in nature. Both the midnight sun and the Northern Lights are re-energising. The unspoiled-by-tourism way of life and genuine welcome within the Inuit communities is wonderfully refreshing. And when a blue whale emerges from turquoise waters, and we have that inexplicable joy of nature move us to tears, well that is quite simply when life is for rejoicing.",

    "Title2": "1. Denmark Strait",
    "Paragraph2": "Also known as Greenland Strait depending on your perspective, the only perspective you want is that of breaching, lobtailing or spouting. Because this powerful, deep channel, that has a huge influence on the worlds movement of water, is home to blue whales. Although blues are rare, Greenland is home to 15 species of whale in summer. You may also spot polar bears, seals, walrus and, with luck, narwhal.",

    "Title3": "2. Ikaasaalap Llinnera hiking trail",
    "Paragraph3": "Aka the Iceberg Trail, this is one of the worlds wildest (although not too challenging) treks you can hope for, following an old dog sled route along iceberg dotted coast, over rocky cols and ridges to viewpoints such as the one between Sofias Fjeld and Polhelms Fjeld. Cross tundra terrain to wild camp in dramatic locations, such as the Amitsivartiva Fjord . Where, all around, Arctic flowers burst into bloom.",
    "Title4": "3. Ilulissat",
    "Paragraph4": "Located 350km north of the Arctic Circle, Ilulissat is Greenlands third largest town. An old harbour town on Disko Bay, its name translates simply as icebergs. So, you get the picture. As does UNESCO, which has given its ice fjord and vast Jakobshavn Glacier World Heritage Status. In fact, it deserves out of this world status really. Its also home to the northernmost four star hotel. Cool on all levels then.",
    "image3": "",
    "Title5": "4. The East",
    "Paragraph5": "Ittoqqortoormiit\nThis is the wild, mountainous east and the islands most remote settlement, home to Inuit who came from Ammassalik Island in 1925. With a population of around 500 living in colourful, wooden houses overlooking the water (or ice for nine months), its a great base for sailing around the icy inlets of this, the worlds largest fjord system, and hiking in the foothills of Liverpool Land, popular with serious Arctic climbers.",
    "Title6": "5. Scoresby sound",
    "Paragraph6": "Aka Scoresbysund, the longest fjord in the world, when you sail here you feel as if it goes on forever. Watch icebergs calving from mother glaciers float past in this stupendously serene seascape. Visit former Inuit settlement Denmark Island where early science explorers based themselves in winter. Or Bear Island for top hiking. All part of Northeast Greenland National Park, a fjord fest if ever there was one.",
    "Title7": "6. Sermermiut",
    "Paragraph7": "An ancient Inuit settlement, now empty as the last resident moved to Ilulissat in 1850. Its magnificent icebergs are part of the Ilulissat World Heritage site now, but this location is a fine one to take in the white greats as they float down the ice fjord. With archaeological remains of communities dating back as far as 2400 BC, this is a thought provoking, barren, if beautiful place to take in the world."
