    "Main_Paragraph": "The dry months of November to February would seem like the best time to visit Cambodia - and they certainly are if you're heading to the beach, particularly blue-skied December and January. However, the monsoon season from June to October offers lush green paddy fields, dramatic skies and wonderful reflections in the pools around Angkor Wat, with the soggy stones revealing deeper colours. In between the late afternoon showers, you'll also find fewer crowds and cheaper prices. The air is also clearer at this time, as the rain washes away haze and smoke. Heat-fearers should head down during the second half of the rainy season, when temperatures are lower and sightseeing more pleasant.",

    "when_to_go_html": "<bullet>The start of the year, <b>January</b> and <b>February</b>, offers one of the best times to go to Cambodia if you're heading to the coast as there's hardly any rain and blue skies all the way.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>March</b> and <b>April</b> find temperatures starting to rise and although there's not that much in the way of rain, it's certainly getting a bit more sticky in terms of humidity.</bullet>\n<bullet>Monsoon season starts around late <b>May</b> and early <b>June</b>, with Cambodia's coasts, in particular, seeing the worst of the torrential downpours.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>July</b>, <b>August</b> and <b>September</b> are still a bit soggy however, lush foliage, vivid green paddy fields and incredible sunsets more than make up for the occasional cloud burst. Cambodia's wet weather season is also less busy so grab your brolly and head for Angkor Wat.</bullet>\n<bullet><b>October</b> and <b>November</b> still find a few rainy days but in the main things are starting to dry out with <b>December</b> often thought of as one of the best times to visit Cambodia before the Xmas holidays.</bullet>\n\nA most unusual race is held each December. The annual half marathon traverses the immense sprawl of ruins around Angkor Wat, including Angkor Thom and Beng Melea. The marathon supports several Cambodian charities working with disabled athletes, underprivileged children and education.",
