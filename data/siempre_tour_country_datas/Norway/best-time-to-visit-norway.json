    "Main_Paragraph": "June, July and August\nare the best months to go to Norway for warmer temperatures and longer days. The warmest month in Norway is July, when theres the fabled midnight sun  ideal for hiking, cycling, kayaking and berry picking. Prices will be at a premium and midges buzz (and bite) around the marshlands. June-August is also the best time to cruise the Norwegian fjords, while Spitsbergen is amazing at midsummer when polar bears are on the hunt. May and September offer mild temperatures and uncrowded, colourful landscapes. Norwegian winters can be bitter, but dress properly and its a nirvana of snowshoeing and cross country skiing. The best time to visit Norway for the Northern Lights is November-February.",

    "when_to_go_html": "<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<ul><bullet>Northern Lights</bullet>\n<bullet>Long nights and short days</bullet>\n<bullet>Snow and freezing temperatures</bullet></ul>\r\n\r\nVery low temperatures, short daylight hours (think 9am-3pm), and beautiful snowy scenery are the norm for Norway in January. Activities such as husky sledding and cross country skiing are popular, but you wont regret packing a few layers of thermal clothing because January is the coldest month in Norway, and the darkest too. However, that does mean more chances to spot the spectacular Northern Lights dancing across the sky. <br/><br/>\n<b>January is great for our</b> <a href=\"/holiday/10263/venabu-cross-country-skiing-holiday-in-norway\">cross country skiing holiday in Venabu</a><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<ul><bullet>Northern Lights</bullet>\n<bullet>Cross country skiing</bullet>\n<bullet>Sámi Week</bullet></ul>\r\n\r\nTemperatures remain freezing, but Norway in February is a winter wonderland. Snow drapes the landscapes creating ideal terrain for cross country skiers in national parks such as Rondane and Jotunheimen. The Northern Lights continue to delight as they illuminate the skies, and February also heralds Sámi Week in Tromso, celebrating the culture and history of northern Scandinavias Indigenous peoples. <br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<ul><bullet>Arctic birdlife</bullet>\n<bullet>Cross country skiing</bullet>\n<bullet>Wildflowers amid the snow</bullet></ul>\r\n\r\nNorway in March welcomes the onset of spring, snow melting away to reveal meadows of wildflowers. Expect changeable weather (rain is likely on the coast) and low temperatures ranging from -4°C to 5°C. Clear skies mean theres still a good chance of spotting the Northern Lights. Arctic birds come to breed in March, making this an excellent month for photography holidays in areas such as the remote Varanger Peninsula. <br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<ul><bullet>Fjord fun</bullet>\n<bullet>Warmer and lighter</bullet>\n<bullet>Time for <i>utepils</i>  the first drink outdoors</bullet></ul>\r\n\r\nCome to Norway in April and youll find a country shaking off the snow to embrace the freedom brought by warmer weather and longer days. This is a popular time for cruises along the fjords, as the banks are brilliant with blossoming fruit trees and waterfalls gush with snowmelt. Norwegians celebrate the ability to enjoy a drink outside again by raising a glass or two  known as <i>utepils</i>.<br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<ul><bullet>Midnight sun</bullet>\n<bullet>Walking and cycling</bullet>\n<bullet>Scenic rail journeys</bullet></ul>\r\n\r\nMay can be the best time for hiking. Landscapes are lush and green, the weather is sunny and dry, and summer crowds are still some weeks off. Norway in May is also lovely when seen from a train carriage  the Flam is one of the worlds steepest and most scenic railway lines. Northern Norway enjoys midnight sun from now until late August  pack sunglasses and eye masks for sleeping.<br/><br/>\n<b>May and June are great months for our</b> <a href=\"/holiday/5133/arctic-icebreaker-cruise-spitsbergen\">Arctic cruises to Spitsbergen</a><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<ul><bullet>Midnight sun</bullet>\n<bullet>Self guided cycling</bullet>\n<bullet>Warm, sunny weather</bullet></ul>\r\n\r\nFrom June, Norway basks in pleasant temperatures  up to around 20°C in the capital, Oslo. Weather-wise, this is the best time of year to go to Norway whether youre getting around on foot, by train, or on a scenic fjord cruise. Norway in June is also lovely for cycling, with some popular self guided routes taking you along the Arctic coast and fjords.\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<ul><bullet>Long, sunny days</bullet>\n<bullet>Outdoor activities</bullet>\n<bullet>Riddu Riddu Festival</bullet></ul>\r\n\r\nJuly is the hottest month in Norway, and a delightful time of year to be there. Long days and short nights are perfect for those who love to be out in nature, whether it be for cycling, or walking (gondolas and funiculars get you up high). Norway in July also sees the Riddu Riddu Festival taking place, a major Sámi cultural event showcasing Indigenous literature, music, film and handicrafts. <br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<ul><bullet>Warm weather</bullet>\n<bullet>Fjord cruises</bullet>\n<bullet>Scandinavia tours</bullet></ul>\r\n\r\nAugust is another great time to be in Norway, with sunny weather reaching highs of around 20°C inland. You can enjoy a wealth of activities in Norway in August, from cycling to cruising along the narrow, deep fjords that cleave the coastline. With hotels, restaurants and tourism activities all open across the region, August is also a good month for Scandinavia tours that also take in Denmark and Sweden. <br/><br/>\n<b>August is a great time for our</b> <a href=\"/holiday/6568/lofoten-islands-cycling-holiday-norway\">Lofoten Islands cycling holiday</a><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<ul><bullet>Less crowded</bullet>\n<bullet>Autumnal scenery</bullet>\n<bullet>Temperatures drop</bullet></ul>\r\n\r\nNorway in September is quieter after the school holidays have ended. This can be an affordable time to visit as well as a very pleasant one, with mild weather and autumnal shades in the landscapes. Its several degrees cooler in the north of Norway though, closer to the Arctic Circle. For a different perspective, pop on a windbreaker for a brisk and beautiful week of sailing around the coast and fjords.<br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<ul><bullet>City touring</bullet>\n<bullet>Harvest season</bullet>\n<bullet>Changeable weather</bullet></ul>\r\n\r\nExpect four seasons in one day when travelling in Norway in October as the country moves deeper into autumn. October is harvest season so fresh produce abounds in local restaurants, from game to fruit and vegetables  look out for homemade berry jams. If you catch good weather, you can still enjoy hiking and cycling during October, but this is also the perfect month for sightseeing around cities like Oslo, Bergen and Tromso.<br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<ul><bullet>Whale watching</bullet>\n<bullet>Northern Lights</bullet>\n<bullet>Cold, damp weather</bullet></ul>\r\n\r\nIf your thoughts are only of weather, then Norway in November may seem a bit of a grim prospect  cold and wet, with nights starting to get longer (the sun doesnt even rise from mid-November in northern Norway). Yet as snow clouds gather, peak season begins for seeing the Northern Lights, and whale watching  fin and humpback whales, along with orcas, forage for herring in the fjords near Tromso.<br/><br/>\n<b>November is perfect for our</b> <a href=\"/holiday/36012/whale-watching-sailing-holiday-norway\">whale watching and Northern Lights cruise</a><br/><br/>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n<ul><bullet>Ski season</bullet>\n<bullet>Cold, snowy weather</bullet>\n<bullet>Saint Lucys Day</bullet></ul>\r\n\r\nNorway in December is pretty, with snow flurries, frozen lakes, and Christmas festivities lighting up the country. The aforementioned snow ushers in the ski season, with our cross country ski holidays providing a more environmentally friendly option than downhill skiing. Meanwhile, Saint Lucys Day on 13 December is a festival of lights and singing that announces the Christmas period.",

    "title2": "Northern Lights Festival (late January)",
    "paragraph2": "Despite the name, the Northern Lights Festival is more of an audio spectacular than a visual one. With its roots in classical music, the Tromso festival has expanded to encompass many different genres, including jazz and dance, with a diverse programme of both local and international performers making this one of Scandinavias most renowned music events.",
    "title3": "Sámi Week (February)",
    "paragraph3": "Taking place around the Sámi National Day of 6 February, Sámi Week  as the name suggests  is a celebration of all things Sámi, the Indigenous people of\nSápmi\n or northern Scandinavia. The festival is held in Tromso and features everything from reindeer racing to lasso championships, along with concerts, discussions and performances of\njoik\n, traditional Sámi singing. February is one of the coldest months in Norway, and a bowl of\nbidos\n(reindeer stew) is a tasty way to warm up.",
    "title4": "Holmenkollen Ski Festival (late February or March)",
    "paragraph4": "Watching a Nordic ski jump championship is a very special thing. Hold your breath and cover your eyes as the daring skiers take off from the ramp; the cheers and frantic shaking of the cowbells alert you to a successful landing.  The jumps, in front of a wildly passionate crowd all waving their Norwegian flags, are a thrilling part of the Holmenkollen Ski Festival, which also showcases biathlon (cross country skiing and rifle shooting) events.",
    "title5": "Extreme Sports Week (June)",
    "paragraph5": "Are you a BASE jumper? Skydiver? A lover of white water kayaking or rappelling down waterfalls? Or do you find all that stuff super exciting but prefer the idea of watching other people take the risks? Then the Extreme Sports Festival in Voss is for you. This is the largest festival of its kind in the world, and one that is committed to sustainability and environmental protection by slashing waste and seeking to reduce emissions. So expect lots of high fives, wraparound sunglasses and clearly marked recycling bins.",
    "title6": "Midnight Sun Marathon (June)",
    "paragraph6": "The Midnight Sun Marathon in Tromso takes place in the middle of the night, but because youre in the Arctic Circle in summer, youll be able to enjoy the Arctic scenery all the way round, as it will be light. The hard part, then, is convincing your body that it should be running rather than sleeping. Actually, thats not true, is it  the hard part is all the running.",
    "title7": "Matstreif Food Festival (September)",
    "paragraph7": "Held across two days in the capital, Oslo, every October, Norways largest food festival sees dozens of local producers congregate to set up stalls and offer tastings, and visitors can also watch demonstrations or take part in food competitions. Elk, salmon and deer burgers are popular, and youll find arrays of colourful organic vegetables and fresh seafood. One delicacy to look out for and perhaps avoid is\nrakfisk\n, which is fermented trout, often eaten with sour cream, onions and flatbread.",
    "title8": "Our travellers also ask",
    "paragraph8": "",
    "title9": "What is the rainiest month in Norway?",
    "paragraph9": "The rainiest month in Norway is either <b>August or October</b>, depending on where you are. Norway is a long, thin country where the weather can vary dramatically between north and south. Typically, the west coast and southern Norway see the most rain, with October to January the wettest period. Frigid Lapland, far in the north, is comparatively dry, seeing most of its rain between the summer months of June and August. <br/><br/>",
    "title10": "What is the cheapest month to visit Norway?",
    "paragraph10": "The cheapest time to visit Norway tends to be <b>the low season between January and April</b>. Spanning winter activities and the beauty of spring, these months are chilly, with unsettled weather, but are excellent for spotting the Northern Lights. Like much of Scandinavia, Norway is seen as an expensive country to visit, so travelling in low season and booking flights early are useful ways to keep costs down."
