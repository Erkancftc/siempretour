        "Main_Paragraph": "Zimbabwe boasts some of Africa’s most beautiful landscapes and flourishing wildlife populations, including huge numbers of elephants. Our small group and tailor made safari holidays take you from national parks such as Hwange to Victoria Falls, and sometimes over the border into neighbouring Botswana. And whether you’re tracking rhinos in Matusadona, or visiting a village to learn about tribal life, there’s no finer companion than the local guides that our holidays employ. No one knows Zimbabwe’s landscapes, wildlife, nature and communities better, and equally there’s no one better placed to help you get to know them.",
        "Subtitle": "About our Zimbabwe holidays",
        "Title1": "Zimbabwe safaris",
        "Paragraph1": "Our safari holidays encapsulate Zimbabwe’s greatest hits. Hippos wallow in Mana Pools National Park and Lake Kariba, where you can take a boat out to view them… at a safe distance. You can drive out to see the elephant herds that still survive in the savannahs, despite years of drought and poaching. Our holidays avoid unethical ‘walking with lions’ experiences and instead help you to track the big beasts down in their natural environment. Expert Zimbabwean guides lead the way, and will also have an eye out for wild dogs, giraffes, rhinos, wildebeest, leopards, and hyenas.",
        "image1": "",
        "Title2": "Hwange National Park",
        "Paragraph2": "Hwange National Park has come a long way from its days as a hunting ground for King Mzilikazi Khumal in the 19th century. It’s one of the biggest national parks in Africa, and home to most of Zimbabwe’s huge elephant population, as well as lion prides, packs of wild dogs, and springy antelopes, all supported by your visit. Our fantastic local guides drive you out to grassy plains at the crack of dawn and show you how to track giraffes safely on foot. Your visit to Hwange National Park will be part of a larger tour of Zimbabwe or Southern Africa; choose a tailor made trip to spend extra time here.",
        "image2": "",
        "Title3": "Victoria Falls",
        "Paragraph3": "Victoria Falls is known as Mosi-oa-Tunya (‘the smoke that thunders’) in the Lozi tongue and Shungu Namutitima in Tonga (‘boiling water’). As you stand beneath its 108m-tall and 1.5km-wide waterfalls, you can see where these evocative local names come from. Victoria Falls straddles the border of Zimbabwe and Zambia, but you’ll get the best views on the Zimbabwe side, where four out of five of the cascades crash. Many of our Zimbabwe holidays feature a stop at Victoria Falls, which is one of the most impressive sights in Africa.",
        "Title4": "Zimbabwe & Botswana",
        "Paragraph4": "It makes perfect sense to visit Zimbabwe and Botswana on the same trip. The elephants and lodges of Chobe National Park are just over the border from Zimbabwe, and the wildlife-rich Okavango Delta (see it by mokoro canoe steered by a local boatman) is just a few hours’ drive from there. Botswana has had years to perfect its conservation-based tourism, so expect luxury camps and more visitors, whereas wildlife holidays in Zimbabwe are still in their formative years. The neighbouring countries concur when it comes to rigorous guide training, however: the Zimbabwean and Botswanan guides on our trips are some of the finest in the world.",

        "Main_Paragraph": "A year round destination, the best time to visit depends on whether you like heat, rain, or more temperate conditions. For safaris, the ideal time to go to Zimbabwe is from May-Nov, though the latter part of this season sees temps soar into the 30s. July-Aug hover in the mid-20s, but can get pretty chilly at night. Some camps around Hwange close during the rainy season (Dec-Mar), but the animals are still very much there to be seen, as are the guides that need their jobs. Zimbabwes storms can be incredibly atmospheric bringing migratory birds, beautiful sunsets and really clear skies.",

        "when_to_go_html": "<bullet><b>The dry season is excellent</b>, particularly April, May and September, as the temperatures are not too extreme and malaria risk is low. Also, this is when the wildlife gathers around the waterholes.\r\n</bullet>\n<bullet><b>October is also dry but very hot</b> with temperatures soaring into the thirties. \r\n</bullet>\n<bullet>It may be heating up, but <b>September and October are considered the best time to see elephant herds</b> in Hwange National Park. \r\n</bullet>\n<bullet>Around Mana Pools National Park, <b>many lodges close between January and March for the low, rainy season</b>. By contrast, July and September is a brilliant time to visit. Open for business and yet not busy at all.\r\n</bullet>\n<bullet>Similarly <b>some lodges close during the rainy season at Hwange National Park</b> (December  March) and it is at its most crowded between June and October.\r\n</bullet>\n<bullet>Although you would be forgiven for thinking that Victoria Falls might be best in full flow, this isnt the case as the spray obscures really good views. So <b>go when the water is lower</b>, the best time being June to September.\r\n</bullet>\n<bullet><b>November and December is when the rainy season begins and lasts through until March</b>, although it usually consists of afternoon showers. This is also when a lot of wildlife is born though. So, the grass is greener and all that.\r\n</bullet>\n<bullet>If you are hoping to raft the River Zambezi, <b>the best time is when the water is low</b>, as the white water is more dramatic. August to February are great months. When the waters get higher around March or April, it is unlikely that runs will be offered.</bullet>",

From a photography point of view, the summer months have clear air and the morning and afternoon light is magical. Of course the dusty winter months mean that the sunsets are rich orange and reds. The dry winter months also mean that the bushveld has less grass and foliage, so the clear view of wildlife can make photography a bit easier.\r\n<br/><br/>\n<b>Andrew Appleyard, from our supplier Exodus Travels:</b><br/>\r\nIf you are in Vic Falls on a full moon the park is open for special guided walks to see the lunar rainbow which lasts three days.",
