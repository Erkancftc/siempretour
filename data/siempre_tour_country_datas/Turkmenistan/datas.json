        "Main_Paragraph": "Desert camping, dinosaur footprints and colourful canyons that lead to the fabled shores of the Caspian Sea – our adventurous Turkmenistan holidays explore one of the lesser-visited ‘Stans, where ancient cultural traditions blend with awe-inspiring natural landscapes. You can spend a few days in key locations such as Ashgabat, Nisa and Dashoguz on one of our Silk Road epics, or take two weeks to enjoy Turkmenistan in detail. And there’s no better way to get to know this land of flaming gas craters and fortified citadels than with a local guide by your side. Our tours here will often feature a night in a welcoming Turkmen homestay, a fantastic opportunity to experience genuine family life while also benefiting a local community project.",
        "Subtitle": "Turkmenistan highlights",
        "Title1": "1. Ashgabat",
        "Paragraph1": "Often described as bizarre, Ashgabat was rebuilt in the 1990s after the earthquake of 1948 which killed 110,000 people. White marble buildings, boulevards and fountains give it a Vegas feel, while its numerous monuments are futuristic. Visit the excellent National Museum, the Carpet Museum  see the worlds biggest carpet!  and the open-air Tolkuchka bazaar, which sells red Turkmen rugs and camels.",
        "image1": "",
        "Title2": "2. Darvaza gas crater",
        "Paragraph2": "In the midst of the magically bleak Karakam desert, the Darvaza gas crater has been nicknamed the door to hell. The origin of this 30m-deep pit of flaming methane is shrouded in mystery, but its been burning for some 40 years. Camp here to appreciate its bizarre glowing beauty and heat at night, when passing birds circle above, attracted by its searchlight beam.",
        "image2": "",
        "Title3": "3. Konye-Urgench",
        "Paragraph3": "This ancient capital of the land of Khorezm was once the centre of the Islamic world. The old town contains incredible architecture, with a series of monuments from the 11th to 16th centuries, including a mosque, fortresses, mausoleums and a 60m minaret. The citys influence spread into Iran and Afghanistan, even shaping the architecture of the Mughal Empire of 16th century India.",
        "Title4": "4. Kugitang Mountains",
        "Paragraph4": "Near the border with Uzbekistan, the western slopes of the Kugitang Mountains are a nature reserve with a unique ecosystem. Deep canyons and mountains with walnut, maple and juniper forests are home to rare mountain sheep and markhour, an endangered mountain goat, while the Dinosaur Plateau contains more than 400 dinosaur footprints. Hike to the Umbar Dere waterfall and the Kyrk Kyz pilgrim cave.",
        "image3": "",
        "Title5": "5. Merv",
        "Paragraph5": "Near the city of Mary, the Silk Road metropolis of Merv dates back 2,500 years. In the 12th century, at its height, it was a place of palaces, irrigation channels and fertile gardens. By the 1220s, though, it had been destroyed by the Mongols, with an estimated 700,000 deaths. Today its windswept ruins are a UNESCO World Heritage site, consisting of five walled cities from different periods.",
        "Title6": "6. Nisa",
        "Paragraph6": "Nisa, 18km southwest of Ashgabat, was capital of the Parthian Empire, one of the most powerful and influential civilisations of the ancient world, from the 3rd century BCE to 3rd century AD. A city of fortresses, palaces and temples, it formed a barrier to Roman expansion and was a crucial trading centre at the crossroads of north and south, east and west."

        "Main_Paragraph": "The best time to visit Turkmenistan is from mid March to end of May and then again from mid September to November, when you can expect daytime temperatures of between 23-35°C. Winter months can be extremely cold and by contrast, July and August are boiling hot, particularly in the desert regions. Ashgabat can soar to well over 40°C in July and drop to -5°C in winter. You might catch a shower in early May or November, but Turkmenistan is typically very dry. Nights in the desert are chilly, too, so take extra layers if youre camping.",

        "paragraph3": "\"If you think about Ashgabat, you would think its almost a Dubai or Las Vegas type place. Its exceptional, especially the buildings  one in the shape of a lighter, one a book, another in the shape of a star. Its almost Dr Zeus like. What really gives it a sense of difference from the West, though, is that there are so many restrictions in Turkmenistan. This is the second most controlled nation in the world after North Korea. When passing into the country you will sometimes have four officers looking at you, from front and back. I wouldnt call it intimidating, unless you have something you shouldnt have in your suitcase! Then youre in trouble, as they will absolutely comb through everything. But there is a friendly side to the security guards, its just extremely controlled.",
        "title4": "Communications advice",
        "paragraph4": "Visitors should understand that yes, there is internet, but there is no communication outside of Turkmenistan. There is a web, but Hotmail, Facebook, Skype, everything is blocked. All the most commonly known apps cant be used. If youre coming here, be prepared that you will not be able to communicate with the outside world. Unless you have to make a phone call out, and thats going to be extremely expensive. Forget about online services.",
        "title5": "Chatting to local people",
        "paragraph5": "The Turkmen people in my experience are very friendly, but they will be reserved, because they are being observed. So, they dont ever want to talk badly, but you do have a sense that sometimes they are holding back what they would really like to say. Its a bit like China, when you have a government guide, so you dont really get their free opinion. They would be in a lot of trouble if they spoke openly about politics, so dont press your guide or local people on this. There is a strong sense of nationalism. Hotels have stars everywhere and there is a great deal of propaganda around the president. Youll be told, Turkmenbashi did this, he did that",
        "title6": "What to expect",
        "paragraph6": "There is a contrast between the vast majority of the country, which is still very undiscovered, and the bigger cities, which are actually very developed. They have areas with a more cosmopolitan feel, nice bars with incredible views, that kind of thing. The people have their fashion sense, too. Women like to wear a lot of green, which is the national colour. Turkmenistan certainly has a real identity!",

Do not miss the museums in Mary and Ashgabat.” <b>– Ann Rix </b><br/><br/>\r\n\r\n“Have as much time as you can to spare. We managed 31 days, which allowed lots of time for visiting cities as well as hiking, which was the primary point of our trip. Don’t overlook places like Bishkek or Turkmenistan; when planning the itinerary they were not high on my list of must dos, but they turned out to be highlights as well.”<b> – David Harper on our Central Asia highlights tour\r\n</b><br/><br/>\r\n“Check what medicines you can take into the country with a doctor’s prescription info, otherwise you may have problems at border control.” <b>– Anne Higgins</b>"
