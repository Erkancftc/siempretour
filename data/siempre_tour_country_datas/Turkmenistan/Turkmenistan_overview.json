    "Main_Paragraph": "Desert camping, dinosaur footprints and colourful canyons that lead to the fabled shores of the Caspian Sea – our adventurous Turkmenistan holidays explore one of the lesser-visited ‘Stans, where ancient cultural traditions blend with awe-inspiring natural landscapes. You can spend a few days in key locations such as Ashgabat, Nisa and Dashoguz on one of our Silk Road epics, or take two weeks to enjoy Turkmenistan in detail. And there’s no better way to get to know this land of flaming gas craters and fortified citadels than with a local guide by your side. Our tours here will often feature a night in a welcoming Turkmen homestay, a fantastic opportunity to experience genuine family life while also benefiting a local community project.",

    "Title1": "1. Ashgabat",
    "Paragraph1": "Often described as bizarre, Ashgabat was rebuilt in the 1990s after the earthquake of 1948 which killed 110,000 people. White marble buildings, boulevards and fountains give it a Vegas feel, while its numerous monuments are futuristic. Visit the excellent National Museum, the Carpet Museum  see the worlds biggest carpet!  and the open-air Tolkuchka bazaar, which sells red Turkmen rugs and camels.",

    "Title2": "2. Darvaza gas crater",
    "Paragraph2": "In the midst of the magically bleak Karakam desert, the Darvaza gas crater has been nicknamed the door to hell. The origin of this 30m-deep pit of flaming methane is shrouded in mystery, but its been burning for some 40 years. Camp here to appreciate its bizarre glowing beauty and heat at night, when passing birds circle above, attracted by its searchlight beam.",

A city of fortresses, palaces and temples, it formed a barrier to Roman expansion and was a crucial trading centre at the crossroads of north and south, east and west."
