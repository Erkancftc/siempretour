    "Main_Title": "BEST TIME TO VISIT TAIWAN",
    "Main_Paragraph": "When it rains in Taiwan it can really bucket down with the warmer, wetter months of Jul-Sep often associated with severe flash floods, which can be especially dramatic if hiking in the mountains. As the country straddles the Tropic of Cancer, the south and south central areas tend to fare better when it comes to warmth with Nov-Mar often chilly around Taipei whilst tropical Kaohsiung enjoys temperatures around 25°C. The best time to visit Taiwan is outside of the summer with either Mar-Apr or Oct-Nov often cited as the months with the least humidity.",

    "title1": "The Dragon Boat Festival",
    "paragraph1": "The Dragon Boat Festival takes place on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month  usually May or June  and finds contestants across Taiwan taking to rivers in a series of organised races to honour the life of former royal advisor and patriotic poet to the Chu dynasty, Qu Yuan. After becoming exiled, Qu Yuan discovered that not everyone shared his patriotism and so he took his own life in the Miluo River, on mainland China. In order to keep fishes, dragons and evil spirits from eating his body, local villagers took to the water and threw rice, banged drums and splashed their paddles. This tradition continues to this day with colourful dragon boats racing and making as much noise as possible.",

    "paragraph3": "Stef Studley, from our partner Regent Holidays, shares her personal experiences and recommendations for responsible travellers looking to take a holiday in Taiwan:",
    "title4": "Why join a small group tour?",
    "paragraph4": "Small group tours often work out more affordable. They cover the majority of Taiwans natural and cultural highlights as well as offering ease of travel and the avoidance of any language barriers. The rail network is extensive and efficient in Taiwan but it can be tricky to figure out which train to catch. A small group tour takes out the hassle and gives you peace of mind so you can sit back and relax rather than worrying whether youre on the right train etc.",
    "title5": "Taiwan vs. China",
    "paragraph5": "Taiwan has a more laidback feel than mainland China and is extremely friendly. The simple fact that the country and the towns and cities are smaller, without so many local crowds, makes it easier to navigate and, in my opinion, projects a more welcoming attitude to visitors. Taiwan is also extremely green, which took me by surprise, to be honest, and the food was so much tastier than anything I've tried in mainland China.",
    "title6": "Hanging with the locals",
    "paragraph6": "If you want to meet people in Taipei Id recommend eating out at street food stalls and night markets, rather than the high rise malls. Also make the most of the highly efficient metro system as well as the great bar (and karaoke) scene which also features several cat cafés that have only just started springing up around the city.",
    "title7": "Trekking",
    "paragraph7": "If you like getting outdoors then youve come to the right place as outdoor adventure pursuits are very popular with Taiwanese. I'd recommend hiring a bike and cycling around Sun Moon Lake or hiking in any of the countrys nine national parks, as just a couple of excuses to get out and explore like a local."
