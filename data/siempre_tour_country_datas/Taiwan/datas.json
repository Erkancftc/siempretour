        "Main_Title": "Our Taiwan holidays & tours",
        "Main_Paragraph": "Our Taiwan holidays explore an island that might be a hiker’s dream destination, with hills rising out of every town and village, including the country’s capital, Taipei. Walking in national parks such as Kenting and Yangmingshan your trip will pay entrance fees that help preserve the parks’ trails, as well as contributing directly to conservation projects. Our Taiwan holiday range also includes fab small group tours that take you from north to south. These include ‘must see’ natural landmarks like Taroko Gorge and Sun Moon Lake, but also unique and memorable experiences like joining a social project that helps single mothers find financial independence, selling sweet potatoes on the street alongside them and learning about their lives.",
        "Subtitle": "TAIWAN highlights",
        "Title1": "1. Kaohsiung",
        "Paragraph1": "The powerhouse of the south, Kaohsiung is a city of shimmering towers as reflected in the Love River that flows through the downtown district to offer residents respite in riverside parks and vibrant night markets. The presence of Shoushan Mountain will tempt hikers to seek cityscape views whilst a trip to Lotus Pond provides further reflections of Taoist temples and Chinese palace-style pavilions.",
        "image1": "",
        "Title2": "2. Lukang",
        "Paragraph2": "Temple tours in Lukang are a must with over 200 different places of worship, including Longshan and Matzu, honouring religious deities and folklore heritage. After the temples, take a trip back in time as you stroll around the alleys of Lukangs Old Street aligned by typically ornate Taiwanese architecture, including shop houses selling everything from Yuzhenzhai cakes to ox tongue biscuits  yum!",
        "image2": "",
        "Title3": "3. Sun Moon Lake",
        "Paragraph3": "Aside from being incredibly beautiful, Sun Moon Lake, in central Taiwan, is home to one of the countrys 16 aboriginal (Formosan) tribes, the Thao. A visit to the village of Tehua (Barawbaw) is one way to discover the traditional culture of Thao people, although some of the surrounding hiking trails, leading to shrines and pagodas, offer equal insight into the lakes naturally peaceful attraction.",
        "Title4": "4. Tainan",
        "Paragraph4": "Taiwans ancient capital is, in many ways, the countrys cultural epicentre with numerous Buddhist and Taoist temples sitting alongside colonial Dutch forts, expansive parks and national museums. For a real taste of the old Taiwan head to Tainan's Flower night market, where young and old sit down each weekend to socialise over flaming grilled meats, steaming dumplings and bubble tea.",
        "image3": "",
        "Title5": "5. Taipei",
        "Paragraph5": "Most tours of Taiwan commence in the capital, Taipei, and will no doubt feature Chiang Kai-Shek Memorial Hall and the National Palace Museum alongside ogling upwards at Taipei 101, once the worlds tallest tower. Stroll around 228 Peace Memorial Park, if you get the chance, or grab a Taipei Pass and ride the MRT rails to seek out Shilin night market or Bihu Park in the suburb of Neihu.",
        "Title6": "6. Taroko Gorge",
        "Paragraph6": "Get to Taroko Gorge as early as possible, and avoid weekends, to ensure you get to see highlights such as the Eternal Springs Shrine and Swallow Grotto, without the crowds. Walking the Shakadang Trail is ideal if youre pushed for time  it takes around 45mins one way  although beware the Jhuilu Old Trail, above Swallow Grotto, as paths are narrow and can be dangerous, especially after a storm."

        "Main_Title": "BEST TIME TO VISIT TAIWAN",
        "Main_Paragraph": "When it rains in Taiwan it can really bucket down with the warmer, wetter months of Jul-Sep often associated with severe flash floods, which can be especially dramatic if hiking in the mountains. As the country straddles the Tropic of Cancer, the south and south central areas tend to fare better when it comes to warmth with Nov-Mar often chilly around Taipei whilst tropical Kaohsiung enjoys temperatures around 25°C. The best time to visit Taiwan is outside of the summer with either Mar-Apr or Oct-Nov often cited as the months with the least humidity.",

        "title1": "The Dragon Boat Festival",
        "paragraph1": "The Dragon Boat Festival takes place on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month  usually May or June  and finds contestants across Taiwan taking to rivers in a series of organised races to honour the life of former royal advisor and patriotic poet to the Chu dynasty, Qu Yuan. After becoming exiled, Qu Yuan discovered that not everyone shared his patriotism and so he took his own life in the Miluo River, on mainland China. In order to keep fishes, dragons and evil spirits from eating his body, local villagers took to the water and threw rice, banged drums and splashed their paddles. This tradition continues to this day with colourful dragon boats racing and making as much noise as possible.",

        "paragraph3": "Stef Studley, from our partner Regent Holidays, shares her personal experiences and recommendations for responsible travellers looking to take a holiday in Taiwan:",
        "title4": "Why join a small group tour?",
        "paragraph4": "Small group tours often work out more affordable. They cover the majority of Taiwans natural and cultural highlights as well as offering ease of travel and the avoidance of any language barriers. The rail network is extensive and efficient in Taiwan but it can be tricky to figure out which train to catch. A small group tour takes out the hassle and gives you peace of mind so you can sit back and relax rather than worrying whether youre on the right train etc.",
        "title5": "Taiwan vs. China",
        "paragraph5": "Taiwan has a more laidback feel than mainland China and is extremely friendly. The simple fact that the country and the towns and cities are smaller, without so many local crowds, makes it easier to navigate and, in my opinion, projects a more welcoming attitude to visitors. Taiwan is also extremely green, which took me by surprise, to be honest, and the food was so much tastier than anything I've tried in mainland China.",
        "title6": "Hanging with the locals",
        "paragraph6": "If you want to meet people in Taipei Id recommend eating out at street food stalls and night markets, rather than the high rise malls. Also make the most of the highly efficient metro system as well as the great bar (and karaoke) scene which also features several cat cafés that have only just started springing up around the city.",
        "title7": "Trekking",
        "paragraph7": "If you like getting outdoors then youve come to the right place as outdoor adventure pursuits are very popular with Taiwanese. I'd recommend hiring a bike and cycling around Sun Moon Lake or hiking in any of the countrys nine national parks, as just a couple of excuses to get out and explore like a local."
