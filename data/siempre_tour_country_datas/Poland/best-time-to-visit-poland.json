    "Main_Paragraph": "Białowieża's primeval forest is incredibly atmospheric during the winter with thick snow providing ideal tracking conditions before returning to log cabins for steaming bowls of bigos (Hunters Stew). Further south, the snow-covered slopes of the High Tatras attract almost as many visitors as the Baltic beaches during the summer although hikers should consider spring the best time to visit Poland for exploring outdoors. Summer finds plenty of sunshine while a few extra layers make the autumn all the more bearable, especially when accompanied by fabulously fiery forest foliage followed by cultural sightseeing in Krakow or Warsaw outside of peak season.",

You can expect everything from the weather here. The coldest months of the season are January and February where temperatures often drop to -20°C and there are frequent intervals of snow.",
    "title3": "Where & when to track wildlife",
    "paragraph3": "I just cant picture a situation where I havent seen bison while being in Białowieża forest. Winter is the easiest time and summer can be tricky, without the help of a good wildlife guide. There are also three to four packs of wolves in the forest (about 30 individuals) and, again, I cant picture a time when I didnt find wolf tracks in winter but summer is difficult as soil often turns into a solid brick.",

    "paragraph4": "The best places to see migrating birds and thousands of wildfowl are the Biebrza marshes (Biebrza National Park) and the mouth of the Warta River (Warta River Mouth National Park). Particularly spectacular is the spring migration of ruff in the Biebrza marshes.",

    "paragraph6": "Gosia Knas, Polish expert at our partner Exodus, shares her local knowledge:\nOscypek is a highlander smoked cheese to buy in Krakow. Very specific, but very good! Polish vodka is considered one of the best in the world so buy a small bottle of Belvedere while you're in Warsaw. Visit a 'milk bar' for pierogi (dumplings) or grab a zapiekanka (sandwich) if on the go.\nIn Krakow, visit Cepelia, Polish Art and Handicraft Foundation to browse for some small, unique souvenirs. While up north, search for original gingerbread cakes - they don't get any better!",
    "title7": "Visiting the big cities",
    "paragraph7": "In Warsaw you may want to check out the old Fotoplastikon, a stereoscopic theatre based on the Kaiserpanorama system of rotating stereoscopic images. It's working and it's based in original location since it was open in 1905, making it the oldest in Europe.\nIf you are in Gdansk in the summer (July/Aug), you must visit St. Dominics Fair. It is the largest open-air trade and cultural event in Poland and one of the largest such events in Europe. It has enjoyed over 750 years of tradition; it was established by the Pope Alexander IV in 1260.",

The walking tour gave a great insight into the history while Auschwitz was thought provoking but not to be missed. The Salt Mine is a must see  awesome. The good weather made the views from the top of Zakopane brilliant. <b>  David Harris </b> <br/> <br/>\r\nPoland is a beautiful country with amazing wildlife and a must for any animal/bird enthusiast. Put a tour together with the guides who are very passionate and knowledgeable about life in the forests and you are in for an unforgettable holiday.<b>  Rosemary Richards</b><br/><br/>\r\nTake some extra nibbles, dried fruit, bars, nuts etc as packed lunches ok but needed something extra. Mozzies get you through your clothes! <b> Julie and James Dore </b> <br/><br/>\r\nTravel light and at Warsaw Airport a 250 metre walk to the bus-stop outside the new airport building for the no. 175 bus (2.40 zlotys) will save you GB £10 taxi fare. <b>  Mr C B Proctor </b>"
