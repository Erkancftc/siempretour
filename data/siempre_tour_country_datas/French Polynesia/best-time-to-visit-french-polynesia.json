    "Main_Paragraph": "Thanks to its location, close to the equator, French Polynesia has a fairly consistent 30°C temperature year round with the slightly cooler, drier, months of June-Aug considered high season. Things start to heat up in Jan-March with an afternoon deluge a regular occurrence. Sep-Oct are the best time to visit outside of high season as it's still fairly dry with plenty of sunshine. Dec and Jan get busier due to Christmas hols, and these are also the wettest months so be prepared for sunshine and showers. Finally, April and May are pretty pleasant and worth considering if you're not tied into school holidays.",
