      "description": "The morning over Mysore comes with the delicious aroma of masala dosa, similar to an Indian crepe, which is delightfully crispy and fluffy at the same time. Your guide meets you at your hotel and takes you on an early tour of the Mysore Palace. The structure was rebuilt in 1912 and remains one of the grandest examples of Indiaâs royalty. When you come to the palace through the main entrance you find an incredible tripartite gateway. The palace itself supports a five-story tower that stands 145 feet. The sensational exterior is matched by the lavish interior. Step through the ornate rosewood doorway and into the Abavilasa where the king held private audiences. The doorway is inlaid with ivory and the columns are gilded beneath the stained glass ceilings. The elegant design and the lavish dÃ©cor are nothing less than inspiring. After your tour of the palace you will venture onward to the Kabini Forest Reserve. When you come to the river you will board a boat and begin your afternoon river cruise. You can see locals paddling through the water on coracles. They smile and wave with sincere excitement. The water is calm. There is a long stretch of grassland between the riverbanks and the lush forest. At the edge of the tree line you see a large fluffy animal making its way to the water. Your guide tells you that itâs a sloth bear. Their arms are lankier and their hair is shaggier than a black bear and they can weigh up to 290 pounds. Their long snout sniffs at the air. You continue to drift down the river but canât stop watching the animal lumber closer to the water."

      "title": "Nagarhole National Park- The Elephant and Tiger Experience",
      "description": "The flavors of the morning are scented with sweet and spicy masala chai tea. You can taste the allspice and cinnamon mixed with the coconut milk. When breakfast ends your early morning guide, an elephant, meets you. You climb atop the elephant and begin to explore the surrounding prairie along the Kabini riverbank. Every step the elephant takes is controlled and calculated. You sit in a large box on the elephants back a sway with every step. The birdlife is vivacious in the canopy, chirping and soaring through the open sky before returning to the comfort of the trees. In the afternoon you say goodbye to your elephant and continue deeper into the expansive jungle of Nagarhole National Park. The park extends over 247 square miles and is home to many endangered species, such as the tiger. Leopards dangle their limbs off of tree branches. Bison graze on the luminous grass. As you spend the day looking through the towering trees you spot a tigerâs orange glow. The tiger steps in long and slow strides and you can see the black stripes marking its back. The moment feels like slow motion, giving you more time to take in the largest of the big cat family; they can grow to over 10 feet long and weigh over 500 pounds. In the tigerâs elegant presence you donât think about its size, you only think about its beauty."

      "description": "The blissful quiet of the surrounding jungle is blended with birdcalls. Active monkeys sprint through the trees. You begin the day with an early morning game drive once more around Nagarhole National Park. The wildlife is most active in the cool air of the early daylight before the sunlight creates a warmer afternoon. Your guide takes you through the diverse grounds of the park, from floodplains to forestry. Each movement forward is another chance to see the majestic fauna in a natural and undisturbed habitat. Deer stroll along the meadow. Their fur is decorated with white spots that look like snowflakes. You see a collection of wild boar speed into the brush. Just as you think you may not find any more wildlife in the beauty of the emerald trees, you spot a troop of elephants in the distance. They step cautiously near the riverbank and dip their trunks to the water. After breakfast you will make your way to Fringe Ford. The plantation stretches over 520 acres and shares borders with both the Wyanad and Tholpetty wildlife sanctuaries. The surrounding Wyanad Mountain Range rolls up to 6,300 feet above sea level. The olive and teal trees shine in the wide sweeping sunlight. A cozy fire flickers in the warm colors of the dwindling day. In the quiet solitude of the plantation you find the scenery comforting, the luxuries soothing, and the location unlike anywhere you have ever seen."

      "description": "The silence of your morning is similar to the tranquil quiet of the previous night. The scent of fresh, wet earth emanates from the surrounding forest. You look out over the rising hills and sunken valley and find a trapped mist draped over the lower foothills. The sun shines brighter and the mist recedes. The day is at your leisure, meant for you to enjoy however you wish. You can set out along one of the plantationâs innumerable trails that lead into the hillsides and watch the golden light seep through the foliage. Soon you will hear the trickle of water. Twenty-seven separate streams careen through the forest; some of them eventually become waterfalls. The trickle becomes a thunder. You find the rocky terrace flush with beaded water falling and pooling below."

In Northern Kerala is the Neeleshwar Hermitage located in the seclusion of palm groves and within earshot of the seaâs soothing waves. In the afternoon you can put your feet in the warm gold sand and lounge on a hammock beneath the overhanging palm trees. The water is sapphire and calm. When you stand on the shore the water is cool as it laps at your toes. You can feel the rejuvenating effects of the hotel working on you already."

      "description": "The sunlight glistens along the Arabian Sea bringing clear sky and a beautiful morning. The day is at your leisure to discover the splendor in and around Neeleshwar Hermitage. You find an intoxicating aroma emanating from one of the two restaurants on the property. Meenakshi is the beachside eatery known for superb fish caught fresh that morning. The aroma comes from the unique Malabar cuisine. The mussel dish, known as kallummekaya, is floral and rich, mixing chilly powder and coriander, fennel, and ginger. The bright and slightly spicy flavors are blended with the sweetness of mango and coconut. Whether you prefer to relax on the beach or venture to the local Shree Palichon Krishna Temple to experience Keralaâs spiritual culture the remainder of the day is yours. The walkways are lined with sculptures. Fierce spirits are carved into the walls guard the entrance. You find the interior bright with images of deities, from Brahma to Shiva."
