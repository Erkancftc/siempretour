      "title": "Dambulla â Arrive in Sri Lanka",
      "description": "Colombo is the capital of Sri Lanka, and much charm is embodied in the wide boulevards that are shaded with trees as the coastal breeze spreads across the gold-sand shores. The Indian Ocean laps against the shoreline and the markets brim with vibrant colors in the form of elegant saris and fragrant spices. Your flight will land at Bandaranaike International Airport, where your private transfer will greet you upon arrival. You will venture outside of the city and make your way along the gorgeous, lush jungle as ferns and giant coconut palms frame the road as the hills begin to rise along the landscape. You can share the splendor of the countryside with your partner as you travel close to the city of Dambulla, the spiritual and cultural heart of a kingdom that predates the might of the Roman Empire. You will reach your majestic eco-friendly resort that overlooks the lakes, the reed beds, and the paddy fields that are situated in the shadow of the rock fortress of ancient Sigiriya. The dramatic plateau provides a grand welcome to your romantic time in Sri Lanka as you relish an evening of fine dining amidst the cool, hill breeze as the scent of coconut lingers in the air as the sun sets beyond the impressive monolith."

      "title": "Dambulla â Discover Stunning Sigiriya and a Jungle Elephant Trek",
      "description": "In the morning, the sunlight will wash over the greenery and the auburn stone of Lion Rock, the dramatic summit upon which Sigiriya Fortress was erected. At breakfast, you will find the enticing aroma of steeping black tea among the tropical scents of fresh coconut and pineapple. Your private transfer will greet you after your meal eager to lead you on a private exploration of the mountaintop stronghold. Sigiriya Fortress reaches a height of more than 650 feet above the surrounding canopy with vertical walls that disappear into the jungle brush below. The dramatic image will evoke a romantic ambiance as you recall your charming dinner and sunset the previous night in view of the stunning monolith. The palace at the top of the summit was the heart of the kingdom of Kassapa in the 5th century. The breeze brushes over the narrow stairway leading up the side of the plateau, and halfway up the spiraling staircase is a sheltered gallery etched into the rock face. The niche contains a series of paintings that depict celestial nymphs and concubines. Due to the way the gallery shelters the images from the sun, the frescoes remain in remarkable condition with their colors glowing against the bright morning. You will descend to the forest floor after visiting the terraces, water gardens, and grand palace that once stood atop the plateau. Your guide leads you to local village where you step on a small ladder to board the waiting elephant. The seat will sway as your guide will lead the elephant around the jungle that surrounds Lion Rock. You will make your way to the stoic reservoir laden with lily pads, where the elephant may choose to soak in the water, adding to the unforgettable memory of a romantic day in preserved history."

      "title": "Kandy â Explore a Matale Spice Garden",
      "description": "In the morning, pilgrims venture to the caves that surround the nearby city of Dambulla, which contain the best-preserved complex in the country. The temples were etched into the towering rocks located hundreds of feet above the plain. The five caves contain 150 different paintings and statues of Buddha for a stunning display of devotional art created over two millennia ago. Your private transfer will greet you at your hotel after breakfast and escort you through the verdant jungle landscape to reach Matale, located in a fertile valley nearly 1,000 feet above sea level. Spice plantations line the north of town and offer insight into the historical and thriving cultivation of the region. You will stop at an estate to explore the manicured grounds that produce vanilla, rubber, cinchona, cardamom, and even cocoa. Sensing your interest in cocoa, your guide will cut away a pod from the plant before slicing it open. The fruit has a leathery texture and can grow to more than an inch thick while the pulp inside has a tart and sweet flavor similar to lemonade. Your guide will pull away the beans, which lose their lavender hues when drying, turning to the brown color people associate to cocoa. As you leave the spice garden, the scent of vanilla will linger on your skin until you reach the gorgeous lakeside city of Kandy, where you can settle into the secluded comforts of your luxury accommodation."

Hawksbill turtles nest near the mouth of the river, and they can grow up to 45 inches long and weigh 150 pounds. The local hatchery protects the eggs to ensure that the endangered turtles that are nesting in the region can thrive.
