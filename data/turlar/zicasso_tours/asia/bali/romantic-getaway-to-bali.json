The serenity of the sacred ground is such that it even rubs off on the monkeys; find them calm and friendly, living peacefully and openly within a caste system, classified by power and perhaps resources. Ask your guide to point out the chiefs; you will know them as they have a banana or two stashed away. As the evening unfolds, arrive at the legendary Tanah Lot Temple, a revered icon set atop a rock out in the sea. During low tide, watch as ceremonial parades wind their way to the temple with garlands and offerings. At high tide, it is a marvel as waves crash and at sunset, the temple, and its grounds take on a mysterious glow.

Many locals come to seek ablution and healing with the holy water, especially on days of full moons. As the day continues, travel into the village of Kintamani to view the majestic Mount Batur, an active volcano, and its crater lake, said to be built by a friendly giant.
