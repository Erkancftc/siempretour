      "title": "Beijing - Tour of Tiananmen Square, the Forbidden City and Traditional Neighborhoods",
      "description": "Pull back those curtains bright and early and begin with Tiananmen Square, a city square that sits at the heart of Beijing. This area possesses an incredible amount of political and cultural significance, and you will feel that as you arrive. At the center of the square sits the Monument to Peopleâs Heroes, a simple yet beautiful marble and stone structure that honors the heroes of modern Chinese history. Nearby is the Great Hall of People, which stands at an overwhelming size and demonstrates architectural mastery, this structure is among the largest of its kind. The Great Hall serves as a host for the state leaders, who hold various diplomatic meetings within its walls, including the National Peopleâs Congress. Facing the Great Hall of People is the National Museum of China, incorporating both the Chinese History Museum and the Chinese Revolutionary Museum. Not only is it Chinaâs largest history museum, but it also possesses the countryâs most significant ancient items. It is a truly spellbinding journey into the history and culture of the Middle Kingdom with some relics that date back to centuries past. Travel next to take in the wonders of the Forbidden City, an incredible imperial palace with landscaped gardens and fascinating buildings that date back to 1406. Covering an area of 950 by 750 meters, the Forbidden City possesses almost 1,000 buildings, withholding almost 9,000 rooms. Home to emperors during the Ming and Qing Dynasty, its name originates from the principle that only a select number of individuals were allowed to enter its hallowed grounds which lends explanation to the 52-meter-wide moat and eight-meter-high wall that surrounds the area. Finish your dayâs explorations as you explore the fascinating old streets, the hutongs , of Beijing. As you weave your way in and out of the winding, narrow lanes you will see local families playing traditional board games, cooking food and engaging with each other. You can even visit families in their courtyard houses to help make customary Chinese dishes or join in playing traditional games. You will also have the opportunity to try some Chinese folk dancing, take calligraphy classes, and much more."

      "title": "Beijing - Tour of the Great Wall and Temple of Heaven",
      "description": "Prepare for another day of awe-inspiring exploring, beginning with the magical Temple of Heaven. This quiet park possesses an array of uniquely designed buildings with the centerpiece being the Temple of Heaven complex. It was within this mystical building that emperors prayed once a year to worship heaven for a rich harvest. The triple-eaved temple was carefully constructed to represent what it stood for, adding to its already overwhelming presence. The four wooden pillars that make up the core of the structure represent the four seasons while the 12 columns symbolize the 12 months of the year. These subtle features complement other works of art within the building, such as a carved dragon in the ceiling of the temple, signifying the emperor. As you explore the full variety of structures and immerse yourself in history, you will see the fascinating older generation of locals partaking in their daily exercises, playing traditional board games and engaging with each other which adds to the tranquility that the Temple of Heaven Park boasts. After experiencing the tranquility of the Temple of Heave, you will move next to Chinaâs most famous landmark, the Great Wall. You will embark on a journey to the Mutianyu section of the wall, a peaceful area that draws fewer crowds of people than the main Badaling section. A cable car to the first viewing section of the Great Wall is available as an alternative to the 30-minute hike, but whichever route you take, the stunning scenery of the wall and its surrounding areas will consume you. Famous for the 23 watchtowers that dot its pathway, the Mutianyu section worked to protect Beijing and its imperial tombs, hence its large number of watchtowers. A beautiful assortment of pine trees and an abundance of vegetation either side of the wall make up the surrounding area, while the brickwork of the Great Wall spirals its way over the mountain peaks to serve as the perfect area to experience this wonder of the world."

This monstrous river stretches almost 4,000 miles and possesses impressive features on each of its twists and turns. Pulling back the curtains will treat your eyes to surroundings very different to what you have previously experienced in hotel rooms as the morning sun kisses serenely tree-topped mountains amid the sound of water gliding the outer edges of the vessel you vacate. Watch on as local fishermen and women use fascinatingly traditional methods to source the fish that swim beneath the riverâs surface.

      "title": "Yangtze River Cruise â Three Gorges and Shennong Stream",
      "description": "Continue your exploration of the Yangtze River today beginning with two of the stunning renowned Three Gorges. Be taken aback by the Qutang Gorge which is widely regarded as the most beautiful out of the three areas. Head down river as mountains on either side of you begin to get closer to the clouds, an enchanting mist swirls, and the narrow waters of the Yangtze move faster to create a perfect balance of tranquility and thrill. Admire a number of mesmerizing scenic spots including the Chalk Wall, a wall inscribed with words from a range of periods in ancient time that date back to the Song Dynasty. Stretching almost 2,000 yards and featuring thousands of words from different periods in Chinese history it is a sight to behold in its pleasant surroundings. Making your way toward the Wu Gorge ignites a feeling of pure enchantment as peaks of different shapes and sizes are eclipsed by a profusion of hovering mist, like a watchful emperor overlooking his hallowed territory. This part of the Yangtze paints a picture befitting that of a magical book cover or film poster and nowhere else possesses that magic as much as the Twelve Peaks. These peaks are each named after the myth that twelve evil dragons inflicted destructive weather upon the Wu Gorge, and so goes the story that after a young girl had killed the dragons, they transformed into mountains. Over the years, the elements have created the aforementioned unique shapes and sizes that this area of the Yangtze holds to make up its fairytale presence. This afternoon you will step off of your luxury ship and step aboard a small wooden boat as you embrace the pure tranquility of the Shennong Stream. You will be entranced by the power of nature as locals steer and guide you down river. The slow repetitions of the ores breaching the surface of the water take you toward serrated cliffs and peaks, where local wildlife thrives. You will be taken aback by coffins suspended over the edges of the cliff that date back over 2,000 years. Ancient locals placed the dead in these hanging coffins and they are a truly wondrous sight to see as you take in the sights of the Shennong Stream. Disembark from your small wooden boat and step aboard ship once again, to enjoy the brilliant onboard entertainment and services."

      "description": "From yesterdayâs tranquility of the Shennong Stream to the human-made force that is the Three Gorges Dam, it is more than likely that you have heard of this dam, if not for its humanitarian, environmental and economic controversy, then for its status as the largest dam in the world. The Three Gorges Dam consists of the dam itself, a navigation facility, and a number of hydropower stations. It stands at a whopping 607 feet while stretching almost 3,500 yards wide. Despite the controversy of the structure, its efficiency in flood control is unparalleled, while its power generation and navigation capabilities are astounding. Witnessing the Three Gorges Dam is an overwhelming experience due to its sheer size, but as you explore more of this human-made structure, you will begin to appreciate the architectural masterpiece that it is before transferring to your final leg of your tour, Shanghai."
