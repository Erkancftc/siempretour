      "title": "Ho Chi Minh City - Arrive in Ho Chi Minh City, the Commercial Capital of Vietnam",
      "description": "Welcome to the vivacious commercial capital of Vietnam. Ho Chi Minh City is a remarkable collection of modern luxury and historic culture, from the glittery skyline to the banks of the Saigon River. You can see Bitexco Tower rising over 796 feet tall and offering a 360-degree view of the entire city. Your private transfer meets you at the airport and takes you to your hotel where you can settle in. You have the option of enjoying a half-day tour of the city or the far reaches of the Cu Chi Tunnel network located in the countryside. No matter which you choose you will find exceptional history and splendor. You find the continual presence of elegant architecture that dates back to the 19th century and the French Colonial power. One of the trademark buildings that bring charm to the wide avenue in the city center is the Central Post Office. The building is located next door to the Notre Dame Cathedral. The churchâs twin steeples rise 190 feet into the air. The Central Post Office was built in the later 19th century and contains looping arches and an intricately designed marble floor. You feel like you have been transferred to central Paris until you see the large portrait of Ho Chi Minh that hangs at the far end of the building and watches over the gallery. The artistic and polished structure was designed by Gustav Eiffel and continues to be filled with opulent painted maps and antique charm."

      "description": "The day begins with the sensual aroma of fresh brewed Vietnamese coffee. Vietnam is the largest exporter of coffee in the world and the scent seems to fill the morning air.

Soon your private guide meets you at your hotel and prepares you for the coming day. Today you will explore the local markets of the city and enjoy a cooking course under the guidance of a local family and chef. Your guide takes you through the Binh Tay Market, the largest and oldest market in the city. The pathways are lined with stalls that boast spices and flowers, hats and handmade wooden toys. Eventually you come to the food district and find the colors of the produce to be almost overwhelming. The chilies burst with reds and yellows. The limes are a sensual green. The scent of ginger and mint brush the air. You pick up the necessary ingredients for your coming meal. You donât know what you will be making but you can still taste the coming delicious flavors. When you arrive at your hostâs home base you are greeted with a combination of large smiles and gracious welcomes. Your guide quickly turns chef and tells you about the local ingredients, their flavors, and what they add to the dishes you will be cooking. She slices and dices the produce. You follow her lead. Soon you begin to cook carrots and sliced chilies. The herbaceous scent of coriander surrounds you. You place the ingredients into rice paper, roll them up, fry the paper, and then enjoy the delicate flavors of your homemade spring rolls."

      "description": "You watch the skyline disappear behind the horizon as you make your way to the Mekong Delta. The river encompasses over 15,000 square miles of southwestern Vietnam. Climb aboard a sampan , a traditional flat-bottomed wooden boat. Your driver paddles through the water and you watch the riverbanks float by. Beyond the banks are endless stretches of rice paddy fields. The iconic image of Vietnam is that of the flooded plain with pockets of large grasses poking through the water. Farmers roll their pants to their knees. They wear conical hats to protect themselves from the sun as they reach down into the water and plant or harvest the rice. The early afternoon is warm. The river is calm. You find yourself at a small local restaurant situated in a little town alongside the water. You are about to taste the local specialty of elephantâs ear fish. The name comes from the look of the fish. It is lightly fried and crispy. The scales and teeth remain attached and the fishâs mouth is decorated with a flower. You find plenty of accompaniments on the table, from chilies and coriander to sliced lime and garlic. Your guide shows you how to take a piece of the juicy and flaky fish, place it in fresh rice paper, and fill it with ginger and garlic before rolling and eating it. All the flavors are present for you to create your preferred tastes within the classic local cuisine."
