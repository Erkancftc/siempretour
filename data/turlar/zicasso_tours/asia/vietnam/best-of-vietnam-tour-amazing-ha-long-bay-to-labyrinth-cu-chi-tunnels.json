The Tan Ky House dates back 200 years and is a model of an old merchant town residence, with a ceiling supported by three successively shorter beams which add a Japanese flair to the dÃ©cor. The inner courtyard allows for light and ventilation while also adding a delicate touch of nature to the home. The edge of the house that touches the river was rented to merchants.
