      "title": "Ha Long Bay - A Garden of Karst Islands",
      "description": "The oriental charm of Vietnam will dazzle you as you touch down in Hanoi, the countryâs bustling capital. Scenes of roadside stalls riddled with sizzling woks and decorated pagodas dressed in gold will dominate the views from your transfer. Your transfer will take the form of a private driver, who will convey you to the pier for an overnight cruise across Ha Long Bay. Dramatic karst islands pepper the emerald bay, and you will swoon over sea spectacles during your voyage to modest fishing villages, such as Cua Van Floating Village and Tien Ong Cave. Colorful marine creatures reside inside the cave."

      "description": "The evocative cityscape of Hue retains its old-world charm. Serving as the residence of the Nguyen Dynasty, the empirical glory days are most notably visible among the ruins and remnants of Dai Noi Citadel but still echo through the atmospheric alleys and charming town squares of the city. You will peruse the magnificent architecture that composes the citadel's skyline before gallivanting to spirited villages where Vietnamâs trademark humility shines brightest. During a visit to Bao La Village, you will be welcomed by the friendly locals before indulging in a truly authentic Vietnamese dinner prepared by chef Mrs. Nhu Huy in her home."

The winding roads pass jagged rocky outcrops that tower toward the clouds and panoramic viewpoints that showcase golden Vietnamese rice paddies. Hai Van Pass is a tour in itself that will lead you to the charming Old Quarter of Hoi An. Here, structures steeped in memories and pagodas drenched in history are just a few moments in the town that will evoke stirring emotions."

You can join the crowds and visit significant heritage sites, including the Reunification Palace and Notre Dame Cathedral. Here, the countryâs dramatic past may unravel itself.
