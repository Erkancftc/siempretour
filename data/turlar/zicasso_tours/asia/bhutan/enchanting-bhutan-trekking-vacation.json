      "title": "Paro â Enchanting First Impressions",
      "description": "First impressions play such an important role whenever you visit a new country. In Bhutan, there are almost too many first impressions to make sense of it all. The country is an overland of new sights and smiles. You will see women in their hand-sewn dresses, men walking in elegant knee-length robes, and prayer flags as they flutter in the wind. When you land, your guide will meet you at the airport and transfer you to your luxurious accommodation. Shortly after, your guide will lead you around Paro and help you feel at home in one of the planetâs most traditional countries."

      "title": "Paro â Insight Into Local History",
      "description": "A private tour of Paro will lead you on a journey through Bhutanâs history. You will begin in the seventh century at the sacred monastery of Kyichu Lhakhang. The story tells of a demon that was large enough to cover Bhutan. You will then travel forward to the 15th century to a triple-storied temple. Here, each floor hosts a different representation and mood. Drukgyal Dzong dates back to the 17th century and is a roving fortress structure that commemorates victory against Tibetan invaders. Rinpung Dzong is lively, and monks in red robes often wander across its cobbled floor. You will complete the dayâs adventure at Ta Dzong, which is a massive watchtower that now houses the National Museum."

      "title": "Thimphu â Meeting the Bhutanese",
      "description": "Bhutan proudly preserves 13 traditional arts and crafts that range from weaving cane and bamboo to crafting wooden cups and bowls. Skills and techniques are passed down at the National Institute for Zorig Chusum, which is the best place in Bhutan to explore the process of crafting tradition. This will be just one of your intriguing stops on a day in Thimphu. At the National Library, you can admire the ancient Buddhist texts. The National Memorial Chorten is Bhutanâs monument to world peace, and Tashichho Dzong impresses an ineffable spirituality on its surroundings and visitors. Thimphu is a short drive from Paro, and your guide can tailor a route that aligns with your interests."

      "title": "Trongsa â Spectacular Peaks",
      "description": "A ring of large peaks dominates the journey to Trongsa. After crossing Dochu-La Pass, you will descend to Wangdiphodrang, which is an excellent place to eat lunch. After lunch, you will cross Pele-La Pass, which is a frontier between eastern and western Bhutan. In total, you will have about six hours of driving in order to reach Trongsa, but when the vistas are so photogenic, you may want the journey to last longer. Trongsa is the ancestral seat of Bhutanâs royal family. Many visitors to Bhutan cannot quite believe that the country can be any more traditional until they cross Pele-La Pass."

      "dayNumber": "5",
      "title": "Bumthang â The Countryâs Spiritual Heartland",
      "description": "Trongsa Dzong dominates Trongsa. Dzongs are like fortified villages that encase a townâs essentials with monastic quarters, government offices, temples, and public meeting places. Trongsa Dzong is the largest and arguably the most spectacular of them all. The entire area around Trongsa is known as Bhutanâs spiritual heartland, and it is hard not to be moved by the sites today. You will begin at Trongsa Dzong before continuing to the Bumthang Valley, where monasteries speak of past mysteries, and a lake burns with the legend of old Buddhist scriptures. Kyichu Lhakhang is another essential stop; it is a temple that elegantly reveals 1,400 years of history."

      "title": "Bumthang Valley â Trekking Adventure",
      "description": "Over these three days, you will trek alongside trout-filled rivers and follow ancient trails through this cultural heartland. The trekking here is relatively easy, and you can have up to five hours of hiking each day. It is not quite a journey into the wilderness, but it will undoubtedly feel like an adventure as you walk between villages that are not connected by roads. On the first day, you will hike to Ngang Lhakhang after trekking across the Chamkhar River and swathes of blue pine. The next day, you will ascend through thick juniper forest to the trailâs highpoint, which is the 3,340-meter Phephe-La Pass. Your final day of trekking will lead you to one of Bhutanâs ultimate highlights: the Burning Lake."

      "title": "Punakha â Cultural Encounters",
      "description": "The journey back to Western Bhutan is imbued with relics. Jambay Lhakhang, which is a 7th-century monastery that could act as the postcard-perfect image of Bhutan, will capture your attention with its whitewashed walls. Green mountain valleys will provide your backdrop while the deep red robes of monks flicker in the foreground. In contrast, you must enter Tamshing Lhakhang to appreciate its treasures. After arriving in Punakha, you will have time to explore and decide which dzong is the most impressive before spending the evening walking through the town at your own pace. Throughout this guided tour, most of the evenings will be free for you to spend however you see fit."

      "title": "Paro â Final Impressions of Bhutan",
      "description": "You will have a relaxing three-hour drive back to Paro this morning. This is a necessary journey because Paro is home to Bhutanâs only international airport. You may choose to stop in Thimphu, which can be a great option if you are keen on bringing back local souvenirs. Eventually, you will arrive in Paro for lunch, and the afternoon will be left free. You can enjoy a final meal with your guide and driver in the evening before your last chance to stroll around the evening market."
