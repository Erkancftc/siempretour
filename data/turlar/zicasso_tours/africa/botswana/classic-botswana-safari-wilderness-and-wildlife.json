      "description": "On safari, you will quickly adapt to a different pace of life. Following the example of the big cats, you will rise before the sun for a morning game drive and then break for a siesta in the heat of the day until late afternoon. After your break, you will go on another game drive. The Moremi encompasses many ecosystems, from open savanna and winding waterways to dense forests that support a variety of animal and bird species. You will be looking for a variety of game that roams the plains game, such as impalas, kudus, buffalos, wildebeest, zebras, and elephants. Not far away will be lions, leopards, wild dogs, and other predators."

Today, you will take to the waterways and explore the channels and lagoons by boat in search of some of Botswanaâs 550 bird species, including the Malachite Kingfisher and the Fish Eagle. Your amazing guides will have countless stories to tell and an uncanny ability to find a lion snoozing in the tall grass or a leopard perched in a tree."

The Savuti is defined by savannah and rocky outcrops that border the Savuti Marsh and the Savuti Channel. Where crocodiles resided in years past when the channel was running, wild dogs can now be found prowling in the dry riverbed. You can share tales of the dayâs sightings with other guests at camp around a bonfire in the evening and fall asleep to the sounds of the wild."
