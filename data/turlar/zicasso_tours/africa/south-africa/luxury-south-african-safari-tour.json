      "title": "Kruger National Park - Arrive in South Africa",
      "description": "Today your plane will descend into the city of Johannesburg, arriving at O.R. Tambo International Airport. You will stay only briefly here, before connecting onwards to a flight that will carry you northeast to the edge of the world-famous Kruger National Park. You will land on a private bush airstrip in the heart of the Sabi Sands Private Game Reserve, which boasts some of the most prolific and exclusive wildlife viewing opportunities on the continent. An open-air safari vehicle will await you on the landing strip, transferring you to your nearby lodge. Located on the banks of the Sabi River amidst enormous boulders, this lodge spares no comfort or luxury in its remote location. Wander along the boardwalks that surround this magnificent stone lodge with a fresh fruit drink in hand, before being escorted to your private cottage. Cottages are each uniquely decorated with the surrounding environment in mind. Muted colors and textured fabrics create a sense of unity with the landscape, while open spaces and panoramic views thrust you into the heart of the bush from the comfort of your plush bed and crisp linens. Drift away into this oasis for a few hours before wandering to the main lodge for a scrumptious meal and high tea. Then, head out for an afternoon game drive."

      "title": "Kruger National Park - Safari in the Sabi Sands",
      "description": "The Sabi Sands Game Reserve shares an unfenced border with Kruger National Park, creating unrivalled wildlife viewing opportunities. The exclusivity of the reserve ensures that all wildlife viewings over the course of the day will occur with near exclusivity. One of South Africaâs best rangers will lead through the dirt roads of this pristine wilderness, searching together for members of the continentâs Big Five. The rangerâs expertise will often lead you quickly to a herd of enormous elephants or grazing giraffe. Moving onwards, you will likely have the opportunity to marvel at the power of a lion or an unending herd of buffalo. Rhino, cheetah, leopard and wild dog are among the more difficult and coveted sightings, with a number of guests viewing at least some of these magical species. You will explore the bush with the sun, embarking on both an early morning and late afternoon game drive. Pause during the sunrise and sunset for coffee and cocktails respectively, soaking in the serenity of this remarkable landscape. Listen for birdcalls and learn about the habits of insects in order to broaden the experience beyond the large mammals. Return to the lodge in the late evening following a nighttime safari, where you will have the chance to marvel at the impossibly starry night sky and its innumerable constellations. You will be ushered back into the lodge with a cocktail, a warm hand towel and a bath in your cottage prior to dinner. With dinner, the adventure continues as you embark on a culinary adventure paired with wines from your lodge's prized collection. The delicacy and intricacy of the meals created in this remote location are arguably just as impressive as the wildlife itself."

      "description": "You will again rise early this morning in order to fit in a final morning game drive throughout Sabi Sands. Spend a few final hours searching for a leopard or rhino before pausing for coffee and biscuits beside the vehicle. Return to Boulders for breakfast before driving to the airstrip for a flight to Madikwe Game Reserve, via Johannesburg. Madikwe is located in northern South Africa, near the Botswana border. Famed for being a malaria-free safari destination, the landscapes here are dramatically different from that of Sabi Sands. The exclusivity, glamour and magic of the destination are however maintained at the same unimaginable level. You will drive through the forests of ancient Tamboti trees to arrive at your lodge. This property is again tucked between boulders, creating a sense of magic and romance. Here you will stay in an expansive cottage complete with a private swimming pool, a fireplace and in-floor heating for chilly evenings. Spend the afternoon gazing out over the plains from your private deck, or perhaps, from your stunning outdoor shower. There will likely be time for an afternoon safari prior to dinner, for those excited to explore this new landscape."

      "title": "Madikwe Game Reserve - Exploring the Enchanting Landscapes",
      "description": "Again, you will rise early in order to explore the bush while it is at its most active. Fueled with coffee and biscuits, you will work with your ranger and tracker to navigate through the Tamboti trees out onto the plains and past watering holes. Madikwe is also a Big Five destination, enabling you to resume your search for special sightings. Enjoy a delightful bush tea as the sun climbs high in the sky before making your way back to the lodge for an afternoon of relaxation. Following another rejuvenating afternoon beside your private plunge pool, you will set out once more for a late afternoon game drive. This afternoon, you may wish to take advantage of your rangerâs superior photography skills, learning a few tips and tricks for capturing that perfect picture of an elephant or leopard. Others may enjoy spending time examining the ecology of the reserve, learning about the smaller creatures and plant life essential to the ecosystem. Your ranger will inevitably have a broad range of knowledge about the region and taking time to ask questions and learn about your surroundings is always a highlight of the trip. A lucky few may have the opportunity to witness lions feasting on a recent kill, or a leopardess with her new cubs on a night drive. Others may prefer to search for the rare nocturnal species. No matter how you spend the day, you will again be welcomed back to the lodge with sherry, a warm bath and yet another remarkable meal."

      "title": "Madikwe - Final Morning Game Drive",
      "description": "This morning you will be awoken by your final wakeup call, ensuring you leave just enough time for one last game drive through the bush. Following a now familiar routine of coffee and biscuits, you will depart with your ranger to seek out a few final wildlife encounters before carrying onwards to the dazzling city of Cape Town. Flying via Johannesburg, you will touch down beside Table Mountain and be transferred to a luxury hotel on the Victoria & Alfred Waterfront. Your hotel perfectly fuses modern luxury with traditional Cape culture with stunning views of the working harbor. Custom designed suites display the multifaceted nature of Cape Town, while the hotelâs restaurant profiles the cityâs love affair with fantastic cuisine and wine. Spend what remains of the afternoon enjoying the shops and restaurants that stipple the V&A Waterfront as you carefully select souvenirs and gifts that encapsulate your adventure."

      "title": "Cape Town - Cape Townâs Most Famous Sights",
      "description": "Your time in Cape Town will be spent entirely at your leisure. Many visitors prefer to take advantage of a guided tour of the city and it surroundings, which we will gladly organize for you. What follows are mere suggestions for how you may wish to spend the following two days in the city. Often, one of the most pleasant ways to adjust to the rhythm of Cape Town is to depart on a full day private tour of the surrounding region. On these tours, a driver will pick you up after breakfast at your hotel and depart along the Atlantic Seaboard that leads you out of the city center. As you circle beneath Lionâs Head, you emerge into the picturesque Cape Town suburbs, which lie in the shadow of the 12 Apostles mountain range. Weave around surfer-filled beaches and snake along thrilling cliffside highways, pausing frequently for photo opportunities. Consider detouring to the World of Birds or the Botanical Gardens if you are interested in witnessing some of the rare flora and fauna that used to exist in the region. Alternatively, consider taking a tour of a Cape Town township for a broader understanding of the cityâs dynamics. The climax of the tour occurs as you drive through Table Mountain National Park towards the Cape of Good Hope, eventually climbing to the lighthouse perched on Africaâs most southeasterly point. The views of this truly unique landscape are â quite simply â indescribable. A visit is well worth your while. Return to the city by way of the penguin-filled Boulders Beach, pausing for a possible cocktail as penguins frolic in the waves beneath you before driving back to the V&A Waterfront for the night."

      "title": "Cape Town - Venture Into the Cape Vineyards",
      "description": "For many, a visit to South Africa is incomplete without a day filled with wine tasting. Wine aficionados will undoubtedly enjoy a day spent traveling through the Cape Winelands, exploring the countless vineyards that brought this region to international fame. Food enthusiasts will also be delighted with a tour in the area, given that the region houses the majority of the country and continentâs best-ranked restaurants. We will gladly organize lunch reservations at one of our favorite restaurants to complete this day of culinary indulgence. Others however may prefer to spend their final day wandering the streets of Cape Town, perusing the many local designer and antique shops. Fitness enthusiasts will certainly enjoy climbing to the peak of Table Mountain or Lionâs Head. From the peak of either mountain, hikers (or cable-car passengers) are able to take in one of the best views of the city, which sparkles as it abuts the glittering Atlantic Ocean. With Robben Island in the distance and fynbos vegetation surrounding you, there are few more classic Capetonian experiences available. Descend from the peak to explore the trendy neighborhood of Campâs Bay, a perfect place for a sundowner and a few tasty treats. Return to the V&A Waterfront and consider sampling the cityâs best cuisine at one of the many fine restaurants here. This city caters to nearly all interests and desires; the challenge is always selecting exactly how you will round off this perfect African experience."

      "description": "This morning you will have time to enjoy a final breakfast looking out over the Victoria and Alfred Waterfront before departing Cape Town. You will return to Johannesburg by air, arriving at the airport in time to connect on with your international flight home. If, however, you wish to extend your stay in South Africa by a few more days, we will be happy to work with you to prolong the magic. Many clients opt to spend a few nights in the vineyards themselves, exploring the magical towns of Stellenbosch and Franschoek. Others prefer to venture towards the coastline outside Cape Town, indulging in a few tranquil days in the town of Hermanus."
