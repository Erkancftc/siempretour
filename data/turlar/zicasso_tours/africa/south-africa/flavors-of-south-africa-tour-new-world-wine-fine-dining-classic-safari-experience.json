      "title": "Cape Town - Victoria and Alfred Waterfront",
      "description": "This African adventure begins at Cape Townâs Victoria and Alfred Waterfront. The active harbor is the hub for tourism in this world famous city, and your chic hotel is located on the edge of it all. Having arrived in the city around midday, you will have the afternoon to leisurely adjust to the time change and pace of life. Browsing the varied boutiques and harbor side cafes while local South African marimba bands play lively songs behind you is one of the most perfect welcomes to the continent. There are countless restaurants to choose between within this area, serving anything from fresh fish and chips to high-end Japanese fare. Some may prefer to wander, browsing menus as you go while others may prefer to make a reservation through the concierge. No matter your approach, be sure to factor in a drink at your hotel lobby, in order to sample your first South African wine from their vast cellar."

      "title": "Cape Town - Tour of the Cape Peninsula and the City Center",
      "description": "While your time in Cape Town is entirely yours to design, we often recommend spending your first day in the city on a private guided tour of the Cape Peninsula. Beginning after breakfast, this tour carries you along the Atlantic seaboard to Cape Townâs smaller harbors. A dramatic and exhilarating scenic highway weaves along the jagged cliffs of the Twelve Apostles, slowly carrying you towards the Cape of Good Hope. There are a number of opportunities throughout this morning drive to pause at various highlights, including Camps Bay, Hout Bay and Clifton. Dip your toes in the Atlantic Ocean before climbing up to the lighthouse at the Cape Point where the Atlantic and Indian Oceans swirl together against a magnificent backdrop. Keep your eyes open for wandering ostrich, mountain zebra and eland amidst the endemic fynbos flora, before carrying on for a visit with the African penguins at Boulders Beach. Todayâs tour has a number of detours available, depending on your particular interests. Ornithologists will likely love a visit to World of Birds where you can walk through a series of aviaries filled with unique and endangered species. Others may prefer a quick ocean adventure to visit a colony of Cape Fur seals on a rocky outcropping off the coast. We often recommend a trip to Kirstenbosch for everyone; a stroll through these expansive botanical gardens is nothing short of magical. While it takes days to circumnavigate the entire jungle of ancient and endemic gardens, a few hours is enough to inspire a curiosity in local botany."

      "title": "Constantia - Timeless Vineyards",
      "description": "All of today will be spent casually exploring the nine vineyards that comprise the Constantia Valley Wine Route. This wine route is the oldest in the southern hemisphere, with some estates dating back as late as 1685. The Groot Constantia vineyard specifically has been a favorite of authors, royalty and explorers for over three centuries, with Napoleon Bonaparte listing the Grand Constance as his favorite wine in the early 1800s. This vineyard has also preserved the original manor house and Cloete wine cellar, which are currently managed by the Iziko Museums of South Africa. A tour through these historic buildings will shed further light on the centuries of people who have savored these very wines. Each of the nine vineyards produces only premium wines, with a number of award-winning bottles scattered throughout. Knowledgeable and charismatic staff will lead you on a journey through whites, reds and dessert wines, highlighting subtle flavors and strategic differences with every glass. With each vineyard more beautiful than the last, today will be nothing short of dreamy. Whether you opt to visit three or nine vineyards, the pace and pattern will be entirely yours to design.

      "title": "Thornybush Private Game Reserve - Embark on a Full Day of Safari",
      "description": "Early this morning, your ranger will give your cottage a wakeup call before the sun begins to rise. Shortly thereafter, a guard will escort you along the boardwalks to the main lodge where hot coffee, fruit, and yogurt await. Fueled with a light snack, you will set out into the bush as the sun rises, observing the wildlifeâs early morning routines. Zebra, impala and kudu can be seen grazing on the dew-soaked grass, while vibrant birdlife soars above. Traverse the dusty tracks in your open-air vehicle, wrapped in a fleece blanket for a bit of extra warmth. Your ranger and tracker will work together over the coming days to search for the regionâs impressive wildlife, providing you with a number of intimate and unforgettable encounters. Your movements and schedule over the coming days will be unpredictable, and based off the tracks they follow in the sand. You will return to the lodge in the mid-morning for a full breakfast served overlooking the watering hole. Resident nyala will likely cruise, while vervet monkeys hover in the trees above in anticipation of a snack. The remainder of the morning and afternoon will be spent entirely at your leisure, until you are eventually called back for the afternoon game drive. The search for elusive leopards and endangered rhinoceros will resume as you explore the bush under the afternoon sky. In addition to using your eyes and cameras, be sure to listen for the roar of the lion and try to smell the scent of an elephant or buffalo. Your ranger may even teach you a few basics of tracking, adding greater depth to the entire experience. As the sun dips near the horizon, pause on an open field for a gin and tonic and a few light snacks. Watch as the sky transforms above you, progressing through a multitude of colors before stars emerge above. Slowly you will make your way back to the lodge while observing changes in the nocturnal world. You will be welcomed back into the lodge with sherry, a warm towel, and another spectacular meal."

      "description": "Today will follow yesterdayâs rhythm of early morning and late afternoon game drives, interspersed with sensational meals and deep relaxation. Today you may see anything from lions feasting on a recent kill to leopard cubs frolicking in the bush. Or, you may prefer to focus on the smaller elements of the bush, embarking on a guided walking safari through the grass. However, be sure to fully indulge between adventures in the bush at the lodgeâs famed spa. Treat yourself to a deep massage or a manicure, along with a sauna or Jacuzzi following. If less inclined towards a full treatment, be sure to at least visit this magical sanctuary in the bush to sip on a healthy fruit juice beside the massive pool. Meals will be a highlight of your stay in the bush as you work your way through a number of multi-coursed themed meals. An extensive six-course tasting menu, complete with some of South Africaâs finest cheeses, will feature the full range of the chefâs capabilities. A classic evening braai (African barbeque) will provide you with the chance to experience some classically South African culture, as you sample a perfectly grilled impala loin alongside a roasted rack of lamb. Those with a sweet tooth will delight at a berry-filled soufflÃ© or a creamy cheese cake, before sleepily retiring to a bed warmed with a hot water bottle. Coupled with a day of rich and awe-inspiring game viewing, today will conclude the perfect retreat."
