You make your way from Denarau Island to Nadi Town, a short drive but entirely different in culture and vivacity. The sparkling water is replaced with bordering foliage sweeping upwards over the Sabeto Mountains. The town bustles at the morning market where fruits and vegetables shimmer like pieces of gemstones. Local artisan shops offer handcrafted objects, carved and shaped by locals, from large statues to elegant earrings. The Sri Siva Subramaniya Swami Temple sits at the base of the Main Street passed the bustling shops of the town center. The temple was constructed in the 1920s and rebuilt in the 1980s. It is the largest Hindu temple outside of India. The colorful exterior matches the rainbow quality of coral reefs, almost competing with the opulent pigments. Wooden carvings of Hindu deities decorate the faÃ§ade. An iconic mural adorns the walls and ceiling. There is an impeccable sense of spirit to the grounds, along with a romantic ambiance characterized in the dedicated artwork around the temple."

      "description": "The sun rises over the eastern edge of the island casting light over the azure coast and towering tropical canopy. After breakfast, you step onto a sailboat to cruise around the archipelago, visiting uninhabited islands, and breathtaking natural scenery. When the boat leaves the marina, the gentle wading of the Pacific carries you away from the shore. You take a morning tea and wrap your hands around the hot cup in the breezy morning. The golden sand beaches you pass are inviting. Mountains slope elegantly upwards from the coastline into conical forest-clad peaks. The 83-foot schooner takes you alongside Modriki Island, famous for being the island depicted in Castaway with Tom Hanks. You step ashore on the isle of Yanuya. A local village greets you with a traditional Kava welcome ceremony. The island is home to approximately 500 people. The scent of coconut, seawater, and straw emanate from the village. The captain offers the village chief a gift out of respect. The chief invites you into the village where you sit on a straw mat and follow tradition. A coconut cup holds the drink made from the root of a pepper plant. The chief dips the coconut cup into a mahogany bowl and passes the cup clockwise. You give a firm clap, sip the kava, clap again three times, and pass the cup back to the chief. The chief smiles warmly, and you continue into the village for an in-depth view of local Fijian life on an island in the archipelagoâs outer rim."

      "description": "After breakfast, the day is yours it enjoy in exceptional leisure. Sit beneath an umbrella on the island shores and dig your toes into the sand. You can see people windsurfing off of the coast. The parachute catches the breeze and lifts the surfer and the board out of the water for seconds at a time. Adventurers twist in the air, some even performing flips before splashing back down into the water. Amateurs enjoy the flying sensation, soaring off of a small wave and touching back down feet away from their original spot. The breeze brings the aroma of fresh coconut milk. You can watch one of the locals carve open the top with a machete, passing the coconut around for everyone to try. The creamy texture has a slightly sweet fragrance and flavor. Medicinal plants line the trail off of the main walkway through the island. When you lounge near the water, you can feel the hot sun on your shoulders and the refreshing water rushing against your toes. Your partner relaxes with you, whether under a cabana poolside, in the sand beachside, or strolling through the medical herb garden for another look into the traditions of island life."

      "description": "The Garden Island is paradise incarnate, filled with lush tropical trees and vibrant Tagimaucia flowers in bloom. The flower can grow to almost 12 inches long and is represented on the Fijian $50 note. The flowerâs legend is steeped in love and passion, which calls to the petalâs beauty with gorgeous red exterior and pure white interior. Around Tagimaucia Lake, at an altitude of 2,715 feet above sea level, the rare flowers add exceptional color to the greenery and float atop the crater lake. You can hike to the top of the summit and watch the petals cruise across the water. The air is cool at the mountaintop but when the sun pierces the canopy you can feel its close heat. In the morning, a mist lingers around the trees providing moisture to the forest underbrush. A nearby waterfall trundles into a natural pool thundering through the trees. Mountains surround the tranquil lake providing ample time to embrace the secluded waters and the romantic moment."

      "description": "Des Voeux Peak rises 3,943 feet above sea level and is the second highest mountain on the island. On a clear day, the peak casts shadows over the shoreline housing numerous birdlife, such as Silktails and Orange-breasted Doves. Instead of the height of the mountaintops you meet your guide to venture into the depths of the South Pacific. You don the SCUBA gear and splash into the exception water. The clarity of the azure ocean fills with the titillating hues of the Rainbow Reef. With just under 1,200 species of fish and more than 230 types of hard and soft corals, the reef is an entirely different subaquatic world. The Pacific wake is gentle, allowing you to float effortlessly. U.S. Divers Magazine has rated Rainbow Reef as one of the top 10 places in the world to dive. White-topped reef sharks circle around the coral and orange basslets swarm in schools near the calcite hills. You and your partner have the eccentric colors to yourselves, watching the ecosystem react in a natural, pure way."

After breakfast, you leave behind the soft sands of your hotel for the thunderous waters around Bouma National Heritage Park. The national park inhabits around 80 percent of the islandâs total area, including both coastal and rainforest. The air is thick, rich with moisture. You can hear the falls in the distance trundling between the trees. Wildflowers provide a soothing fragrance around the freshwater pools. Tavoro Falls stands almost 80 feet tall, situated near a picnic area where the aroma of fresh barbecue settles beneath the canopy. The pool ripples and people jump in letting the cold mountain water rejuvenate them. Hiking trails wind around the national park, meandering by two more waterfalls, a local village, and historic island ruins carved into captivating boulders. The romance of the island is as prominent in the water as in the trees."
