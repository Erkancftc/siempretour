      "description": "The Fijian island of Viti Levu is the largest of the tropical archipelago. Coconut palms fringe the white sand beaches along the Coral Coast. The South Pacific Sea shimmers with crystal clear turquoise waters. The jungle canopy shades the heart of the island, giving a perfect tropical ambiance for orchids and the tubular white flowers of Tahitian gardenias. The underbrush produces yellow and green fruit utilized for its sweet fragrance and medicinal properties. The red and yellow bulbs of heliconia resemble flames as the flowers blossom on stems growing up to three feet tall. The red-throated lorikeet twitters in the trees and the bottlenose dolphins swim in view of the shoreline. Your flight lands at Nadi International Airport, where your private transfer greets you upon your arrival. Take some time to visit the central market that brims with vibrant tropical hues emanating from guavas, melons, limes, and passion fruits. The aromas of banana and oranges drift beneath the lofted ceiling. Boys roll through the marketplace and along the streets of the town with barrels filled with cassava melons bound for restaurants, homes, and shops around the city. Chili peppers shimmer with red luster and large taro roots offer more than just a meal. Your private transfer escorts you to your resort surrounded by lush tropical gardens and views of the small islands trailing away from Viti Levu. The concierge greets you with a traditional welcoming ceremony, during which you leave your shoes away from a large mat, and sip kava, a drink made from ground taro root."

The scent of hibiscus sweeps across the village landscape. Houses were erected to embody the traditional architecture of the island, containing restaurants, boutique shops, and a theater. The jovial ambiance is intoxicating and inviting. You can hear the sounds of the meke , a traditional song, and dance being performed. The dancers use the movements to tell a story, often an island folktale. When the drums and rhythm stop the broad male dancers in woven grass sulu raise their spears for the traditional war dance. The men beat their bodies and clap their legs to keep the beat as they puff out their chests. Continue to the rippling landscape of the Sigatoka Sand Dunes, a protected area peppered with sandy monoliths overlooking the shoreline. The windblown dunes reach nearly three miles long and more than half a mile wide, with the average dune rising to a height of 65 feet above sea level."

The semi-sweet aroma of the saltwater fills the air. Droplets of sea spray land on your skin as you watch the shoreline fade behind the horizon. You will stop at three different spots to view the biodiversity of the more than 1,400 miles of reef. The boat weighs anchor against a floating platform. You jump into the water with fins, a mask, and snorkel, eager to view the blossoming aquatic gardens below. The water is warm as it wraps around your body. The salt content helps you float along the surface. Sea fans rustle in the current, waving like trees in the wind. Pillar coral ascends above plates and rounded mounds glowing with rainbow hues. Soft coral known as sunset cups have tendrils that move with the ebb and flow of the water. The body of the coral shimmers orange and yellow, which resembles the sunset. You follow a glint of orange peeking from within the purple forest of the tendrils of a sea anemone to find hiding clownfish hiding."
