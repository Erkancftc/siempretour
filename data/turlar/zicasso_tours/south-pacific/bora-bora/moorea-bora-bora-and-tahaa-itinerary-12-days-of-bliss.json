      "description": "The lush palms and tall grasses of Papeete shimmer with emerald hues as your flight descends into the airport. The Pacific Ocean shimmers with iridescent indigo colors, as thatched-roof huts rise out of the jetties along the marina. Boat masts wade in the gentle waters as the palm trees rustle in the calm breeze. Your flight arrives at Faaâa International Airport. Colorful impressionist works by famous French painter Gauguin decorate the airy galleries in the eponymous museum. Dramatic wooden Tikis rise out of the lavish gardens and entertain visitors with ancient myths and tales warning people not to move the unforgettable carved artworks. The aroma of sweet salt water permeates the air. The bustling life of the Papeete Market creates a swirl of color emanating from handmade sarongs and shell necklaces, woven hats, and the array of produce picked from the trees and bushes around the countryside. The sweet, juicy aroma of coconuts and pineapples drifts beneath the banisters, leading locals to the aisles of fishmongers and butchers. Pearl shops line the lanes of the upstairs and caves offer rich espressos and vivacious, citrusy smoothies. Your private transfer greets you at customs and escorts you to a secluded resort, offering you the romance of a private view of the lapping water and the charm of slow-paced island life blending the essential cultures of the islands of French Polynesia."

At breakfast, you find the enticing, seductive aromas of frothy cappuccino and young coconut. You sip a freshly squeezed passion fruit juice and smell the scent of banana pancakes adding to the tropical ambiance of the morning air. Your guide greets you after breakfast, eager to lead you on a full-day 4x4 tour. The vibrant life of Papeete returns in the municipal market. The scent of vanilla bean accentuates the tropical colors of the sarongs. You travel into the heart of the island of Tahiti in an open-air jeep, allowing the refreshing breeze to brush against your cheeks. The island was formed over a million years ago by volcanic activity around the Pacific. The ferns and underbrush glisten with emerald hues. Children in villages wave as you pass. The jungle vegetation becomes denser. The sporadic villages disappear behind the dangling branches and soaring jungle canopy. The jeep crosses over a wooden bridge. The sound of the meandering river rushes around the pillars. Clouds pass the verdant mountain summits framing the valley. You stop along the riverbanks located higher up the mountainside and dip your toes into the cold water fed by the rain sweeping down the slopes before arriving at Puraha Waterfall."

The aroma of the sea fades beneath the scent of fresh crepes, connecting the island life with French colonial culture. The scenery resembles an exotic, lush garden from the breadfruit, oranges, pineapple, and coconuts growing in the trees to the adorning roadside markets filled with dried fruits and homemade jams. After breakfast, you make your way to the Moorea Dolphin Center. A retired navy officer started the facility with three bottlenose dolphins and a team of veterinarians and animal behaviorists. Locals and visitors from around the world have become educated on the ecology, environment, and interaction between dolphins through the centerâs more than 20 years of research. The conservationist approach to the dolphins allows you to view the majestic animals up close without interfering with their lifestyle in the water. The dolphins are playful and intelligent. They can grow to more than 13 feet in length and have a sleek, sliver sheen. After visiting with the captivating dolphins, you continue to the Maison Blanche, an early 20th-century mansion depicting life for the aristocracy on the islands during the vanilla boom."

The roads are empty along the water, allowing you to embrace the stunning views of the indigo colors leading to the sapphire water along the horizon. The palm trees rustle in the refreshing wind. The scent of coconut pervades the briny ocean air. Fruit vendors along the road offer full papayas and pineapples. They offer to open the fruits for patrons or drain the delicious, sweet juice into ice for a flavored snow cone. The aroma of banana bread emanates from the small roadside bakery. Mangoes dangle from the trees, and you can take some time to relax beneath the shade of the coconut palms while enjoying the view of a hidden lagoon."
