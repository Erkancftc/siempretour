      "title": "Bora Bora â Pleasures of French Polynesia",
      "description": "Bora Bora is an island built like a dreamscape. Proud peaks protrude from the jungle terrain with a solid, sheer rock. The vibrant colors of indigo, sapphire, and turquoise emanate from the South Pacific Sea and the serene lagoon. Rainforest sweeps across the undulating basalt landscape. Coconut palm trees rustle in the breeze along the coastline, and mango trees thrive in the tropical warmth. Fruit stands on circular roads throughout the island display fresh papayas and pineapples beside bread stands offering delicious banana bread. Your flight lands at Bora Bora Airport where your private transfer greets you upon your arrival. You make your way across the lagoon for your first view of the white sand beaches and indigo waters up close. The sea splashes over the boat, providing a mist to the cool breeze. You settle into the comforts of your private overwater bungalow, an iconic accommodation for those visiting French Polynesia. Palm trees shade the luxury pool, and you can hear the sea lapping against the wooden posts of your secluded suite offering views of the mountains to the west and the ocean to the east. Take the time to visit the main town of Vaitape at your preferred pace. The largest town on the island offers a bustling pace compared to the surrounding villages and pristine landscape. The water seems to brush against the shoreline at a slower, more relaxed pace. The market brims with bright produce, from bananas to coconuts, pineapples to lychees. Pearl vendors showcase their precious stones on the upper floor, highlighting how the natural light glints off the polished black or white surface."

      "description": "At breakfast, you find the vibrant aromas of tropical fruits accentuating the frothy texture and invigorating flavor of your freshly made cappuccino. Schools of fish swim around the posts of your overwater bungalow in the crystal clear, indigo water. After the meal, you meet your guide, who is eager to begin your adventurous exploration across the island terrain. You travel by boat from the shores of the lagoon to the mainland to board your open-air 4x4 jeep. Venture onto the rugged trails leading into the inland rainforest. The trees block the peak of Mt. Otemanu. You can hear rivers rushing along the forest floor. The cold water splashes onto your skin as the jeep drives through a creek bed. Your guide explains that mango trees mean a village is nearby before pointing out plants used by locals for medicinal purposes over the course of millennia. You pass the occasional village where women hand-dye their sarongs with vibrant, tropical colors. A Stephenâs lorikeet twitters in the trees. The jeep stops and your guide points into the canopy at a blue lorikeet, known for their dark blue plumage and opulent white chest. Their orange legs and beaks contrast their colorful feathers. They feed on coconut palm trees and seeds in the area. You reach the upper shoulder of Mount Otemanu, which supports the sheer basalt promontory reaching heights of nearly 2,400 feet above sea level. You have an elaborate panorama of the sea's innumerable shades of blue as a backdrop to the verdant rainforest of Bora Bora."

      "description": "Bora Bora is famous for its incredible snorkeling spots around the island. The colorful reefs fringe the shallow waters with garden-like beauty along the shoreline. At breakfast, you delight in the aroma of fresh espresso and the sensational hues of the juicy pineapple and creamy banana. Your guide greets you at the hotel on a private boat bound for the islandâs most celebrated snorkeling destinations. The reefs secure the lagoonâs safety by protecting the island from waves and large movements of the water. Your guide explains the importance of the reef to the islandâs eco-system before weighing the anchor away from the white sandy shores. You dive into the water with your snorkeling gear, keen on exploring the variety of marine life. The sea maintains a cool, refreshing temperature. The crystal clear water provides views up to 20 feet away. The sunlight can pierce the surface to depths of 200 feet. The coral garden is much more shallow, nearly touching the surface of the water. You pass brain cactus coral forming shapes that resemble calcite mounds. Parrotfish glow neon pink, yellow, and blue. Clownfish hide in the tendrils of purple sea anemones. You continue to your second destination, jump into the water, and find blacktip reef sharks swimming beside schools of angelfish. The sharks can grow longer than five feet long and carry a noble, dramatic aura in the way they swim. Manta rays swim close to the moored boat in search of food. They flap their giant wings in the water as if flying through the gentle current."

      "description": "The morning light washes over the crystal clear water. The silver basalt rock at the summit of Mount Otemanu shimmers above the emerald jungle canopy. At breakfast, you indulge in the refreshing flavor of freshly squeezed orange juice and delectable aroma of freshly baked baguettes. You meet your private transfer in the lobby and cross the lagoon to reach a quiet beach. Your guide introduces you to the kitesurfing equipment, teaching you the important basics of the sport. The sound of the gentle lapping waves fades beneath the pounding of your heart. You are excited to learn the importance of your stance on the board and the wind direction blowing across the shore. Your instructor helps you inflate the kite to a respectable level before strapping you in. You lay the lines to make sure everything is properly connected, position your feet, and ready yourself for the launch. The water wraps around your ankles in the shallow depths of the shore. Your instructor positions the kite upwind to help you launch. The wind lifts you out of the water, and you glide over the sea, flying with grace until lowering back down and skimming over the surface. At the end of the exhilarating experience, you feel accomplished, eager to partake in a large and lavish home-cooked meal prepared during your private cooking lesson."

Teak tables and chairs decorate the open-air gallery atop the sandy floor. The aroma of coconut milk drifts from the kitchen. The colorful dish of Poisson Cru arrives at the table.
