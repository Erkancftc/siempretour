      "title": "Malaga - Enjoy Your Arrival in Malaga",
      "description": "Malaga is a classic, southern, coastal city in Spain, embodying the nickname âCosta del Solâ. Its soulful and colorful history spreads across beaches shimmering with golden sand and the history displayed in museums and art galleries exuded confidence grown from the refurbished port. Your private transfer will meet you at the airport upon your arrival and escort you to your centrally located accommodations for your first glimpse of life in the seaside city. Energetic with life, the food culture combines traditional fishersâ shacks with Michelin-starred restaurants, local wine intertwines with a heritage of creativity, while Roman ruins overlook Moorish architecture. For an introduction to Malaga, you can visit Picassoâs birthplace at Casa Natal Picasso . The house in Plaza de la Merced stands between the Roman Theater and Gibralfaro Castle, with the impressive history looming large over the neighborhood. The first floor features works by Jose Ruiz Blasco, Picassoâs father, offering a glimpse into the personal life and influences of the painter from a young age, leading to the family mementos and a third-floor library with aged leather-bound books, papers, and archive material of Picassoâs work and life. In the evening, you can visit a famous wine and tapas restaurant to enjoy traditional cuisine using local, seasonal ingredients inside an 18th-century mansion. Musicians may play through the night, adding to the ambiance, as you find Picassoâs signature decorating one of the wine barrels lining the wall."

      "title": "Malaga - Experience Picassoâs Early Life",
      "description": "After breakfast, you will meet your Picasso art specialist at the hotel. They will lead you on a tour through the celebrated Picasso Museum of Malaga to explore the themes of the artistâs early life. The painter wanted his work displayed in Malaga to celebrate his birthplace and represent his connection to the city by the sea, as well as the way his early years influenced the artist he became. You may find familiar pieces such as âStill Life with Minotaur and Paletteâ, depicting the mythological Greek character, or find sculptures the artist used to represent unusual or surprising shapes in nature. Your specialist guide will take you behind the scenes of the museum to view and learn about works not displayed in the normal gallery. You will continue your exploration of Picassoâs works with a painting class to learn the techniques the artist employed throughout his career. Your instructor will guide you through the colors, brush strokes, and intentionality of line usage to create your own Picasso-style work to take home as a reminder of your immersive Picasso experience in Spain."

      "description": "In the morning, your private transfer will take you from the hotel to the airport for your flight to A CoruÃ±a, in the northern region of Galicia. The distinctive culture and rugged northern landscape will strike a sharp contrast to the golden coastline and Moorish ambiance of the south. As you travel to your accommodations, you may easily see the rugged coastline striking a wild chord against the labyrinth of green valleys weaving through the interior. After settling in, you could take a hike along the cliffs and beaches to enjoy the landscapes that inspired some of Picassoâs early work. You may find the sea breeze blowing the aroma of salt and soil at Riazor beach as the turquoise water crashes against the nearby rocks. Local fishers continue to set sail and cast their nets in view of the Tower of Hercules that looms over the coastline as one of the oldest lighthouses in the world. Instead of viewing one of the artistâs beloved paintings, you have stepped into the landscape. In the evening, you may choose to visit one of the seaside restaurants, known for mariscada , a large, traditional platter of seafood often promoting the freshness of mussels, cuttlefish, and clams dressed with olive oil, sea salt, and pepper."

Home to Europeâs largest fishing fleet, you can quickly connect to Picassoâs new life as he arrived from Costa del Sol by ship as a teenager. Perhaps spend time wandering through the narrow lanes as the city wakes up to the aromas of coffee with milk and the sweet scent of freshly baked pastries. You can step aboard a boat for a sailing excursion along the northern Atlantic waters that imitates the panoramic view Picasso may have had as he sailed into port, giving you a view of the beaches to the west and the protruding edge of the peninsula. When you return to land, you can visit the Museo de Bellas Artes, a small museum with an impressive collection representing important Spanish artists. Find an introduction to Goya and an exhibition on 19th-century regional ceramics, before uncovering the connection to Picassoâs teenage life during secondary school. You may find the work âWoman with Hatâ displayed within the modern walls of the historic school, demonstrating the evolution of art in all its forms as it takes inspiration from the past to create a new vision for the future."

The breeze often carries the aromas of the sea and surrounding Mediterranean brush, adding to the majestic ambiance shaped by the pristine nature.
