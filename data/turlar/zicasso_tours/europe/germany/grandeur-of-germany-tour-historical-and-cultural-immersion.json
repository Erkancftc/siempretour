      "dayNumber": "1",
      "title": "Munich - Munichâs Bavarian History",
      "description": "You will arrive in Munich and transfer to your accommodation in the old city before having some time to rest and relax. This afternoon, you will explore the cityâs history on a guided tour that mixes iconic stops with hidden sights. First, you will head for Marienplatz and its lively splendor. Here, you can admire the Glockenspiel, explore the old food market, and start to understand the fabulous Rococo ornamentation at Asamkirche. There is a great collection of old German art at Alte Pinakothek to finish your tour, and your guide can provide you with recommendations on German bars for a famous Bavarian beer."

      "title": "Munich - Palaces and Gardens in Old Munich",
      "description": "You will spend your morning in a palace, and the exquisite Nymphenburg is a place in which you can get lost in regal beauty and design. Ostentatious coaches and sleighs fill some of the rooms, and the gardens are a great place to relax on your first full vacation day. This will be a relaxing morning excursion, and the afternoon will be at your leisure. Your guide will also be on hand to customize your afternoon to your interests. Englischer Garten and Neue Pinakothek are two possible historical sites that you can visit, but you will also discover just as much by delving into the backstreets of Munichâs old center."

    {
      "dayNumber": "3",
      "title": "Regensburg - Hidden German History",
      "description": "Much of Germany was destroyed during World War II, and what remains can only scratch the surface at what there once was. One great exception is Regensburg, which is a jumble of narrow lanes and atmospheric squares. Almost the entire city has remained untouched since medieval times, and it is a great place to understand the country during the 16th and 17th centuries. After a private transfer, you will enjoy an afternoon tour in a city that can seem like a timewarp. Regensburg remains off the beaten path, and it is a very authentic destination for history lovers, especially in comparison to some of the more famous Romantic Road."

    {
      "dayNumber": "4",
      "title": "Fussen - King Ludwig II and His Famous Castle",
      "description": "Fussen also evokes old-world charm with its red-tiled roofs and lovely townhouses. You will transfer here and check in early to your hotel before taking a short tour of the central streets. Nearby Neuschwanstein is Germanyâs most famous attraction, and it is worth the visit. By going in the late afternoon, you can avoid most of the crowds and wonder at the fairytale world of King Ludwig II. After visiting the castle that inspired Disney, you will enjoy an after-hours visit to Hohenschwangau, which is a castle that can best showcase Ludwigâs story and childhood."

      "title": "Berlin - Crossing Germany From South to North",
      "description": "After a road transfer back to Munich, you will take the high-speed train to Berlin, which is about a 4-hour journey that will eat up most of the afternoon. It is very comfortable in the first-class carriage, and you will have some exceptional views of rolling valleys and scenery. Nothing will be planned for your evening in Berlin, and a local guide will greet you at the railway station and assist you in the short transfer to your accommodation. You will get a quick city orientation on your way to your hotel and have some great dining options around you this evening."

      "title": "Berlin - Iconic Sights and War History",
      "description": "Berlin is packed with sights and has many famous stories to explore. Some of these will be featured on todayâs war history tour, but the big focus will be venturing off the beaten path to view places that Berlin does not like to advertise. Hitlerâs old war bunker is one example, and your guide will narrate a storyline that connects the first half of the 20th century. Along the way, you will see iconic sites, such as the Reichstag and Brandenburg Gate. Berlin displays its glamour along with its gritty past."

      "title": "Berlin - Discovering Both Sides of the Old Wall",
      "description": "Bricks on the ground show the route of the Berlin Wall, and sometimes they even cut through buildings. On todayâs tour, you will follow this famous line, starting at Checkpoint Charlie and continuing to parts of the wall that still remain. Today will be a day of local neighborhoods as you explore places that were once the front line in the Cold War. While the sights are not as glamorous as they were yesterday, stories make history here, and you will have plenty of opportunities to discuss what it was really like during the 1970s and 80s."
    },
    {
      "dayNumber": "8",
      "title": "Berlin - The Baroque Wonder of Dresden",
      "description": "Dresden barely survived the war, but the city has done a great job in reconstructing its former Baroque glory. This was the worldâs most attractive Baroque city, and you can still enjoy an impression of its scale and detail. You will visit Dresden on a guided day trip from Berlin. Part of Dresden is Baroque, and part of it is new and not that interesting. There is a neighborhood in between, which is a contemporary hub of international art and culture that has been enveloped by old eastern architecture. It is another place where locals will narrate the story for you."

      "title": "Hamburg - One of the Worldâs Most Historic Ports",
      "description": "The first-class train to Hamburg takes less than two hours and ensures that you can have a full afternoon of exploring Europeâs most alluring port city. Most of the port is now designated as a World Heritage area, and the antiquated warehouses are very different from most other ports. To explore them best, you will spend three hours on a harbor cruise with stops to discover how different civilizations brought their own trading and architectural style. Hamburg is a must for history lovers and an indication of how different European empires have come and gone over the centuries."

      "dayNumber": "10",
      "title": "Hamburg - Ancient Masters and Slow Wandering",
      "description": "Hamburg is also a place to wander around slowly, especially the harbor area. To complete your Germany history tour, you will have the day to explore 2,000 years of history with hints of the Saxons, Vikings, Hanseatic trading league, Roman Empire, and Nazi Germany. Again, the focus will be more on the stories, and with a private tour, you can tailor all the timings to your interests. Kunsthalle will be one of the dayâs stops, and its collection of old and new art reflects the disparate influences. Waterside HafenCity is also a superb juxtaposition of centuries and histories."
