      "title": "Zagreb â Welcome to Croatia",
      "description": "Today, as your plane descends over Croatia, you will catch your first glimpse of the quintessentially Croatian orange and red roofs. Zagreb, the countryâs capital, has found itself a place in the hearts of travelers in recent years, through its historically saturated architecture and ever-welcoming cafes. Your private transfer will meet you at the airport and escort you to your luxury accommodations. Passing by galleries, museums and cinemas, take note of the socialist roots that course through a rapidly modernizing city. In Zagreb, local chefs are famously re-inventing classic dishes in which you can indulge and enjoy."

      "title": "Rijeka â Tour the Historic and Cultural Sights of Zagreb",
      "description": "This morning, your day will begin with a tour of the city. Located where the East contentiously meets the West, Zagreb has had a long history of foreign rule and external influences. Spend your morning exploring this ultra-walkable city, wandering from JelaÄiÄ Square towards the bronze statue of Marija Juric Zagorka, the countryâs first female journalist. From there, you might head over to Lenuciâs Horseshoe, a lush promenade filled with flowerbeds and fountains. Here you will find the Croatian National Theatre, a masterpiece of neo-Baroque architecture, and the Botanical Gardens. You can also enjoy the sidewalk cafÃ©s transferring to Rijeka."

      "title": "Split â Travel through Ancient Roman History",
      "description": "This morning, you will begin a winding drive down the Dalmatia Coast. Arriving in Zadar just in time for lunch, you will spend the early afternoon exploring the history-filled walls of the city. Beginning at the Roman Forum which dates back to the second century; you can slowly walk through the centuries as you pass the ninth century pre-Romanesque church of St. Donatus. You can also stop in the medieval town of Trogir. Founded by the Greeks and occupied by the Romans, this 17-century town is a protected UNESCO World Heritage Site with centuries-old stonework adorning the preserved homes."

      "title": "Dubrovnik â Soak in the History of Split",
      "description": "As the pace of your surroundings livens, you will embark on a guided half-day tour of the cityâs most coveted sights. Perhaps most famous of them all is Diocletianâs Palace, the cityâs historic core and a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site. Basement corridors and oceanside promenades lead you throughout the palace, perhaps better described as a walled city, before ultimately guiding you towards the Peristil, the main courtyard. Following lunch, you can continue along the Makarska Riviera, gradually winding your way between the mountains and the sea as you make your way towards the globally-coveted town of Dubrovnik."

      "title": "Dubrovnik â Wander from Cobblestone Alleyways to Oceanside Cliffs",
      "description": "Today, you will have an entire day to explore Dubrovnik at your own pace. Rich with historical, cultural, culinary and natural sights, the day will be entirely yours to design. For many, the morning may begin with a walk along the Adriatic Sea, stepping down to a pebble beach or out onto the rocky shelves. You might venture into the old city for breakfast or wander into the museums, galleries, and churches nestled into the Baroque architecture. Or perhaps consider renting a kayak to catch a glimpse of this walled-city and the surrounding islands from the Mediterranean."

      "title": "Plitvice â Drive along the Adriatic Coast",
      "description": "This morning, you will drive away from the orange rooftops of Dubrovnik moving back up the Adriatic Coast. As you approach the Neretva River Delta, you will venture inland following the curves of the valley and the Cetina River. Stop en route for a countryside lunch and eventually arrive in Plitvice in the mid-afternoon. After a busy couple of days of sightseeing, spend what remains of the afternoon enjoying the deeply luxurious surroundings of your hotel. Revel in the fresh breeze that rolls across the lakes and forests that are characteristic of the national park before a romantic dinner."

      "title": "Zagreb â Explore the Sixteen Lakes of Plitvice Lakes National Park",
      "description": "Cascading waterfalls, clear turquoise lakes and cathedral-like forest canopies weave together to form Plitvice Lakes National Park. Sitting in perfect complement to the regal beauty of the Adriatic Sea, your understanding of Croatia would be incomplete without a stroll through this majestic UNESCO Natural Heritage Site. The entire park sprawls out over 12,000 acres, with walking trails leading you under spruce and fir, through delicate meadows and up onto rock cliffs perched around pristine lakes. Follow your chosen path through this surreal natural wonderland, enjoying your final full day in the country."

      "title": "Zagreb â Indulge in a Final Croatian Breakfast",
      "description": "This morning, following a final breakfast at your Zagreb hotel, you will return to the airport for your international flight home. Those with a later departure may have enough time to stroll the streets once more, visiting the favorite sights from your first day or a few others that remain untouched. Of course for those that crave more than a few hours, there is always the opportunity to design a few additional idyllic days in the region, be it in Croatia, or elsewhere."
