      "title": "Berlin - Energetic Introduction",
      "description": "Berlin has a captivating cultural flair and a history that dates back to the 13th-century. A mixture of monuments and historic quarters radiate from eclectic neighborhoods, including a portion of the wall that once divided West and East Germany. Nikolai Quarter stands as the heart of the Old City, telling the history based in the brick buildings and narrow streets filled with nooks and crannies. Lattice-windows perforate old houses. Ephraim Palace was erected in the 18th century and houses a collection of the cityâs cultural history. Your private transfer greets you upon your arrival at the airport and escorts you to your hotel located near the center of Berlin. Restaurants prepare an array of dishes, both traditionally German as well as an amalgamation of cultures from around the world. Locals sip a beer at small cafes with tables lining the sidewalk.

      "description": "The gray concrete of the Berlin Wall now glows along the MÃ¼hlenstrasse with almost a mile-long stretch of the former rampart known as the East Side Gallery. The open-air mural collection contains more than 100 paintings by artists from around the world, each using the format to demonstrate freedom, which also embodies the New Berlin. After breakfast, your guide meets you in the hotel lobby, ready to begin your Germany vacation, taking you first to the Brandenburg Gate. The cityâs most iconic monument was erected in defiance to Franceâs Arc de Triomphe in 1791. The sandstone edifice stands 85 feet tall, adorned with a four-horse chariot. The grace of the structure encompasses the past, present, and future of the city, projecting the presence of mind and a connection to something greater. You quickly absorb the vast history of Berlin when, after taking in the beauty of the gate, you visit Checkpoint Charlie, witnessing what is left of what had been a 13-foot high wall that extended more than 96 miles."

      "title": "Berlin - A Touch of the East",
      "description": "By now the quintessential spirit of Berlin has overtaken you, showing you the value of history and art in the everyday world. After breakfast, your guide takes you through Berlin like a local, hopping aboard the tram to Hackescher Markt to discover the ever-changing streets of East Berlin. Traces of the cityâs separation are still noticeable. Numerous buildings maintain their Soviet appearance and the decorations of Soviet relics decorate the street. When you reach Bebelplatz, you find a 17th-century public square bordered by St. Hedwigâs Cathedral and the State Opera House. Your guide points out what looks like a glass square at the heart of the cobblestoned plaza. Inside the glass are bookshelves. The memorial commemorates the Nazi book burning of May 10, 1933. During this tragic event, students destroyed books from the library of the local institute. The bookcases underneath the glass panel can hold up to 20,000 books, the same number that was burned during the demonstration. Set in tandem with Berlinâs vivacious present is the heavy shadow of its past, from Nazism to Socialism, and also imperialism. However, the cityâs past has shaped its present as an artistic, friendly, and one of the most sought after cities in Europe."

The castle became an abbey in the 11th-century after Benedictine monks took over responsibility. The town has a tranquil atmosphere surrounded by the lush pastures of the valley. Melk Abbey stands atop a bluff at 1,065 feet. The twin towers of the church stand above a semicircular terrace.

The library has an oil painting decorating the ceiling to give the illusion that the room is taller than it seems. The magnitude of the abbey, along with the alluring dÃ©cor, adds to the grandeur. A fountain trickles in the courtyard. Natural light shines through the large windows in the corridors. It is easy to forget that the abbey is a religious building, and you feel that it has returned to its origins as a magnificent castle."
