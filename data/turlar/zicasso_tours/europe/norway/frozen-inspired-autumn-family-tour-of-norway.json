      "title": "Oslo â Arrive in Oslo to Discover Folklore, Culture, and Frozen",
      "description": "Oslo is a city of wonder with a fairytale ambiance that stems from natural treasures, its charming culture, and its connection to the marvelous characters of Anna, Elsa, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf from Frozen . Protected forests shine with emerald leaves, and hundreds of glassy lakes reflect the colorful facades of antique buildings. Oslo will welcome you into the real-life Arendelle as you arrive at the airport, where you will pick up your pre-arranged rental car before your family drives into the heart of Oslo. You will first drive to check-in to your modern accommodation, where you can relax before venturing out into the city. The aroma of saltwater will emanate from the edging seaside, eventually fading beneath the scent of blotkake , which is a traditional sponge and cream cake that is often topped with icing and seasonal fruits. You will begin your discovery of Norway and Arendelle with a privately guided tour of the city, beginning with the Norsk Folkemuseum, for a glimpse of life into Norway in the 19th century, which is the time period in which Anna and Elsa would have lived, loved, and ruled over Arendelle. Your family will immediately notice the customary folk costumes that are worn by the princess and queen, which are known as Rosemaling dresses. The fantastical images of the movie will blend with reality as you visit the 13th-century Gol Stave Church and wander among the 160 buildings that will offer you a touch of village life. You will continue your tour to Akershus Fortress, which acted as the model for Elsaâs castle. The foundation of the powerful citadel dates back approximately 500 years, and the aromas of stone and sea will drift through the air as your family strolls through what feels like the true home of Anna and Elsa. Once you have walked in the shoes of Anna and Elsa for the day, you will be returned to your well-appointed accommodation, where you will have the remainder of the evening to spend at your leisure."

Your family will instantly be whisked into the majesty of the Valley of the Living Rock, where Kristoff lived with his adopted troll family. While you are here, you will find the Hunderfossen Troll, which is a 70-ton statue that stands nearly 46 feet tall. The troll watches over the valley, resulting in the worldâs largest troll statue. Norwegian folktales and grandeur of the Arendelle kingdom will continue to shine as you visit the Fairy-Tale Castle, which is a gorgeous palace that is full of magic. Rooms within the palace castle reflect national folklore with 3D presentations and the exciting Troll Drop, which is a thrilling rollercoaster that leads you into the heart of a troll pit and asks if you have the willpower not to touch the trollâs treasures. In the evening, you can settle into the comforts of your hotel with your family, embracing the warm atmosphere that captures the essence of traditional Norway."

Their herds of reindeer grazing across the landscape will immediately remind you of Sven. You will stay at a charming accommodation that is known for possessing a husky farm. The dogs live very close to the accommodations allowing you to visit with the herd and pet them when they are not training. Your family will then participate in a boat safari to wind through Alta Canyon, which is a natural marvel that reaches for over seven miles long and is 1,380 feet at its deepest point. As you glide along the tranquil water, your family will enjoy the changing leaves, peaceful atmosphere, and the impenetrable mound of rocks that is shaped by the elaborate boulders of the riverbank.

      "description": "When visiting Alta in summer, you will find the land of the midnight sun, known for possessing up to 24 hours of sunlight spreading across the salmon-filled rivers and Finnmarksvidda mountain plateau.

After your meal, your private transfer will escort your family to the airport for your return flight to Oslo, where you will have plenty of time to check-in for your flight home with your fairytale ending to your Frozen adventure in Norway.

With the help of a master glassblower, you will learn the intricate technique for crafting a tremendous souvenir: a glass sculpture that is shaped like a snowflake to commemorate your discovery of Norway and its focus on the wonderful world of Frozen . Your family will enjoy the glassblowing demonstration with your instructor, and you will all work among temperatures that can reach up to 1,100 degrees Fahrenheit. After your instructor heats, molds, and cools the glass, you will have the opportunity to shape your own snowflake under the guidance of a well-trained professional. This unique experience will result in a snowflake that will never melt, much like Olaf the snowman.
