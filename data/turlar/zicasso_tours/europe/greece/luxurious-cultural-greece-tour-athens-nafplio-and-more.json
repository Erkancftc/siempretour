      "description": "Embracing tradition infused with modern charm and vibrance, Athens epitomizes a capital city that blends the past and present, exhibiting that through its architecture, cuisine, and traditional dances. Settle into your hotel and, if time permits, consider exploring some of the cityâs treasures, such as the prehistoric collection at the National Archeology Museum or the many dining options at the ârestaurant staircaseâ in popular Plaka and Anafiotika. Or perhaps visit the Kerameikos neighborhood, the former living quarters of the cityâs potters and the site of an ancient cemetery."

Feel humbled in front of the looming, decorative columns, each embedded with intricate details and decals telling stories of Ancient Greece. Visit Syntagma Square, standing in silence as you watch the âchanging of the guardâ, the precision of formality moving you to stand to attention.

Feel the spiritual energy as you retrace steps and stories of Christianity regaled by St Paul when you visit the ruins at the Church of Corinth, archways and single walls standing as strong today as the power of Paulâs word in AD 52. Afterward, visit St Paulâs church to find mosaic images of the Apostle Paul standing bold on the outer walls, an acknowledgment of his importance to Corinthians.

Hidden behind a bold, bronze door lie relics and historical manuscripts depicting tales of the monks that once lived there. Step outside and onto the Odontotos rack railway, holding your breath as you wind along narrow train tracks, seemingly wedged between the rocks as you make your way to the town of Kalavryta.

      "description": "A historic town made famous when a victorious Athenian army defeated a mightier Persian contingent in the battle of Marathon in 490 BCE, Marathon forms a significant part of Greek history and is well known today as the birthplace of the modern-day marathon. Legend has it that a Greek herald was sent to Athens with news of this incredible victory, endurance, and will that we still see in marathon running today. Spend time exploring the town before traveling through the narrow pass of Thermopylae. The stretch of land between the mountain and sea still resembles the ideal location for the Greek army to have halted the Persian navy from reaching the shore at the Battle at Thermopylae in 480 BCE."

Enter the bright and bustling flea market, the smell of old books and the sound of traders bargaining ringing through the aisles, a page out of the Ottoman Empireâs booming 16th century ever present in textiles and threads. Musicians and street artists entertain while you set about looking for that one last souvenir to take home."
