      "title": "Munich â Relaxing in Bavaria",
      "description": "Landing in Munich reduces your travel time versus landing in Vienna. Therefore, you will land in Bavariaâs capital, where there is also a lot to see and do. A guide will transfer you to your accommodation in the heart of the city. When you are ready, your guide will lead you on an orientation walk of the neighborhood. Grand markets may entice you with their smells and sounds, side streets will be covered in small cafes, and you canât go far without seeing a sausage-selling street merchant. Not much will be planned for today, and it is hard hard to predict your childrenâs mood after such a long journey."

      "description": "This morning, you can take a walk through Munichâs Old Town. Artisanal crafts spill from the stalls of Viktualienmarkt, offering everything from mechanical toys to chocolates and intricate bells. Not everyone can drink a stein in the legendary Hofbrauhaus beer hall, but it is a fascinating place to see. As you hoist a liter-sized mug, your children can chomp through a giant Munich pretzel. Afterward, you can all explore the rest of the city. One full day is not enough to see it all, so your guide will tailor an afternoon to your interests. The evening will be left free, and you will find a handful of excellent restaurants within walking distance of your hotel."
