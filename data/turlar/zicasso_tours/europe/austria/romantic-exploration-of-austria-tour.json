      "title": "Salzburg - Music and Baroque Bliss",
      "description": "Salzburg has a glorious location, draped along a river beneath rugged mountains. Touch down here and you can instantly sense the serenity. Life moves slowly here and thereâs a wonderful feeling of space, two things that are hallmarks of any Austria tour for couples. After a private airport transfer, the afternoon and evening will be at your leisure. So stroll hand in hand through the baroque streets, past Mozartâs house, and enjoy your first impressions of how romantic Austria can be."

      "title": "Salzburg - Exploring in a Horse and Carriage",
      "description": "Salzburgâs charming streets are best explored in a horse and carriage. You can travel in private, at a pace thatâs fast enough to get around the entire city in one day. Heading out of the center youâll clip-clop towards mountain vistas and filming locations from the Sound of Music. Back in the city youâll move slow enough to appreciate all the details, such as ornamental doorways and the changing facades of 300-year-old townhouses. This is a romantic half-day tour that will include lunch, leading to a free evening in the old city."

      "title": "Hallstatt - Alpine Wonder",
      "description": "Mountains shimmer snow-white in the morning light. Lakes glisten beneath encircling peaks. You will be transferred privately into the Austrian Alps, for a day of blissful scenery and laid-back indulgence. Stop in Bad Ischl for a private salt bath and spa session at one of Europeâs most revered spa towns. Wind over mountain passes to Hallstatt, a town thatâs even more idyllic than its famous photos suggest. Draped along the water, with a church spire climbing towards the Alps, this is a place for escaping the rest of the world with only your partner for company."

      "title": "Hallstatt - Austriaâs Most Romantic Town",
      "description": "The highlight of any romantic vacation is private you-and-me time. And thatâs the focus of today. Nothing specific has been planned, so you can laze in bed, explore the cobblestone streets, and perhaps take a walk into the nearby mountains. With these nine days in Austria you will have time and space to come together, so donât expect too much input from guides. Hallstatt has some lovely cafes and restaurant terraces. Most importantly, it has a slow pace of life that makes every moment so idyllic."

      "title": "Krems - Austriaâs Famed Lake District",
      "description": "Lakes extend, all blue hues and peaceful reflections. Mountains continue to impose, with sharp white peaks marking your journey north to Salzkammergut, Austriaâs Lake District. This is another peaceful place and there are many self-guided hiking trails you can explore. Your guide will help you to choose one that fits your interest and energy, before transferring you to an alpine restaurant with a view. After lunch you continue through the Lake District to Krems, a town with a Roman history and delightful old-world streets."

      "title": "Melk - Cruising the Danube",
      "description": "The River Danube meanders through most of Central Europe and you will spend the afternoon cruising upon it. After a short transfer itâs a private boat all the way down the river, with wine and lunch served on board, and little to interrupt the tranquility. Melk Abbey delights in its 11th-century glory, its grand decor transporting you back almost 1000 years. The old town has a lovely feel and youâll take a short tour with a historian guide, so you can travel forward to the 17th century and the House of Itinerants."

      "title": "Vienna - A Night at the Opera",
      "description": "After a one-hour private transfer to Vienna, you will be deep inside a cityâs baroque beauty. A guide will take you on a short walking tour of the old center, pointing out the most historic Viennese cafes and landmarks. Thereâs time to explore on your own, before an evening in Europeâs most historic opera house. This is a stately country of Mozart and the performances retain a Hapsburg-style glory. Itâs one of the most romantic immersions you can have in Austrian culture."

      "description": "Cruise through Vienna in a horse and carriage today, checking off grand museums and nearby palaces. Opulence is draped along city walls and it goes hand in hand with the clip-clop of horses. Stop for a Viennese pastry and coffee. Go behind the rope at a Hapsburg palace. Tailor the exact to your interests and find temptations on most corners. This is a beautiful capital city and you can enjoy real privacy in the carriage, as you sit back and watch Vienna roll by."
