      "title": "Oprtalj - Over Land and Sea",
      "description": "Begin your Croatia tour by arriving in the small village of Oprtalj by way of Trieste, Italy. There is no doubt that the beauty outside of the windows en route to the small village is breathtaking. It looks like you have ventured into the Tuscan hills, or have hidden away in the Austrian countryside; except you have made your way into Croatia, an undoubtedly beautiful country that continues to live in wonderful partial-secrecy. Located in on the largest peninsula in the Adriatic Sea, the greenery carpets the hills where vineyards run along the terraces; you can look out into the vast rolling landscape and see mountains at the horizon. A cool breeze strokes your hair and the surrounding leaves. There is a natural draw for any and every level of foodie, from those who have searched their entire life for authentic cuisine hidden in the mountaintops of distant lands, to people that just want to enjoy a tasty meal in the comfort of beautiful scenery and unparalleled company. Near the village is the location where Giancarlo Zigante discovered the worldâs largest truffle in 1999. From truffles to the Renaissance the regionâs cultured love of olive and wine-growing, the aromas that pass through the hills make your mouth water as the scenery welcomes you to someplace like home."

      "title": "Oprtalj - Artistic Medieval Streets and Wineries of GroÅ¾njan",
      "description": "The morning light casts a gleam over the tremendous greenery that surrounds the plateaued village. The succulent perfume of breakfast seems to drift through the meandering narrow streets. In the late morning, you will have a visit to the hilltop village of GroÅ¾njan, where artists, musicians, and artisans have added to the charming stature. In the summer months, the streets transform into an artistic enclave, filled with music academies, dance performances, and more all spreading throughout the villageâs labyrinthine streets. Stroll through the historic streets. Your steps on the cobblestone streets echo along the walls bouncing off eclectic galleries. The views are splendid, giving a grander display of the outstretched valley and far-reaching hills. With the day at your whim to leisure away along the streets of medieval fantasy, there is no better time to luxuriate amongst the delicate and diverse flavors of the Istria countryside. KozloviÄ is a vintner that produces exquisite wine with subtle and supple flavors remarking on the fabulous Croatian terrain. The vineyard, like the landscape itself, blossoms along the horizon springing fresh greenery and a welcomed earthiness to the air. Sip on their famed Malvasia varietal, known for its lemon coloration and nose of ripe fruit like peaches and nectarine, followed by a creamy palate of grapefruit flavors that provides you with a lovely sampling of the best of Istrian wine-making. The owner, Luciano Visintin, is filled with the intense passion and friendliness that has developed from family history and is deeply rooted in the personality of the wines and olive oils they produce. Dinner at Damir and Ornellaâs offers fresh fish caught that day, prepared for you at the table to order in what they have named âMediterranean Sashimi.â The more you the time you spend in Croatia the more you realize that much of its luster comes in remarkable edible form."

      "title": "Kobarid - Grandeur of the Alps",
      "description": "Say good morning and goodbye to the Croatian countryside after a light cafÃ© breakfast. Soon you will find yourself over the Slovenian border at Å kocjan Caves. The breathtaking system of limestone caves expands to almost four-miles of underground caverns and sinks to over 600 feet at its deepest point. There is an eerie and exhilarating spaciousness that weaves around the karsts. Rushing water echoes through the vast openness. Standing on the main bridge you can look down into the flowing water and see the incredible depths at which the cave drops. The limestone mixes with the moisture to add an earthy scent to the cavernous atmosphere. Light fixtures help illuminate the walkway and give an emerald glow to the Reka River that rushes through the system. Stop for lunch at the 11th century Dornberk Castle before arriving in the stunning town of Kobarid, situated at the foothills of Soca Valley which climb up to Mount Krn. The vibrant greenery that sweeps across the valley and over the mountains is almost unimaginable. The only things more remarkable than the rich valley and mountainside are the towering peaks above them, whether covered in snow or showing off their limestone grandeur. The town itself resembles a quaint alpine village, where the quiet draw of the streets is surrounded by the splendor of its surroundings. Whether a tranquil evening in your comfortable hotel or strolling along the Gastronomic Circle filled with restaurants offering tasty treats from recipes that have been passed down for generations, you will quickly find the majesty of Kobarid."

      "description": "There is a wonder in the Julian Alps that surround the Soca Valley. Placid lakes reflect their surroundings, from quintessential churches to endless blue sky. Today you will settle into the fantastic accommodation of HiÅ¡a Franko. Ernest Hemingway stayed in the charming site at the fringes of World War I, and the rumor states it is the location where he wrote, A Farewell to Arms . The alpine scenery is bejeweled with hot springs and castles, luxuries and comforts, all set within the undulating mountain peaks that give grace and tone to your time in Slovenia. HiÅ¡a Frankoâs award-winning chef, Ana RoÅ¡, will offer you a tremendous tour of her cheese storehouse located in the lower-levels of the hotel, along with her herb and vegetable garden in the back. The cheese cellar looks more like an artesian showroom, where indigenous cheeses like Tolminc and Voski are aged, each variety paired with local honey and marmalade. The scenery is delectable, the food is desirous, and together they are perfection."

      "description": "Today you will venture through the town of Kaborid to the KobariÅ¡ki Museum, which displays memoriam of the SoÄa River and the World War I front that separated Italy from the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The exterior is unassuming, consistent with the architecture and tranquility of the entire town; however, once inside the museum you can see the remarkable collection that showcases the past, from the faces and artifacts of those who fought hardily during the Great War that changed the modern landscape and geography of the area, to a documentary detailing particular instances, the strife, and the power of World War I which continues to inform and shape the region. In the midday you cross into the Italian city of Cividale del Friuli. You will be met by a local guide who will take you through the ancient city that was founded by Julius Caesar in 53 BC. Cross Il Ponte del Diavolo, the Bridge of the Devil. A symbol of the city, the stone arch contains a devil-related myth that has stretched over the bridge since the 15th century; the bridge was rebuilt after World War I. The history is alive along the streets and architecture. You can see saints around the vista of the Longobardo Temple, jutting out from the walls in clean and precise poses, blessing and watching those beneath them. As the evening settles in you will arrive in Udine at the delectable restaurant of Agli Amici, where a traditional eight-course dinner awaits you."

      "description": "You will find charm and elegance in the Slovenian capital of Ljubljana.

You have seen villages and valleys, Alps and rivers, yet this capital is unlike any other, utterly delightful. The city combines Habsburg architectural majesty with boutique stores and artisan crafts, all somewhat hidden beneath the 15th-century castle perched above the winding, narrow streets. Stand atop the viewing tower to see the wondrous vista that reaches the horizon, filled with plush trees and red rooftops. There is even a fantastic display of what the castle once was, transitioning to how the castle is perceived now on a virtual walkthrough of its history.

      "description": "Once more the sunlight rises over Slovenia, only today you find an unfamiliar finality to the sunrise, the last time you will watch the light glisten off of this particular greenery; the last time the scent of vineyards and cherry trees will drift in this particular breeze. After breakfast, you will venture back to Trieste, Italy where and board your flight bound for home. You have tasted your way along the Adriatic, where the exceptional flavors have blossomed with time and culture. Just because you have begun your journey home doesnât mean that the tastes of the region have to end. There will always be more wines to sample, more cheese to eat, more incredible coursed meals to find, and when you find yourself missing the landscape, the food, and the people that much, you will always be welcomed back. Consider extending this 11-day trip. Browse the Croatia reviews for additional ideas and to read traveler reviews."
