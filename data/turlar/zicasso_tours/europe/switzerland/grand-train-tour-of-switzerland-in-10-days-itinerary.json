      "description": "Zurich is a vibrant city set against the backdrop of the mouth of Limmat River. In the summer, locals jump into the water and drift with the current alongside the whitewashed tower homes to pass beneath the old bridges. Trees shade the walkways along the grid of the fortified Roman settlement on the left bank as bohemian neighborhoods brush against post-industrial apartments that contrast with the winding lanes and the tall church towers of the historical city center. Your flight will land at Kloten Airport, and your private transfer will greet you upon your arrival. You will settle into the comforts of your luxurious hotel that overlooks the cobbled lanes of the antique neighborhood of Old Town and your guide will greet you in the lobby eager to lead you on an engaging tour of Switzerlandâs largest city, beginning at Fraumunster. The Cathedral soars over the city with a 13th-century copper tower, and Marc Chagall crafted the remarkable stained-glass windows that depict stories from the Bible represented in bright, glowing hues."
