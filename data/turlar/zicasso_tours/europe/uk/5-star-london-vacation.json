This incredible tour allows you to walk in their shoes, explore their surroundings and hear their stories; it is truly as unique and authentic a tour of London as could be imagined. After lunch, youâll be led to the mammoth dome of St. Paulâs Cathedral, the masterpiece of English architect Sir Christopher Wren and one of the largest places of worship in all of Europe. Youâll be awed by the sumptuous interior, from the beautifully, delicately adorned dome to the imposing tombs of English greats that dot the immense marbled floor.

      "title": "Poetâs Corner and the Crown Jewels",
      "description": "With no scheduled tours for today, you find yourself at your leisure to visit some of Londonâs most famous buildings, monuments, memorials and museums. Start in Westminster, where you can walk around the famous Abbey and soak in the history that fills the ether with a heavy presence, from St. Edwardâs Chair â the throne of every coronation since 1308 â to the tombs of Mary I and Elizabeth I, sister queens who now lie directly on top of one another. Feel the inspiration of the plaques and monuments to the great writers of the English language in Poetâs Corner, from Browning and Chaucer to Spenser and Tennyson, or bask in awe at the monuments to Sir Isaac Newton, David Livingstone and George Frederick Handel. The grounds of Westminster Abbey are also beautiful, and the surrounding cityscape is bustling with an energy that seems to evaporate once you enter the hallowed halls. After a delicious lunch, you might want to turn down the Thames to tour another building inextricably linked to the British monarch: the Tower of London. Youâll enjoy a tour led by the famous Beefeaters, catch a glimpse of the Towerâs famous ravens, try to get a Coldstream Guard to crack a smile, and ogle at the Crown Jewels of the British throne, from scepters and swords of coronation to the state crowns featuring some of the most famous gemstones on Earth, like the Koh-i-Noor diamond and the Black Princeâs Ruby."

      "title": "A Castle, a Resort Town, and Incomparable Stonehenge",
      "description": "This morning, you leave the bustle of swinging London to venture out into the unmatched scenery and serenity of the south English countryside, bound for some of the most famous destinations in all of Europe. You start at the venerable Windsor Castle, where the British monarchy has called home for nine centuries, longer than any other palace in Europe. Stroll through the elegant and opulent State Apartments, furnished in the finest Classical, Gothic and Rococo styles, and walk the grounds of the castle before exploring St. Georgeâs Chapel, a Gothic structure built in the 1600s. It houses the remains of some of the most famous British rulers in history, including Henry VIII and George III. From Windsor Castle, continue onto the Salisbury Plains to encounter the unmistakable ring of Stonehenge, a structure shrouded in mystery and famed for its seemingly impossible construction. Built long before the pyramids, before Socrates was teaching in Greece or Jesus in the Holy Land, this puzzling production of prehistoric humanity continues to confuse experts in its techniques, its structure, and even its purpose. Despite this haze of uncertainty, however, the site is still revered as one of the most famous megalithic structures on the planet. Your day around southern England concludes at the famous spa town of Bath, a city that reflects its prominence during Roman and Georgian times by sporting the long and graceful stretch of the Royal Crescent to the Roman bathhouses that can still be found. Cross the Pulteney Bridge â one of only four bridges in the world with shops fully across its span â and enjoy the weather on the green stretch of the Parade Gardens before returning back to London for a night filled with vivacity."

Bibliophiles will love exploring the many bookstores that line Charing Cross Road, while a visit to Hamleys on Regent Street â Londonâs premier toy store that fills seven stories â is definitely worth a visit. If youâre feeling like nobility, you would do well to strut the sidewalk alongside Beauchamp Place, where royalty and celebrities alike do their buying and where some of the best clothes, jewelry and food in the city can be found."
