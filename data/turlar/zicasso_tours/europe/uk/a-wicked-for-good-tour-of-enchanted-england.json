      "title": "London - Step Onto Famous University Quads and Historic Palatial Grounds",
      "description": "Enjoy a guided tour of two quite different yet connected universities: one that has been in existence since the 11th century and the other created by a master director. A visit to Oxford University, one of Englandâs oldest and most well-known tertiary institutions, is like stepping into a living storybook of history, architecture, and academic prestige. Marvel at the iconic Radcliffe Camera, a Baroque building housing the Radcliffe Science Library, and explore the Bodleian Library, one of the oldest in Europe. Wander through the atmospheric college quads, popping your head into Christ Church, with the grand dining hall that inspired Hogwarts in the Harry Potter films. Discover quirky anthropological treasures in the Pitt Rivers Museum before taking a stroll through the University Parks and along the River Cherwell, where many a rower has taken oar to water in preparation for a battle against Cambridge. Switch school yards for formal estate gardens when visiting Blenheim Palace. Doing so will introduce you to legacy, power, and victorious history. Enter stately rooms with Baroque interiors, priceless art, and the soaring ceilings of the Great Hall, drawing parallels to Wicked: For Good through dramatic architecture that could easily evoke the grandeur of Ozâs Emerald City or Glindaâs Palace. Imagine a scene where Elphaba walks the Water Terraces or Glinda hosts a ball in the Long Library. Blenheimâs history as a victory gift and home to generations of dukes mirrors Wicked âs exploration of destiny, influence, and rewriting history."

      "title": "London - Discover Munchkinland and the World of Wizardry",
      "description": "Step away from the big city today for a visit to Bedfordshire, the site of Munchkinland. Heading into Leighton Buzzard, you will see signs of the purpose-built movie set that was created in the town for the original movie. Complete with thatched-roof cottages and the iconic Yellow Brick Road, the scene was set for an epic adventure in Oz. Take a ride on the Leighton Buzzard heritage railway, a narrow-gauge railroad that offers scenic countryside views and a nostalgic steam-train experience. Gaze out onto fields and hills where munchkins may have wandered on a daily basis. Explore Rushmere Country Park, where trails run through woodlands flanked by sculptures and feature a treetop viewing platform. Take a peaceful stroll along the Grand Union Canal, stopping for a pint in a local English pub, and enjoy a narrowboat adventure as you pass imaginary scenes of wonderful wildlife roaming the hills of Oz. Back in London, you have the opportunity to immerse yourself in the wizardly world of witchcraft. Visit the House of Spells near Leicester Square, a fantasy-themed shop that celebrates Wicked and Harry Potter -adjacent fandoms, with wands, potions, and a lot of sparkle. You can entertain yourself with Wicked- themed workshops and musical theater classes as you rediscover Oz through dance and song."

      "title": "Buckinghamshire - Capture Scenes of Countryside Charm Fit for a Munchkin",
      "description": "Your journey into the Chiltern Hills and the surrounding village of Ivinghoe in Buckinghamshire will bring visions of Munchkinland into reality. Ivinghoeâs charm and quaint location nestled within the rolling Chilterns was the location used to film many scenes of those entertaining little people, providing a portal to Oz. Temporary sets of colorful, higgledy-piggledy cottages with thatched roofs highlighted their whimsical world in this storybook location, while the stunning natural beauty of the area provided a blissful backdrop. The winding Yellow Brick Road stood in charming contrast to the ancient, undulating landscape, turning Buckinghamshire into a real-life fairytale, echoing the innocence and wonder of childhood imagination. Climb Ivinghoe Beacon and capture views across the Vale of Aylesbury, looking out for colorful kites sweeping the sky. You would be hiking the same hills where Elphaba and Glindaâs story unfolded. Explore Pitstone Windmill, one of the oldest surviving windmills in Britain, or the Ford End Watermill, where you can watch flour being ground via traditional methods. Enjoy the Chiltern and wind your way through chalk hills, woodlands, and historic sites such as the Uffington White Horse when hiking the Ridgeway. This 3000-year-old chalk figure carved into the hillside is one of Britain's oldest and most iconic geoglyphs, and the views from the top are outstanding. Wander through market towns like Tring, Berkhamsted, and Wendover, where cozy pubs, artisan shops, and weekend markets can be enjoyed."

      "title": "Gloucestershire - Discover the Exceptional Beauty of the Iconic Cotswolds",
      "description": "With villages and towns that could easily resemble Munchkinland in Wicked: For Good , a visit to the glorious Cotswolds will have you feeling like you are stepping into a storybook, perhaps similar to that of the Wizard of Oz . Rolling green hills, honey-hued stone cottages, and villages with names that sound like they belong in a fairytale, you will easily feel like you have switched the concrete jungle for a countryside haven. Officially designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, there are sites and experiences to keep you busy and intrigued. Visit local artisans, from cheesemakers to potters, and sip delicious local wines on an outing to a vineyard. Wander through the iconic village of Bourton-on-the-Water, known as the Venice of the Cotswolds, and, in Bibury, capture scenic shots along Arlington Row. Take to the skies in a hot air balloon for a birdâs-eye view of patchwork fields and winding lanes, and ride a vintage steam train on the Gloucestershire to Warwickshire Railway for a countryside experience. The regionâs timeless charm and theatrical beauty, from ivy-draped cottages to misty meadows, echo the emotional tone for the Wicked ballad For Good . The song is about transformation, friendship, and the places that shape who we become, and the Cotswolds, with its sense of stillness and storybook wonder, feels like the kind of place where such a moment could unfold."

      "title": "East Sussex - Experience the English Countryside As You Travel to East Sussex",
      "description": "Leave the scenic Cotswolds and travel to the south-east coastal region in East Sussex. Your journey will take you through endless fields of brilliant green and patches of golden crops that fold into the undulating landscape. As you pass through landscapes that feel like they belong in Wicked: For Good , you will notice the shift from the pastoral calm of the Cotswolds to the windswept drama of the cliffs. En route, you will stop at the South Downs National Park, specifically at the Petworth House & Park. Nestled within the South Downs and managed by the National Trust, the house is known for its grand Baroque interiors and a world-class art collection, including works by Turner and Van Dyck. Spend time in Petworth Park, a vast open landscape designed by Capability Brown. The Upper Pond will give you a chance to gaze out over tranquil waters, often with deer grazing nearby, while the Pleasure Garden offers a more intimate setting with benches, flowerbeds, and shaded corners. Choose your ideal location in the park to sit and enjoy your Wicked -themed picnic. Savor popular pink pinwheel wraps, a tortilla wrap filled with beet hummus, goatâs cheese, and pink radish slices, laid on edible rose petals for flairâa true nod to Glindaâs bubbly charm. Sip Defying Gravi-tea sparkling green lemonade, channeling Elphabaâs signature hue. Arriving at your accommodation along the coastline, settle in for a night of peace and quiet."

      "title": "East Sussex - Witness the Coastal Scenery That Mirrors Shiz University Waterways",
      "description": "Picture the arrival scenes in Wicked: For Good at Shiz University, the dramatic chalk Seven Sisters Cliffs, and coastal beauty mirroring the waterways at an institution where friendships were forged, ideals tested, and the seeds of rebellion sown. Neither the Manipulating Madame Morrible, headmistress of Crage Hall, nor carefree Prince Fiyero would argue that the dramatic rising and falling white faces, like waves frozen in time, are nothing short of mesmerizing. Spend your day exploring this scenic destination through wildlife watching to blissful hikes and postcard-perfect homes at Cuckmere Haven. Enjoy a hike along Seven Sisters Walk, a trail that runs from Seaford to Eastbourne, offering panoramic views of the cliffs, sea, and countryside, and set off for a gentle paddle in the peaceful Cuckmere Haven estuary, where the River Cuckmere meets the sea. Explore Birling Gap, a National Trust Site with beach access and a staircase leading down to the pebbled shore. A passion for Elphaba, look out for wildlife among the cliffs and wildflowers, from fulmars to kingfishers and silver-spotted skipper butterflies, as well as the pleasant sight of British cattle roaming the hillside. The location resonates deeply with the emotional tone of Wicked: For Good , with cliffs constantly shaped by wind and sea, mirroring the theme of transformation. Standing at the edge of the world, look out over the horizon and imagine Elphaba and Glindaâs final farewell echoing in the sea breeze."

For a decadent afternoon experience, the table is set for your Wicked -themed afternoon tea at the Tea Lounge at Londonâs Clermont Victoria Hotel. Enjoy a selection of delicious bites created and displayed against a fanciful scene inspired by the musical and movie.

If you are still peckish, a selection of finger sandwiches will fill any gap quite nicely.
