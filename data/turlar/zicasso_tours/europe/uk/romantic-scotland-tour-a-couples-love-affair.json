      "description": "Glasgow is a city of hidden romance emanating from inside the Victorian facades. Your Scotland vacation begins when your private transfer meets you at the airport and escorts you to a luxurious hotel located near Glasgowâs city center. Cobblestone streets pave the old streets. Gothic spires cast shade along the sidewalks. The once industrial city now thrives with contemporary culture, situated on the peaceful banks of the River Clyde. Lush parks and gardens thrive in the open spaces providing a touch of countryside charm to the proud stone edifices. Your guide meets you at the hotel and takes you on a fabulous private tour of the cityscape. At the heart of the antique city center, located in George Square, are 12 statues. Town Hall boasts a 230-foot tall tower dating back to the 1890s. The winding streets take you through the cityâs trendy Merchant City district and Italian Center. People linger in streetside cafes and watch the crowds pass them by. The daily life of Glasgow is as intriguing and enchanting as its history."

      "description": "The imagined sounds of the bagpipe emanate out of the National Piping Centre, which houses the worldâs oldest bagpipe relic. The heritage of the instrument runs strong through the Highlands and Lowlands of the countryside. In the lobby a fireplace crackles with roaring early morning warmth. You indulge in a true Scottish breakfast, sizzling with bacon and a fried egg, accompanied by fresh brewed black tea. After your meal your private transfer meets you in the lobby and takes you away from the energetic city streets. The rolling homes and sprawling streets fade behind the elegant countryside. The green pastures and rolling hills border the ethereal. The Scottish landscape is known as much for its rugged mountains as its romantic ambiance, brimming with vibrant gardens and fairytale castles. After a cruise on Loch Lomond, the largest lake in Scotland, you visit the sensational grounds of Inveraray Castle. The conical towers flank the entry-gates. A gravel walkway crunches beneath your feet and leads to the main door. It is a castle straight out of the storybooks constructed in the 18th century. It remains the ancestral home of the Dukes of Argyll. The interior captivates you, filled with an Armory Hall that holds 1,300 pieces, including muskets, axes, and broadswords. The aroma of freshly manicured crass shifts to lavender. The state dining room shines with elegant maroon carpet and velvet chairs. Portraits of noblemen decorate the walls. The regal ambiance of the entire castle continues flow out of the exceptional interior."

      "description": "Morning in Oban bustles along the harbor. The town sits beneath a 19th century Romanesque structure, a Romantic Period Colosseum. The open arches frame the rising sunlight stretching over the hillside. Fishing boats venture along the firth in search of a fresh and abundant catch. After breakfast, you make your way to the marina and begin a whale watching adventure. The boat weighs anchor; the colorful buildings and lush trees that line the waterway shrink. Boats wade in the calm, royal water. You can hold your partner close in the cool sea breeze. The Firth of Lorn embraces the conservation of uninhabited islands. Sea cliffs tower above the water. Sea eagles circle the air before swooping down to catch an unaware fish. Seal colonies lounge on low-lying rocky shores, their gray and white fur blending into the rugged coastline. Your skipper points into the water. A shadow slowly rises from the water until the Minke whale breaches the surface. The male can grow up to 32 feet long and weigh as much as 10 tons. Their black and purple color glimmers against the water. The splash carries and mists the air. The breeze softens but you continue to hold your partner closer, experiencing the majesty of the natural world together."

      "description": "Wake up in the village of Tobermory. The brightly painted buildings situated against the backdrop of lush trees and navy waters create a distinctively enchanting atmosphere. Indulge in the calm morning along the small town streets. You make your way to the ferry and return to the mainland where your private transfer awaits. Travel north to Fort William, the largest town in the Highlands, where you will board the delightful Jacobite Steam Train. The antique steam engine dates back to the early 20th century. The interior is decorated with comfortable, vintage fabric and cushion. The dining car offers a variety of delicacies in a plush ambiance. The train itself has been featured in the Harry Potter movie series, better known as the Hogwarts Express. You settle into the ride and nuzzle up to your partner. The passing countryside fills the window as you make your way northbound to Mallaig. The view is exceptional, passing over stone bridges that arch over small rapids. Rugged mountains border the graceful sweep of plains. The aroma inside the train car is sweet and delicate. The greenery outside drifts in through the windows. It feels like a private moment between you and your partner, together watching the wonders of the outside world pass you by."

      "description": "The Highlands are renowned for their village life. Wake up in the town of Ballachulish, encircled by dramatic rising mountains of Glencoe. The idyllic destination is tranquil, touching the cold waters of loch Leven. The peaceful sunlight spreads over the stunning scenery. Visit the historic site grounds of the Culloden Battlefield before embarking on a shared tour to experience some of the most treasured flavors of Scotland. Travel through the Grampian Mountains, which include Ben Nevis, one of the largest peaks in the United Kingdom, reaching a height of 4,409 feet above sea level. The air turns crisp and the peak turns rugged. Once over the pass you arrive in Pitlochry and the Blair Athol Distillery. The distillery looks like a cottage. They welcome you with open arms and friendly smile. The faÃ§ade is draped in trimmed vines. A red door leads you inside. The aromas of smoked wood and caramel waft around the copper distilleries. Your guide takes you through the entire whisky making process in an operating that dates back to the late 18th century. At the end of the tour you are invited to taste the layers in a number of different blends. The 2009 Blair Athol has a hint of peaches and spices. Your guide helps you find and gather all the flavors with each taste. It is another unique moment you and your partner are happy to experience together."

      "description": "The history of Pitlochry dates back to the 1700s when the settlement began to shape into a town. The hillsides rise out from the townâs border, brimming with spruce and cypress trees. Victorian architecture lines the streets with large, elegant windows open to passersby. In the northeast Ben Vrackie stands 2,759 feet above sea level and is visible from almost anywhere. Your private guide meets you after breakfast and takes you to the celebrated scenery of Royal Deeside, located in the valley of the River Dee. The trees change from emerald to gold, combining for a glistening effect against the mountains. Arrive at Royal Balmoral Castle, which was once frequented by the British Royal Family in the mid 19th century. The estate was constructed in the 14th century and adorned with baronial extensions in the 1830s. Shaped and strategic vines color the gray stone exterior. The aromas of fresh grass and spruce swirl in the air. The castle is another reminder of historic opulence and luxurious comforts. The Royal Dining Room contains large windows to let in the natural light. Portraits of royalty hang gallantly on the walls. The oak table and chairs glint with glossy coating. The table can hold up to 18 guests, decorated with polished sterling silver candelabras and dishware. You and your partner can imagine the lavish romance of an evening dining at the castle."

      "description": "The countryside around Aberdeenshire is flush with green. The stoic mountains press up against the coastline and create unique blend of cliffs and foothills. After breakfast your private transfer takes you to Glamis Castle, known as the legendary setting for Shakespeareâs âMacbeth.â The stronghold is powerful and mysterious. The grounds are flat, carpeted with attended grass. The castle was constructed in the 14th century, however its present appearance dates back to the 17th century. Queen Elizabeth was born in Glamis Castle in 1900. The towers measure 23 feet tall and over three feet thick. The clock tower contains the castleâs archives, housing a vast history of the castle and the Lyon family. The lowland valley around the edifice encompasses 14,000 acres of land. You and your partner notice a more medieval dÃ©cor and atmosphere surrounding the castle. You are confronted with the reminder that Glamis Caslte remains an elegant and lavish home as opposed to a museum. The interior is as grand and opulent as previous regal and antique estates, however the dramatic stone edifice rising above the trees and flatland creates a stunning juxtaposition. Continue on to St. Andrews, a historic town home to Scotlandâs first university, and also the birthplace of golf."

      "description": "The morning washes over the seaside town and you can see the early morning dew sprinkled across the exceptional greenery. The spires of the university add to the remaining towers of the 12th century St. Andrews Cathedral. After breakfast your private transfer escorts you to Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, and a city filled with a wealth of culture, both cosmopolitan and historic. Edinburgh Castle stands atop Castle Rock, watching over the entire cityscape from its central perch. The city contains a remarkable historic atmosphere, emanating from the cobblestone streets and combination of Georgian and Victorian buildings. Princess Street is the main way of the neighborhood of New Town. The street runs nearly a mile in length and bordered by pleasant gardens and chic shops. Cafes and trickling fountains decorate the street near the traditional Jenners of Edinburgh, the oldest independent department store in the world. The blossoming city winds around you with vivaciousness. Spires and towers rise above the luscious greenery. Greyfriars Bobby is a statue of a Skye terrier erected in the 19th century. The statue was fashioned for, and named after Bobby, a pup who followed his masterâs procession to the churchyard and refused to leave for 14 years. His loyalty and love is forever commemorated."
