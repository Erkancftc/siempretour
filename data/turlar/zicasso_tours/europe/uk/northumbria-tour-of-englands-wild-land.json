      "title": "Hexham â Hadrian's Wall to Lovely Villages",
      "description": "Hadrian's Wall radiates subtle colors and millennia of history. Thousands of years of sun and snow have bleached the stone, resulting in each block having a slightly different hue. As you wander alongside the wall, you can enjoy the wild panoramas that personify the Roman Empire's northern frontier. The village of Hexham rises around an abbey and church that reflect the region's wealth of the 13th century. Charming Bywell is equally hypnotic with the scent of earl grey drifting out of the tea rooms. Between the villages, there is not much, only the roving grassy hills of the north in all their glory."

You will move through the centuries as you discover Cragside, a wonderful collection of Victorian style that juxtaposes the dramatic fortresses. A narrative of warring tribes, plundering leaders, and marks of power will emerge from the layers of history through the glassy lakes and moors."
