      "description": "The Amazon Rainforest is one of the most surprising and rewarding destinations in the world as nature absorbs you in incredible scenery with emerald canopy, winding crystal-clear waters, and lakes echoing with rippling lakes. The pristine scenery can feel like another world as you arrive in Brazil and travel through the vast plains morphing into the lush Amazon that captures the spirit of the untamed wilderness. Your accommodation outside of Alta Floresta demonstrates comfort and calm as you hear a nightly fire crackling or see the glowing red eyes of the YacarÃ© caiman lingering in the distant waters."

      "description": "The day is at your leisure to explore the Amazon as you please, from a walking tour along the trails to canoeing down the placid waterways. For an introduction to the landscape and wilderness, you may venture to the observation towers to search for the active birdlife of the area. The towers nearly blend into the trees and give you the perfect vantage point to find tanagers and toucans, aracaris and parrots. The many layers of the trees will open up, along with possible sightings of lively blue and gold macaws whose raucous calls echo through the forest."

You can paddle leisurely as the calm current of the Cristalino River opens the views to the tree-lined banks. You may see crowned herons scouring the mudflats for food or find spider monkeys rushing across the tree branches. Back on land, you can continue your exploration of the trails as you learn about the floods that feed the wetland forest or listen for the haunting call of howler monkeys."

      "description": "After breakfast, you will travel to Porto Jofre for a different perspective of the Pantanal, the wetlands at the heart of South America spanning the borders of Bolivia, Paraguay, and Brazil. With few people and no real towns, the Pantanal embodies the classic sense of adventure as you travel to reach your riverboat and weigh anchor on the Cuiaba River. Unlike the dense jungle of the Amazon, in the Pantanal, you are more likely able to spot the wildlife on the edges of the waters, from the sinister caiman to the charming capybara."

You can step onto the land with a guide to uncover the mysteries of the jaguar, the largest cat in the Americas. You may spot them from a distance lounging in the trees to escape the dayâs heat or simply see their tail swishing through a tree branch. Jabirus may call out or giant otters may ripple through the waterways before the unobstructed starlight fills the night sky."

Your guide will lead you beneath the star-studded sky as you shine a flashlight over the waters looking for a red flash glinting back. Each red dot indicates a caiman. Instead of relying on your sight, your guide may teach you how to follow your other senses in the darkness as you look for nocturnal flora and fauna."

In the grasslands, deer graze on the lush grass and coati forage for fallen food along the ground. As your guide leads you through the landscape, you may learn about medicinal plants or the soft call of the hidden twittering bird."
