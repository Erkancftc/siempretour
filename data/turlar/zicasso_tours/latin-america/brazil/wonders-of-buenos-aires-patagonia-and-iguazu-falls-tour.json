      "description": "Buenos Aires is a city of movement. The history of tango enlivens the streets with dancers performing out in the open air. Spanish colonial buildings continue to decorate neighborhoods. Cafes set out tables on sidewalks and allow guests to sip their wine as they watch the city pass them by. The aroma of chocolate drifts out of the charming chocolatiers and blends into the scent of browning filo dough from the bakeries. Your flight lands at Ministro Pistarini International Airport. Your private transfer greets you upon your arrival and escorts you into the heart of the city. You settle into your lavish accommodation located in the enchanting neighborhood of Recoleta. The barrio boasts fine architecture and a lush environment. The neoclassical Libreria el Ateneo Grand Splendid is a remarkable bookstore in Recoleta. The building was designed in the 19th century and acted as a theater in the early 20th century with the ability to hold more than 1,000 occupants. It stands in the main gallery today, showcasing the vast display of books encircling the main floor and the upper tiers of the former theater.

On weekends, an artisan market fills the plaza to great local fanfare, showcasing handcrafted leather goods, jewelry, and the aroma of freshly pressed Argentinian coffee. After breakfast, your guide meets you at the hotel. You are eager to set out on a tour of the city and explore the grandeur of Buenos Aires, which was once called, the âParis of South America.â Each barrio in Buenos Aires has a distinctive character. With 47 neighborhoods in total, the charms of the city are endless. Your guide leads you along the marvelous pedestrian street of Avenida de Mayo. The boulevard runs through the center of the cityâs historic center near the presidential mansion of Casa Rosada. The Building Inmobiliaria is unmistakable with its two red domes and Italian neoclassical faÃ§ade. The neo-Gothic building of Palacio Barolo lines the same street in dramatic fashion. Domes, columns, vaults and bronzes create an amalgamation of historic designs with expressive attention to detail to shape the images of Dante Alighieriâs Divine Comedy . The connection to the Italian masterwork is notable in the way the palace grounds are divided to ensure divine numerology."

After breakfast, your private transfer meets you at the hotel lobby and escorts you to the airport for your flight to Puerto Madryn. The city has a small town atmosphere.

A pathway along the beach provides stunning views to the azure waters breaking against the shores of the city."

The water glows indigo against the still shores. Between the months of August and November, sea elephants travel through the small inlet, following the tide, in search of shelter on the quiet shores of the bay. The sea elephants lounge on the shores over the mixture of sand and pebbles. Males average a length of 16 feet and can weigh up to more than 6,600 pounds. During mating season, the males call out to females, making an extraordinary noise that reverberates over the lulling waves. In the distance at Puerto Piramides, golden cliffs rise over the crescent shape of the bay."

      "description": "The sweet aroma of the sea continues to encompass the seaside city. At breakfast, the scent of Argentine coffee accompanies the flakey, buttery texture of medialunas . Your guide meets you at the hotel after your meal. You travel along the coastline to the edges of Punta Tombo. In the warm and longer days of spring, Magellan Penguins travel up the coastline and settle on the beach of Punta Tombo, ranging from September to mid-March. The fauna reservation was created in the 1970s with the intention of protecting the diverse fauna of Argentina and the breeding grounds of the Magellan Penguins. A clear pathway winds around the brush-clad dunes. You can hear the loud squawk of the penguins over the crashing waves. The paths lead over the dunes to the beach, where you find penguin families lounging in the sun, waddling against the current, and diving into the water. They can swim up to nearly five miles per hour, using their fins like wings to gain momentum. They kick their feet as rudders. When they emerge from the water, their black and white feathers glisten in the sunlight."

The city is known as the âEnd of the World,â for its location as the southernmost city in South America and across the globe.

You look back at the city for a remarkable panorama of the Andean peaks dwarfing the cityscape. The mountains in the background add to the water in the foreground for an unparalleled framing of Ushuaia. On Bridges Island, verdant moss blankets boulders. Windswept grasses rise and fall with the rolling hills. The island offers dramatic contrast to the city. The uninhabited landscape opens to a view of the rugged mountaintops in the distance. Large shells inadvertently decorate the shoreline of the island.

At breakfast, you sip a rejuvenating cup of fresh espresso to start the day. Your guide meets you at the hotel and leads you on one of many Patagonia tours to the wondrous grounds of Los Glaciares National Park, home to the Perito Moreno glacier. The national park was established in the 1930s and encompasses more than 2,800 square miles. Lake Argentino, the largest freshwater lake in the country, borders the edges of the Perito Moreno Glacier. The ice forms a narrow channel that raises the water level. After you explore the walkways overlooking the glacier, you step onto a viewing boat that takes you along the strait, known as âIceberg Channel.â The water is crystal clear. The breeze is crisp on your skin. The boat ventures close to the ice cliff of the glacier, which rises an average of 240 feet above the water. Bright blue and white color radiates from the ice. The boat keeps a safe distance from the edge of the ice field, which is one of the few glaciers in Patagonia that is expanding. Icebergs float in the water, evidence of past pieces of the glacier breaking away from the ice field and splashing into the canal."

The day is yours to indulge in the beauty surrounding El Calafate, from sailing on the turquoise glacial waters of Lake Argentino to exploring the handcrafted goods displayed in the city. For a distinctive view of life and culture in Patagonia, you could venture to an Estancia , a ranch that exemplifies the frontier lifestyle of cowboys and ranchers. Vast plains extend to the foothills. Rivers wind along the rolling steppe. Sheep graze on the soft grass. It feels as though you have traveled back in time to an antique version of Argentina. You can saddle up on a horse and follow your guide to the Trocoman River. Trout swim in the water and feed on the reeds. The romantic image of cowboy life becomes clear.

The Argentine side of the park contains trails winding around 81 square miles of verdant trees and splendid riverbanks. You can hear the thundering waters of Iguazu Falls echoing along the pathways. A collection of more than 270 falls tumble over the crescent-shaped cliffs and islets. The paths take you across the bridges and underneath the dangling trees, which open up to multiple views of the staggering waterfalls overtaking the landscape. On the lower footpath, you come to an outlook taking in a smaller waterfall. Refracted light in a powerful water stream bursts into a rainbow. Mist sporadically rises out of the confluence of the waterfall and the riverbed encompassing the viewpoint. Monkeys linger near snack areas in search of discarded food. Both the upper and lower paths provide opportunities to take in the unparalleled natural splendor of Iguazu. When you reach the canyon known as Devilâs Throat, the cascade descends more than 262 feet into the tumult of the whitewater below, encased in the crescent of cliffs."

The wooden bridge carries you over the water to the edge of the cliff. The series of 275 individual waterfalls become clear. Some waterfalls pour over the edges of the upper cliffs with powerful waves. Smaller falls trickle down the precipice with strings of water. The uproarious sound is that of endless rumbling.
