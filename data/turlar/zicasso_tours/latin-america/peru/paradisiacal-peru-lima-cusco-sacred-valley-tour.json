      "description": "In the morning, the dawn will break crisply over the ornate facades of the Spanish-inspired architecture and rough stone of the Inca ruins. Distant mountains will beckon to you with hints of untold adventure. Today, you will embark on an adventure after enjoying an enjoyable breakfast served by the hospitable and attentive hotel staff. These highlands will be yours to enjoy when you make your way to the ruins of Pisac, the Sacred Valley, and the town of Awanacancha.

      "description": "Peru enjoys an abundance of natural resources. Today, you will catch a glimpse of one of those whose importance has decreased little since its origins. Tucked in an Andean gorge, the Incan Salt flats are a series of terraced, spring-fed plains where salt-infused water evaporates, leaving the precious mineral behind for harvesting. You will also visit the bizarre ruins of Moray, where archaeologists discovered massive terraces that texture the slopes in a fashion not found anywhere else in the world. In the afternoon, you will make your way to your hotel, where you will have the remainder of the afternoon to relax and spend at your leisure."
