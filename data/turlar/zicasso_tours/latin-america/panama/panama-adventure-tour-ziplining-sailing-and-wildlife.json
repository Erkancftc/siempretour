Set out with your guide on an exciting tour to explore the wilderness within armâs reach of the urban streets, first with a boat tour to visit Monkey Island. The small island seems to float in Lake Gatun, shines with foliage, and sings with the active calls of white-faced capuchin, Geoggroyâs tamarin, and howler monkeys. You may feel the monkeys watching you as you approach and wander along the jungle terrain, stepping over vines or rustling the leaves. You can continue to a sloth sanctuary to learn more about the slow-moving mammal, its camouflaged fur, and how the sanctuary is helping protect and preserve the wilderness."

At Miraflores, you can witness the quality and vision of engineering on a ship as it rises over 54 feet. You will not only feel the ship moving but may also witness the walls sinking as the water rises.

Walk between historic ruins and enjoy the views spreading out to the bay, accentuated by the sleek design of the modern city. You may feel youâve stepped back in time as you witness architectural designs dating back to the 17th century."
