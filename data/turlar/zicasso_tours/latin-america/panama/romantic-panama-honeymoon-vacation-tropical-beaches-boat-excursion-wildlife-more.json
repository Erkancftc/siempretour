Settle into the city at your leisure and take your time getting comfortable, from visiting the shoreline to walking along the Paseo de las BÃ³vedas, the old seawall known for the briny scent of the sea breeze, the vibrant artisan crafts sold by vendors along the lane, and views of Downtownâs shimmering glass high-rises."

      "description": "The tropical ambiance of Panama City can feel captivating, immersing you in the combination of natural beauty and civil wonder as you make your way to the Panama Canal at the Miraflores Locks. The engineering marvel spans over 50 miles long, with waters rising to nearly 65 feet, depending on the tides. You may board a vessel as it travels through the locks to experience a portion of the Panama Canal and see how it has made trade more accessible and faster between the Atlantic and Pacific. You may continue to Monkey Island and enjoy the lush foliage, quiet waters, and boisterous sounds of four species of monkeys populating the island. You may see white-faced capuchin monkeys moving through the trees or listen to the guttural call of howler monkeys hidden in the canopy."

If you and your partner prefer the sound of crashing waves and the quiet of an isolated corner, you can visit the tidal pools at Cala Este or listen for toucans and parrots in the lush jungle canopy as you lounge on the warm sands. You may be able to partake in a romantic seaside picnic for an intimate and unforgettable oceanside moment. Dip your toes into the cool water for a refreshing change before returning to your resort or continuing on to Playa Catalina for a kayaking excursion on the islandâs calmest bay."

As you sail, the mixture of sunlight and sea breeze can create perfect conditions against the backdrop of passing islands. The boat may weigh anchor at the edge of a coral garden where you can dive into the water in search of sea turtles feeding on the waving sea grass or pods of dolphins passing in the distance."

When you return to the city, your transfer will escort you to your accommodation, where you can relax or explore at your pace for the remainder of the day."
