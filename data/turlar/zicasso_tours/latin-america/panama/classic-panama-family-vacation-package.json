      "description": "Embrace the wonders of Panama City as you and your family wander the city center. Towering buildings line the way for a diverse architectural exploration, while twisted towers lead the way to vast sandy beaches. Discover the family-friendly neighborhood of Amador by bicycle with a ride along the rustic-colored Amador Causeway, admiring the blue-green waters blurring by you. Step inside the Amador Biomuseo, the roof of multi-colored squares resembling haphazardly-placed post-it notes in contrast to its lush green gardens. Kids of all ages can explore the history of Panama and experience exhibitions such as the âliving web,â a 50-foot living sculpture that presents the interconnectedness of plant life, animals, and microorganisms."

      "description": "A day of adventure awaits your family as you set sail to the entrance of the Panama Canal. The Bay of Panama will guide you as the city skyline fades in the distance as you enter the first of two locks. The intriguing and perfectly-timed engineering marvel offers a functional purpose as well as a fascinating and fun geographical exploration. Thunderous white walls of water plummet into rising waters, your vessel seemingly floating up toward the sky. Crossing the calm and shimmering waters of the Miraflores Lake, the rumbling of Pedro Miguel Lock opens you to the snaking Culebra Cut, revealing a day of water wonders and intricate engineering as you enjoy the crisp, cool brush of water drops against your skin."

      "description": "Mimicking monkeys, sleek-like sloths, and the majestic brilliance of butterflies are all on the list of exciting encounters you and your family can enjoy today. Set sail on Gatun Lake, the emerald waters of this freshwater lake carrying a myriad of ships across the Isthmus of Panama, moving you through tropical forest and lush vegetation to Monkey Island. Giggle at the cute, yet cheeky facial gestures of the white-faced capuchin monkey, small in stature, large in attitude. Watch with bated breath as the two-toed sloth hangs suspended from a trusting branch, the hairy creature going nowhere in a hurry, and admire the beauty of butterflies flickering through orchid-filled rainforests."

      "description": "Travel west to the island paradise of Isla Colon in the Bocas del Toro archipelago. Your adventure begins when you step aboard your tender boat, almost parallel to the water. Gaze upon exotic mangrove glades as straggling vines create a curtain-like effect over thick shrubs and trees, the waters lapping against sandy banks. Draw back the vine curtain to reveal an exquisite picture of a white sandy beach separating azure waters from deep green forests with dramatic views across the Caribbean waters as you settle down in a haven far removed from the bustling city scenes."

Art and culture run through the cobbled streets between boutique hotels and bakeries, family eateries, and culinary corners. Take some time to savor a plate of delicious, smooth calamari rings or bite into soft and powdery mamallena dessert, the doughy balls a delight with each bite. Dine under the stars on a rooftop bar in Cathedral Square with views over the Museum Canal while the distant city skyline fades to dark as sounds of lively Panamanian music fill the night."
