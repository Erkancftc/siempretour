The emerald forest that overtakes Cerro de Monserrate rises above the northeast corner of the city to overlook the edge of the La Candelaria, Bogotaâs oldest neighborhood. A funicular travels between the trees to reach the top of the summit as the mountains surround the edges of the sprawling urban expanse dotted with luxurious high-rises and murals that wash over the old walls. Your flight lands at El Dorado International Airport where your private transfer will meet you at baggage claim. Your hotel offers the best of contemporary luxuries inside the cozy ambiance inspired by colonial colors and artistry. Exotic flowers endemic to the Colombian countryside radiate down the halls and in the lobby, with abundant pinks, purples, and reds contrasting with the terracotta walls. The surrounding city offers a glimpse into the cultural amalgamation of Bogota, with Colombians gathering from all around the country inside the nationâs capital.

Frescoes adorn the tripartite doors depicting stoic saints. When you arrive at the museum complex, you will enter into the Museo del Oro, the famous gold museum of Bogota that exhibits the indigenous peopleâs connection to the precious metal.
