      "title": "San Ignacio â Lush Seclusion in the Cayo District",
      "description": "Belize has a scintillating combination of tropical jungle and seaside, Mayan culture and Caribbean lifestyle. Your flight lands at Philip S.W. Goldson International Airport in Belize City. A brief, small flight takes you to the Cayo District on the banks of the Mopan and Macal Rivers. Verdant trees rise around the runway. The aroma of berries and tree bark fill the air. On the hillside, you see cows grazing on the hillside through the trees. Your private transfer meets you at baggage claim and takes you along the narrow, gravel-paved road to your award-winning resort. Your concierge greets you and your partner with freshly squeezed juice made from berries grown on the propertyâs organic farm. You are given a refreshing peppermint towel. You press the cool, fragrant fabric to your neck, which offsets the temperate jungle humidity. A steward takes your bags to your room. From your suite, you can hear the trickling waters of the Macal River running along the banks to towards the foothills of the Maya Mountains. The property encompasses 400-acres and includes a private nature reserve and butterfly farm. You and your partner easily settle into the romantic ambiance set in the jungleâs lushness."

      "title": "San Ignacio â Romance in History at Xunantunich",
      "description": "In the morning, you wake up to the rushing water along the Macal River. Birds chirp in the canopy around the edges of the property. Trogons thrive in the subtropical forest. Their calls consist of monosyllabic whistles and hoots. At breakfast, you sit beneath the thatched-roof open to the natural beauty surrounding the property. You and your partner indulge in an organic meal cooked by a celebrated chef, accompanied by a freshly brewed cup of coffee. After breakfast, you meet your guide at the stables. A number of horses roam freely across the property, rounded up only when guests wish to enjoy time along the trails on horseback. You and your partner saddle-up and make your way along a tranquil, secluded trail to the Mayan site of Xunantunich. You trot through broadleaf forest finding traces of howler monkeys along the way. Your guide points to the discarded shells of tree nuts on the forest floor. You arrive at Xunantunich, which means Stone Woman in the Yucatec Maya language, and dismount your horse. The core of the site encompasses nearly 3230 square feet. More than 26 temples and palaces surround a total of six plazas. El Castillo stands at the heart of the main plaza. It was erected in 800 AD and stands 130 feet tall. It is one of the tallest buildings in Belize. The pyramid stands beneath a series of terraces. Friezes depict the birth of a god connected to the royal family, along with various versions of creation, including the tree of life. Your guide explains that the tree is significant because the roots touch the underworld, the stump remains on earth, and the branches reach to the heavens. You and your partner find shared splendor in the mythology and history of the ancient site."

      "title": "San Ignacio â Beauty of the Blue",
      "description": "In the morning, the water from the infinity pool drips into a lower pond, acting as a fountain. The sound accentuates the verdant atmosphere and nearby river. After breakfast, your transfer meets at the lobby and takes you along the Hummingbird Highway. The forest vegetation opens to citrus groves along the roadside. Oranges and limes add a fruity aroma to the jungle ambiance. You pass the entrance to Cockscomb Wildlife Sanctuary and Jaguar Preserve and soon arrive at the entrance to Blue Hole National Park. You follow the trail to a stairway leading you through the forest. Birds twitter in the treetops, but the landscape is otherwise quiet creating the feeling of privacy. A bright, sapphire blue glows through the foliage. Sunlight beams through the treetop and reflects off the waterâs surface, making the pool look more like glass. Blue-crowned marmots take reprieve on the vines. Their colorful tail feathers dangle like tassels. The sinkhole was formed after an underground limestone cave collapsed. The surface water is located approximately 100 feet below the surrounding jungle. The pool drops another 25 feet into the underground cave system. You and your partner dip your toes into the water first. The subterranean temperature contrasts the warm forest providing a refreshing, sensual touch."

      "title": "San Ignacio â Adventure Together",
      "description": "In the early light of the morning, butterflies flutter around the farm located on the property. A local guide is happy to show visitors the life cycle of the butterfly, from the pale green egg stage to the dazzling indigo colors radiating from its wings. After breakfast, your private guide meets you in the lobby once again, eager to take you on a fabulous adventure to the Barton Creek Caves. Mayans once used the caverns for ceremonial purposes. You and your partner step into a canoe and make your way along the quiet, emerald waters. Your guide paddles close-by, explaining the natural history of the region and the cultural heritage of the caves. Stalactites dangle from the cave opening resembling an open mouth with teeth. Vines from the growing trees wrap around the textured cliff. The sunlight fades. You turn on your headlamps to see the width of the cavern and its cathedral-like qualities. The air is cool. When you touch the walls, you find the slick surface as cold as the temperature. Stalactites drip down to head level. You and your partner weave around them. You can hear water dripping into the subterranean river. Your guide points to Mayan pottery shards almost overtaken by the earth. The cave travels nearly 21,000 feet through the mountain. In 2005, an exploration team found the cave to meander almost four miles deep. You couldnât imagine a better way to explore a subterranean river system than with your partner, listening to the water ripple."

      "title": "Ambergris Caye â One More Taste of the Jungle",
      "description": "In the morning, the breakfast has a succulent and invigorating aroma. Roasted coffee and fresh fruits bring a bitter and sweet scent to the jungle air. After your meal, you could spend time enjoying the property or visit the town of San Ignacio. At Branch Mouth, you can see the meeting of the Mopan and Macal Rivers. The Mopan travels from Guatemala from Mountain Pine Ridge. The confluence marks the beginning of the Belize River, which flows out to sea along the northeast of the country. Before you make your way to the airport, you and your partner decide to take part in a coupleâs Mayan cooking class. The roots of the heritage remain strong throughout Central America. You meet your instructor ready for a spellbinding experience on the doorstep of ancient Mayan cities. The tradition of the cuisine emanates through the cooking process. You use a stone rolling pin to shape maize, learning how to make fresh tortillas first and foremost. You can hear them sizzle as they cook on the stone pan, set atop a roaring fire. After your class, your private transfer escorts you to the local airport for your flight to Belize City. You board another brief flight to San Pedro on Ambergris Caye, where you indulge in your seaside suite overlooking the gentle waves splashing against the white sand."

      "title": "Ambergris Caye â Submerging into Splendor",
      "description": "In the morning, you can stand on your private balcony and enjoy a morning drink while looking out onto the water. A pier juts out from the beach pointing in the direction of the horizon. Boats speed by in the distance. A sailboat catches the breeze and cruises along the turquoise water. After breakfast, you make your way to the jetty to meet your skipper and venture out on a private snorkeling excursion. You catch the aroma of the salty, sweet ocean. Your guide explains the reason for the variation in blue hues, ranging from crystal clear indigo to cobalt, depending on the depth of the ocean floor. After a brief journey, you arrive at your first snorkel location, Mexico Rocks. The section is located in a shallows midway between the Barrier Reef and Ambergris Caye, reaching a maximum depth of 12 feet. You follow your guide floating above the coral. Brain coral, named for its meandering ridges resembling a brain, grow out of the sand. Sea fans wave in the drifting current. The visibility allows you to see up to 30 feet in front of you. A large spiny lobster peeks out from beneath the coral crests. Their long, thin, spiny antennae differentiate the lobster from other closely related groups. In the distance, your guide points out the shell of a green turtle swimming quickly away. The spectacular show beneath the water is something you and your partner will always share."

      "description": "The mornings on Ambergris Caye are relaxed and tranquil. A local fruit market set beneath a thatched roof located alongside the main road displays lush, local produce for passersby. Pineapple and mangoes add to the illustrious colors of the island. The day is yours to enjoy San Pedro, Ambergris Caye, and the surrounding islands as you and your partner desire. Learn a new sport with a kitesurfing lesson, using the breeze to lift you and the board from the water for seconds at a time. Step aboard a catamaran for an unforgettable sailing adventure taking you around the islands. You and your partner can spend time together at the spa, taking in a romantic coupleâs massage. You step out into the serene setting along the pier. The water brushes against the support posts below. The scent of the sea blends with the coconut aroma of the room, with an open view to the horizon. You and your partner lay side by side listening to the soothing sounds of the shore. You both relax instantly, enjoying the feeling of all your tension washing away. You forget about the life waiting for you off the island and find yourself embracing the present with your partner, indulging in island life."

      "title": "Belize City â Romance from Here, There, and Back Again",
      "description": "In the morning, canât help but recall the romantic beach dinner you and your partner shared the previous evening. You sat at a table on the beach looking out to the water and listening to the waves. You sipped champagne, dug your toes into the sand, and felt like you arrived at your own private beach separate from the rest of the world. Today you relive that sensation at breakfast, enjoying a savory meal accompanied by the pleasant aromas of papaya and banana. When you are ready, your private transfer meets you in the hotel lobby and escorts you to the San Pedro airport for your brief flight to Belize City. You land at Philip S.W. Goldson International Airport with plenty of time to check-in to your flight home. You prepare for your departure, knowing that you will soon return to Belize to soak in more of the romance beneath the jungle trees and along the white sand shores."
