  "generalInfo": "Jaguars have for a long time been regarded as one of the most elusive and difficult animals in the world to see. However recently they have been revealing their secrets to dedicated scientists and hardened wildlife watchers in the Pantanal region of Brazil. <br/><br/>On this tour you will be taken into the heart of this region and with the help of expert local guides we have a 100% record of seeing these big cats. Whilst in the Pantanal you can expect to see giant otters, capybara, hyacinth macaws and of course Jaguars alongside hundred of other species. <br/><br/>By staying in Porto Jofre and not on the Transpanteiro you will right on the jaguars doorstep. And with a past average record of 1.1 jaguars per day in the Pantanal you are in safe hands with this tour.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife watching holidays that focus on one specific rare or elusive species of mammals. These trips are specialised in that they have a distinct focus, a species which is the overall target for the tour. But of course we are exploring the wonderful and diverse natural environment and many other species can also be seen. However this is the only specialist mammal tour focusing on both the northern and southern the Pantanal.<br/><br/>On this tour you will firstly visit the northern Pantanal and our focus will be on the mighty jaguar as well as the wonderful and vocal giant otters and the incredible diversity and abundance of birds. We will then visit the southern Pantanal and our focus will then shift to the Brazilian tapir and giant anteater (among others).<br/><br/>All of this will be done with the expert guidance of local naturalist guides and where possible our own zoologist guides (zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) and wildlife researchers also. All you have to do is to get in touch with your budget and your group size and where you would like to go and we will come back to you with an itinerary and quote for your perfect specialist Pantanal wildlife watching tour.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Cuiaba and Campo Grande. There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers and safaris. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Brazil. Your naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, guided walks, park entrance fees and permits. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the field. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>During September to October the weather in the Brazilian Pantanal is hot and dry (although it is the end of the dry season and the occassional early rain can occur). The temperatures during the day and night are hot and they heat up quickly in the morning. At this time of year the rainy season is approaching and whilst rain is rare at this time of year it is not unheard of for a tropical storm to blow in.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• Our local naturalist guides have their ears to the ground and are constantly scouting new areas for rare and unusual wildlife. So we know of all of the locations to visit and we have the adaptability to change our plan (if needed) to take advantage of better wildlife watching in other locations whilst on the trip.<br/>• We will stay in a variety of accommodation when on this tour, from quaint boutique style guest houses, larger hotel chains to hotels and lodges. <br/>• Spend all the daylight hours searching for wildlife as well as spotlighting as many mammal species are nocturnal.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our specialist mammal watching tours give us a great success rate of seeing our targeted species (as well as many others). We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Brazil so that we can try and find and observe mammals and many more species. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Brazil at other times of year and focusing on other groups of wildlife such as birds, reptiles &amp; amphibians or even botany as well as other groups of animals or even specific species such as jaguars, maned wolves, giant armadillos etc. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour focused on 1 part of the Northern Pantanal. the major river ways of the Porto Jofre area. The entry and exit point for this trip is the city of Cuiaba. <br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from a boat which cruises the rivers of the Pantanal. So no special physical fitness is needed..<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 15 Years Old",

      "description": "Transpantaniero - Travelling & Wildlife Watching After breakfast at the hotel you will leave at around 07:30am and depart for the Pantanal, this is a 1.5 hour drive to reach Transpantaneira Road, which is one of the best places in the world to spot wildlife (rivalling anywhere in Africa or India). Whilst travelling we will stop several times in order to appreciate the spectacular flora and fauna. We will be looking for hyacinth macaws, giant anteaters, capybara and other bird life but one species we will have no difficultly in finding is the Yacre caiman. There are around 20 million of these in the Pantanal and at this time of year they are everywhere. There are some excellent wildlife photography opportunities along the way and we may stop around half way to have lunch or if we are making good time head all of the way to Porto Jofre before having lunch. Then when we arrive at Porto Jofre we will check into the hotel and if there is still some time we may head out to look for wildlife (including Jaguars) nearby the hotel on the rivers. (breakfast and dinner included)"

So that the whole day is not as long as it could be. On the way back to Cuiaba we will once again have some wildlife watching along the Transpantaneiro Highway. Once we arrive back in Cuiaba you will check back into the same hotel as on your arrival. (breakfast is the only meal included today)"
