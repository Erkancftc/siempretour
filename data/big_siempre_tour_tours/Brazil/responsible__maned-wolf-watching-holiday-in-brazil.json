  "generalInfo": "Travel to the most reliable places in the world to see the stunning and unique Maned Wolf. The fox on stilts lives in the Brazilian grasslands and this tour focuses on this species.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife watching holidays that focus on one specific rare or elusive species. These trips are specialised in that they have a distinct focus, a species which is the overall target for the tour. But of course we are exploring the wonderful and diverse natural environment and many other species can also be seen. However this is the only specialist tour for Maned Wolves in the world, and this safari offers the greatest chances of seeing this species in the wild.<br/><br/>The Amazon rainforest or perhaps the vast wetland ecosystem of the Pantanal are what spring to mind first when people think of Brazil for wildlife watching. However there are many other ecosystems and some of them are unique to Brazil. One such ecosystem is the Cerrado. This is Brazil’s answer to the African savanna. A large grassland ecosystem in central Brazil. And this is the habitat of our target species the wonderful Maned Wolf.  <br/>Resembling a fox on stilts it is one of the strangest looking animals in the world and this trip travels to the best places in the world to see them. There is of course a chance of seeing many other species in the Cerrado, and as well as visiting the Cerrado we will also visit a remote monastery where the monks have been leaving fruit out for the local “street dogs” for decades. It was only when one monk saw that they were in fact Maned Wolves that this place become famous. And today it I possible to visit to see this incredible animal very close.<br/><br/>Guided by expert naturalist guides and visiting stunning locations full of wildlife, we will explore the Cerrado and aim to showcase the unusual Maned Wolf and many other species. All you have to do is to get in touch with your budget and your group size and where you would like to go and we will come back to you with an itinerary and quote for your perfect specialist Maned Wolf watching tour.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Cuiaba and Belo Horizonte. There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers and safaris. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Brazil. Your naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, guided walks, park entrance fees and permits. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the Cerrado. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>During September to October the weather in the Brazilian Cerrado grasslands is hot and dry with plenty of blue skies during the day. The temperatures during the day and night are hot and they heat up quickly in the morning. At this time of year the rainy season is approaching and whilst rain is rare at this time of year it is not unheard of for a tropical storm to blow in.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• Our local naturalist guides have their ears to the ground and are constantly scouting new areas for rare and unusual wildlife. So we know of all of the locations to visit and we have the adaptability to change our plan (if needed) to take advantage of better wildlife watching in other locations whilst on the trip.<br/>• We will stay in a variety of accommodation when on this tour, from quaint boutique style guest houses, larger hotel chains to hotels and lodges. <br/>• Spend all the daylight hours searching for wildlife as well as spotlighting as the maned wolf is rather nocturnal as well as diurnal.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our specialist wildlife tours for a particular species (the Maned Wolf in this case) give us a great success rate of seeing our targeted species (as well as many other). We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Brazil so that we can try and find and observe Maned Wolves and many more species. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Brazil at other times of year and focusing on other species such as jaguars, giant otters, giant anteaters, tapirs, rainforest primates and many other species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour focused on 2 particular sites, firstly the Cerrado ecosystem which is best encompassed in Emas National Park and then a remote monastery which has a small population of habituated maned wolves living around their grounds. <br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from a vehicle and so the trip requires no special hiking experience or a specific level of physical fitness. This is a very easy trip to undertake.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 15 Years Old<br/><br/>Some images on this page are by:<br/>By Aguará - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=40357029<br/>By Clodomiro Esteves Junior [CC BY-SA 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0)], from Wikimedia Commons<br/>By Robin Müller - Self-photographed, CC BY-SA 2.0 de, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=7196161",

The real treat for people staying here occurs at dusk when then a small population of local maned wolves visit the grounds to feed on the fruit and dog food left for them by the monks. This special relationship started many years ago when the monks left some of their leftover food out for the stray dogs of the town. However it was not the stray dogs that showed up but instead the rarely seen maned wolves. They have since been regular visitors. (breakfast and dinner only today)."
