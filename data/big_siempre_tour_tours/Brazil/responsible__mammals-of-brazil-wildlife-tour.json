  "generalInfo": "Brazil is a vast country with many different ecosystems and incredible biodiversity. This trip offers the chance to travel to three of the most diverse ecosystems, the Pantanal, Amazon Rainforest and the Cerrado savanna. All of this locations will be explored with expert guides in search of he best mammal life Brazil has to offer.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife watching holidays that focus on one specific rare or elusive species of mammals. These trips are specialised in that they have a distinct focus, a species which is the overall target for the tour. But of course we are exploring the wonderful and diverse natural environment and many other species can also be seen. However this is the only specialist mammal tour focusing on the Pantanal, Amazon and Cerrado available.<br/><br/>The Amazon rainforest or perhaps the vast wetland ecosystem of the Pantanal are what spring to mind first when people think of Brazil for wildlife watching. However there is one other large and mammal rich ecosystem in Brazil, in fact one that is unique to this huge country; the Cerrado. This is Brazil’s answer to the African savanna. A large grassland ecosystem in central Brazil. And this is the habitat of one of our highly targeted species the wonderful Maned Wolf.  <br/>There are some species which are found in two or even three of these locations, but each of our targeted ecosystems are home to some particularly targeted species. Firstly in the northern Pantanal we will focus on the mighty jaguar as well as the wonderful and vocal giant otter, in the southern Pantanal our focus shifts to the Brazilian tapir and giant anteater (among others), when in the southern Amazon we will look into the trees for a wealth of primate species as well as sloths and then in the grasslands of the cerrado we focus on maned wolves and armadillos.<br/><br/>All of this will be done with the expert guidance of local naturalist guides and where possible our own zoologist guides and wildlife researchers also. All you have to do is to get in touch with your budget and your group size and where you would like to go and we will come back to you with an itinerary and quote for your perfect specialist Brazilian mammal watching tour.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Cuiaba. There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers and safaris. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - a zoologist is not always available, so please inquire first if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip) who would escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Brazil. Your naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, guided walks, park entrance fees and permits. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the field. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>During September to October the weather in the Brazilian Pantanal and Cerrado ecosystems is hot and dry (although it is the end of the dry season and the occassional early rain can occur). The temperatures during the day and night are hot and they heat up quickly in the morning. At this time of year the rainy season is approaching and whilst rain is rare at this time of year it is not unheard of for a tropical storm to blow in.<br/>The Amazonian rainforest weather is pretty standard all year around with hot, humid conditions punctuated by regular rainfall.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.• Our local naturalist guides have their ears to the ground and are constantly scouting new areas for rare and unusual wildlife. So we know of all of the locations to visit and we have the adaptability to change our plan (if needed) to take advantage of better wildlife watching in other locations whilst on the trip.<br/>• We will stay in a variety of accommodation when on this tour, from quaint boutique style guest houses, larger hotel chains to hotels and lodges. <br/>• Spend all the daylight hours searching for wildlife as well as spotlighting as many mammal species are nocturnal.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our specialist mammal watching tours give us a great success rate of seeing our targeted species (as well as many others). We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Brazil so that we can try and find and observe mammals and many more species. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Brazil at other times of year and focusing on other groups of wildlife such as birds, reptiles &amp; amphibians or even botany as well as other groups of animals or even specific species such as jaguars, maned wolves, giant armadillos etc. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour focused on 4 particular locations, firstly two ecosystems in the Pantanal, the northern and southern as well as the southern Amazonian and then the Cerrado and in particular, Emas National Park. <br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from a vehicle (4x4 or boat) and so the trip requires no special hiking experience or a specific level of physical fitness. This is a very easy trip to undertake. There are some optional activities from horse back if you wish and walking, however the walks are not particularly long and there are no steep inclines.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 15 Years Old",
