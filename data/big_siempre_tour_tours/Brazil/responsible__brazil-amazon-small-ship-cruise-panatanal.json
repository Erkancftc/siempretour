  "generalInfo": "We highly recommend our 7-night Amazon River Expedition Cruise on the Aria Amazon where you may experience our most luxurious and comprehensive Amazon journey among the Amazon River’s three powerful tributaries: the Marañon, the Ucayali, and the Puinahua as well as several hidden black water lakes.<br/><br/>Enjoy a tour by skiff of the Yacapana Isles, the “Isles of the Iguana”. Meet the gray and pink freshwater dolphins of the Yarapa River. Visit Madgalena Village and her giant water lilies and meet the Cocama Indians of Puerto Prado. Travel down the Ucayali River spotting monkeys and learn about the Amazon River headwaters. Probe deep within the Nauta Caño within Pacaya-Samiria Reserve, known as the mirrored forest, fish for piranha in Charo Lake and learn about sustainable resource management projects in Amazonia.<br/><br/>• Low Water Season (June through October) vs. High Water Season (November Through May)<br/><br/>If seeing glorious Amazon rainforest at its lushest and getting up close to lots of birds and mammals (and enjoying slightly cooler temperatures) sounds most attractive, then December to May might be your best choice.<br/><br/>If jungle hikes and spotting exotic migratory birds perched on trees between flights across Amazonia appeals most to you, while still having the chance to see capuchin monkeys, kinkajou, and other mammals, and going on great fishing expeditions, you might be happier choosing the warmer, low water season.",
