    "generalInfo": "The Amazon might be a mighty river, but it doesn’t mean you should explore it on a massive boat. On a smaller vessel you can get into the small tributary rivers, too, where it’s much easier to spot wildlife on the shore and get away from the main settlements. This custom-built river boat is designed to be able to creep up hidden channels, to see a side to the Amazon that not everyone gets to experience.<br/><br/>The Ria Negro tributary is the largest river to flow into the Amazon. It’s flanked by forests that haven’t changed for millions of years, but which are always growing and bristling with new life. There are huge boughs draped with vines and trembling orchids. You’ll spend the first days of the cruise on the Ria Negro, before encountering the Amazon itself. <br/><br/>Each day there are multiple excursions: forest walks, village visits, stops in river trading towns and lazy afternoons spent fishing. Don't be worried about piranhas – you'll eat them before they’ll eat you. You might come across them as an appetiser, and you can fish for them in the river. At night, you might spend the evening drinking caipirinhas, or you might slip out in a launch and glide through the darkness, listening out for nocturnal creatures and looking up at a star-filled sky. <br/>",

We depart on the Rio Negro and as the vessel glides upstream we will have our first talk about Amazon environments. By late afternoon we enter one of the world’s largest river island systems, the Anavilhanas Archipelago. The boat will weave along a winding channel with rainforest on both sides in a riot of brilliant vegetation. Weather permitting, we will go for a launch excursion in the gnarled and dense flooded forest along the river’s edge. We may see some Squirrel Monkeys and we may hear the other-worldly growls of Howler Monkeys echoing through the primitive rainforest. The Amazon has one of the greatest collection of birds in the world and we are sure to see some of these brightly colored jewels perched in the treetops. We return to the M/Y Tucano for hors d’oeuvres on the observation deck and a toast to the rainforest sunset. Following dinner we will embark in our launches in search of nocturnal creatures such as the Caiman, the Amazon’s crocodilians.

We drive north from here into the Amazon proper and Jardim d’Amazonia – a relaxing Amazon jungle lodge, set in its own gardens in the heart of dense rainforest and on an Amazonian tributary. An astonishing 590 bird species have been catalogued here alongside some astonishingly rare primates here and nowhere is better for spotting animals in the forest.

Situated along the banks of the Cuiabá River, this tiny hamlet is the gateway to the world’s largest tropical wetland – this South American Serengeti and Okavongo, offering the best opportunities for seeing wildlife in the Americas. One of the main attractions of Porto Jofre is the chance to see jaguars in their natural habitat. The Pantanal is home to the highest density of jaguars on the planet, and the area around Porto Jofre provides one of the best chances to observe these majestic predators. These big cats are often seen lounging along riverbanks, hunting caimans, or swimming across channels, making boat safaris a popular and effective way to spot them. Beyond jaguars, Porto Jofre’s rich biodiversity includes giant otters, capybaras, toucans, macaws, and countless other species of birds and mammals. The region’s lush landscapes, with its mosaic of rivers, lakes, and forests, create a stunning backdrop for wildlife photography and eco-tourism. Visiting Porto Jofre offers an unforgettable experience, immersing travellers in the raw and awe-inspiring beauty of the Pantanal. The total driving time to Porto Jofre is approximately 5 hours, along a road cutting through the heart of the wilderness, where we will stop frequently to see wildlife and with a stop for lunch along the way (not included). On arrival after checking-in, we will take a boat trip on the river to spot jaguars at their favourite time of day – the late afternoon and early evening. Alex will help you with wildlife photography throughout our Pantanal stay. Accommodation: Santa Rosa Pantanal"

In the dry season, jaguars are most easily spotted on the exposed beaches of the rivers – a once-in-a-lifetime experience! Other wildlife commonly seen on the river are capybara and Pantanal black caiman, a different species to those we will have seen in the Amazon. We will almost certainly also see giant jabiru storks, rare agami herons, black-collared hawks, giant otters and a proliferation of other wading and water birds. We will have full day outings by motorboat to explore the rivers and streams, resting for lunch. You will need plenty of water and sun protection today.

Piuval has been successful in attracting jaguars to the property in recent years, making it one of the best locations in the region for wildlife stays. There are resident tapirs and nowhere is better for seeing giant anteaters. The total driving time is approximately 2.5 hours, and we can enjoy stops along the way to take photographs of the many wild animals we will encounter. Upon arrival at Pousada Piuval, we will drop off our bags and have lunch before leaving for jeep and walking safari. We will return to the lodge at sunset, ensuring we capture some great shots along the way. Alex will be available today for wildlife photography tutorials. Accommodation: Pousada Piuval"

After breakfast we will transfer north to the little-visited region of Bom Jardim, an area of open savannahs and cerrado woodlands filled with flowering trees. The cerrado – which is made up of dry, semi-deciduous forest is one of South America’s most threatened biomes, with distinct species from the Amazon and Pantanal. Bom Jardim is famous for its lakes and glassy-clear rivers, where it’s possible to snorkel alongside huge schools of fish and float over a river bed dotted with brightly-speckled fresh water stingrays. There is nowhere like it. At sunset we will visit the Lagoa das Araras; a lake ringed with buriti palm trees, which provide nests for hundreds of macaws and other parrots. Sunset over the lake to the sound of their raucous song is extraordinary – both for the proliferation of birds and the gorgeous colours in the sky. Buriti trees lose their crowns when they die, thereby leaving hollow stems that form the perfect habitats for these birds to set up their nests and breed. The reflection of the sky in the water makes the landscape even more spectacular. Especially as the sky turns from deep blue to golden before, the sun sinking red and the sky fading into a night brilliant with stars. Accommodation: Reino Encantado – Nobres"

After breakfast, we will take a short drive to the Salobra River, where it emerges from the ground as series of astonishingly clear springs. After a short walking safari (where we hope to see agoutis and paca), we will don our wetsuits and snorkels for a leisurely float for around a kilometre. The aquatic life is astonishing. At the end of the river, we will walk back the lodge along the trail past a series of springs, with another good chance of seeing paca, agoutis, armadillos and tamandua anteaters. In the afternoon we will have further wildlife excursions before retiring in the evening after another glorious sunset. Accommodation: Reino Encantado – Nobres."

        "description": "Nobres – Brazilian Amazon – 20/10/2026. This morning we transfer north into the Amazon Basin and a unique Amazon jungle lodge Jardim da Amazonia; combining comfort with unique access to the world’s greatest tropical forest. Jardim (Portuguese for garden) is one of the most inspiring ecotourism projects in South America – an island of pristine southern Amazonian rainforest standing over a clear-water tributary of the Tapajos river (one of the largest affluents of the Amazon itself). There are mammals everywhere at Jardim – paca and agouti grazing the lawns, huge herds of almost tame capybara, margays and ocelots in the forest, and even jaguar and puma. A shy tapir comes to steal cashew fruits from trees near the bedrooms in the dead of night. Careful you don’t startle him. The birds are even better. According to E-Bird, Jardim is one of the Top 4 hotspots in Brazil for diversity, with an impressive 562 species recorded just on the hotel grounds. The Jardim provides an ecological corridor (in an area depleted by soya, planted mainly for European cattle feed), for a string of endangered Amazon species including Umbrellabird and critically endangered Cone-billed Tanager (an endemic described in 1939, based on a single specimen). Beautiful red-capped black-girdled barbets, flame-crested manakins and dot-eared coquettes (all vulnerable or endangered) flit in the trees. Arriving at this private reserve by car is an incredible experience. The road from Nobres takes three to four hours to drive (with stops along the way), and is lined by soya, stretching to the horizon across the ceaseless plains. Thunderstorms flicker in the distance and every hour or so you pass through a new agricultural town full of Stetsons and pickups. Then the forest begins. A turnoff leads onto a dirt track into Jardim da Amazônia and cuts immediately into thick jungle, exuberant and full of life. Birds dart in the trees and after a few miles the forest clears to reveal a beautiful house, set in tropical gardens and sitting on a lake at the bend of a healthy Amazon River. Behind are a cluster of little boutique cabins. Our three-night stay at the Jardim will involve a range of activities, with guided walks, canoeing, rainforest hikes and wildlife watching. And there’s a lovely freshwater pool. Accommodation: Jardim da Amazonia"

Meet the gray and pink freshwater dolphins of the Yarapa River. Visit Madgalena Village and her giant water lilies and meet the Cocama Indians of Puerto Prado. Travel down the Ucayali River spotting monkeys and learn about the Amazon River headwaters. Probe deep within the Nauta Caño within Pacaya-Samiria Reserve, known as the mirrored forest, fish for piranha in Charo Lake and learn about sustainable resource management projects in Amazonia.<br/><br/>• Low Water Season (June through October) vs. High Water Season (November Through May)<br/><br/>If seeing glorious Amazon rainforest at its lushest and getting up close to lots of birds and mammals (and enjoying slightly cooler temperatures) sounds most attractive, then December to May might be your best choice.<br/><br/>If jungle hikes and spotting exotic migratory birds perched on trees between flights across Amazonia appeals most to you, while still having the chance to see capuchin monkeys, kinkajou, and other mammals, and going on great fishing expeditions, you might be happier choosing the warmer, low water season.",

    "generalInfo": "Brazil has an amazing variation of landscapes, eco-systems and culture. The Amazon jungle and Pantanal boast amazing wildlife, the Atlantic Rainforest provides a beautiful tropical ambiance full of flora and fauna, the many National Parks offer breathtaking landscapes with natural waterfalls and extraordinary rock formations. And Brazil’s 7000 miles of coastline means that there are thousands of incredible beaches.  <br/><br/>Brazilians are friendly, hospitable, love life and a party. Brazil’s rich African and Indigenous heritage is fused in every part of Brazilian culture together with European influences, particularly in religion, art, music, dance and food.  This can be experienced directly on the street, in the nightlife and in many of the traditional festivals and celebrations. Brazil will touch you with its passion, sounds, flavours, and colours, the people will enchant you with their liveness and joy. <br/><br/>The most famous festival is of course Carnival which is celebrated allover Brazil from Olinda, Recife, Salvador, Rio de Janeiro up to small villages as Paraty with its typical Bloco de Lama (mud carnival). However, there's much more to the Brazilian calendar. Some Brazil's festivals and events are Semana Santa - the Brazilian Holy Week, Festas Juninas, Festa do Divino, Festa Nacional do Índio, LGBT Pride Parade in São Paulo, worship of Yemaha during the Reveillon which is the celebration of the Brazilian New Year.<br/><br/>And besides the overwhelming landscapes there are so many beautiful places to stay! From floating lodges on the river, treehouses, mountain- eco lodges, guesthouses in colonial mansions, fazendas, pousadas in all sorts and kinds up to top boutique hotels.<br/><br/>One of the extra reasons to visit Brazil is that it is an excellent destination for eco-tourism, of which the Amazon, Pantanal and all the National Parks are of particular interest. Sustainable tourism is in strong development with energy saving, waste recycling, agricultural and local education initiatives.<br/><br/>When you would like to visit the Pantanal and watching Jaguars is absolutely on your priority list, you have to go to the North Pantanal and this we have included in this holiday for you! The ultimate trip for wildlife lovers, this jaguar holiday in the Pantanal Brazil includes seeing jaguars in the wild. Our expert private guides have tracked jaguars for the BBC, National Geographic and the Discovery Channel. Our trips have had 99% success rate for several years, with multiple sightings of jaguars and cubs in one or two days. When going to the North Pantanal for Jaguar wildlife watching you can go as well for hiking in the Chapada Guimareas. We have a snorkeling excursion in this chapada as an alternative for the snorkeling at Bonito in the south Pantanal. When you wish to combine both the best of the North with the South Pantanal you can fly with a small Cessna plane over the Pantanal from the north to the south or vica versa, directly from pousada to pousada. We arrange the flight for solo travelers, families or small parties. You are picked up at your lodge pousada and will fly in a spectacular flight over the Pantanal directly to your new destination. When you love birdwatching please contact us and we can send you special itineries exclusively for birdwatching in Brazil, Colombia and Panama.<br/><br/>The itinery below can be fully tailor made and is one of the three itineries we have developed for observing jaguars in the Pantanal combined with the Amazon. In the other two itineries we offer snorkeling at the crystal clear waters of Bonito eventually with visiting cave Anhumas, a small waterfall Boca da Onça and wildlife observation in the South Pantanal, outdoor activities at Chapada Veadeiros and hiking with birdwatching at NP Itatiaia. Added can be as well another stay and bird watching in the Atlantic rainforest at Cachoeira de Macuco with Regua lodge.<br/><br/>And at last Brazil can be the start or end of a tailor made trip along the greatest attractions in Latin America. You can combine the Galapagos islands, Machu Picchu and the Uyunyi saltflats with a visit to Rio de Janeiro.  A trip may include also Easter Island in Chile. You can go hiking or skiing in Patagonia and combine this with a beach holiday at Rio, Paraty and Ilha Grande. We offer tailor made travels for Cuba, Colombia, Panama, Mexico, Bolivia, Brasil, Peru, Ecuador with Galapagos, Chile with Easter island, Argentina and Venezuela. Note that with a tailor made trip we can offer 10% discounts on public prices for Galapagos and Antarctica cruises.

        "description": "The Pantanal is a huge flat wetland area that is as large as France. During the rainy season (October - March), the rivers burst out of their banks and cause a massive swampy landscape (Pantano = swamp), where the slightly elevated pieces stay as islands. In the dry season the water pulls back and numerous lakes and mud puddles remain where the wildlife is concentrated. This annual seasons have created a unique ecosystem. The landscape consists of alternating grassland and forest with a very diverse animal life. It has the highest concentration of wildlife in all of America ! Some of the birds you might see are ibises, parrots, herons, cormorants, kingfishers, jabirus (giant storks), spoonbills, hyacinth & red macaw, hawks and kites. Besides the many alligators & capybaras (the largest rodent in the world), you may see anteaters, otters and howling monkeys. With some luck you will see wild pigs, deer, armadillos, tapirs, crab-eating fox, anacondas and maybe a jaguar or other wild cats ! You can add more days at other pousadas as boutique Pousada Xaraes or have a night safari at a basic pousada with a chance of 90% seeing jaguars or other felines as ocelot & margay hunting in open rice fields in only one night safari.

    "generalInfo": "With such a giant of a country, it’s difficult to know where to start – Brazil has such a wealth and diversity of experiences that it’s impossible to include them all in one trip. We’ve designed this tour to encompass some of its best, from those you’ve undoubtedly heard of, to those that are a little more ‘unusual’.<br/><br/>We start in the coastal city of Salvador, a centre for the country’s Afro-Brazilian population and home to some fascinating customs. We delve into the indigenous religion of candomble – a mixture of traditional African and European beliefs – see how the martial art of capoeira is practiced, and explore the city’s colonial centre.<br/><br/>We then continue into the sublime landscapes of the Chapada Diamantina, a vast region of table top mountains, gaping canyons and gushing waterfalls. We explore the landscape on foot and by vehicle, visiting caves with azure blue pools, stalactites and stalagmites, enjoying spectacular views, and learning about the local cuisine.<br/><br/>Moving on, the towns and cities of Minas Gerais are home to some of the most exquisite colonial architecture on the continent. Cobbled streets, pastel coloured houses and elegant old churches take us back a couple of centuries as we explore Ouro Preto – perhaps the jewel in the crown here – and the smaller town of Mariana, just as charming but with far fewer visitors.<br/><br/>We then head to Rio de Janeiro, as no visit to Brazil would be complete without it. We take in the classic sights of Christ the Redeemer and Sugarloaf Mountain, of course, and also spend time in the favelas, meeting local people and hearing their stories of life here. Rio has some legendary nightlife as well, and we head out to sample some of the excellent music to be found here.<br/><br/>Finally we fly to the jungle city of Manaus, gateway to the mighty Amazon, and from here travel to our remote floating lodge in the Mamiraua Reserve – the largest protected area in Brazil. With three full days here, we spend our time exploring the rivers, lakes and forests, home to monkeys, sloth, dolphins and numerous other species. We’ll also visit a local community to see how they maintain their traditions and culture in the world’s greatest rainforest.<br/><br/>From some of the planet’s most enigmatic wildlife, to rich cultural traditions, beautiful cities and awe-inspiring landscapes, this is a marvellous introduction to the wonders that this vast country has to offer.",

    "generalInfo": "This tailor made Brazil wildlife holiday takes you to a country full of contrasts, with everything from wild, empty beaches, to rainforests brimming with plants and wildlife. It includes both the biggest jungle in the world and the biggest wetlands in the world. <br/><br/>The first stop on your tour is to the mighty Iguacu Falls on the border between Brazil and Argentina, one of the world’s greatest natural phenomena. In the midst of a subtropical nature reserve, the earth seems to open up and 275 separate falls crash over a horseshoe-shaped precipice, nearly five kilometers wide and 90 meters high. Spectacular all year round, we recommend two days here to fully explore the falls on both the Argentinian and Brazilian sides.<br/><br/>From Iguacu you will continue on to Rio de Janiero, where you’ll take in the sights in the company of an experienced local guide. As well as visiting the famous Sugarloaf Mountain and Corcovado, you’ll also get an insight into local life through a BBQ lunch at a traditional restaurant and a visit to some “favelas,” or shanty towns. <br/><br/>Next, you’ll head (via internal flight) for the Pantanal – a vast wetland that’s around half the size of France. It may be one of the least explored areas in Brazil, but it’s also one of the most wildlife rich, with over 650 species of bird and 260 fish species. What makes a visit here even more special is the fact that you can explore on foot, on horseback or by canoe. <br/><br/>A couple more internal flights later and you’re in Manaus in the Amazon. From here you’ll make your way to Uakari Lodge, which floats on the Rio Solimoes, within the Mamirauá Reserve. The lodge is simple, but the incredible location means that you can spot plentiful wildlife and drink in beautiful views without even leaving the premises. The lodge itself is quite simple, however the wildlife in the surrounding area is abundant. You can expect to see endemic species such as the white uakari monkey and the black headed squirrel monkey, as well as the Amazon pink river dolphin, the red howler monkey, the scarlet-macaw, the harpy eagle and the black cayman. <br/><br/>The best time to visit the Pantanal is the dry season of May to September, when there are fewer mosquitoes and the mammals, reptiles and birds are around the water sources and therefore easier to spot. This is also the perfect time to go to the Amazon as the nights are cooler, the skies are filled with stars and the birdwatching is top-notch.<br/>",

The guides were great, very friendly and helpful..I enjoyed every aspect of this tour..Definitely value for money\" <br/>____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br/><br/>The ultimate jaguar adventure for wildlife lovers seeking jaguars in the wild and other extraordinary creatures. Explore the heart of Brazil's north Pantanal, including \"Jaguar Ground Zero\". We have had a 100% success rate for many years, with multiple sightings of jaguars and cubs on every single trip. Our expert guides have tracked jaguars for the BBC (including Planet Earth II), National Geographic, the Discovery Channel and Netflix's Our Planet. You'll get up close to hyacinth macaws, tapirs, giant anteaters and more, with more birdlife than you can imagine.  Many people are surprised to learn that the Pantanal, not the Amazon, is the best place to see wildlife. This trip shows you why! (Although if you really want to go to Amazon, it can be added to your trip.)<br/> <br/>You'll also experience the greener side of Rio de Janeiro and the world-famous Iguaçu waterfalls, from both the Brazilian and Argentinian sides. This is a fully private tour; you can take each day at your own pace. Recommended in Wanderlust Magazine's top 10 Wildlife Trips and The Sunday Times Travel Magazine. <br/><br/>The trip itinerary overview is below, but for full details and availability, please make an enquiry on this page. Responsible Travel will put you in touch with us (the specialist independent tour operator who designed and run this trip), and we will email you directly. You can also phone us 9am- 9pm, 7 days a week.<br/><br/>The main 'season' for this part of the Pantanal is June to November. We recommend reserving as early as possible (ideally at least 12 months in advance). You can secure your tour with a deposit. This is 100% private, whether you are travelling as a couple, friends, family or solo - it's just you. You won't be joined in with others, even at Pantanal lodges.

We'll also visit the main opera house (entrance not included), built in the late nineteenth-century at a time that was known as the 'Golden Age of Rubber'. The afternoon, you're free to wander the shady streets of Belem. Belem is the Amazon's culinary capital, using many indigenous plants and fruits, as well as plenty of fresh seafood.

        "description": ": The open grasslands of Marajo Island flood during the rainy months, creating a year-round wetland habitat that's excellent for wildlife spotting. It's particularly well known for its water buffalo - the story goes that some 150 years ago, a ship heading for the West Indies, carrying a herd of Indian water buffalo, sank off the Marajo coast. Most of the cattle were adept swimmers, and eventually reached the shore, making their home on the island, where they proliferate today in both a wild and domestic setting. They are commonly used in agriculture as well as being a form of transport around the island. Today we'll experience a real cultural immersion as we spend time with local people who live on the island. We'll start early by vehicle and by boat to one of the many farms on the island - Fazenda Sao Jeronimo. The owner will take us on a tour of his land, where he runs a coconut-farming business. Our visit will include walks along forested, a canoe journey up the river that runs through his property, and a wooden walkway that will take us through the important mangrove habitat. While buffalos help with the farming here, Sao Jeronimo isn't a buffalo farm. However, our next stop - the nearby Mironga Farm - is. Over 700,000 buffalos live on Marajo Island, more than humans, which is a testament to their economic importance. Here, we'll have lunch and a tasting session including items produced on the farm - butter, cheese and buffalo meat. Time permitting, we may make a visit to a small pottery centre, which houses some early ceramic finds from the Marajoara culture, and take a small walk along a mangrove beach, before heading back to our pousada."

Caboclo communities are descended from the mixture of the indigenous populations and the white adventurers, such as rubber tappers and prospectors. We'll get a snapshot of their lives on the riverbank as we travel, seeing them wash clothes, fish and travel along the river by canoe or boat. Throughout our journey from Belem to Santarem, we'll stop once or twice a day in the Amazon Basin to see the busy ports and the loading and unloading of cargo, taking in the colourful atmosphere. There isn't time to disembark, but part of the fun of the journey is watching this frantic activity as crates of alcohol, food and supplies are quickly unloaded at each town."

Best known for its white-sand beaches, more prominent in the low-water season from late June, and transparent waters (an unusual site for anyone expecting the muddy brown Amazon), it's also idyllically situated on a blue lagoon and flanked by forest reserves. This afternoon is free to explore, swim and relax. On a low-water departure it's possible to take a water taxi to one of the open-air restaurants on the 'Ilha do Amor', where chairs and tables are placed in the warm water of the lagoon. For those who wish, you can take a trip to the Lagoa Verde (green lake). During the high-water season (February to July) you can enter the Enchanted Forest by canoe and explore this labyrinth of trees that are home to birds and monkeys. During the low-water season (August to January) the water levels allow us to walk along the canals, bathe in the cool waters of natural springs and enjoy sunset at Ponta de Cururu beach on the Tapajos River (pink dolphins are often spotted here).

We'll start out from Alter do Chao, taking a boat ride along the clear waters of the Tapajos River flanked by forest, to the Jamaraqua Community Centre, where we'll be welcomed with a coffee before setting off on our jungle walk. This 12 kilometre/7.5 mile walk will acquaint us with medicinal plants and the flora of the forest. Most of the trail is flat but there is one significant climb of 300m / 985ft, which has a rope fixed to the path for stability. The weather is hot and humid which can also make it more challenging. The walk will take us approximately five hours, with plenty of stops for photos and explanations of the nature around us. Time permitting, we may also have a swimming opportunity while in FLONA, and we'll have a superb home-cooked lunch by the people at the community - a meal generally made up of different river fish, rice, vegetables, feijoa, salad and bread.

Although Manaus is generally blown through by travellers who use it as the jumping off point for Amazon trips, it's worth staying for a look at one of the country's most impressive buildings - the Teatro Amazonas. This 19th-century neo-classical style opera house is quite simply a work of art. Built by cash-rich rubber barons who were trying to recreate a sense of European elegance in the wild Amazonas region, the pastel-pink, colonnaded exterior and lavish interior contrast sharply with the industrial grit of the rest of the city. Around the theatre, the central square comes alive around 4pm when the bars and restaurants start filling up. It's a great place to try fresh fish (the region's most well-known fish is the 'tambaqui' - a large freshwater variety, delicious grilled) and enjoy the nightlife."

Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Brazil. Your naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, guided walks, park entrance fees and permits. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the field. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>During September to October the weather in the Brazilian Pantanal is hot and dry (although it is the end of the dry season and the occassional early rain can occur).

At this time of year the rainy season is approaching and whilst rain is rare at this time of year it is not unheard of for a tropical storm to blow in.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• Our local naturalist guides have their ears to the ground and are constantly scouting new areas for rare and unusual wildlife. So we know of all of the locations to visit and we have the adaptability to change our plan (if needed) to take advantage of better wildlife watching in other locations whilst on the trip.<br/>• We will stay in a variety of accommodation when on this tour, from quaint boutique style guest houses, larger hotel chains to hotels and lodges. <br/>• Spend all the daylight hours searching for wildlife as well as spotlighting as many mammal species are nocturnal.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our specialist mammal watching tours give us a great success rate of seeing our targeted species (as well as many others). We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Brazil so that we can try and find and observe mammals and many more species. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Brazil at other times of year and focusing on other groups of wildlife such as birds, reptiles &amp; amphibians or even botany as well as other groups of animals or even specific species such as jaguars, maned wolves, giant armadillos etc. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour focused on 1 part of the Northern Pantanal. the major river ways of the Porto Jofre area.

    "generalInfo": "This jaguar watching safari in the northern Pantanal wetlands of Brazil is one of the most exciting wildlife experiences you can hope for.  This is by far the best region to see jaguar, the Pantanal being the world’s largest wetland area. As well as being home to jaguar, other magnificent wildlife includes caiman, giant otters, giant anteaters, tapir and pumas. As well as some of the most spectacular bird watching opportunities including the hyacinth macaw and toco toucan. <br/><br/>We are experts in finding jaguar as they rest or patrol the river banks and all of our jaguar watching is done from the safety of our shaded boats. To date, our average sightings is two per day on this trip with a mix of hunting, kills, swimming, mating as well as mothers and cubs. We are also proud of our  100% success rate of seeing jaguar. <br/><br/>Based around the fishing village of Porto Jofre, our tours are guided by a professional local guide who is expert not only in jaguar, but also in the region’s other prolific wildlife. This includes:  capybara, collared peccary, yacre caiman, ocelot, puma, giant anteater, greater rhea, Brazilian tapir, giant otter and nine-banded armadillo. As a tailor made holiday we can organise this to suit your timing and interests, although we do recommend a minimum of three days to increase your chances of seeing jaguar. <br/><br/>Staying in jaguar camps, driving around the famous Transpantaneira Highway in your own vehicle, walking through forests and grasslands tracking the elusive big cat or trekking on horseback are all exciting options on this trip. We also offer the chance to do a spotlighting safari after dark to see some of the more elusive species like ocelot, puma, crab-eating fox, Brazilian tapir, crab-eating raccoons and many other nocturnal mammals. We bring thermal imaging and night vision equipment upon request. <br/><br/>As all the wildlife watching is all done from boat or vehicle in the northern Pantanal, any fitness level can participate. We also have tours that travel to the south of the Pantanal which involve 2-3 hour walks or some horse riding, so a greater level of mobility is required. Please note that we are also able to arrange this trip for solo travellers, upon request. Minimum age is 18 years old. <br/><br/>The price of this holiday includes:<br/>All activities, all meals, bottled water, air con vehicle, drive, transfers, internal flights, guides, entrance fees, equipment, reference library. <br/><br/>Best time to see jaguar<br/>We recommend early August to late October for seeing jaguar in the Pantanal, as this is the dry season when they, and other wildlife, gather at waterholes. September is particularly good.",

    "generalInfo": "Brazil is a vast country with many different ecosystems and incredible biodiversity. This trip offers the chance to travel to three of the most diverse ecosystems, the Pantanal, Amazon Rainforest and the Cerrado savanna. All of this locations will be explored with expert guides in search of he best mammal life Brazil has to offer.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife watching holidays that focus on one specific rare or elusive species of mammals. These trips are specialised in that they have a distinct focus, a species which is the overall target for the tour. But of course we are exploring the wonderful and diverse natural environment and many other species can also be seen. However this is the only specialist mammal tour focusing on the Pantanal, Amazon and Cerrado available.<br/><br/>The Amazon rainforest or perhaps the vast wetland ecosystem of the Pantanal are what spring to mind first when people think of Brazil for wildlife watching. However there is one other large and mammal rich ecosystem in Brazil, in fact one that is unique to this huge country; the Cerrado. This is Brazil’s answer to the African savanna. A large grassland ecosystem in central Brazil. And this is the habitat of one of our highly targeted species the wonderful Maned Wolf.  <br/>There are some species which are found in two or even three of these locations, but each of our targeted ecosystems are home to some particularly targeted species. Firstly in the northern Pantanal we will focus on the mighty jaguar as well as the wonderful and vocal giant otter, in the southern Pantanal our focus shifts to the Brazilian tapir and giant anteater (among others), when in the southern Amazon we will look into the trees for a wealth of primate species as well as sloths and then in the grasslands of the cerrado we focus on maned wolves and armadillos.<br/><br/>All of this will be done with the expert guidance of local naturalist guides and where possible our own zoologist guides and wildlife researchers also. All you have to do is to get in touch with your budget and your group size and where you would like to go and we will come back to you with an itinerary and quote for your perfect specialist Brazilian mammal watching tour.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included.

    "generalInfo": "Travel to the most reliable places in the world to see the stunning and unique Maned Wolf. The fox on stilts lives in the Brazilian grasslands and this tour focuses on this species.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife watching holidays that focus on one specific rare or elusive species. These trips are specialised in that they have a distinct focus, a species which is the overall target for the tour. But of course we are exploring the wonderful and diverse natural environment and many other species can also be seen. However this is the only specialist tour for Maned Wolves in the world, and this safari offers the greatest chances of seeing this species in the wild.<br/><br/>The Amazon rainforest or perhaps the vast wetland ecosystem of the Pantanal are what spring to mind first when people think of Brazil for wildlife watching. However there are many other ecosystems and some of them are unique to Brazil. One such ecosystem is the Cerrado. This is Brazil’s answer to the African savanna. A large grassland ecosystem in central Brazil. And this is the habitat of our target species the wonderful Maned Wolf.  <br/>Resembling a fox on stilts it is one of the strangest looking animals in the world and this trip travels to the best places in the world to see them. There is of course a chance of seeing many other species in the Cerrado, and as well as visiting the Cerrado we will also visit a remote monastery where the monks have been leaving fruit out for the local “street dogs” for decades. It was only when one monk saw that they were in fact Maned Wolves that this place become famous. And today it I possible to visit to see this incredible animal very close.<br/><br/>Guided by expert naturalist guides and visiting stunning locations full of wildlife, we will explore the Cerrado and aim to showcase the unusual Maned Wolf and many other species. All you have to do is to get in touch with your budget and your group size and where you would like to go and we will come back to you with an itinerary and quote for your perfect specialist Maned Wolf watching tour.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Cuiaba and Belo Horizonte. There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers and safaris. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Brazil. Your naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, guided walks, park entrance fees and permits. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the Cerrado. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>During September to October the weather in the Brazilian Cerrado grasslands is hot and dry with plenty of blue skies during the day. The temperatures during the day and night are hot and they heat up quickly in the morning. At this time of year the rainy season is approaching and whilst rain is rare at this time of year it is not unheard of for a tropical storm to blow in.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• Our local naturalist guides have their ears to the ground and are constantly scouting new areas for rare and unusual wildlife. So we know of all of the locations to visit and we have the adaptability to change our plan (if needed) to take advantage of better wildlife watching in other locations whilst on the trip.<br/>• We will stay in a variety of accommodation when on this tour, from quaint boutique style guest houses, larger hotel chains to hotels and lodges. <br/>• Spend all the daylight hours searching for wildlife as well as spotlighting as the maned wolf is rather nocturnal as well as diurnal.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our specialist wildlife tours for a particular species (the Maned Wolf in this case) give us a great success rate of seeing our targeted species (as well as many other). We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Brazil so that we can try and find and observe Maned Wolves and many more species. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Brazil at other times of year and focusing on other species such as jaguars, giant otters, giant anteaters, tapirs, rainforest primates and many other species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour focused on 2 particular sites, firstly the Cerrado ecosystem which is best encompassed in Emas National Park and then a remote monastery which has a small population of habituated maned wolves living around their grounds. <br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from a vehicle and so the trip requires no special hiking experience or a specific level of physical fitness. This is a very easy trip to undertake.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 15 Years Old<br/><br/>Some images on this page are by:<br/>By Aguará - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=40357029<br/>By Clodomiro Esteves Junior [CC BY-SA 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0)], from Wikimedia Commons<br/>By Robin Müller - Self-photographed, CC BY-SA 2.0 de, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=7196161",

There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>During September to October the weather in the Brazilian Pantanal is hot and dry (although it is the end of the dry season and the occassional early rain can occur). The temperatures during the day and night are hot and they heat up quickly in the morning. At this time of year the rainy season is approaching and whilst rain is rare at this time of year it is not unheard of for a tropical storm to blow in.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• Our local naturalist guides have their ears to the ground and are constantly scouting new areas for rare and unusual wildlife. So we know of all of the locations to visit and we have the adaptability to change our plan (if needed) to take advantage of better wildlife watching in other locations whilst on the trip.<br/>• We will stay in a variety of accommodation when on this tour, from quaint boutique style guest houses, larger hotel chains to hotels and lodges. <br/>• Spend all the daylight hours searching for wildlife as well as spotlighting as many mammal species are nocturnal.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our specialist mammal watching tours give us a great success rate of seeing our targeted species (as well as many others). We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Brazil so that we can try and find and observe mammals and many more species. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Brazil at other times of year and focusing on other groups of wildlife such as birds, reptiles &amp; amphibians or even botany as well as other groups of animals or even specific species such as jaguars, maned wolves, giant armadillos etc. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour focused on 2 areas of the vast Pantanal wetland ecosystem; the northern which is serviced by the city of Cuiaba and the southern which is served by the city of Campo Grande. <br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from a vehicle (4x4 or boat) and so the trip requires no special hiking experience or a specific level of physical fitness. This is a very easy trip to undertake. There are some optional activities from horse back if you wish and walking, however the walks are not particularly long and there are no steep inclines.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 15 Years Old",

    "generalInfo": "Brazil is a vast country with many different ecosystems and incredible biodiversity. This trip offers the chance to explore one of the most biodiverse in full. The huge wetland ecosystem of the Pantanal varies from north to south and this tour will explore both of these regions from land, boat and the air. The northern Pantanal is home to the highest density of jaguars in the world and the south is home to tapirs, anteaters, armadillos and much more.<br/>Join this tour and observe a range of wildlife in the wonderful Pantanal.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife watching holidays that focus on one specific rare or elusive species of mammals. These trips are specialised in that they have a distinct focus, a species which is the overall target for the tour. But of course we are exploring the wonderful and diverse natural environment and many other species can also be seen. However this is the only specialist mammal tour focusing on both the northern and southern the Pantanal.<br/><br/>On this tour you will firstly visit the northern Pantanal and our focus will be on the mighty jaguar as well as the wonderful and vocal giant otters and the incredible diversity and abundance of birds. We will then visit the southern Pantanal and our focus will then shift to the Brazilian tapir and giant anteater (among others).<br/><br/>All of this will be done with the expert guidance of local naturalist guides and where possible our own zoologist guides (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) and wildlife researchers also. All you have to do is to get in touch with your budget and your group size and where you would like to go and we will come back to you with an itinerary and quote for your perfect specialist Pantanal wildlife watching tour.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Cuiaba and Campo Grande. There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers and safaris. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Brazil.

The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, guided walks, park entrance fees and permits.

Of course the other third option is to have a rest and do nothing this morning! The choice is yours ;-) Later in the day the group will meet up at the hotel and stroll down together to the Marina da Gloria - enjoying a nice included lunch on the way. You will then all hop aboard a magnificent schooner boat that will cruise around Rio's spectacular Guanabara Bay for around 3-4 hours. Enjoy an open bar during the first hour of the cruise and make the most of the dance floor, music and chill-out area. Returning just after sunset, you'll have the chance to view the city, Sugarloaf Mountain, and Christ the Redeemer from a stunningly different light and angle.

It is also one of the largest countries in the world, so it can be challenging to cover much terrain on a short holiday. This 12-day Rio to Iguazu Falls holiday makes use of internal flights, private transport and a particularly well planned itinerary to ensure you see as much as possible, without feeling rushed.<br/><br/>Get underway in sunny, cosmopolitan Rio de Janeiro, where a highlight will be the rack-and-pinion railway up through Tijuca National Park, the largest urban forest in the world, to the summit of Corcovado Mountain where the iconic Christ the Redeemer statue awaits. From Rio you fly to another Brazilian icon, the spectacular Iguazu Falls where you’ll spend two days exploring the forested region around the waterfalls.<br/><br/>With a brief pause in the capital, Brasilia, with its futuristic and innovative architecture, you’ll fly on to Campo Grande, gateway to the Pantanal wetlands. In this vast wilderness of rivers, marsh, savannah and cattle ranches, much of it flooded during the rainy season, you’ll stay in a traditional pousada (lodge). From there, expert local guides lead you out to track wildlife including giant anteaters, caimans, capybaras and, perhaps, even jaguars. You’ll head out on foot, by boat and by 4WD, with the option to ride on horseback, too<br/><br/>This small group tour has a maximum of 16 people, minimising your impact on the fragile environments and remote communities you will visit. You’ll travel the entire way with a brilliant tour leader, and, as is fitting given Brazil’s renowned biodiversity, you will stay in accommodation with strong environmental credentials. That includes a family-run lodge in the Pantanal that is involved with efforts to conserve the endemic blue macaw.<br/>",

Despite its Portuguese architecture, the spirit, cuisine, culture and people are predominantly African. The area's riches originated from sugar cane and tobacco, with most of the workforce coming from the west coast of Africa. Today, the population is mostly of African descent - this is reflected in the rhythms of the music that pulsates through the streets, as well as in the cuisine and Candomble, a mixture of African and Christian deities and rites. This afternoon is free for you to explore more solo or relax on the beach.

We'll arrive to Cuiaba late, possibly even in the early hours of tomorrow, and go straight to our hotel ready for our drive into the Pantanal tomorrow."

        "description": ": Driving from Cuiaba to the Pantanal Wildlife Reserve along the Transpantaneira road, we have our first encounters with wildlife at the waterholes. We have two full days to explore this paradise for birds and wildlife. There are over 600 bird species including waders, toucan, heron, stork, duck and coot and 350 varieties of fish, including the piranha. Animals include deer, armadillo, tapir, boar, the unusual capivara and thousands of Jacare caiman (alligator). Few visitors discover the remote Pantanal, so there is little infrastructure for tourists. Our lodge is located by a river and has a pool to relax beside - a wonderful combination of relaxation and a chance to see the most readily accessible and prolific wildlife in Latin America. Lie in your hammock and appreciate the evening birdsong."

We might head out on foot, in small boats, on horseback, or by jeep safari to explore the area around our lodge. Boat trips in the Pantanal take place only during the high water period; typically November to April. Early morning and dusk is the best time for wildlife spotting, and we'll split large groups into two for better viewing opportunities.

Again, our day will be flexible depending on the season, the weather and the wildlife patterns - no two days in the Pantanal are the same! For those who'd like to join, there's an optional (not included) full-day excursion to search for the Pantanal's elusive jaguar. In recent years the Pantanal has emerged as one of the best places to spot jaguars in the wild - although daily sightings cannot be guaranteed as these vary according to the temperature, rainfall and seasonal water changes. The excursion leaves our lodge at around 5.30am, returning at approximately 7pm, giving around 7-8 hours of boat time to spot these beautiful creatures. You'll spend most of the day sailing on the Rio Claro, as jaguars are more easily spotted from the banks with the help of the eagle eyes of the boat captains."

Uncovering many of the area's highlights, we'll walk through the colourful, tile-lined stairway that leads to the studio of Jorge Selaron, as well as the cultural centre of Parque das Ruinas, which overlooks the bay. Please note, on festivals or special holidays, the queues for the tramway to Santa Teresa can be enormous, and cause delays to our program.

    "generalInfo": "This tailor made holiday in Brazil follows a carefully crafted itinerary that allows you to take in the famous sights of Rio and some of the country’s most magnificent landscapes. Starting in Rio you will head out along the Green Coast. Enjoy a few days in Rio first, sipping caipirinhas on Copacabana or taking a guided tour up to Sugar Loaf Mountain. You will have experienced driver guides with you throughout.<br/><br/>After the excitement of this great city, your next coastal destination is Paraty, a laid back colonial town with magnificent sea food restaurants, boutiques, cobbled streets and a wonderfully arty ambience. You can also take boat trips from here out to bays around the town, or go kayaking among coastal mangroves. Or just enjoy time chilling out at a stunning seafront pousada, in the heart of the Serra do Mar Natural Park.<br/><br/>Continuing on you will reach the pristine beach hideaway of Picinguaba. A stay at Pousada Picinguaba allows guests to disconnect from the outside world by encouraging guests to leave their internet-connected devices in the lobby while they explore the gorgeous surroundings. Guided excursions offered by the pousada range from jungle trekking to a day out on the water with local fisherman and with several days spent soaking up paradise, you get a real impression of all the region has to offer.<br/><br/> Your itinerary takes you inland next to Latin America’s fastest growing metropolis of Sao Paulo, where we recommend a day to explore before taking a flight to Cuiabá. This is your gateway town to the sprawling Pantanal region, the largest wetlands in the world—roughly equivalent in size to Washington —and an ideal place to leave the outside world behind.  You will explore the region by travelling by boat and foot in and around your remote, yet exquisite pousada, where birds, butterflies and some stunning rare mammals form the majority of the population. This includes the elusive jaguar, monkeys and a plethora of birdlife, including hyacinth macaws.<br/><br/>This Brazil holiday ends in style, flying south again to Iguaçu Falls which actually consist of over 270 falls. We take you to both sides of the falls, which create a natural border with Argentina, giving you the best all round experience.<br/><br/>We believe that the best time to go to Brazil, following this particular itinerary, is between April and September, so that you can catch the dry season in The Pantanal. This is when wildlife emerge in search of water and are much more visible. The climate generally will be pleasant elsewhere on your itinerary, cooler than at other times, but dry.<br/><br/>",
