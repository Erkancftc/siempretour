  "generalInfo": "East Timor, also known as Timor-Leste, is one of Southeast Asia’s hidden gems—a small yet captivating country with breathtaking natural beauty and a powerful story of resilience. Located between Indonesia and Australia, it’s a land of rugged mountains, vibrant coral reefs, and lush forests. After centuries under Portuguese colonial rule and a turbulent period of Indonesian occupation, East Timor finally gained full independence in 2002, making it the first new sovereign state of the 21st century. The country today reflects a rich blend of European and indigenous influences in its architecture, cuisine, language, and customs, with communities deeply rooted in tradition and faith.<br/><br/>This 12-day group tour offers a great mix of sightseeing, nature adventures, and cultural experiences. Starting in the capital city of Dili, the trip takes you to important places that tell the story of East Timor’s fight for independence. You’ll travel along the scenic northern coast, stopping in towns like Baucau and Com, with visits to salt lakes, memorials, and national parks. One of the highlights is a boat ride to Jaco Island, a peaceful and sacred spot with clear waters and white sand.<br/><br/>Later in the journey, you’ll explore the mountains and even climb Mount Ramelau for an unforgettable sunrise. You’ll also visit historic towns like Suai, Venilale, and Balibo, which still show traces of Portuguese and wartime history. With chances to relax at beaches, stroll through markets, and learn about the country’s past, this tour offers a deep and balanced look at East Timor’s landscape, culture, and resilience.",
