    "generalInfo": "East Timor, also known as Timor-Leste, is one of Southeast Asia’s hidden gems—a small yet captivating country with breathtaking natural beauty and a powerful story of resilience. Located between Indonesia and Australia, it’s a land of rugged mountains, vibrant coral reefs, and lush forests. After centuries under Portuguese colonial rule and a turbulent period of Indonesian occupation, East Timor finally gained full independence in 2002, making it the first new sovereign state of the 21st century. The country today reflects a rich blend of European and indigenous influences in its architecture, cuisine, language, and customs, with communities deeply rooted in tradition and faith.<br/><br/>This 12-day group tour offers a great mix of sightseeing, nature adventures, and cultural experiences. Starting in the capital city of Dili, the trip takes you to important places that tell the story of East Timor’s fight for independence. You’ll travel along the scenic northern coast, stopping in towns like Baucau and Com, with visits to salt lakes, memorials, and national parks. One of the highlights is a boat ride to Jaco Island, a peaceful and sacred spot with clear waters and white sand.<br/><br/>Later in the journey, you’ll explore the mountains and even climb Mount Ramelau for an unforgettable sunrise. You’ll also visit historic towns like Suai, Venilale, and Balibo, which still show traces of Portuguese and wartime history. With chances to relax at beaches, stroll through markets, and learn about the country’s past, this tour offers a deep and balanced look at East Timor’s landscape, culture, and resilience.",

    "generalInfo": "This two week East Timor (Timor-Leste) holiday is a tailor made trip, travelling with a local expert guide through this wonderful country, still very much unknown to most tourists. We suggest the itinerary below to ensure that you get to visit the country’s cultural and natural highlights but it is, of course, a flexible itinerary, which we can tweak to accommodate your interests and time frame. <br/><br/>East Timor is thankfully at peace and proud to be so after a long struggle for independence from Indonesia which they gained in 2002. It boasts a long list of highlights, both cultural and natural, and from the start of this holiday in Dili, the capital, you will instantly garner a sense of East Timor’s colonial heritage and new identity as well. <br/><br/>We spend a couple of days in the foothills of Mt Ramelau, the country’s highest peak and also the island’s, at 2,986 m. Camping in the foothills and then taking the moderate trek to the summit at sunrise is a highlight of the tour for many. Spend time exploring many of the country’s former Portuguese colonial towns such as Venilale. There is also plenty of blissful beach time built into the itinerary at islands such as Atauro, a coral island perfect for reef swimming and snorkelling and also home to a stunning eco resort. <br/><br/>This is not only one of the newest countries in the world, but is still almost tourist free. Enjoy before the word gets out too much. It really is still a charming, undiscovered destination.  <br/>",
