      "title": "Bora Bora – Arrive in Bora Bora to Enjoy the Idyllic and Iconic Paradise",
      "description": "Island life on Bora Bora fills with images of indigo waters along the lagoon and white frangipani fringed with streaks of purple. The basalt peak of Mount Otemanu shimmers with silver and black soaring above the emerald rainforest canopy. As your flight descends onto the runway at Bora Bora International Airport, you can see the thatched roofs of the overwater bungalows rising above the lagoon. The luxury suites have become an iconic image of relaxation and opulence in French Polynesia since their introduction to resort lodging in the 1960s. Your private transfer greets you upon your arrival at the airport and escorts you over the calm, crystal clear waters of the lagoon to reach the splendors of your resort. A porter helps you with your bags, escorting you from the private dock to the lobby. You enter into the comforts of your gorgeous suite to find a private plunge pool, which serves as a connection to the greater lagoon. A large deck provides a sensational view of the dramatic peak of Mount Otemanu. Natural light pours into the bungalow through the glass panels. The sunlight bounces off the radiant hues of the indigo water and through the panel on the floor, offering a unique perspective of the schools of fish swimming below. You easily settle into the charms of your accommodation, accentuated by the view of the landscape, the sounds of water lapping against the wooden posts, and the aroma of fresh coconut. You find inviting Mai Tai cocktails to celebrate your arrival and the relaxing honeymoon vacation to come."

      "title": "Bora Bora – Enjoy Your Overwater Bungalow and Swim with Sharks",
      "description": "Wake to the casual sounds of water lapping against the wooden post of your bungalow, creating a soothing soundtrack to the returning morning light. The gentle strum of a ukulele accompanies the rhythmic ebb and flow of the water. A traditional outrigger canoe floats over the lagoon and glows with an abundance of frangipani and hibiscus. The canoe docks beneath your bungalow and the staff carry a marvelous breakfast on your deck. As they create a special, welcoming ambiance in the seclusion of your overwater bungalow, you take the ladder down to the canoe for a short morning cruise. The scent of hibiscus accompanies subtle hints of vanilla. The ukulele continues to strum as you glide above the vibrant turquoise hues of the crystal clear lagoon. Dip your fingers into the water to feel the warm, inviting temperature. You can see schools of sergeant majors huddling around the shallow fringe reef. Return to your private deck to find a stunning array of tropical fruit, from guavas to pineapples, dragon fruits to lychees, accompanying the comforting aroma of freshly brewed coffee. After the fabulous, celebratory meal, you board a boat at the dock and venture to a fascinating location on the lagoon for a unique snorkeling opportunity. You jump into the water and notice you can touch the seafloor. Blacktip reef sharks and manta rays swarm around the outrigger canoe. You place your head in the water, and your heart begins to pound. A frenzy of sharks lingers near the surface and ignores you completely. You watch from a safe distance as the dramatic figures swim alongside gorgeous butterflyfish."

      "title": "Bora Bora – Relish a Private Paddle Board Lesson and a Helicopter Ride",
      "description": "The beauty of Bora Bora continues to captivate you in the morning. At breakfast, you find the bright pink of dragon fruits accentuated by the petals of a hibiscus decorating the tables. The aroma of a decadent cappuccino overtakes the subtle scent of coconut. After the meal, you meet your guide on the shores of the lagoon, eager to learn the quiet art of paddleboarding. Your board rests on the sand near the rippling wake of the lagoon. You practice holding the paddle with one firm hand gripped on over the top. You take the paddle into the water, learning to balance on the calm, crystal clear water. You float as a couple near the thatched roofs of the overwater bungalows in view of the basalt peak of Mount Pahia. The shallow lagoon makes it easy to climb back atop the paddleboard after splashing into the water. You keep your legs evenly spaced and slightly bent. You push the board using the paddle and make your way parallel to the bungalows, enjoying the combination of thrill and relaxation. After washing away the salt crystals from your skin, you board a helicopter from the landing pad on the resort grounds. You gain an impressive panorama of Bora Bora from the air, circling the nearly 2,400-foot tall summit of Mount Otemanu. Your guide on the helicopter helps you capture the majesty of the island, encompassing the glimmering sheen of the rainforest canopy and turquoise lagoon."

      "title": "Bora Bora – Delight in a Bike Ride around the Island and Dive for Pearls",
      "description": "In the morning, you take the time to indulge in the luxuries of your overwater bungalow, noticing the schools of damselfish swimming in view of your glass floor panel. After breakfast, you make your way to the shores for a bicycle tour circling the marvelous coastline of the island. A single road traverses the 11 square miles of shores. The sea breeze rustles the coconut palms soaring over the sand. The quiet waves brush against the mixture of ivory sands and rocky promontories. Sporadic fruit vendors along the roadside display pineapples, passion fruits, and guavas. Mango trees grow amongst the rain forest canopy. You circle the peaks of Mount Pahia and Otemanu, stopping at a local pearl farm. The thatched structure overlooking the lagoon contains a charming shop displaying white and black pearls beneath the soft light. Your guide leads you through the shop to learn about the cultured stones. It takes two years to harvest a single pearl, with only three out of every 100 pearls harvested considered to be ideal. The famous Tahitian black pearl is actually five different colors, including blue, green, and purple, with the luster determining the pearl’s value. You can take a boat to the buoys to view the 22 lines dangling in the water. Each line hosts up to six oysters. Dive into the water with your guide to view the oysters up close, reaching 15 feet below the surface. Back in the shop, your guide gives you a demonstration on how to harvest the pearls, using a delicate device to help secure the gem. A slow unveiling displays the treasure inside the oyster."

      "description": "In the morning, you can’t help but return to the photos you took while traversing the island on a helicopter. The aerial views provide a unique perspective of the mountain summits, forest canopy, crystal clear waters, and overwater bungalows. At breakfast, you bask in the enticing tropical aroma of banana pancakes before returning to the shores of the island to trek through the Valley of the Kings. The trail meanders through the marvelous rainforest taking you alongside blossoming frangipanis and hidden orchids. The flower petals glisten with purple, red, and blue hues against the surrounding emerald leaves. You touch your fingers to the flowers to feel the waxy, smooth texture beneath the tropical sun. The trail meanders through mango and avocado trees. Your guide explains that the presence of fruit trees means a village is nearby. An atoll fruit dove perches in the trees. Its jade wings give way to streaks of silver plumage on the breast and a speck of fuchsia on its crown. Your guide cuts through a snaking vine and offers a drink of the fresh water spilling from the root. The scent of ginger emanates from a nearby plant. You arrive at a clearing where a three-foot-tall stone carving rises out of the grass. The historic temple was erected more than a millennium ago. Your guide explains the distinctive weathered stones and small carving guarding the king’s spirit. At the top of a summit overlooking the valley grows gigantic banyan trees shading magnificent boulders, which connotes the resting place of the kings."
