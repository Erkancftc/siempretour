  "generalInfo": "Discover Montenegro through adventure. On this nature holiday, you will hike to secret beaches and a waterfall, explore hidden trails, and kayak across crystal-clear waters surrounded by mountains and untouched nature.<br/><br/>Each day brings a new experience, from canyoning in wild canyons to stand-up paddleboarding on calm bays, to a boat tour of Kotor Bay where we visit mussel farms, monasteries on small islands, and the famous Blue Cave. Adventure flows easily here, with plenty of time to swim, relax, and enjoy the sea.<br/><br/>This holiday is also a journey into Montenegrin culture. Taste traditional cuisine, local cheeses and wine, and seasonal food straight from the region. Nature, movement, good food, and great company.",
