A well-planned monastic complex included caved temples, bathing pools, lovely ponds and Asia's oldest surviving landscaped gardens. The \"Lion stairway\", the \"mirror wall\" and the \"water gardens\" are its other highlights. The ruins of the capital built by the parricidal King Kashyapa I (477–95) lie on the steep slopes and at the summit of a granite peak standing some 370 m high (the 'Lion's Rock', which dominates the jungle from all sides). Afternoon enjoy Ayurveda massage one hour each per person to rejuvenate your bodies.

Stand up paddling, also known as standup paddle boarding or simply ‘SUP’ is a leisurely, yet exciting modern water-based activity, which has quickly gained popularity in recent years. While it is an offshoot of surfing, in contrast with traditional surfing where the surfer remains seated until a wave comes, stand up paddle boarders stand atop their boards and use a paddle to propel themselves through the water surface. Perfect for the still, calm ocean. Look around to enjoy the magnificent landscape of both land and sea, or look down for a crystal-clear close-up of the ocean ‘aquarium’ beneath you, all the while getting an excellent cardio workout!"

    "generalInfo": "The Maldives has a reputation for being an exclusive destination, but thanks to changes to local law made in 2011, tourists can now stay in accommodation on a local island rather than in one of the resorts here. It's the perfect way to get a flavour of the real Maldives, without the hefty price tag. You will still enjoy the gorgeous beaches, excellent snorkelling and diving and fresh food any visitor to the Maldives expects, but will also have the chance to experience local island life.<br/><br/>This four day adventure includes water sports, exploration and lots of time to relax. For an authentic experience, you’ll use the ferry, have a meal with a local family and even try some Maldivian singing and dancing. There’s the opportunity to find out how boats are built and to simply enjoy being part of the local life of one of this beautiful archipelago’s inhabited islands.<br/><br/>You can also try some of the activities that the Maldives is rightly famous for, including snorkelling, diving, fishing, surfing, dolphin cruises and beach barbecues. The Maldives is a Muslim nation, so drinking alcohol and wearing bikinis on beaches restricted, but all our guests have the option to enjoy the freedom of tourist beaches, picnic islands and resorts where these restrictions are not in effect.<br/><br/>This is an affordable and enriching way of visiting the Maldives, which you can combine with a resort stay or as part of a holiday in Sri Lanka or India, for example. All packages begin and finish at Male International Airport and they can all be customised to your timings and interests.<br/><br/>Accommodation is in small, locally owned guesthouses, usually on the island of Guraidhoo, although we do offer holidays on other islands. All accommodation is chosen for its comfort, excellent service, great value, good food and friendly feel. Rooms are well kitted out with ensuite bathrooms, air conditioning and fans. There is Wifi, too, as well as tea, coffee and water. Some overlook the sea while others have a private garden or beach, and there are usually cafes and restaurants nearby.<br/>",

Coral reefs are fragile ecosystems so learning how to snorkel responsibly can help minimize your impact on the marine environment and protect the delicate balance of marine life. This snorkel will also provide the opportunity to understand firsthand how development and reclamation impacts coral reefs. Your Tour Leader will assist less confident or inexperienced snorkelers, ensuring your equipment is comfortable and you feel safe in the water. As the afternoon cools down time is spent exploring Guraidhoo and immersing yourself in the local way of life. Stop by the harbour where fishermen may be bringing in their catch. Chat with children playing in the street and watch the ladies of the community begin their evening meal preparations. Stop by a local cafe to sample traditional ‘hedika’ - Maldivian savoury and sweet short eats served with black tea. The Maldives is rich in marine life but unfortunately, our marine life is under threat because of activities carried out by us humans. Following dinner over a coffee your tour leader will highlight the harmful practices that are pushing the balance in the ecosystem and what we can do to limit the impact."

At first glance the knotting looks difficult and hard work, but after learning it’s just a simple process of knotting using a single piece of rope rather than many different pieces as it would seem like. An important way to show respect for any culture is to embrace cultural differences. This can be as simple as taking the time to learn a few key phrases or words in the local language. Even if you are unable to say them perfectly, your efforts will always be noted. Learn the alphabet and sounds and some key phrases with your tour leader who will also provide you with your name in Dhivehi! Late afternoon spend time on the beach, giving back to the community that has welcomed us by supporting a clean beach. Our reward will be a refreshing fresh Kurumba (coconut water) followed by an ocean swim! Fishing is the second largest industry in the Maldives after tourism and the Maldives has one of the most sustainable fishing industries. “Fishing is the lifeblood of our nation, it is inborn. From the soil on which we live, to the sea around us, it remains an integral part of our existence“. These words will always be in the fisherman heart. This evening there is the option to join the fishermen at the harbour and learn how to fish the traditional way with just a line."

You’ll have the chance to visit some villages and see the traditional Maldivian island way of life first-hand.<br/><br/>\nYou can snorkel every day if you want to. This cruise provides masks and flippers – just state your size in advance. The water is warm and exceptionally clear, and under the surface you may be able to spot turtles, clown fish and other colourful reef fish over the unspoilt coral reefs that fringe nearly every atolls. Your guides will be able to help you identify what you’ve seen. You may also see manta rays, and other beautiful species of ray.<br/><br/>\nBetween four and five crew operate the dhoni, leaving you free to relax on board. Accommodation is simple and comfortable, with two bunk beds in each cabin and shared bathroom facilities.

We then begin a four-hour cruise south, passing through the Vaadhoo Canal to the South Male Atoll - a smaller and quieter neighbour to the more developed North Male Atoll. Here, many of the islands are uninhabited and are surrounded by clear turquoise water and reefs. Heading further south, we'll cruise to the Vavuu Atoll, where we'll spend time exploring the picturesque island of Kudiboli. Please note, you don't need special footwear for getting on and off the boat and exploring these islands - most travellers manage just fine in flip-flops. After our island exploration, we'll spend the afternoon snorkelling or relaxing onboard our dhoni. For our first snorkel we plan to enter the sea from the beach or sand bar into relatively calm waters. All subsequent snorkelling and swimming will be directly from the boat, over reefs and into deeper waters. Over the week, we're likely to encounter plenty of underwater fauna. We might be lucky enough to spot green turtles, reef sharks and gigantic manta rays, as well as smaller sting rays and eagle rays. At each stop, we'll also swim amongst a rainbow of small, colourful fish, including the famous Clown Fish. Our knowledgeable local guides will be able to help identify many of the underwater species that we come across. All meals are included on the dhoni. Menus are likely to include freshly caught fish, as well as curries and pasta. Drinking water, tea and coffee are readily available, with alcoholic and soft drinks can be purchased on-board, too. You can pay your bill for drinks at the end of your cruise in USD or by credit card. Cabins are compact but spacious enough for two people. You also have the option to sleep on deck under the stars some nights. Please note that the itinerary is entirely dependent on the local weather, winds and tides. It's very often necessary to adapt the planned itinerary to local conditions."

    "generalInfo": "Most people do not come across barely touched remote dive locations. Last February, we visited Addu Atoll on a whim, and my whole take on diving changed. I had found a series of Indian Ocean islands with steep walls, coral covered reefs and passages with currents that brought in Manta Rays and sharks. And to cap it all, in the centre of the Atoll sits the enormous wreck of the Motor Tanker, British Loyalty. The size of the Atoll islands chain makes for scores of dive sites, and with few hotels, the number of dive boats can be counted on one hand ADDU DIVING<br/><br/>Addu Atoll is famous for its sharks that inhabit its passages and its manta cleaning station, where Manta Rays come by and peer at divers in 30m visibility. But Addu should be dived for so much more than the sharks and Manta Rays. <br/><br/>Addu Atoll is one of the final frontiers of global scuba diving. It is host to the healthiest, most vibrant coral reefs that I have seen in 30 years.  Every reef is packed with fish.  If you wish to explore the outside of the Atoll, you can jump onto walls that descend down to the Indian Ocean floor. You drift through “farms” of gorgonian fans that stretch down from 10m-50m.  Sometimes sharks will appear from nowhere, have a look at the divers and then disappear. Down deeper we see 300lb tunas investigate us. <br/><br/>On your safety stop the barracuda, turtles, eagle rays and jacks swim past you.  In the lagoon, close to the pier of Maradu-Feydo, lies the MT British Loyalty. This magnificent wreck lies on her side in 32 metres of water, but only 14 metres from the surface.  Sunk twice by the Germans and Japanese and <br/>refloated twice by the Royal Navy, the MT British Loyalty is a magnificent giant coral reef. Swimming into the cavernous engine room, the giant Sulzer engine is covered in yellow snapper. To sum up the diving in Addu: everything is pristine, untouched, unbroken and vibrant. Best of all you’ll be very unlucky to see other divers. <br/><br/>WHERE IS ADDU ?<br/>Addu Atoll is a series of slightly larger islands by Maldivian standards that lie 620 nautical miles south west of Colombo, 300 nautical miles south of Male, and only 200 nautical miles north of the British Indian Ocean Territory. The heart shaped atoll is made up of three large islands: Hitaddu, Maradu-Feydoo and Gan. <br/><br/>ADDU CULTURE- STEPPING BACK IN TIME<br/>When you land in Addu Atoll you will feel as though you have stepped back in time; to an uncomplicated world where people move at a slower pace. The crushed coral streets of Maradu-Feydoo are spotless; the people polite and incredibly kind. Behind the houses you can find dreamy lagoons with tiny clean beaches. Inside the main lagoon there is a seafront walk where fishing boats occasionally go out through the breakwater.<br/><br/>Addu offers you a real view of the authentic Maldives. Uncluttered with concrete and with a truly relaxed atmosphere, Addu Atoll is a series of calm islands, charming café’s and a world class dive destination.",

Built by King Kasyapa in the 5th century on top of a vast 200m granite rock it took seven years to build and was abandoned after ten years of occupation when the King, defeated by his brother, committed suicide. Although it is a steep climb, and the panoramic view of Dambulla seen on the top is definitely worth the effort.

    "generalInfo": "As Sri Lanka and Maldives holidays go, this tailor made two week trip promises a magical mix between culture, heritage and natural wonders in both of these stunning countries. As local experts, we have been creating holidays here for people for many years, finding you hotels or villas with some of the best locations. Such as in Sri Lanka, where your trip begins at the iconic and eco chic Heritance Kandalama hotel, located  around a mountain  with Sigiriya rock fortress on the horizon. This is just one of three points on Sri Lanka’s Cultural Triangle, the artery of ancient Sinhalese civilisation, the other two being the vast palaces of Anuradhapura and the ruins of Polonnaruwa. From cultural to natural wonders, we also recommend a jeep safari in Minneriya National Park, where elephants are one of the island’s most spectacular sites. <br/><br/>To explore further south around Sri Lanka’s ancient capital of Kandy, you will stay at The Kandy House, an elegant colonial manor dating back to 1804 and perfectly located for exploring the city, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Moving on into Sri Lanka’s Hill Country and resplendent tea plantations, you will stay at Camellia Hills, a five-bedroom boutique hotel overlooking Castlereagh Reservoir on a mountainside amidst emerald tea bushes and pine forests. A contemporary interpretation of a tea planter’s bungalow, the bedrooms, inside and outside living spaces, and infinity pool boast stunning hill country views. <br/><br/>After flying to Maldives, where snorkelling and diving are always on the itinerary, we have chosen one of the most stupendous hotels for your dream holiday, at 5-star Angsana Ihuru resort. On its own palm-filled island, it has its own reef and a plethora of fine dive sites nearby, including the famous Rannamaari wreck. We believe that this hotel and island capture the essence of Maldives, famous for its archipelago of over a thousand islands and 26 atolls, with coral reefs encircling them. Sublime seascapes that are now world famous for being pure paradise holiday escapes. <br/><br/>The best time to go on Sri Lanka and Maldives holidays:<br/><br/>The best times to go to Sri Lanka are in between the monsoon seasons, although they hit the island in different regions. The southwest monsoon finishes in late October and so visitors favour the months between November and April. The east and north have different rainfall patterns, however, with rain falling between November and February but dry from  March all the way through until September, making it perfect for European summer holiday makers. No matter when you travel to Sri Lanka, however, the temperatures are always beautifully warm. <br/><br/>In Maldives, rainfall seems to change every month. From New Year until April is low on rainfall, February is fabulous, and more rain kicks in between the months of May and October with the arrival of the monsoon. <br/><br/>",

Trails through neighbouring tea estates, patches of dense forest and to gushing waterfalls promise striking panoramas at every turn, and picnics can be packed up for enjoying in many of these drama-fuelled locations. The islands on the reservoir proffer further picnic potential, and you can island hop by boat. The lush forest edges and the surrounding hills are home to wild leopards. At the local Leopard Research Station, you can learn all about this elusive hill-dwelling sub-species that manages to exist in this fragile environment. Many more live in the nearby Peak Wilderness Sanctuary, a vast region of protected forest which is also home to sacred Adam’s Peak, Sri Lanka’s fourth highest mountain – a place of pilgrimage for Christians, Muslims, Buddhists and Hindus alike."

Head down to the water to catch the sunset and spot locals bringing in the day's catch. For those arriving in time, our tour leader plans to meet you in the hotel reception at 6pm for a welcome meeting and for those that wish, there is the chance to go out for dinner. There are no other activities planned today, so you're free to arrive in Negombo at any time. If you'd like an airport transfer, you'll need to arrive into Colombo's Bandaranaike International Airport (CMB), which is a 30-minute drive from our hotel. If you miss the welcome meeting, your tour leader will inform you of any essential information as soon as you catch up.

Depending on the season, we might spot 'toddy tappers' climbing coconut trees to collect sap from the flowers along the way, too. The sap they collect is used to make Arak - a local whisky-type spirit. Despite its location in Sri Lanka's dry zone, Wilpattu National Park boasts nearly 60 lakes and is renowned for being home to leopards, elephants, and sambar deer. We'll head out on a jeep safari in the hope of spotting the elusive leopard. We choose to visit this park, rather than the more touristy Yala National Park further south because we believe it offers our customers a better experience. You can spot the same animals here as in Yala, however it's less crowded, making our visit more enjoyable and responsible. Leaving the park, we'll drive onwards to nearby Anuradhapura, where we'll spend the next two nights."

It's believed that this was the site of a momentous meeting between the monk Mahinda and King Devanampiyatissa, introducing Buddhism to the country. Exploring Mihintale involves climbing a flight of shallow stone steps, and a short final section with uneven steps carved into the bedrock and a handrail leading to the summit. There are excellent panoramic views from the top across the entire surrounding landscape. In the afternoon, we'll explore the ancient capital of Anuradhapura - a UNESCO World Heritage Site famous for its well-preserved ancient ruins and considered to be Sri Lanka's first capital. One of the oldest continually inhabited cities in the world, it was founded around 500 BC. Its golden age began around 260 BC when the King and his people converted to Buddhism. The city became vast, spreading over many miles. There were hospitals for the sick, hostels for travellers and artificial reservoirs to ensure a good water supply. Of great interest are the 2,200-year-old Sacred Bodhi-Tree; the Brazen Palace, once a nine-storey residence for monks; the 4th-century Samadhi Buddha masterpiece and the Ruvanvalisaya Dagoba - a 90-metre/295-foot-high dome-shaped stupa towering over the surrounding countryside."

After climbing the hill we'll visit five separate caves, which contain a large number of Buddha images, as well as sculptures of Hindu Gods. After enjoying a traditional Sri Lankan lunch of curry and rice, we'll drive on to the small town of Giritale - our base from which we'll explore Polonnaruwa.

The city has maintained many of its spectacular buildings and monuments, with arguably the most impressive being the Quadrangle. This sacred precinct originally housed the tooth relic. It contains a superbly decorated circular shrine which is one of the most ornate buildings in the country. The neighbouring audience hall and bathing pool are also worth a visit. Close by, the curious round structure of the Circular Relic House has a beautifully preserved moonstone carved at the foot of a flight of steps. Another famous feature of this deserted city is the group of carved images of the Buddha, known as Galvihara. These four colossal figures are all hewn out of solid granite and the Reclining Buddha alone is no less than 14 metres/46 feet long. After our visit, we'll continue driving towards our accommodation. In the early afternoon, we'll have the option to take a jeep safari in either Minneriya or Kadaula National Park, in search of herds of wild elephants. Your tour leader will be able to advise you of the likelihood of elephant sightings on the day. The parks are also home to a large array of birdlife, including painted storks."

Rising dramatically from the central plains, the UNESCO-protected ruins of this 5th-century 'Sky Fortress' are one of Sri Lanka's major attractions and an impressive feat of engineering skill. The fortress was built in just seven years as a fortified palace atop the granite peak, to protect the reign of merciless King Kassapa who had assassinated his father and deposed his brother. Before our final ascent to the summit, we'll pass between a set of enormous lion paws carved out of the rock - all that remains of an ancient gateway that gave Sigiriya, the 'Lion Rock', its name. From here a series of switchback steel stairways ascend to the top. Once at the 200-metre/656-foot summit, we can take in the magnificent views of the surrounding jungle and countryside. We return to our hotel in time for a late breakfast. After a chance to have breakfast and freshen up, we leave the hotel at around 11am. The drive to Kandy should take around four hours including stops for lunch, to see a woodcarving centre at Naula and a spice garden."

        "description": ": Sitting on a plateau 500 metres/1640 feet above sea level and 112 kilometres/69 miles northeast of Colombo, Kandy is, in climatic and cultural terms, a world apart from Colombo. Serving as the capital of the last Sinhalese kingdom until falling to the British in 1815, it's a place of cultural and spiritual importance. Buddhists from all over the world come here specifically to visit the Temple of the Tooth, the Dalada Maligawa. The costly jewelled shrine of the Holy Tooth, said to be Buddha's left canine, is kept on the upper floor of the original building. This relic was brought from India 1,500 years ago and every year, at the time of the August full moon, it is paraded around the town with great celebration in the Perahera Festival. This morning's sightseeing includes attending the Temple of the Tooth Ceremony and a visit to the serene Royal Botanical Gardens in Peradeniya. For lunch we have included a visit to a social enterprise run by women who are either differently abled or come from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. The cafe gives them a chance to earn a meaningful income. In addition to the meal, there is a small on-site workshop where guests can see the women crafting handmade products, which are sold in the adjoining shop. The afternoon is free to continue exploring the busy highland town at your own pace. In the evening, for those interested there is the option to watch a performance by the famous Kandyan dancers, complete with impressive costumes and graceful dances, accompanied by a thundering drumbeat."

Here, we'll have the opportunity to ascend this sacred mountain, known locally as Sri Pada. A depression at the top of the peak is said to be Buddha's footprint and, each year, thousands of locals climb to the top for sunrise. Setting off at around 2am, we'll join pilgrims for our ascent. There is a stone staircase which we'll follow right to the top. It can be tough on the legs, and some may find it physically challenging, but you can go at your own pace, take your time and savour the experience shared with pilgrims. We plan to reach the top in time for sunrise and take time to soak up the spectacular views that surround us. The ascent involves around 900 metres/2952 feet of ascent and descent, with many flights of steps (some of which are steep) and is about 5 kilometres/3 miles in each direction. On busy days, we'll set out a bit earlier, shortly after midnight. Please note that on rare occasions the sheer volume of local pilgrims is so great that the final stages of the ascent may be extremely busy, and it may not be possible to reach the summit. For anyone not wanting to climb the peak, there will be free time to explore the small town of Dalhousie or to relax at our guesthouse and you will have a night of sleep while the others are sharing the trek with local pilgrims In Dalhousie, we'll stay at the Punsisi Resthouse. While it's a little basic, it is the best the town has to offer, and rooms are clean and spacious with ensuite bathrooms. Staying here enables us easy access to Adam's Peak and the pilgrims add to the atmosphere in town. A number of the rooms are located in another more recent building some way up the hill behind the main building, accessed on foot by a series of steps. Porters will be able to help with your main luggage. There are some simpler rooms located in the main building and if you prefer to be allocated one of these room then please speak to the Tour Leader before check in.

This part of Sri Lanka is an important tea-growing area and plantations stretch over rolling hills for as far as the eye can see, interspersed with the occasional tea-making factory. We plan a visit to a tea estate close to Nuwara Eliya to learn about the process of picking the leaves and creating the perfect cuppa. Known as 'Little England', Nuwara Eliya is reminiscent of Britain with its red telephone boxes, Victorian colonial architecture and pretty rose gardens - relics from its era as a hill country retreat for any homesick Brits. The cool climate provided a sanctuary in which they could immerse themselves in familiar pastimes, such as polo, golf and cricket."

Train tickets are in very high demand and the process of securing tickets is affected by corruption. We always try our best to get our reservation confirmed, but on the rare occasion that this is not possible, you will continue the journey in our private vehicle.

Our journey continues with a two-hour drive to Udawalawe. Designated as a national park in 1972, Udawalawe covers 31,800 hectares and is surrounded by mountains, a mix of rolling grasslands, teak plantations, rainforest, and scrub. Renowned for its large herd of elephants, the park is one of the best places in Sri Lanka to see them and is also home to deer, wild boar, buffalo, jackal, and leopard. The resident bird population is also second to none, including a magnificent collection of birds of prey, chief among them the impressive, white-bellied sea eagle. In the afternoon, we'll head out to explore the park by jeep as well as paying a visit to the Elephant Transit Home where orphaned elephants are cared for until they're old enough to be released back into the wild. Tonight, we'll sleep in a fixed-tented camp close to the banks of the Rakwana River. The camp is comfortable with twin beds, simple ensuite bathrooms and mosquito nets, and waking up next to the river is ideal for a spot of early morning bird watching."

An important trading centre since ancient times, the fortifications that can be seen in Galle today were built by the Portuguese and then the Dutch between the 16th and 17th centuries. The fort ramparts of this UNESCO World Heritage Site protect the harbour and a myriad of fascinating old houses, churches, and warehouses. Today, the town has a strong arts vibe, with foreign and local artists, writers, photographers, designers, and poets drawing inspiration from their surroundings. Boutique shops and cafes around the town showcase their work.

We'll have breakfast onboard and our tour leader will take time to introduce the crew and tell us about the boat and our day-to-day living for the coming days. We then begin a four-hour cruise south, passing through the Vaadhoo Canal to the South Male Atoll - a smaller and quieter neighbour to the more developed North Male Atoll. Here, many of the islands are uninhabited and are surrounded by clear turquoise water and reefs. Heading further south, we'll cruise to the Vavuu Atoll, where we'll spend time exploring the picturesque island of Kudiboli. Please note, you don't need special footwear for getting on and off the boat and exploring these islands - most travellers manage just fine in flip-flops. After our island exploration, we'll spend the afternoon snorkelling or relaxing onboard our dhoni. For our first snorkel we plan to enter the sea from the beach or sand bar into relatively calm waters. All subsequent snorkelling and swimming will be directly from the boat, over reefs and into deeper waters. Over the week, we're likely to encounter plenty of underwater fauna. We might be lucky enough to spot green turtles, reef sharks and gigantic manta rays, as well as smaller sting rays and eagle rays. At each stop, we'll also swim amongst a rainbow of small, colourful fish, including the famous Clown Fish. Our knowledgeable local guides will be able to help identify many of the underwater species that we come across. All meals are included on the dhoni. Menus are likely to include freshly caught fish, as well as curries and pasta. Drinking water, tea and coffee are readily available, with alcoholic and soft drinks can be purchased on-board, too. You can pay your bill for drinks at the end of your cruise in USD or by credit card. Cabins are compact but spacious enough for two people. You also have the option to sleep on deck under the stars some nights. Please note that the itinerary is entirely dependent on the local weather, winds and tides.

It is not only known for its great kings who ruled the city for almost 225 years independently until the British took over in 1815, but it is also the place where the Sacred Tooth of Lord Buddha is laid in a magnificent temple. Strategically nestled amidst three mountain ranges, Kandy was initially built in this location as a natural fortress against attack. Kandy was not an easy target for the foreign invaders who could gain the control of coastal areas of the island without too much loss. Kandy’s main architectural monuments date mainly from the 19th Century when King Vikrama Rajasinha, the last King of Kandy, constructed many new buildings. At the time of the eventual surrender of Kandy to British Rule in 1815, when King Rajasinha was captured, imprisoned and finally deported to India where he died in 1832. The most visited places of cultural, religious and natural interest in Kandy are the Sri Dalada Maligawa and the Peradeniya Botanical Gardens. In the morning you will visit The Temple of the Tooth & Buddhist Museum, Sri Dalada Maligawa dates back to the 16th century, though most of the present buildings were built in the 19th century. Venerated as the most important object in the Buddhist world, the Sacred Relic of the Tooth of Buddha is enshrined at the Temple. Brought from India 2500 years ago, it is said that the possessor of the Relic had the right to rule the country. The Relic is kept in a gold casket and stored amidst great security in the Inner Chamber. In the afternoon you explore the Kandy City & markets. A walk through the town with its brilliantly coloured bazaars, aromatic spices and fruits, this best place to see some of the tropical fruits first time in your life(if you haven’t been in the tropics before).

Kandy period Marks another golden era of Sri Lanka‘s legendary past. It is great place for shopping or just walks around the Lake and enjoys the beautiful scenery and narrow streets. KANDY LAKE – Built in 1806, Kandy Lake was constructed in order to bring more beauty to the Palace of King Sri Rajasinghe. In the centre of the Lake a small island was built to enable the King to be rowed out and relax whilst surveying his kingdom. The Queen’s Bathing House is set on the edge of Kandy Lake. Kandy Lake is sometimes called ‘Milky Sea’. Afterwards you will travel to Sigiriya. Travel time is approximately 2 hours. Location: Kandy Board: Breakfast & Dinner"

It's believed that this was the site of a momentous meeting between the monk Mahinda and King Devanampiyatissa, introducing Buddhism to the country. Exploring Mihintale involves climbing a flight of shallow stone steps, and a short final section with uneven steps carved into the bedrock and a handrail leading to the summit. There are excellent panoramic views from the top across the entire surrounding landscape. Afterwards, we'll drive south stopping enroute for a local lunch experience. Travelling like locals, we'll reach Hiriwaduna village by tractor-drawn cart and dugout canoe-style boats crossing the short distance across the lake to the village, where we'll be treated to a traditional Sri Lankan lunch of various curries and rice. Our next stop is Dambulla, where a series of caves have been turned into temples dating from the 1st century BC. This UNESCO World Heritage Site still attracts scores of worshippers. After climbing the hill we'll visit five separate caves, which contain a large number of Buddha images, as well as sculptures of Hindu Gods. Finally, we'll drive the short distance to Sigiriya where we'll spend the night."

        "description": ": We'll have an early start this morning as we plan to climb Sigiriya ahead of the crowds and while it's still relatively cool. Rising dramatically from the central plains, the UNESCO-protected ruins of this 5th-century 'Sky Fortress' are one of Sri Lanka's major attractions and an impressive feat of engineering skill. The fortress was built in just seven years as a fortified palace atop the granite peak, to protect the reign of merciless King Kassapa who had assassinated his father and deposed his brother. Before our final ascent to the summit, we'll pass between a set of enormous lion paws carved out of the rock - all that remains of an ancient gateway that gave Sigiriya, the 'Lion Rock', its name. From here a series of switchback steel stairways ascend to the top. Once at the 200-metre/656-foot summit, we can take in the magnificent views of the surrounding jungle and countryside. We return to our hotel in time for a late breakfast. After a chance to have breakfast and freshen up, we leave the hotel at around 11am and we'll drive for around two and a half hours to Kandy. Sitting on a plateau 500 metres/1640 feet above sea level and 112 kilometres/69 miles northeast of Colombo, Kandy is, in climatic and cultural terms, a world apart from Colombo. Serving as the capital of the last Sinhalese kingdom until falling to the British in 1815, it's a place of cultural and spiritual importance. Buddhists from all over the world come here specifically to visit the Temple of the Tooth, the Dalada Maligawa. The costly jewelled shrine of the Holy Tooth, said to be Buddha's left canine, is kept on the upper floor of the original building. This relic was brought from India 1,500 years ago and every year, at the time of the August full moon, it is paraded around the town as part of the Perahera Festival. On arrival, we'll have free time to explore this historic town. You might like to visit the Temple of the Tooth or take a short tuk-tuk ride out to Peradeniya Botanical Gardens."

In 1842, a tea bush was brought from China to be planted at Peradeniya Botanical Gardens and 25 years later, James Taylor established Sri Lanka's first tea plantation - the Loolecondera Estate in Kandy. These days, more than one million people in Sri Lanka are employed in the tea industry. The tea factory we'll visit is a small and intimate one so we won't see the tea leaves being picked but we will witness the process of drying and grinding the leaves. We'll also get to sample some of the blends before leaving tea country. After our visit, we'll drive for another four hours to the southwest coast and pay a visit to Galle Fort. An important trading centre since ancient times, the fortifications that can be seen today were built by the Portuguese and then the Dutch between the 16th and 17th centuries. The fort ramparts of this UNESCO World Heritage Site protect the harbour and a myriad of fascinating old houses, churches and warehouses.

We then begin a four-hour cruise south, passing through the Vaadhoo Canal to the South Male Atoll - a smaller and quieter neighbour to the more developed North Male Atoll. Here, many of the islands are uninhabited and are surrounded by clear turquoise water and reefs. Heading further south, we'll cruise to the Vavuu Atoll, where we'll spend time exploring the picturesque island of Kudiboli. Please note, you don't need special footwear for getting on and off the boat and exploring these islands - most travellers manage just fine in flip-flops. After our island exploration, we'll spend the afternoon snorkelling or relaxing onboard our dhoni. For our first snorkel we plan to enter the sea from the beach or sand bar into relatively calm waters. All subsequent snorkelling and swimming will be directly from the boat, over reefs and into deeper waters. Over the week, we're likely to encounter plenty of underwater fauna. We might be lucky enough to spot green turtles, reef sharks and gigantic manta rays, as well as smaller sting rays and eagle rays. At each stop, we'll also swim amongst a rainbow of small, colourful fish, including the famous Clown Fish. Our knowledgeable local guides will be able to help identify many of the underwater species that we come across. All meals are included on the dhoni. Menus are likely to include freshly caught fish, as well as curries and pasta. Drinking water, tea and coffee are readily available, with alcoholic and soft drinks can be purchased on-board, too. You can pay your bill for drinks at the end of your cruise in USD or by credit card. Cabins are compact but spacious enough for two people. You also have the option to sleep on deck under the stars some nights. Please note that the itinerary is entirely dependent on the local weather, winds and tides. It's very often necessary to adapt the planned itinerary to local conditions."
