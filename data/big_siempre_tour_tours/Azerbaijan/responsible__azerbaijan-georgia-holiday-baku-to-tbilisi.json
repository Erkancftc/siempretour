If you arrive early, maybe walk around Baku Boulevard, a promenade that stretches along the Caspian Sea – the world’s largest inland body of water. After the meeting, join your leader for a night walk around Azerbaijan’s capital, where they’ll highlight the best spots for dinner. Maybe get your group together for some traditional Azerbaijani dishes, like plov (seasoned rice) or dolma (stuffed vegetables)."

      "description": "This morning, drive to Qobustan – also known as Gobustan National Park – a UNESCO World Heritage site that’s famous for its ancient rock carvings and mud volcanoes. Stop on the way to check out these geological formations as they spew mud and gas. Azerbaijan has more clay craters than anywhere else in the world, so you’re in the right place for spotting them! The rock carvings in Qobustan date back to the Stone Age, giving humans today an insight into daily life all those years ago. With over 6000 petroglyphs on display, Qobustan is often referred to as one of the largest open-air museums in the world. Return to Baku in the afternoon and visit the walled Old Town with your leader, who’ll bring its legends and history to life. Enjoy a free evening to explore the city at your own pace. Maybe eat at a restaurant on Nizami Street – a busy boulevard with lots of authentic Azerbaijani cuisine."

Then get on a local public bus to Kish to visit the pointed spires of a church that is among the oldest in Christendom, believed to be around 1700 years old. The rest of the afternoon is free for you to discover Sheki. Why not explore the impressive traditional architecture on foot.

      "description": "Follow the Tergi River on a drive to Stepantsminda, formerly known as Kazbegi. Explore this mountain village then hike through beautiful valleys and woodlands to the iconic Gergeti Trinity Church. This 14th-century church sits at the base of the second-highest volcanic summit in the Caucasus – Mt Kazbegi – and, weather permitting, you may catch a glimpse. The image of the pointed spires of the isolated church against the mountains is truly breathtaking, and a great place for a photo. Drive back to Gudauri for a dinner with your group."

      "description": "Make the drive to Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, located along the banks of the Kura River. Get into the swing of things with an orientation walk with your leader. Spend the rest of the day as you wish, perhaps grabbing a khachapuri (bread stuffed with salty cheese) to snack on. In the evening, regroup and head out for dinner with your fellow travellers and leader. This is a good chance to sample some khinkali (Georgia’s famous soup-filled dumplings). Make sure to ask your leader about the polite way to eat them – it involves sipping the broth and leaving the pinched bit of dough where the edges of the delicious parcel have joined on the plate."
