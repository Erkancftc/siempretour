Sailboats drift along the cobalt waters of the Tasman Sea, and the Auckland Sky Tower soars above the sprawling city streets at the height of nearly 1,100 feet. Two harbors frame the narrow isthmus textured with volcanic cones, islands dot the waterways, and lush, fertile farmland borders the country’s largest city. Your flight lands at Auckland International Airport, where your private transfer greets you upon arrival. The aroma of the sea permeates the air, rainforest rises out of the south, and open, verdant hills roll across the north. You take a moment to settle into the comforts of your five-star hotel, basking in the gorgeous view of the water from your private balcony. Quay Street brims with restaurants and shops and the scent of fresh oysters drizzled with lemon drift out of restaurants on the Princess Wharf. You meet your guide in the lobby and make your way through the city on a private tour that will lead you to One Tree Hill. The volcanic cone was once a fortress at a height of nearly 600 feet above sea level, and the site offers 360-degree views of the city and a panorama that includes both seas of Auckland. Your guide points to the shimmering obelisk crowning the summit, and you have a perfect view of this monument dedicated to the Maori people."

Your private transfer greets you after breakfast and escorts you south towards the cultural capital of the North Island, Rotorua. En route, you will stop at the celebrated filming location of Hobbiton, known as the Shire in The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies. The set was designed in the late 20th century to resemble dells of old England. Soft tufts of lush grass blanket the farmland, hiding the small doors of the Hobbit holes. The herbaceous aroma of the greenery blends with the untreated timber spread across the 14 acres of countryside. Step through an emerald door to view the home of Bilbo Baggins, the famous hobbit who helped defeat the dreaded dragon Smog. You feel tiny passing through the door and standing beside the tall chairs created to make the actors in the movie look small. Stand at the hearth where Bilbo and Gandalf discussed the coming adventure before making your way over the river to the Green Dragon, the local inn at which the hobbits enjoyed meat pasties and refreshing ale. You leave Hobbiton but continue in the realm of the fantastical at Waitomo Caves to view the iridescent hues of the Glowworms."

Mud pools bubble and shimmer in the sunlight. Local Maori women would boil or steam seafood by placing the freshly caught mussels and clams in nets and letting it rest in the natural boiling pools. After breakfast, your guide leads you to the Te Puia Thermal Reserve where more than 500 springs team and gurgle in the volcanic landscape. It is reminiscent of a scene out of a fantasy movie, reminding you of the time you spent in Hobbiton the previous day. The celebrated Pohutu Geyser erupts 20 times a day, shooting water 100 feet into the air. The adjacent geyser, known as the Prince of Wales’ Feathers, bubbles over its silica cone before Pohutu erupts. Vibrant silver and rich orange hues glow along the edges of the steaming pools, shaped by the wealth of minerals in the water. You find a chef standing beside the boiling waters of The Cauldron and watch as he dangles a large pouch on a string, pulling the pouch from the steaming pool. You learn that the chef is cooking shellfish and seafood for a traditional Maori meal."

After breakfast, your private transfer escorts you back to Auckland. The city feels familiar in its welcoming activity along Queen Street. You board a boat in Waitemata Harbour and set sail along the famous waterway that splits Auckland in two. The Auckland Harbour Bridge was completed in the late 1950s and stretches more than half a mile and reaches a height of more than 140 feet, and connects downtown with the northern suburbs. A gentle seaside breeze brushes against your cheeks and carries the briny scent of the water, as sails puff in the wind propelling elegant sailboats over the horizon. The skyline climbs above the city, crowned by the Auckland Sky Tower, while the calm, cobalt waters of the Tasman Sea shimmer in the daylight. You drop anchor at the docks at Rangitoto Island, formed by a series of volcanic eruptions lasting more than 6,000 years, and then walk along the winding trail through the lava field to find vegetation sprouting along the edges of rugged, black soil."

Your private transfer greets you at the hotel after breakfast and escorts you to Auckland International Airport for your flight to Sydney, Australia. As the plane descends onto the runway, you view the elegant arch of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and notice the way it frames the iconic Sydney Opera House. You venture to your gorgeous hotel by way of a private transfer, taking time to indulge in the sights around the active harbor. The iconic Sydney Harbour Bridge, standing at nearly 140 feet and reaching a length of over half a mile, opened in the 1930s and connected the outskirts of Sydney to the Central Business District across the narrowest points of the harbor. Your guide greets you in the hotel lobby eager to lead you on an introductory tour of the famous Australian city, beginning in the historic district of The Rocks. The neighborhood overtakes a tongue of land protruding into the harbor. The historic streets became the first European settlement in Australia, beginning with convicts pitching tents along the rocky coastline. More than 100 heritage buildings remain in the neighborhood and showcase the sandstone bricks and iron chimneys of the 19th century. Your guide leads you to Cadman’s Cottage, the oldest surviving home in Sydney, erected in 1816.

You weigh anchor and glide gently onto the celebrated waterway connecting suburban canals to the Central Business District. Stand on the aft and enjoy the soft sea breeze brushing over the boat. Looking back at the city you can spot the iconic sails of the Sydney Opera House, and the stunning skyline crowned by the Sydney Tower, the city’s tallest building, shimmering with a golden spire.

Art galleries and murals decorating the brick walls of antique buildings add to the artistic ambiance along the avenues and hidden lanes. After breakfast, you make your way out of the city to reach the borders of the Blue Mountains National Park where the aroma of eucalyptus from the surrounding forest hangs in the air. In the morning light, the leaves cast a blue hue over the canopy, accounting for the name of the protected area that contains waterfalls, ravines, and more than 80 miles of hiking trails. Sandstone cliffs ascend above the forest-clad Jamison Valley, and the golden and rust-colored striations on the rocks contrast the emerald treetops. For an elaborate view of the landscape, your first stop is Echo Point, a clifftop platform that overlooks the Three Sisters. The ravine ridges run along the background with trees carpeting the crests and hills, while in the foreground the sandstone karsts known as the Three Sisters capture your attention. The pillars rise nearly 3,000 feet above the floor of the Jamison Valley and were created by erosion due to wind and rain. If you feel adventurous, you can follow the Giant Stairway which winds down the precipice and connects the peaks to the basin by more than 800 steps."

Surfers take to the waves and carve the breakwater crashing near the rocks away from the powdery white sand. As the day grows warmer, more people venture to Bondi Beach to relax in the hot Australian sun and to cool off in the refreshing, turquoise waters. The shop windows along Campbell Parade present fashionable clothing displays and lead to the charming outdoor seating of the local cafes. The Coogee to Bondi Coastal Walk wraps around the beach and offers spectacular vistas from which to take in the famous coastline of New South Wales and Sydney. You continue your exploration of the delightful Australian state as your private guide leads you to Hunter Valley, the oldest wine region in Australia.

After breakfast, your private transfer escorts you to Sydney International Airport for your flight east to tantalizing Tahiti.

Coconuts dangle from the palms in collected bunches. Women wear bright, hand-dyed sarongs glowing with the tropical colors of the island, and the lagoon shimmers with ultramarine hues against the rolling hills of vibrant, green trees. You catch the scent of hibiscus in the breeze blowing through the open-air vehicle. The jeep splashes through a shallow river, causing drops of cool water to reach your skin amidst the tropical heat before you step onto a path winding beneath the gigantic ferns and lush canopy. You can hear the echoing sounds of crashing water, and you find a sharp peak in the background framing the more than 440-foot tall Fautaua Waterfall.

The day is yours to embrace the splendors of Tahiti at your leisure, where you can spend time enjoying the art of the Gauguin Museum or lounging on the ebony sands of Papenoo Beach. Board a luxury catamaran to set sail to an old plane wreck. The crystal clear sea glistens with shades of turquoise, and you leap into the water and let the warm, briny texture embrace you. Blue tangs swim along the coral garden rising out of the seafloor, while a school of humbug damselfish circles in your shadow; their black and white stripes remind you of a herd of zebras.

Disembark the plane, and the views are magnified with a rainbow of greens and blues blurring together. Check into your room with a panoramic view at the Intercontinental Tahiti Resort, and it will seem that these colors extend for eternity, a perfect backdrop for your days of romance in the South Seas. Such vistas naturally lend themselves to a feeling of relaxation, and regardless of how long it took to reach Tahiti, within an hour of landing, you will appreciate that it was worth traveling to the end of the world. The resort has two restaurants, and three bars tucked away in 30 acres of private gardens on the coast and has long been rated as the best hotel on the island of Tahiti. Over the next ten days, you will grow accustomed to the rhythm of the islands, one that is not marked by time but rather by pleasure. There is no need for your watch, no requirement to stay connected on Wi-Fi, and on this first day, an insight into local culture will help you to feel at home in this alternative way of life. It will not be the setting and the indulgent resort that creates a laid-back rhythm, as while the white sand and turquoise waters obviously help in this regard, the atmosphere has its roots in the people of these islands. Their culture has always been one that favors tranquility and indulgence, and through a handful of local connections and cultural demonstrations, you will completely slow your pace. Tahiti is not just a Westernized fiction in the South Pacific, but a way of life that has always enabled escapism to thrive."

This morning you will travel onwards on a luxury catamaran that will traverse the islets and colors of the archipelago. It takes just 30 minutes to reach Moorea, an island that soars majestically out of the ocean. The island’s volcanic peaks are carpeted in velvet green, the forests and fern-softened cliffs interspersed with the poetic threads of waterfalls. A wide, shallow lagoon is back-dropped by this magnificent scene, the drama of nature standing over the tranquility of the ocean. You will be transferred from the pier to the InterContinental Moorea Resort & Spa, where you are staying in a premium beach junior suite bungalow. Situated on the white sand and shaded by a canopy of coconut palms, the bungalows are isolated from the rest of the resort. Relaxed terraced dining and cocktails are found on this side of the resort so that you can spend the each day within a short white-sand arc of your bungalow. There is absolutely no need for shoes here as the sand is soft and gentle beneath your feet. Gaze back, and the island’s massif rises evocatively; gaze out and the colors of the lagoon swirl below, beckoning you forward. In this sense, Moorea epitomizes the theme for this honeymoon. You can spend the days in the solitude of the turquoise setting, but you can also add on some adventures across the island."

Spend time in the on-site spa, swim through the waters of the infinity pool to a bar, and drift away on the lagoon’s soft current as Moorea is famed for its gentle, warm waters. This resort is handpicked as it offers Moorea’s widest range of activities, providing adventures for two on both land and water. Paddle away in a double kayak or canoe, following the shoreline to slithers of sand unbeknown to the world. The island has virtually no roads, so when you paddle in the opposite direction to the pier, it is easy to escape into a place where there is absolutely nobody else. Guided jeep tours are not quite as tranquil, but have a similar feeling of escapism. Bumping along rutted trails you will rise across these fern-covered slopes to mystical waterfalls and jagged volcanic escarpments. The views from up here are legendary, and as the wilderness envelops, you will discover that a South Seas honeymoon offers more than just the fairytale images of the coast."

The island is a gem in an archipelago of treasures, and it looks just as your imagination can muster with the rainbow of colors pierced dramatically by the massif of Mount Otemanu. The origins of Bora Bora are unquestionable as the impressive central feature reveals that this is a volcanic island rising interrupted from the ocean deep. A boat is the only means of getting to Motu Piti Aau, the eastern side of the island. Such inaccessibility creates exclusivity, with only the visitors at your resort able to see this part of Bora Bora.

        "description": "The sunlight will spread across Moorea with a breeze that carries the aromas of vanilla and dried pineapple. Sweet homemade jams adorn a stand outside of the Tropical Gardens while the farmland cultivates breadfruit and lychee, guava and coconut against a backdrop of the open South Pacific. The dining room fills with the refreshing aroma of decadent coffee for breakfast, and after the meal, you can meet your guide at your resort’s private dock to begin your stunning discovery of the lagoon beneath the surface. The wind will rush through your hair and across the fronds of the towering coconut palms and from the boat, the inland rainforest will look more like green velvet. You will find the aroma of hibiscus blending with the briny scent of the lagoon while you weight anchor around the edge of a coral garden that is blooming with vibrant colors and unique, twisting calcite formations. The sporadic mounds of coral near your overwater bungalow turn into a long stretch of rainbow hues from the coral that resembles budding roses, small tables, and unique pillars. Lemonpeel angelfish swim near purple mounds to contrast the darker hues with vibrant yellow scales. The fish have a blue ring around their eyes and can grow to nearly five inches long. The current will carry you away to find two marvelous rays swimming along the sandy seafloor. Their wingspan can grow to a width of 23 feet, while a giant clam hides amidst the coral and occasionally opens to show sparkling blue and white design. You can admire the natural splendor that thrives in the warm, crystal clear waters and reveals itself with a flash of gorgeous color and vibrant life."

        "description": "The enticing and luscious aroma of coconut blends with the scent of blossoming hibiscus. You can slowly wake as you listen to the water lapping against the posts of your bungalow and watch the fish scurry beneath the glass floor panel at the center of your suite. Nearby, the jagged peaks soar above the emerald jungle as the sunlight returns the sheen to the translucent lagoon. After breakfast, you will board your boat at the marina and venture out into the waters in search of dolphins and whales. Your guide is a certified conservationist and researcher eager to share his knowledge of the open water and island shores. Your guide will share the legends of the formation of Moorea in equal parts with the geological explanation of the island’s natural history. Sporadic mist will splash against your cheeks and leave salt crystals on your skin as your guide will point over the boat as a collection of dorsal fins rise out of the water from a pod of pilot whales. Their black, glossy skin will glint in the sunlight as they arch out of the water. They have an anchor-shaped light patch beneath their chin and can grow to nearly 24 feet long. The whales will click their teeth and whistle while foraging and show signs closely related to dolphins before your guide will explain that pilot whales are in fact the among the largest of oceanic dolphins. You will stay on the water not much longer before a pod of spinner dolphins will appear, flipping like acrobats out of the blue South Pacific."
