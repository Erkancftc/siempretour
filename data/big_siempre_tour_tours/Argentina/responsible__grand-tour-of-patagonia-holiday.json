This charming town is located on the shores of Llanquihue Lake (Chile’s second largest), framed by two snow-capped volcanoes, Osorno and Calbuco. In addition to the gorgeous scenery and lots of outdoor activities, the area’s diverse history provides a unique mix of culture. Once inhabited by the indigenous Huilliche people, the region was conquered by the Spanish in the 1540s. Later, in the 1850s, German settlers from Hamburg began to put down roots. As a result, many of the geographical names are in the Huilliche language, some of the area’s biggest attractions are hundreds of wooden churches built by Spanish Jesuit missionaries, and the architecture in several areas is distinctly German. On the way to Puerto Varas, we recommend you to stop at the lakeshore town of Puerto Octay, a charming town with a beautiful German-style architecture and the town of Frutillar, with streets lined with flower gardens and perfectly-maintained wooden buildings Transport: rental car 80 mi ~ 4h >Accommodation: Hotel (Pto Varas) > Included meals: breakfast"
