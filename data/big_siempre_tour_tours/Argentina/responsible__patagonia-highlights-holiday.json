  "generalInfo": "On this Patagonia highlights holiday you’ll discover the best of this raw natural landscape, from craggy snow-topped mountains to windswept grasslands to vast icy lakes and glimmering glaciers. It’s a landscape in which shy guanacos roam and hardy gauchos tend huge herds of sheep; and visitors from all over the world come to enjoy world class trekking and to experience life in the world’s most southerly city, Ushuaia. <br/><br/>After a day soaking up the big city charms of Buenos Aires, you’ll head for the mountain town of El Chaltén, which sits in Los Glaciares National Park and has incredible views of Mount Fitzroy and the Southern Patagonian Ice Field. Highlights of this area include the glacial lake of Laguna de los Tres and the mighty Viedma Glacier. Next it’s on to El Calafate, from where you’ll visit Perito Moreno Glacier, the fastest moving glacier on earth, which rises 200ft out of the icy waters of Lago Argentino. <br/><br/>Crossing the border into Chile takes you to one of the world's most beautiful national parks, Torres del Paine. One of the main attractions is the hike up to the base of the Three Towers - dramatic granite formations that tower above a glacial lake. It’s a long and difficult trek, but a beautiful one, passing through forests and steep rocky terrain, with beautiful views across the park. Other highlights of Torres del Paine include Lake Nordenskjold and Lake Pehoe, as well the waterfalls of Salto Grande and Salto Chico.<br/><br/>Next it’s on to Tierra del Fuego National Park, where you’ll catch a glimpse of the most southerly part of the Andes and walk through the varied terrain, flora and fauna. There’s an optional boat ride along the Beagle Channel to see marine wildlife including penguins and sea lions and, of course, a visit to Ushuaia, the southernmost city in the world. <br/>",

      "description": "Set off for a day of trekking amid the incredible mountains and valleys of Los Glaciares National Park. Our hike begins alongside Rio Blanco (the white river), taking us through a forest of lenga and ñire trees. Once out of the forest we get our first view of the Piedras Blancas Glacier. From basecamp, our trek continues up to Laguna de los Tres, a glacial lake whose still waters reflect the three main peaks of the Mount Fitz Roy massif. We return to El Chalten via the Laguna Capri lookout point trail, for serene views of Fitz Roy. This is a challenging full-day trek over fairly rough terrain which is widely regarded as one of the best and most iconic hikes in South America. It's possible to do a shorter, moderate version of today's hike which doesn't involve going all the way to Laguna de los Tres. Accommodation: Poincenot or Fitz Roy Inn (or similar)"

Today's hiking trail follows the Diablo River Valley (Devil River Valley), through native forest, past the Diablo Lagoon and across hanging bridges before emerging at the Cagliero Glacier. A cosy refuge is located in front of the glacier. This will be a welcome lunch stop before our trail continues past the Blue and Green Lagoons. Look out for sightings of the torrents duck, magellanic woodpecker and condor in this pristine environment. Accommodation: Poincenot or Fitz Roy Inn (or similar)"

      "description": "Visit Perito Moreno Glacier today, a jagged ice sheet that stretches more than 3mi (5km) across Lago Argentino and rises 200ft (61m) out of the cold waters. It is the fastest-moving glacier on the planet and the eerie creaks and thunderous groans add an atmosphere of anticipation. Every so often, an office block-sized chunk of ice calves from its face into the water below before slowly floating down the lake as an iceberg. A series of walkways offers different vantage points of the glacier, and an optional boat trip gives an even greater appreciation of the immense scale of this wonder.

      "description": "Without a doubt, one of the park highlights is the hike up to the base of the Torres del Paine. The walk itself is beautiful, trekking primarily through forests along the Ascencio River valley with incredible views. This is a challenging full-day trek and the last section is steep with rocky terrain, so you need a reasonably good level of fitness and confidence. Adverse weather conditions can make this walk much harder; your tour leader will give a trek briefing and be on hand throughout. It's possible to do a shorter, moderate version of today's hike which doesn't involve going all the way to base of the towers. Accommodation: Hosteria Pehoe or Lago del Toro (or similar)"

      "description": "Another great day of trekking lies ahead as we venture into the French Valley. A 30-minute boat trip along Lake Pehoé takes us to Paine Grande, where our trail starts with views of the azure water of Lake Skottsberg, before reaching Campamento Italiano where we begin our ascent. We hike for around 1hr 30min until the French Glacier lookout, where we can observe an impressive hanging glacier and listen for the rumbling of small avalanches as great chunks of ice and snow fall off. The trail continues until Campamento Británico and onto another lookout point, Mirador Británico. The full trek distance of 12.5mi (20km) applies if we reach the very end of Valle Frances; often, we only go as far as one particular viewpoint due to the weather and/or group condition. We return back along the French valley to Campamento Italiano, catching sight of Nordenskjöld Lake and re-tracing our steps to the boat back across Lake Pehoé. Accommodation: Hosteria Pehoe or Lago del Toro (or similar)"

There are magnificent views from the hills leading up to the Martial Glacier and some small shops to pick up souvenirs. Ushuaia has just one museum, housed in the former prison, which is worth a visit.
