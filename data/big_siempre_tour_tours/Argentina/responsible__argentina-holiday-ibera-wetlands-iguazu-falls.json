  "generalInfo": "On this Argentina holiday you’ll experience the Ibera Wetlands and Iguazu Falls on a five day tailor made journey that takes you away from the main tourist trail. In the Ibera Wetlands you’ll tour the swamps, marshes and lagoons where a wide variety of wildlife make their home, from pig-like peccaries to capybaras to armadillos. In Iguazu National Park you’ll visit both the Argentinean and Brazilian sides of the Iguazu Falls, whose beauty you can appreciate from the many walking trails and boat trips.<br/><br/>What makes this tour the most interesting, perhaps, is your accommodation. You’ll enjoy traditional Argentinean food and hospitality with stays at local estancias – old, usually family run establishments, home to sweeping grounds, horses and gauchos. They are a fascinating insight into Argentinean life and an experience that you’re sure to remember for a long time to come. <br/>",

      "description": "From Posadas to an off-the-beaten-path destination... When you arrive in Posadas, you will be taken to a small estancia in the Iberá region, close to the renowned wetlands. Enjoy the classic gaucho setting. The estancia is an excellent starting point for exploring the surrounding area. The Esteros are the world's second-largest wetlands, after the Pantanal in Brazil. Iberá is also one of the continent's largest freshwater reservoirs. The estancia is an ideal base for exploring the area and experiencing a real gaucho atmosphere. Because this is more like a family home than a hotel, you will be able to eat handmade meals and learn about the local customs. After arriving at the estancia, you will have the afternoon free to explore the magnificent, isolated countryside on foot or on horseback."
