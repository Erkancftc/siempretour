  "generalInfo": "Explore the very best that this part of the world has to offer with a trip which takes you from the Brazilian capital all the way to densely bio-diverse Colombia. This trip has something for everyone and offers a real taste of all the different facets that South America has to offer. Along the way pay a visit to Ushuaia, the southernmost city in the world, take in the cultural diversity and extremes of climate that spanning 9 countries will inevitably showcase and see both extremes of city immersion and real remoteness. While there will be long drives and tough camping and cooking conditions this tour gives you the unique opportunity to see the real South America and the possibility to meet people you would never otherwise encounter. Please note that the accommodation on this trip is predominantly camping, though there may be opportunities to upgrade this locally where rooms are available. Please see the trip inclusions for an approximate percentage of camping and room nights",
