  "generalInfo": "This tailor made Argentina tour gives you a handle on the country’s best bits, from glaciers to soaring mountains to buzzing cities. Your adventure starts in Argentine capital Buenos Aires, where there’ll be time for a tour of the city’s political and historic heart, as well as an evening watching a Tango show and sampling traditional Argentine cuisine. You’ll get further big city action as you continue your trip, passing through the dynamic capital of Argentina’s wine lands, Mendoza, as well as paying a visit to Ushuaia, the continent’s adventure capital, which sits right at the country’s southern tip.<br/><br/>Of course, there’s plenty of natural beauty on offer, too. You’ll visit both the Argentinean and Brazilian sides of thundering Iguazu Falls; take a boat trip around the dramatic Perito Moreno Glacier, trek the wild landscapes of Tierra del Fuego National Park and cruise the Beagle Channel in search of marine wildlife including cormorants and fur seals. <br/><br/>Since this is a tailor made tour you’re welcome to adjust your itinerary as you see fit – perhaps adding extra days or destinations, or even adjusting your budget if you want to stay at cheaper or more expensive hotels. For example, you could choose to spend more time at Mendoza’s wineries or go horse riding at a ranch just outside Buenos Aires – it’s all up to you!<br/>",
