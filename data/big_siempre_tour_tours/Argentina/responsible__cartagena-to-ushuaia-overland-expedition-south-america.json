      "description": "CARTAGENA TO TAYRONA NATIONAL PARK A highlight of any trip to Colombia is undoubtedly Cartagena. With its colonial past and Unesco World Heritage status, the old city is an ideal place to just wander the maze of cobbled alleys amongst churches, monasteries, plazas and bougainvillea draped balconies. Las Murallas, the thick walls built around the old city to protect it from pirates, are wonderfully preserved and make for an interesting walk, before stopping off in one of the hidden patio cafes. We spend our first night here to get a flavour of both the old city and also the trendy area of Bocagrande. We will also include a boat trip to Playa Blanca, which is one of Cartagenas most famous beaches with its turquoise waters and golden sand. We then set off in the Truck heading eastbound with a quick dip in Volcan de Lodo el Totumo before we continue to Taganga where we spend a night in this chilled out Caribbean town with a strong alternative feel. Some of South America's loveliest coastline lies east of Taganga in Tayrona National Park. We spend time exploring trails to beaches set in deep bays, shaded by coconut palms. We have the option to snorkel and possibly scuba dive in some of the bays. Lack of roads means that we may hike with some of our gear to our overnight spots and sleep in hammocks!"

      "description": "TAYRONA NATIONAL PARK TO SALENTO We then head south into the heart of Colombia, with a roadside bush camp on the way before arriving in the lively city of Medellin. Here is a good spot to get a few Salsa or Tango lessons in before trying out your moves in the many discos and clubs. For those wanting a little culture there are several art galleries and museums worth visiting or also an option to travel via local bus to the sleepy colonial town of Santa Fe de Antioquia. Continuing south, our Colombian overland adventure takes us into the mountains to the pleasantly cool climate of Salento. Here, deep in the heart of the coffee growing area, we have the option to visit one of the numerous coffee farms. Parque Los Nevados, with peaks topping 5000m, and weirdly tall Palm trees make it a great place to spend a day trekking, before checking out some of the town's funky bars in the evening."

      "description": "SALENTO TO PARQUE PURACE We now travel through the Tatacoa Desert, an arid area of striking eroded cliffs surrounded by distant peaks of over 5000mtrs. The result is a quite unique ecosystem, and due to the dry, clear conditions, the area is an excellent star gazing spot and we will try to camp here to appreciate the view. Turning west through stunning mountain scenery towards the Pan American Highway, and after a gruelling drive, we eventually take an unpaved road into Parque Purace. The park is the only place to see Condors in Colombia, and it is also home to some good walking trails. The adventurous can scale Volcan Purace (4750mtrs), but there are a few other less strenuous hikes to the Sulphur Mine and Termales de San Juan - a spectacular hot spring complete with water slides! We may also have time to stop to see the San Agustin Archaeological Park, home to numerous ancient carved volcanic stone figures and tombs."

      "description": "PARQUE PURACE TO QUITO Further west is the beautiful colonial city of Popayan. Nicknamed the white city, some would say only Cartagena surpasses Popayan's colonial structures. We shall make a small stop to admire the chalk white facades and stock up on supplies, before following the Andes south towards Pasto. Santuario De Las Lajas - a neo-Gothic church built on a stone bridge spanning a gorge - is the main point of interest in our last stop in Colombia, Ipiales. We may choose to camp the night in either Pasto or Ipiales, or possibly continue on to the border with Ecuador. We cross the equator as we make our way to Quito, a capital city rich in history, surrounded by mountains - a play ground for hikers and mountain bike fans. On the way we cross the Equator and stop at the town of Otavalo famous for its colourful craft market."

      "description": "QUITO TO THE AMAZON JUNGLE AND CUENCA Departing Quito, Ecuador’s largest city, we head east on narrow, tortuous roads to the steamy edge of the Amazon basin and our gateway into the Amazon jungle. Here accompanied by experienced guides, we explore on foot this exotic environment staying at a forest lodge. Further south, perched high in the mountains of Ecuador, lies the outdoor adventure mecca of Banos. This spa town, where Ecuadorians go to relax in the thermal baths, is a favourite amongst those who have undertaken South America travel. With optional activities including rafting, canyoning and treks to waterfalls, you won't be short of things to do! We hit the road again and drive south along the spine of the Andes towards Peru visiting Cuenca on the way."

      "description": "CUENCA TO LIMA A day’s drive and a bush camp on the Pan-American highway brings us to the border with Peru. You will notice an amazing transition in one day, from the glush farming country of highland Ecuador, through sub-tropical forest and immense banana plantations, to dry barren desert in Peru. We are rewarded with a couple of days chilling by the beach at Punta Sal and Mancora. Our next stops on our South America travel experience are the Chan Chan ruins, imperial citadel of the pre-Inca Chimu kings which the Incas later conquered. It claims to be the largest mud brick city in the world. Continuing with the Andes close to our left and the sea on our right, the capital city of Lima will be our next stop on our South America tour. Here you'll encounter both abundant wealth and grinding poverty, modern skyscrapers next to some of the finest museums and historical monuments in Latin America."

      "description": "LIMA TO COLCA CANYON AND CUSCO Departing Lima our next stop is the Ballestas Islands in the Paracas National Reserve. By boat, you have the opportunity to visit the rare and exotic sea birds and mammals that inhabit these islands. An hour's drive inland in the heart of the Ica Desert is the Oasis of Huacachina; if it’s an adrenaline rush you're after, you have the option to head out on a custom made dune buggy & roar across the desert sands to the top of enormous dunes & then sand board down them - head first on a greased up plank of wood! Then, after an unforgettable desert sunset, we sit around the campfire while our guides cook up a storm, followed by a night sleeping out under the stars. In the morning we make our way to one of the world's great archaeological mysteries The Nazca Lines. These huge figures and shapes, carved into the desert floor are best viewed from the air, with various optional flights available - South America travel is not complete until you have seen these unbelievable ancient mysteries. Still heading south we visit Chauchilla Cemetery with its well-preserved mummies, on our way to Puerto Inca, at this ancient Inca harbour we camp at the beach and enjoy our last night at sea level before beginning our climb back into the towering Andes. The next two nights are spent in Arequipa at 2325m, giving us time to acclimatise, and enjoy this beautiful colonial city with its impressive El Misti Volcano in the background. Arequipa is also the gateway to one of the deepest canyons in the world. Twice as deep as the Grand Canyon, Colca Canyon is an awesome sight. Here, if you get up early, Condors can be seen circling lazily on the thermals rising from the canyon floor. A couple of day’s driving and an overnight bush camp then bring us to Cusco."

      "description": "CUSCO, INCA TRAIL AND MACHU PICCHU Widely considered to be the most interesting city for South America travel, our next stop Cusco is surrounded by the Sacred Valley of the Incas and offers a wide range of activities to explore the region. We will base ourselves here for 6 days giving us enough time for the Inca Trail trip and to visit Machu Picchu, which is regarded by many to be the highlight of their South America tour. There are several treks which you can take to Machu Picchu. These are all available as Optional Add Ons which you can add to your booking. When permits are still available, we will organise the Classic Trail trek for those booking the trek option, but great alternative Inca Trail treks, like the Lares or Salkantay can be arranged when the Classic is not available or by your choice (must be pre-arranged at time of booking). These alternatives mean that you still get to visit Machu Picchu. If you do not want to trek, then you can remain in Cusco for a couple more free days, and then we offer an option to visit Machu Picchu by train instead. This must also be booked and paid for in advance. Tours to Machu Picchu are absolutely unbelievable; a trip to this City in the Clouds is an ancient and awe-inspiring part of our South America travel tour. Besides seeing Machu Picchu, you are able to enjoy the architectural uniqueness of Cusco and explore some of the colourful surrounding markets. Please note that for all those visiting Machu Picchu there is now the option to buy a ticket to go up the summit next to Machu Picchu, Huayna Picchu. Tickets for this must be requested at the time of your booking with us, and payment made in advance in the UK."

      "description": "CUSCO TO LA PAZ Bordering Peru and Bolivia at 3800m lies Lake Titicaca, the home of the Uros Indians who have made their dwellings on floating reed islands. By boat we visit the floating islands during the day and then we go that one step beyond the average tourist and spend the night with one of the Indian families on the lesser known islands Isla Amantani or Taquile. Spending some time during South America travel in these local communities will provide a unique opportunity to learn more about the traditional lifestyle of the Andean people and their customs. From here it is a days drive to the capital of Bolivia - La Paz. This is a great place to visit a 'peña' club, dedicated to Andean folk music, and perhaps buy some souvenirs in one of the authentic markets such as the witches market. It’s also well worth while exploring the city using the network of cable cars stretching up the hillsides."

      "description": "LA PAZ TO UYUNI Leaving La Paz we enter real Bolivia, where the Aymara and Quechua Indians scrape a living from their small plots of land in the harsh climate and paved roads are virtually non-existent. A couple of day’s driving and overnight bush camp bring us to one of Bolivia’s most beautiful cities, Sucre. Known as the ‘4 Names City’ because of its long and varied history, the city is at a lower altitude than La Paz and enjoys a warmer and greener climate. The Cretaceous Park is well worth a visit, as you can see and learn about the thousands of remarkable dinosaur footprints discovered here, including the largest ever found, from a Titanosaur weighing over 70 tonnes!. A short drive then brings us to Potosi. At over 4000m it is the highest city of its size in the world and 400 years ago it was the largest city in all the Americas. Vast amounts of silver were extracted from Potosi and shipped to Spain in years gone by. The adventurous may take the opportunity to go down one of these mines where mining techniques have remained unchanged for centuries, though read up on safety concerns first. Visiting the ancient mint or having a tour around the Casa Nacional de Moneda (National Money House) also provides a good look into Potosi's and Bolivia's past. Leaving the bleak Altiplano we arrive at the shimmering white Salt Flats of Uyuni. With no roads and only vague tracks to follow, taking an optional jeep trip out onto the salt flats and salt lakes makes for an unforgettable experience"

      "description": "UYUNI TO SANTIAGO Our descent through the Andean passes is spectacular as we cross into Argentina towards the colonial city of Salta. On the way we pass the rugged desert landscapes and red rock formations in the Tupiza River Valley, and see the Cerro de los Siete Colores (Hill of 7 Colours). After a couple of nights’ break in Salta, allowing us to relax and enjoy the cafes around the Plaza 9 de Julio which is bordered by the neoclassical Salta Cathedral and 18th century El Cabildo, town hall turned museum. After Salta, we head south winding around lakes and weaving through baked cliffs until we reach Cafayate, the first wine region of Argentina. Famous for its white wines, you can explore some of the wineries on foot or by bicycle. Continuing south we join the route 40, the longest route in Argentina, to Mendoza, the biggest wine region in Argentina. Here you can indulge in more wine and good steak! From here we head for Chile as we cross the Andes past the Inca Bridge and San Martin's pass and into the modern capital, Santiago. We have some free time here to explore the city, and with famous Chilean Steak houses, the Casillero del Diablo winery, skiing available in the winter, you will find it easy to pass the days away."

      "description": "HANGING GLACIER TO EL CHALTEN & EL CALAFATE After arriving in El Chalten we have a few days to explore and enjoy the amazing scenery here. El Chalten is rightly known as the trekking capital of Argentina, and there are many optional day hikes in the surrounding mountains, including up to the base camp of Mount Fitz Roy. From El Chalten we drive back along the shore of Lago Viedma and then drive south to Lago Argentina and the town of El Calafate which is a bigger base for more adventures into Los Glaciares National Park. This includes the largest glacier in the world and here you have the option to take a boat ride up close to Perito Moreno Glacier, almost 200 ft high. Options are also available to take guided walks with crampons on top of the glacier, hikes in the surrounding mountains, and horse rides in nearby Estancias."

      "description": "TORRES DEL PAINE NP & PUERTO NATALES From Calafate we cross back into Chile and arrive at the coast at Puerto Natales. We base ourselves here for several days particularly for visits to Torres del Paine National Park, another area of outstanding beauty where huge granite cliffs dominate the landscape. A good way to explore the area is either hiking or by horseback. Here there is also the option to complete the famous W-Trek (bookable as an Add on), and we allow 4 full days for people to complete this trek. Please note that spaces on the trek are subject to availability. For those who do not want to complete the W-Trek there are options of shorter day hikes in the park which do not need to be booked ahead and you are free to do as you choose once there. You could also take a boat trip to Magdalena Island, which hosts one of the largest colonies of Magellanic Penguins, exceeding 150,000. During the trip you may also spot Austral Dolphins and Toninas."

      "description": "PUERTO NATALES TO USHUAIA We continue south towards the wild and hauntingly beautiful land at worlds end, the island of Tierra del Fuego. We cross by ferry to the most southerly town in the world Ushuaia, from where you can view the green waters of the Beagle Channel, and the snow clad peaks beyond. We have a few days here, and boat trips on the Beagle Channel and to Penguin Island are available as well as hiking trips to the Emerald Lagoon or the Vinciguerra Glacier. For those not feeling so active, a fun and scenic vintage steam train ride is available on the Fuegian Railway into the Tierra del Fuego National Park. Ushuaia is also the starting point for many cruise ships and expeditions heading to Antarctica, and you could aim to time a trip there with the end of your expedition with us. Winter in Patagonia - Please note that any trips which travel through this part of Patagonia between July and September will coincide with winter in Patagonia. This will give us the opportunity to see the Andes at their most impressive, driving past towering snow-capped peaks and experiencing this rugged wilderness at a time of year that not many other travellers get to see! We will hopefully have the chance to ski or snowboard in Bariloche and Ushuaia, ice-climb across glaciers in El Chalten, and hike in national parks at the most dramatic time of year. However, weather conditions can be unpredictable, and there is a chance that certain roads will not be passable, so we cannot guarantee following our planned itinerary to Tierra del Fuego; changes may have to be made with little or no notice. But if this is required we will make a new plan and find a different route that will be sure to offer its own attractions and experiences, so come prepared for an adventure!"
