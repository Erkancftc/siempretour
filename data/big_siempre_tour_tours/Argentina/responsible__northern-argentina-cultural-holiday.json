      "description": "Your guide will meet you at your hotel, to show you the historical district (Plaza de Mayo, the Cabildo, and the main buildings), pointing out different architectural styles and impressive domes. After strolling along its Haussmann-style boulevards, head to the bohemian neighborhood of San Telmo and the very colorful La Boca, famous for its unique street, Caminito, a true open-air museum. At some point during your visit, you will enjoy 60 minutes in a comfortable studio with your professional dance teacher in the world capital of tango. During the lesson, you will learn the basic steps (or more if you already dance) to dance tango on the dance floor, the embrace, how to walk, the basic step, the \"Ocho,\" and other movements. The Argentine and Uruguayan tradition of tango, now renowned worldwide, was born in the popular circles of Buenos Aires and Montevideo, in the Rio de la Plata basin. In this region where European immigrants, descendants of African slaves, and natives mix, the Criollos, a heterogeneous mix of customs, beliefs, and rituals, emerged to evolve into a characteristic cultural identity. Among the best-known forms of expression of this identity, the music, dance, and poetry of tango are both a reflection and a vector of cultural diversity and dialogue. English-speaking guide. The visit is done on foot and by public transportation. Duration: 5 hours. At 5 pm, you will begin an Asado Experience. It's a BBQ cooking class with premium meat and wine where you will discover a local authentic Argentine tradition. This activity recreates the Asado in a unique location: Belen's +100 years old family house in Belgrano, a residential neighborhood in Buenos Aires city. The fire is the first step of this ritual. It is much more than cooking, is turning on tradition, memories, and new experiences with friends or family. In fact, the asado is just an excuse to be reunited around the fire sharing a glass of wine and laughter. You will enjoy different cuts of our premium meat selection accompanied by premium wine, Catena Zapata, an Argentinian wine that stands with the best in the world. You will be participating in a hands-on activity where we will prepare the traditional Chimichurri Sauce with Belen’s family recipe. You will be also helping the host with the cooking process: salting the cuts, using our tools to identify in which cooking stage the cuts are, and placing the egg on the red pepper to discover how we cook each ingredient on the grill. You will learn how to start the fire, you will share a table with other guests, you will prepare the chimichurri sauce with Belen's family recipe and you will learn about Argentinian meat and the best techniques to grill. Not only you will be hearing a lot of stories and anecdotes about Argentina from us, but you’ll also get to share a meal with a reduced group of travelers from all over the world. Finally, you will taste unique flavors experiencing the flow of an authentic Argentine Asado. Three-hour 'hands-on' experience.
