      "description": "Welcome to Buenos Aires One of Argentina’s top attractions is the leviathan metropolis of Buenos Aires, the most fascinating of all South American capitals. It’s a riveting place just to wander about, people-watching, shopping or simply soaking up the unique atmosphere. Its many barrios (neighborhoods) are startlingly different – some are decadently old-fashioned, others daringly modern – but all of them ooze character. Buenos Aires has got everything: night-life, tango, culture, football, excellent beef and the best local wines. Private City Tour. The city tour would be a mixture of driving and walking and would take in all the major sights of Buenos Aires. From the Flor Generica And the Rose gardens we would make our way to the park of memory . This park is dedicated to the 30,000 Argentines who disappeared during the dictatorship between the years 1976 to 1983. We would then visit Recoleta and the final resting place of EVA (Evita) Peron. This would be followed by the plaza San Martin and the Plaza de Mayo. This plaza has a rich history and the mothers of the plaza de Mayo still march their every Thursday holding the pictures of their disappeared youngsters and wearing their iconic headscarves. This is also the sight of the Casa Rosada where Evita made her famous balcony speech. From there we would move on to take in San Telmo and la Boca with the famous Caminito. We would move on then to the Theatro Colon and the 9th of July Avenue which at 18 lanes wide is the worlds largest and quite a sight to be hold. Argentine Dinner Party Experience. You will take part in the Argentina Dinner Experience this evening . This unique dinner party's concept is to teach you the fundamentals of what being an Argentine is all about, whilst simply having more fun than is available anywhere else. Learn how to close your own empanada using the 'repulge' technique, to order steak your way in Spanish, to prepare your own 'mate' drink. During the experience you get to take part in the ritual of preparing an Argentina Asado with the best of Argentina beef whilst sampling the best of Argentine wines. This is a group experience and is a lot of fun and great way to meet fellow travellers."

What better way to pass Sunday than a visit to the Sunday San Telmo Market - private tour The Feria de San Telmo is one of the most notable and popular events that takes place in Buenos Aires. Nestled in one of the oldest neighborhoods in Buenos Aires, the San Telmo Fair is bustling with unique artisans and antiques every Sunday (depending on the season and the weather). Perhaps its greatest qualities, besides the architecturally beautiful neighborhood which it calls home, are its exclusive goods and reliable nature. Never a Sunday will there be without tourists pouring into the cobblestone streets of San Telmo for one of a kind antiques, trinkets, art, tango and delicious food. Los Angelitos Tango Dinner Show. Buenos Aires is the world capital of Tango and Los Angelitos experiences the nostalgic mood with intensity through dance, music, clothing and poetry. Lively and ethereal, El Cabaret is the vibrant dance of this award winning show. A dazzling live orchestra, great dancers, traditional Argentine cuisine, and a fine selection of local wines and cocktails, make it a must see production.
