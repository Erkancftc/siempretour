      "title": "Touching Down in the Capital of Argentina",
      "description": "Early this morning, you’ll find yourself on the outskirts of breathtaking Buenos Aires, the capital of arresting Argentina and one of the great cities of South America. A private driver will be waiting for you at the airport, ready to transport you to your perfectly located and luxurious hotel, filled with modern amenities and resplendent with Latin American charm. Take some time to relax and recover from your long journey before setting out to see the sights of this magical metropolis for the first time. The afternoon features a fully guided tour of Buenos Aires, showing the best of its various barrios (neighborhoods) and giving you unique insight into its indescribable and undeniable allure. Make your way to the opulent city center, where you’ll find the famous Plaza de Mayo, the center of Argentine political activism for more than a century. Nearby is the iconic Casa Rosada , the “Pink House” that serves as the executive mansion for the President of Argentina. Continue to the charming neighborhood of San Telmo, whose cobblestone streets echo a decidedly artistic feel, before turning to the boisterous and colorful barrio (neighborhood) of La Boca, where the air is filled with the shouts of street vendors and the graceful forms of tango dancers. You’ll also get a chance to see the newly restored and renovated port at Puerto Madero and the stately streets of Palermo, where you’ll find some of the finest shops and restaurants in all of Buenos Aires.

      "title": "An Unforgettable Excursion in the Heart of the Pampas",
      "description": "Leave the excitement of the city and head out to the rugged romance of the Argentine plains known as the Pampas , where the Gauchos have roamed the land for countless years, driving the cattle that make Argentina’s beef industry one of the best-regarded in the world. You’ll get a fascinating and insightful look into the history, culture and traditions of these South American cowboys, reveling in their stories and songs and enjoying the wide-open spaces that give Argentina its characteristic beauty. The highlight of the day is lunch, where you’ll get to try sumptuously grilled meat that is as fresh and delicious as any you’ve ever had while getting a first-hand look at the incredible skills of these legendary cattle handlers. You’ll be awed when you see these men saddle up a horse and set it to herding, and you’ll be inspired by their dedication to the land and the animals that they’ve spent their life herding and protecting. The afternoon sees you back in Buenos Aires, ready to enjoy the delights of this incredible city. Stroll along the expansive Avenida 9 de Julio – the widest avenue in the world – and ogle at the impressive buildings that line its tree-filled sidewalks, from the gorgeous French Embassy to the sublime Teatro Colon, Argentina’s premier opera house and one of the five finest concert halls on the planet."

      "description": "Begin your day with some retail therapy at Buenos Aires’s best shopping districts. Fine leather goods can be found in just about every corner of the city, but there are certainly some hidden gems and a number of beautiful stores in some of the most luxurious barrios (neighborhoods). Palermo Viejo is a must-visit for artsy, Boho-chic types - it’s Buenos Aires’s answer to SoHo – and nearby Murillo Street is the place for leather handbags and apparel. Florida Street and Lavalle Street in the Microcentro are pedestrian-only areas with wares that range from touristy items like mate to candies, baked goods, and excellent food. And no shopping trip to Buenos Aires would be complete without a visit to El Ateneo, a theater turned bookstore that is one of the most beautiful stores of its kind. This evening, you’ll get up close and personal with Argentina’s most famous export, the steamy and sultry dance known as the tango, where romance sizzles in every step and where passion is ignited in the opening strains of the dancing tunes. You’ll gorge on fine Argentine beef, sip on a succulent Malbec and simply sit back and marvel at these marvelous artists, spinning a story of love and intrigue in graceful, elegant movements that will make you want to get up and try your hand at this truly unique art form."
