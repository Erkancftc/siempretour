  "generalInfo": "This Patagonia adventure holiday is perfect for walkers who have always wanted to experience the wilderness of this magnificent, mountainous region but perhaps not the hardcore trekking that some trips offer. Focused on southern Patagonia, we visit the three most famous protected areas: Torres del Paine National Park in Chile, Fitzroy and Tierra del Fuego National Parks in Argentina. Along the way, we stay in either campsites of hostels, in order that you get that truly wild Patagonian experience. You don’t have to carry too much weight on this trip, as the camps (with toilet facilities) are all set up in advance of your arrival. <br/><br/>A small group tour, travelling with expert local guides throughout, this Patagonia itinerary starts in El Calafate, and then we travel north to El Chalten with the Cerros Fitz Roy and Torre at its heart. Camping here, we have two days of walking with magnificent views of many peaks, and also the Torre Glacier.  You have an option to walk on this glacier, with plenty more time to examine glacial activity at our next stop, Glaciers National Park, which has the giant Perito Moreno Glacier as its centrepiece, best seen by a boat trip. <br/><br/>Torres del Paine National Park is our next stop, famous for its three enormous granite Torres towers, but we also take treks to see both the Grey Glacier and French Valley, with its rugged cliffs, peaks, and hanging glaciers. Our final stop is Ushuaia, the southernmost town on the continent with a couple of stops en route. For example, after crossing the Magellan Strait, we stay at a remote estancia or ranch and learn about rural Patagonian lifestyles. Then finally, Tierra del Fuego archipelago as well as a boat trip on the Beagle Channel, where wildlife watching is spectacular for the likes of seals, birds and penguins in their natural habitat of ice coated mountains and rugged islands. Time it right and you may even see orcas. Anything can happen when you are at the end of the world which, as you will see, it totally out of this world. <br/>",

El Calafate lies on the shore of the vast, turquoise lake Argentino and is today a gateway to the natural wonders of the Los Glaciares national park.

      "description": "Bus from Puerto Natales to Ushuaia. It’s a long bus journey today, but worth it. After breakfast, we drive south to the legendary Magellan Strait. We follow the strait to Primera Angostura, where we board a ferry to cross these iconic waters. Hernando de Magallanes discovered this maritime route in 1520. It remained the logical passage for vessels looping around South America until the Panama Canal opened in the early twentieth century. It’s hard not to think about those brave mariners fighting the conditions in often precarious boats. Our destination is Tierra del Fuego. This translates literally as Land of Fire after the first white sailors saw the cooking fires of the local people. We continue driving, entering Argentina once more at Paso San Sebastián, then on to Ushuaia. Journey time approximately 12-13 hours with border crossing into Argentina on Tierra del Fuego Island. On arrival transfer to your accommodation. Hostel dorm or private room in Ushuaia. Note: Groups of 10 or more people spend the night at Estancia Las Hijas in Rio Grande, where a classic Patagonian barbecue awaits us (dinner included if we make this stop). Approx. drive time: 12-13 hours. Meals included: Breakfast (or breakfast and dinner if staying at Estancia Las Hijas) Hostel dorm or private room Ushuaia.

About Ushuaia Ushuaia, in Tierra del Fuego, is Argentina’s southernmost city and is perched on the Beagle Channel. What was once a remote penal colony is now a bustling port and the gateway to Antarctica—cruises set off from here for Antarctica or Punta Arenas in Chile via Cape Horn. Ushuaia is historically interesting, Charles Darwin wrote much about it, and it is home to some fascinating naval history museums. Visitors can take a sailing tour on the wildlife-rich Beagle Channel, visit a Penguin colony during the season, trek into the mountains behind the city and kayak in the Tierra del Fuego national park. Hostel dorm or private room in Ushuaia. Meals included: Breakfast.
