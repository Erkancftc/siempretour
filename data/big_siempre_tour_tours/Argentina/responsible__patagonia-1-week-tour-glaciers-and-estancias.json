      "description": "Pick-up starts at 8 hs Every land has its secrets, but not everyone is chosen to know them. A lighthouse on a lonely cape, a mysterious ship that ran aground 40 years ago, and a distinguished old estancia are just some of the icons that will reveal the unknown stories of Tierra del Fuego. Early in the morning, you will leave Ushuaia along National Route 3 and cross the Andes via Paso Garibaldi. At 450 meters above sea level, this is one of the most interesting points of the journey. After around 60 km, Lake Escondido will surprise you amid the high rock faces. As you continue, you'll notice that the ecosystem is gradually changing from forest to steppe in the northern part of the island, a region known for breeding the best lamb in the world. Next, you'll head for provincial road \"A\", where you'll take a gravel road and visit Estancia Rolito. This beautiful estancia, which retains the spirit of a family business founded on the tradition of sheep farming, is the first to open its doors to rural tourism. It's here that you'll pause for a delicious tea with homemade cakes, biscuits, and jams. You'll also have time to take a stroll through part of the magnificent ancient Lenga forest. After enjoying this picturesque setting, you will continue towards the Atlantic Ocean and Cape San Pablo. At this point, you will climb a secluded mountain at the foot of which is an abandoned lighthouse (easy walk). When you reach the top of this lighthouse, you'll see the Desdemona, a ship that has been abandoned for almost 40 years and invites you to step back in time. It was on a cold winter's morning in 1983 that this enormous ship ran aground on the shores of the Argentine Sea. After exploring this mysterious giant, you'll pay a visit to local fishermen who will invite you to enjoy a home-cooked lunch of fresh fish on their premises. You will be welcomed into their home by Silvia and Miguel. Return to your hotel after a unique experience. Excursion in a small group with an English/Spanish-speaking guide. Available only from October to April"
