  "generalInfo": "This magnificent Argentina holiday is a tailor made trip that takes in the natural and cultural wonders of the country, the two greatest being the Andes and Iguazu Falls. Not forgetting the immense Altiplano. Starting and ending in Buenos Aires, with three domestic flights to help speed up your journey around this enormous country, you will visit a wide array of contrasting sites along the way. <br/><br/>Starting in Salta in the northwest, this town is in the foothills of the Andes Mountains and a great place to get to grips with the vast size of landscapes in Argentina. Drive from here into the Andes Cordillera to explore remote villages, the Seven Colours Mountains of the Humahuaca Valley and high altitude vineyards of El Cafayate. <br/><br/>Among these wonderful landscapes in Argentina, cultural heritage highlights include pre-Inca ruins at Quilmes or Santa Rosa de Tastil, as well as a chance to meet the ingenious Guarani people of Jejy who lead a hunter gatherer lifestyle in the rainforests. <br/><br/>Wildlife and wonderful plantlife are a feature of all the landscapes you visit on this holiday with thousands of species of plants, birds, butterflies and mammals inhabiting the mountain valleys and rainforests. The natural highlight for many people is the visit to Iguazu Falls National Park, up on the border with Brazil. This is one of the greatest cascades on earth, made up of a collection of 275 waterfalls ranging between 40 and 80m in drop and spread over a distance of 2.5km.<br/><br/>On this tailor made holiday in Argentina, although you will be travelling independently using a variety of private and public transfers, we will provide a bespoke handbook for your trip with all the details you need to make this a very memorable holiday. As well as round the clock support with us via mobile phone. <br/>",
