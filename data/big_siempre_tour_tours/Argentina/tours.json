Each neighbourhood of Buenos Aires has its own distinct character, with grand Italianate architecture sitting alongside winding cobbled streets or tree-lined avenues. To get a feel for the heart of the city, we'll walk towards its founding point at the Plaza de Mayo, where the President's dusty-pink mansion is located. Every big event in Buenos Aires's history has been witnessed by the Plaza, from the continued protests of the 'Madres de la Plaza de Mayo', going back to Eva Peron's mass demonstrations in 1945. From here, we'll hop on a bus towards the vibrant neighbourhood of La Boca. Originally settled by Italian migrants, the area is famed for its bright houses, a ramshackle affair of corrugated iron, and the tango dancers who perform in the streets. We'll visit a local 'cafecito' during our tour, taking a traditional Porteno snack of coffee and pastries. We'll end our morning in bohemian San Telmo, with its small one-way streets, historic mansions and walls adorned with street art. Our tour leader will suggest lunch at a traditional restaurant here, for those who wish. It's worth noting that our city tour will last around five hours and will involve several hours of walking to see the city's highlights. This afternoon, you're free to explore more at your own pace. You could stay and explore San Telmo, which is particularly interesting when the antique market takes over the cobbled streets. Or visit Recoleta Cemetery, the final resting place of Argentine luminaries, including Eva Peron. For book lovers, the Ateneo Grand Splendid, set in a converted theatre, is one of the most impressive bookstores in the world. This evening, we'll have an opportunity to enjoy something of Buenos Aires' nightlife, perhaps going to a tango show and soaking up the pulsating rhythms of the Latin dance."

        "description": ": Today we'll transfer to the airport for our flight to Ushuaia, the world's southernmost city, located on the Island of Tierra del Fuego at the very tip of the South American continent. Beyond this remote port lies the Beagle Channel and then the open waters of The Drake Passage, where the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans converge. This afternoon is free to explore the city as you choose. You may wish to stay on land, visiting the old prison of Ushuaia, now the Maritime Museum and an excellent portrait of the harsh realities of life on these unforgiving oceans. Alternatively, there are three different trips around the coast that allow you to get closer to the awesome nature in this part of the world: 1. Beagle Channel catamaran and penguin spotting. This five-hour excursion sees you taking a catamaran boat from Ushuaia through the Beagle Channel, cruising around Sea Lion Island, Bird Island, Les Eclaireurs Lighthouse and Martillo Island. During the trip, we'll try to spot sea lions, cormorants and other diverse wildlife. At Isla Martillo the catamaran approaches the beach to see the Magellanic Penguin colony. Please note that on this trip there are no landings, but it's a great overview of the incredible scenery in the Beagle Channel. 2. Harberton Estancia and Isla Martillo. This six-hour tour starts with a 90-minute drive to the Harberton Estancia, the oldest ranch in the Tierra del Fuego, dating back to the late 1800s. If the Estancia is open, you'll have the option of visiting the small museum inside for an additional fee, payable locally. The main reason for our trip here is to access the pier, which is the launching point for boats travelling to Isla Martillo - an island just 15 minutes offshore that's home to a large penguin colony. This excursion is run by the only company permitted to let visitors disembark and walk among the penguins. Magellanic penguins are the largest colony, but you may also see Gentoo penguins or King Emperor penguins. Taking an hour-long walk around the island with a guide, you'll discover these colonies before the 15-minute return boat ride and 90-minute drive back to Ushuaia. 3. Beagle Channel boat to Sea Lion Island and Bird Island. This last boat trip doesn't take you out to see the penguins, sailing just around the sea lion island and bird island. For those on a budget who may have seen penguins in other places, this is a great option to witness the area's wildlife and the bleak scenery of the Beagle Channel. All excursions here in Ushuaia should be pre-booked before departure, preferably a minimum of three months prior to your trip. We cannot guarantee the availability of any of these excursions at any point. Important note: flight schedules in Argentina change constantly. You may depart in the very early hours for your internal flight, and if so, breakfast will be taken in-flight rather than at the hotel. Alternatively, you may have a longer morning in Buenos Aires and depart in the late afternoon. Due to the changing nature of the flights, boat excursions may take place either on today's free afternoon, or on tomorrow's free afternoon on Day 4 of the trip."

Separated from Patagonia by the waters of the Magellan Strait, Tierra del Fuego is a landscape of lakes, forest, and tundra, set beneath an imposing backdrop of rugged mountain peaks. After driving 10 kilometres from Ushuaia to the park entrance, we'll drive through the park and take walks in several different sectors, along forest trails and to Lapataia Bay, taking in the expansive views and hopefully coming across some of the abundant wildlife in the area. Depending on the weather, we'll likely be undertaking three different walks, the longest being just under 2 kilometres / 1.25 miles. The undulating and well-trodden trails include some steps and light hilly terrain along the way. These peaks and valleys are filled with Lenga and Guindo trees which provide a rich haven for Patagonian grey foxes and condors. After lunch, we'll return to Ushuaia and have a free afternoon to further explore the area. Across the three hikes, we'll be walking for around 4 kilometres / 2.5 miles, approximately 2 hours in total, with negligible ascent of 40m / 164 ft."

At first glance, the area might seem barren but as we wander on, the wide variety of flora and fauna that call it home come to light. It's not unusual to see large numbers of guanacos here, as well as black-necked swans, upland geese, and pink flamingos. We may even be fortunate enough to spot condors in this vast territory of the elusive puma. As well as an abundance of natural sights, there are also more than 20 ancient cliff paintings, which are approximately 6,000 years old, in a hidden spot along the trail. We'll continue by vehicle to the Cascada Paine, a waterfall backed by the jagged peaks of the Torres. From here, we'll continue to drive to the Blue Lagoon, where we can stroll around the beach to admire the towers from the same view that inspired Lady Florence Dixie to call them 'Cleopatra's needles' in her book Across Patagonia in 1880. The 8.5 km / 5.2 mile hike around Lake Sarmiento will take approximately 3.5hrs, with 230m / 755ft of ascent, and 290m / 950ft descent. For those who'd prefer something more challenging, you'll have the option of undertaking the 22-kilometre trek to the base of the Torres del Paine. The entire hike is full of breath-taking panoramas, as you cross glacial lakes, passing through river valleys and mountain forest, culminating in one of the most impressive lookouts in the park, over the spectacular Torres - imposing pinnacles of sharp granite that rise up over 2,600 metres to pierce the sky. The total ascent and descent of the hike is 950 metres, taking us from a starting altitude of 30 metres to the peak of 980 metres, over approximately ten hours. The terrain is hilly, with small and undulating slopes until the last kilometre, which is a steep push to the top. If you'd like to undertake this trek, your local guide will need to know by day two of the trip, in order to ensure that a guide is in place for you.

Fed by the vast expanse of the Southern Patagonian Ice Field, the glacier covers some 250 square kilometres and presents us with an impressive list of statistics. It stretches over 30 kilometres and at its deepest point is over 700 metres thick. It's advancing at a rate of 700 metres per year but is estimated to calve off great chunks at probably the same rate, meaning that it has remained almost stationary for nearly a century. Whilst here we'll take an included walk along some of the boardwalks in the National Park, which offer some excellent panoramic views of the glacier. If you'd like to get closer, there is the possibility to take an optional boat ride up to the glacier face, or there will be the chance to take the optional trek out on the ice (an age limit of 65 years applies due to National Park regulations). Please note, the ice trek is very popular, and for those interested we advise pre-booking your spot with us before you travel to avoid disappointment. It involves walking on the ice itself using crampons. No experience is necessary, and you'll have a little time to practice walking with crampons before stepping onto the glacier. The walk is fairly easy, at a steady pace, with just a few very slight inclines. The terrain can be uneven in places, with seracs and glacial pools, however, an expert guide will be on hand to help you navigate the route."

The mountain reaches 3405 metres and our aim is to reach the base at around 1200 metres). Its forests and slopes are home to a unique array of wildlife, including the elusive huemel (a small deer) and the majestic condor. The scale and grandeur of this setting, where the glaciers seem to hang suspended between the jagged peaks, make this walk a truly rewarding excursion. The hike is on a well-marked trail covering a variety of terrain, expect forest, river and mountain scenery and the paths that go with each. Our total ascent and descent will be approximately 950m / 3150ft, over a distance of 26 kilometres / 16.1 miles, and the round-trip will take us around nine hours. We've graded this walk as challenging due to the long distance covered.

Set amidst the lush landscapes of the Parque Nacional do Iguazú Reserve, the falls are one of nature's finest masterpieces. A cascade of 275 interconnecting falls hurtle over high cliffs into a curved amphitheatre making up the breathtaking sight that extends three kilometres across the Rio Iguazu. Viewed from the Brazilian side, the falls present themselves in all their majestic and powerful glory and the noise is tremendous, with huge clouds of soaking mist being churned up by the cascade. The park itself was declared a World Heritage Site in 1986 and its trails are a paradise for nature lovers. The surrounding spray-soaked forest provides a rich haven for flora and fauna, with over 2,000 plant species and over 400 different types of birds being recorded here, as well as countless mammals, insects, and reptiles. The canopy is alive with an array of brightly plumaged toucans, parrots, hummingbirds, and colourful butterflies, whilst the forest floor boasts jaguars, mountain lions, tapirs and capuchin monkeys. Please note, the days in Iguazu are designed as an extension to our Adventures in Patagonia tour, and some of your fellow group members may leave the tour today in Buenos Aires before you fly to Iguazu. Whilst the extension has been designed to complement the Patagonia trip, it's worth noting that there might not be other Explore customers travelling with you. Your transfers and excursions in Iguazu are not private and might be shared with others who are not booked through Explore. Our flights are normally in the morning, and therefore the plan for arrival is to visit the Brazilian side of the falls today. It's approximately a half day visit, usually stopping for lunch at the Brazilian side. If flight schedules change we may rearrange this visit to Day 16 before your flight back to Buenos Aires."

Each neighbourhood of Buenos Aires has its own distinct character, with grand Italianate architecture sitting alongside winding cobbled streets or tree-lined avenues. To get a feel for the heart of the city, we'll walk towards its founding point at the Plaza de Mayo, where the President's dusty-pink mansion is located. Every big event in Buenos Aires's history has been witnessed by the Plaza, from the continued protests of the 'Madres de la Plaza de Mayo', going back to Eva Peron's mass demonstrations in 1945. From here, we'll hop on a bus towards the vibrant neighbourhood of La Boca. Originally settled by Italian migrants, the area is famed for its bright houses, a ramshackle affair of corrugated iron, and the tango dancers who perform in the streets. We'll visit a local 'cafecito' during our tour, taking a traditional Porteno snack of coffee and pastries. We'll end our morning in bohemian San Telmo, with its small one-way streets, historic mansions and walls adorned with street art.

It's worth noting that our city tour will last around five hours and will involve several hours of walking to see the city's highlights. This afternoon, you're free to explore more at your own pace. You could stay and explore San Telmo, which is particularly interesting when the antique market takes over the cobbled streets. Or visit Recoleta Cemetery, the final resting place of Argentine luminaries, including Eva Peron. For book lovers, the Ateneo Grand Splendid, set in a converted theatre, is one of the most impressive bookstores in the world. This evening, we'll have an opportunity to enjoy something of Buenos Aires' nightlife, perhaps going to a tango show and soaking up the pulsating rhythms of the Latin dance."

Beyond this remote port lies the Beagle Channel and then the open waters of The Drake Passage, where the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans converge. This afternoon is free to explore the city as you choose. You may wish to stay on land, visiting the old prison of Ushuaia, now the Maritime Museum and an excellent portrait of the harsh realities of life on these unforgiving oceans. Alternatively, there are three different trips around the coast that allow you to get closer to the awesome nature in this part of the world: 1. Beagle Channel catamaran and penguin spotting. This five-hour excursion sees you taking a catamaran boat from Ushuaia through the Beagle Channel, cruising around Sea Lion Island, Bird Island, Les Eclaireurs Lighthouse and Martillo Island. During the trip, we'll try to spot sea lions, cormorants and other diverse wildlife. At Isla Martillo the catamaran approaches the beach to see the Magellanic Penguin colony. Please note that on this trip there are no landings, but it's a great overview of the incredible scenery in the Beagle Channel. 2. Harberton Estancia and Isla Martillo. This six-hour tour starts with a 90-minute drive to the Harberton Estancia, the oldest ranch in the Tierra del Fuego, dating back to the late 1800s. If the Estancia is open, you'll have the option of visiting the small museum inside for an additional fee, payable locally. The main reason for our trip here is to access the pier, which is the launching point for boats travelling to Isla Martillo - an island just 15 minutes offshore that's home to a large penguin colony. This excursion is run by the only company permitted to let visitors disembark and walk among the penguins. Magellanic penguins are the largest colony, but you may also see Gentoo penguins or King Emperor penguins. Taking an hour-long walk around the island with a guide, you'll discover these colonies before the 15-minute return boat ride and 90-minute drive back to Ushuaia. 3. Beagle Channel boat to Sea Lion Island and Bird Island. This last boat trip doesn't take you out to see the penguins, sailing just around the sea lion island and bird island. For those on a budget who may have seen penguins in other places, this is a great option to witness the area's wildlife and the bleak scenery of the Beagle Channel. All excursions here in Ushuaia should be pre-booked before departure, preferably a minimum of three months prior to your trip. We cannot guarantee the availability of any of these excursions at any point. Important note: flight schedules in Argentina change constantly. You may depart in the very early hours for your internal flight, and if so, breakfast will be taken in-flight rather than at the hotel. Alternatively, you may have a longer morning in Buenos Aires and depart in the late afternoon. Due to the changing nature of the flights, boat excursions may take place either on today's free afternoon, or on tomorrow's free afternoon on Day 4 of the trip."

It's advancing at a rate of 700 metres per year but is estimated to calve off great chunks at probably the same rate, meaning that it has remained almost stationary for nearly a century. Whilst here we'll take an included walk along some of the boardwalks in the National Park, which offer some excellent panoramic views of the glacier. If you'd like to get closer, there is the possibility to take an optional boat ride up to the glacier face, or there will be the chance to take the optional trek out on the ice (an age limit of 65 years applies due to National Park regulations). Please note, the ice trek is very popular, and for those interested we advise pre-booking your spot with us before you travel to avoid disappointment. It involves walking on the ice itself using crampons. No experience is necessary, and you'll have a little time to practice walking with crampons before stepping onto the glacier. The walk is fairly easy, at a steady pace, with just a few very slight inclines. The terrain can be uneven in places, with seracs and glacial pools, however, an expert guide will be on hand to help you navigate the route."

Today, we'll set out with a local guide, weather permitting, to cover the distance to the base of Mount Fitz Roy, whose unmistakable summit is almost permanently covered in cloud, a phenomenon that was believed to be smoke by the indigenous Tehuelche who named it Chalten (smoky mountain). The mountain reaches 3405 metres and our aim is to reach the base at around 1200 metres). Its forests and slopes are home to a unique array of wildlife, including the elusive huemel (a small deer) and the majestic condor. The scale and grandeur of this setting, where the glaciers seem to hang suspended between the jagged peaks, make this walk a truly rewarding excursion. The hike is on a well-marked trail covering a variety of terrain, expect forest, river and mountain scenery and the paths that go with each. Our total ascent and descent will be approximately 950m / 3150ft, over a distance of 26 kilometres / 16.1 miles, and the round-trip will take us around nine hours. We've graded this walk as challenging due to the long distance covered. There are other shorter walks available on self-guided trails if you prefer, or you might like to take the time instead to relax around the town of Chalten."

The Perito Moreno glacier is one of the only glaciers in the world that’s still advancing. Though it’s not the only glacier in the area is the one that made the city of El Calafate famous worldwide. For many years now, El Calafate has been considered capital of the glaciers. Located at the shore of Lago Argentino (the southernmost, largest Patagonian lake) it’s also home of the Spegazzini glacier, which forms the natural border between Argentina and Chile, and the Upsala glacier, named “Glaciar del Gigante” (Giant’s glacier) upon its discovery and the biggest glacier that sits at the mouth of Lake Argentino. So is El Calafate all about the glaciers? Well, yes and no…glaciers are main attractions that you can visit via hiking or a boat ride. But you have lot more to discover about Argentine rural culture. From Calafate you can also visit a typical Patagonian “finca” (ranch) and learn all about the gaucho culture and enjoy a great “asado” (barbecue).

    "generalInfo": "This tailor made Argentina tour gives you a handle on the country’s best bits, from glaciers to soaring mountains to buzzing cities. Your adventure starts in Argentine capital Buenos Aires, where there’ll be time for a tour of the city’s political and historic heart, as well as an evening watching a Tango show and sampling traditional Argentine cuisine. You’ll get further big city action as you continue your trip, passing through the dynamic capital of Argentina’s wine lands, Mendoza, as well as paying a visit to Ushuaia, the continent’s adventure capital, which sits right at the country’s southern tip.<br/><br/>Of course, there’s plenty of natural beauty on offer, too. You’ll visit both the Argentinean and Brazilian sides of thundering Iguazu Falls; take a boat trip around the dramatic Perito Moreno Glacier, trek the wild landscapes of Tierra del Fuego National Park and cruise the Beagle Channel in search of marine wildlife including cormorants and fur seals. <br/><br/>Since this is a tailor made tour you’re welcome to adjust your itinerary as you see fit – perhaps adding extra days or destinations, or even adjusting your budget if you want to stay at cheaper or more expensive hotels. For example, you could choose to spend more time at Mendoza’s wineries or go horse riding at a ranch just outside Buenos Aires – it’s all up to you!<br/>",

In the heart of Patagonia, next to the Andes, is one of Argentina’s most scenic areas, commonly referred to as Lago Argentino and the Perito Moreno Glacier, declared “Universal Heritage” by the UNESCO. The most renown of all the glaciers is the Perito Moreno Glacier. Situated 80 km (50 miles) from El Calafate, it is the most easily reached among them. This is an imposing ice river that descends from the Southern Patagonian Ice Cap down to the lake, at ‘Canal de los Témpanos’ (Icebergs’ Channel). It is the only glacier in the area which is considered to be in equilibrium, that is: not receding. It has always been the most important attraction of the region thanks to its spectacular beauty, but especially because of its unusual behavior. The glacier slowly advances down the mountain slope towards the lake, producing, as it spills down, thunderous noises and ruptures. Recommend visiting Laguna Nimez reserve, a short walk from the town center. This ecological environment lodges an educational circuit with trails and signposts laid up along over 2,500 meters. The guides await visitors at the entrance gate to assist them with the interpretation of the natural environment. Likewise, a complete herbarium that helps visitors identify the local plants is located in the entrance area. The reserve has good vantage points that enable visitors to watch how the flamingoes, geese, silvery grebes, black-necked swans, ibis, lapwings, ducks, coots, hawks and chimangos, among other 70 species, fed in the clump of rushes."

Later, our journey will continue into the Natural Reserve Campo de Piedra Pómez, a strange and stunning landscape carved into the rock that gives rise to its name: The Pumice. Of purely igneous origin, it was produced from a massive volcanic explosion so powerful that if one could have seen it, it would be similar to the mushroom cloud produced by a nuclear bomb. This cloud has spread the ash and debris in large areas and in different directions, which crystallized by the effects of the temperature giving shape to these wonderful rocks with special features and with plenty of holes produced by the escape of gases during the cooling stage. This degassing phenomenon made the rock very easy to carve by the arid harsh winds of the Puna. Return to the Hotel, just on time to enjoy stunning sunset views from the village.

    "generalInfo": "On this 12 day Argentina and Brazil holiday, you’ll get to experience a less touristy region of Argentina – the north. While its charms may not be as well known as those of southern Argentina, it’s a region that excites everyone who visits, with its remote wetlands, tropical farms, vineyards and, of course, the magnificent Iguazu Falls. <br/><br/>It’s not all about the natural world, however, and you’ll have time to experience two of South America’s most iconic and dynamic cities. First off, there’s Buenos Aires, where you’ll tour the cobbled streets and elegant buildings of the city’s historical and political centre. You’ll also take in a Tango show and sample some of the local food and wine. Rio de Janeiro is the other heavy hitter on your list, and as well as a half day city tour taking in Sugar Loaf Mountain and Copacabana Beach, you’ll get to escape to the jungle on a trip to Tijuca Atlantic Forest, which has incredible views out over the cityscape. <br/>",

In many parts of this tour, engines are silenced and with the help of the pole the boat is drifted along the smaller streams and aquatic vegetation.

This pretty little town is a religious sanctuary (it gave Rio’s famous beach its name), and its whitewashed buildings and Moorish-style basilica are striking against a clear blue Andean sky. The Basilica is frequented by pilgrims to the miraculous 16th-century Dark Virgin of the Lake, and they bring their rickety cars to the forecourt, bedecked in flowers, to be blessed by her. If you have the energy in this rarefied air, climb the stations of the cross for views out over the lake and the snow-capped cordillera in the distance. From Copacabana there’s an optional boat trip to Isla del Sol. Legend has it that this mystical spot marked the beginning of Inca civilisation. The children of the sun god sprung from the lake’s depths to found the mighty empire in Cusco, and a rock at the northern end of the island was their birthplace.

In the heart of Patagonia, next to the Andes, is one of Argentina’s most scenic areas, commonly referred to as Lago Argentino and the Perito Moreno Glacier, declared “Universal Heritage” by the UNESCO. The most renown of all the glaciers is the Perito Moreno Glacier. Situated 80 km (50 miles) from El Calafate, it is the most easily reached among them. This is an imposing ice river that descends from the Southern Patagonian Ice Cap down to the lake, at ‘Canal de los Témpanos’ (Icebergs’ Channel). It is the only glacier in the area which is considered to be in equilibrium, that is: not receding. It has always been the most important attraction of the region thanks to its spectacular beauty, but especially because of its unusual behavior. The glacier slowly advances down the mountain slope towards the lake, producing, as it spills down, thunderous noises and ruptures. Recommend visiting Laguna Nimez reserve, a short walk from the town center. This ecological environment lodges an educational circuit with trails and signposts laid up along over 2,500 meters. The guides await visitors at the entrance gate to assist them with the interpretation of the natural environment. Likewise, a complete herbarium that helps visitors identify the local plants is located in the entrance area. The reserve has good vantage points that enable visitors to watch how the flamingo's, geese, silvery grebes, black-necked swans, ibis, lapwings, ducks, coots, hawks and chimangos, among other 70 species, fed in the clump of rushes."

After admiring Caleta Valdes you'll continue along the road as it drops suddenly down into a crescent of golden cliffs overlooking a bright blue bay and the small village of Puerto Piramides. Here herds of southern right whales tend to arrive in June. You can take a boat trip around the Golfo Nuevo bay and watch these immense creatures gliding past. The peninsula navigation allows you to get unusually close to the whales. You will even get wet if they jump! While the whales may be seen from late June to mid-December, the sea elephants and sea lions are permanent residents. Following your tour, you will return to your hotel in Puerto Madryn."

        "description": "Penguins in Punta Tombo tour. Drive to Punta Tombo which is located on the Atlantic Ocean coast, 150 km from Puerto Madryn. During the warm months (September to April) Punta Tombo reserve is home to the world's largest colony of Magellanic penguins. Spending much of their lives in the water, these penguins return yearly to the Patagonian coast to court, breed, and raise their young. Approximately half of the colonies of penguins that nest at Punta Tombo burrow underground. Males arrive prior to the females, preparing and settling into their old nests. When the females arrive, they search out their lifelong mate through a series of calls and a chorus of answers. After an elaborate courtship, the female will lay one egg and both male and female will share the two-month incubation. Once the baby penguin, or chick, hatches, the parents will forage for food, feeding the chick by regurgitation until it can fend for itself. After the chicks learn to swim, the family will return to the ocean and migrate north to southern Brazil. Some Magellanic penguins may migrate 3000 miles round-trip between Brazil and Patagonia. When the immature penguins return to Punta Tombo the following year, they will molt their feathers, and breeding will once again resume. Besides penguins it is also possible to see many other kinds of birds in the area. Driving back to Puerto Madryn, the tour stops at Gaiman, one of the oldest Welsh colonies in the area, where it is possible to taste an excellent tea with homemade cakes."

In the heart of Patagonia, next to the Andes, is one of Argentina’s most scenic areas, commonly referred to as Lago Argentino and the Perito Moreno Glacier, declared “Universal Heritage” by the UNESCO. The most renown of all the glaciers is the Perito Moreno Glacier. Situated 80 km (50 miles) from El Calafate, it is the most easily reached among them. This is an imposing ice river that descends from the Southern Patagonian Ice Cap down to the lake, at ‘Canal de los Témpanos’ (Icebergs’ Channel). It is the only glacier in the area which is considered to be in equilibrium, that is: not receding. It has always been the most important attraction of the region thanks to its spectacular beauty, but especially because of its unusual behavior. The glacier slowly advances down the mountain slope towards the lake, producing, as it spills down, thunderous noises and ruptures. Recommend visiting Laguna Nimez reserve, a short walk from the town center. This ecological environment lodges an educational circuit with trails and signposts laid up along over 2,500 meters. The guides await visitors at the entrance gate to assist them with the interpretation of the natural environment. Likewise, a complete herbarium that helps visitors identify the local plants is located in the entrance area. The reserve has good vantage points that enable visitors to watch how the flamingoes, geese, silvery grebes, black-necked swans, ibis, lapwings, ducks, coots, hawks and chimangos, among other 70 species, fed in the clump of rushes."

    "generalInfo": "Northern Argentina offers fascinating sights to the visitor, with its varied and distinct native cultures set in their beautiful natural surroundings of Andean volcanoes, deserts, multi colored rock formations and green oases. We bring you in touch with its people, to learn their music, understand the regional variations, to fully enjoy the flavors of its Andean cuisine, discover incredible wineries hidden in the middle of imposing mountains. Northern Argentina is a hidden gem to be explored and experienced.<br/><br/>Here you find the soul of indigenous cultures mixed with Spanish influences. One of the highlights of Argentina is to travel through the Andes chain from Salta into the Atacama desert and saltflats of Uyunyi, it has immense nature of volcanoes combined with Andean cuisine, wine tasting, boutique spa’s, for those who love adventure and luxury travel. We offer selfdrive itineries &amp; guided trips for groups through Argentina and like to show you the possibility, for those who have the budget, to travel with a private guide - driver. This can be for a special holiday, for a gourmet – culinary tour exploring the Nova Andina cuisine and wines, for a wellness holiday in the Andes, scouting for shooting locations, real estate, for making a film documentary. We form part of a professional audiovisual team and can help you further with all audiovisual equipment and take care of all logistics for a photo or film shooting in case this might have your interest as well. A traditional made yerba mate and a master class how to prepare your gourd with fire, charcoal and sugar will be part of the journey. Time for Vision Quest and Healing Arts can be incorporated. The trip can be fully tailor made according on your travel wishes. We offer Vip premium service.<br/><br/>In this itinery we show you an example of how to combine Salta as a starting and ending point together with the Valley of Calchaquies and a visit to San Pedro de Atacama in the driest mountain desert of the world in Chile. <br/><br/>After Salta we drive to Cafayate and Cachi in the Valley of Calchaquies with Indian villages, famous wine houses, abandoned haciendas, snow capped volcanoes, plains with giant cactuses &amp; amazingly polychrome rock formations. From Cachi we return to Salta, continue to Purmamarca from where you can decide to cross the Andes to San Pedro de Atacama via the Lema pass. You return via another pass and the Toro canyon to Salta again. These are 2 circular itineries joined in an eight shaped loop with the great advantage that we pick and drop off our car at Salta. You can also start and pick up your car at Catamarca or La Rioja and travel from there over the famous N40 to Cafayate, Cachi and Salta and drop off the car finally at Salta, but the drop off costs are very high due to the large distances that are covered in Argentina, so this is not the best option.<br/><br/>The itinerary from Cafayate to Cachi goes mainly over dirt roads and can be accomplished without problems with a normal car in the dry season from April to December. In the wet season part of these roads are flooded by rivers and only accessible with a 4x4 pickup. The rest of the roads mentioned have access all year round for a normal car. Accessibility of the roads in the high Andes always need to be checked with local police stations during the rain season. These itineries can also be booked as selfdrive programs by us. For selfdrive programs it requires good Spanish language skills, experience with orientation using maps &amp; GPS, and not to forget thorough driving experience.<br/><br/>Treks on horseback or on foot of 3-10 days, guided by authentic Gauchos can be added to your program, see the reviews for horseback trekkings in NW Argentina on this site. You travel through fascinating valleys &amp; mountains with pre-Inca &amp; Incaica sites, with remote haciendas, puma’s and condors, amazing pre-Inca petroglyps, you cross through an area where you can come only on foot or by horse, the postman and priest still travel that way.<br/><br/>We also offer guided private roundtrips at Mendoza &amp; San Rafael, including gourmet cuisine, wine and olive tasting, boutique wineresorts, Aconcagua park, day and night visit to the observatory Leoncito, staying at boutique pousada La Querencia, Barreal (San Juan province), visit Caverna de Las Brujas, Laguna de Llancanelo and volcano national park la Payunia, visit to the observatory Pierre Auger at Malargue, Pozo de las Animas, Las Llenas - one of the best ski centers of Latin America and boutique spa Therma Cacheuta near Mendoza.  More options are to cross the Andes and travel from Mendoza (or from San Juan as starting point to Valle Elqui - Selena in Chile) to Valparaiso at the Pacific Ocean or Santiago de Chile with your private guide-driver in 4-5 days.<br/><br/>Traveling with your own driver is one, traveling with a guide that has traveled and guided all over Latin America is another story tale. Your guide has a University degree, speaks fluent both English &amp; Spanish, is a certified mountain leader, has guided more than 120 trips and is well trained in driving on difficult terrain also with 4x4 vehicles. The combination of thinking out of the box and the radiation of a guide with a mission can make this trip a real unforgettable experience. A guided trip can be one on one, it can be for a couple, family with kids or for a whole group. It can be a top luxury travel, we can also stay at guesthouses, that all depends on your travel wishes, we can even now and then camp if that would interest you. By making an enquiry through this page you get directly in contact with your guide. Feel free to Skype us or invite us for a call on a time that suits you. We have free calls to 60 countries worldwide among which free calls to the UK, USA, Canada, Australia and China.<br/><br/>Countries that we cover to guide at this moment are Argentina with the mid to northern range of the Andes, north Chile with the Atacama desert, Bolivia Altiplano &amp; rainforest, Colombia from Caribbean, Pacific to the Andes, Cuba from West to East, Brasil from Rio de Janeiro, Pantanal, Amazon, Chapada de Diamantina to the Atlantic rainforest and beaches, the mystic South of Peru with Colca canyon, Cusco, Titicaca &amp; Machu Picchu.<br/><br/>Buenos Aires tours are all tailor made according to your wishes, half day, full day or several days.

We also offer Gastronomy Culinary tours, Architecture tours mixed with Urban art or only focused on one aspect. Kayaking tours with walking in the Tigre delta and learning about life and ecosystems. Birdwatching tours. Besides all common City tours.<br/><br/>Some local festivals on the proposed itineries: a very enchanting festival of NW Argentina is the carnaval at Huamahuaca and San Pedro de Jujuy in February; at San Pedro de Atacama they celebrate Festival de San Pedro y San Pablo the last days of June, a blend of lively folk dancing, a thrilling rodeo, and processions that combine their Atacameño heritage into hispanic Catholic traditions, and the most important festival at Mendoza is the National Grape Harvest Festival (Vendimia) in the last days of February and first days of March.<br/><br/>We have more than 250 independent reviews on Responsible Travel on our destinations in Latin America from Cuba, Bolivia, Brasil, Peru, Colombia to Chile and Argentina.

    "tourName": "Argentina whale watching tour",
    "placesVisited": "",
    "generalInfo": "Not always regarded by wildlife watchers but wrongly so, Argentina is home to a vast array of wildlife and some of the most stunning scenery in the world. This trip centres around one particular location in Argentina (Peninsula Valdes) the the amazing behaviour of a small population of orcas. Which was immortalised by the BBC during the 1993 series The Trails of Life where they filmed the orca beaching themselves in order to catch the southern sea lion pups in the surf. It is just unbelievable sight which we aim to see here. <br/><br/>But in addition to the orcas we will spend some time at the largest colony of Megallanic penguins in the world, enjoy a dolphin watching cruise, some world class birding and excellent mammal watching inland. All in all this tour is an excellent way to get the best of the Patagonian wildlife whilst sampling the best that Argentina culture and hospitality has to offer.<br/><br/>See one of the world's most spectacular natural events. Come to Patagonia in time to see the resident Orca hunting seal pups by torpedoing onto the beaches before thrashing their way back off with their prey in caught.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner). There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles for all transfers. We include a professional zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) to escort you on all your excursions and also a very knowledgeable English speaking local guide. Your zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) escort is an expert in cetacean (whale and dolphin) biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. For example the subtle learning techniques that the orcas use to teach the younger whales the hunt and individual differences in each orca so you begin to get to know individuals. One of the joys of having a zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) escort is that you will not miss any sightings. We also use excellent local whale watching naturalists, with years of experience in observing the orcas as well as other whales and dolphins of the area. Also included are all boat trips, wildlife viewing and park fees are included. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on blue whales which are available to watch throughout the tour.<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>The exact season varies a little but from late February to early April is usually the entire season for this tour. During a 5-6 week period from late February to early April the transient pod of orcas start to hunt the southern sea lion and southern elephant seal pups as they take the water for the first time. The exact time of this unique behaviour varies and is dependant on fish stocks which speed up or slow down the seal development and therefore when they take to the surf for the first time. Over the last couple of decades the vast majority of attacks have been recorded in March and this is when the hunting usually reaches a peak.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>•\tWe offer the chance to observe the amazing hunting behaviour of the orcas around Peninsula Valdes. <br/>•\tWe can arrange use of a boat to go out to where the orcas patrol, this is an exciting and new way of observing the hunting orcas before and during their unique hunting.<br/>•\tIf requested we can bring equipment such as a hydrophone (to hear the orcas under the water) and also an underwater camera which will attempt to film the whales and dolphins underneath the waves. <br/>•\tThis tour is like none other being offered by a UK based operator, you will not only get access to the best locations to watch the hunting orcas but we can also arrange further wildlife watching throughout Patagonia as well as taking in some of the most spectacular landscapes in the world. <br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>•\tWe have an unrivalled network of experts and guides all over Argentina that are able to find and observe animals like Commerson’s dolphins, southern fur seals, Magenellic penguins, culpeo foxes, giant anteaters, greater rheas, pumas, fairy armadillos, southern elephant seals, coypus, jaguarundis and hundreds other endangered, rare or endemic species throughout this wilderness land. Whether it is Los Glaciares, Tierra del Fuego, Chaco, Iguazu, Campo de los Alisos, El Palmar and many other wildlife watching locations you want to visit we can arrange it. Please inform us if you wish to add a Argentina extensions to this orca watching itinerary below and we can provide an excellent wildlife watching itinerary and quote for you.<br/>•\tUnlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>The only place in the world where this orca hunting style exists in the world is off one or two beaches along the Peninsula Valdes in Patagonia, Argentina. Making Punta Norte just about the most exciting whale watching destination in the world. <br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>There is no real fitness level required for our orca watching holidays to Patagonia, you decide on the amount of walking involved in the tour.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; but as a rule of thumb we recommend that you bring your own binoculars or spotting scope as well as suitable clothing which would be a mix of cool, light clothing as well as warm winter clothes as the weather can be unpredictable and long hours on exposed beaches can get windy. Water proofs and a wind-breaker are also recommended. Comfortable walking shoes are a must, just in case you decide to head out for a hike in search of armadillos or guanacos. A sunhat and sun cream are also recommended. Of course plenty of film or memory cards for your camera as well as any other items of a personal nature which you will require whilst away.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 12 Years old.<br/><br/>Photo Credits:<br/>Ecohotel<br/>Maarten Visser from Capelle aan den IJssel, Nederland<br/>Winky from Vancouver, Canada",

As there are many flights arriving in the morning to Santiago, our Tour Leader plans to meet us in the hotel reception at 2pm for a welcome briefing, and to take us on an orientation tour of the capital. We'll head into the heart of the city, making our way to the Plaza de Armas, the civic heart of the city since 1541. Standing here, we'll get the impressive panoramas of the majestic cathedral, as well as City Hall and the National History Museum. Busy pedestrian areas flank the Plaza de Armas, and unleash residents and families into the palm-tree-lined square on weekends. We'll continue to the imposing Government Palace, through picturesque, cobble-stoned streets and traditional neighbourhoods, and also take a cable car trip up San Cristobal Hill from some panoramic city views, before returning to our hotel. If you'd like to receive an airport transfer today, you'll need to arrive into Santiago International Airport (airport code: SCL), which is approximately a 45-minute drive from our hotel. Please note that if you wish to join the city tour today, you should arrive at the hotel by 2pm. We recommend giving yourself at least one hour to clear the airport, and a 45-minute drive to our hotel - so the latest your flight should arrive is 12pm. Don't worry if you miss the welcome meeting or the city tour, your Leader will inform you of any essential information this evening or tomorrow morning."

Valparaiso's UNESCO-listed old town is a meandering maze of multi-coloured, hilltop houses, dotted with street art and murals that have almost created a type of open-air art museum. We'll explore the Cerro Alegre neighbourhood, a slightly bohemian area of colourful 19th-century mansion houses, built predominantly for a burgeoning English immigrant population. Now covered with murals and colourful stairwells, we'll get some great views from the city and have the chance to see in action some of the famous 'ascensores' (funiculars) that bring people up and down from the mountain-top. While in the city, we'll also explore the iconic Plaza Sotomayor and the seaport that made Valparaiso a hub of one-time international importance. From Valparaiso, we'll drive to the charming coastal city of Vina del Mar. After seeing a couple of key sights, we'll have some free time here for lunch at the coast, taking a paddle in the Pacific before making our way back to Santiago for the evening."

Over the next two days we have the chance to explore the cultural and natural diversity of this region. Our first day sees us travelling out to the gigantic Salar de Atacama to walk on the salt flats, undoubtedly one of the most dramatic natural features in the country. The barren valley of salt has been almost moulded by wind into crystalline forms on its crust - some hexagonal and others almost coral-like, or like shards of ice. We'll take a walk at the trails of the high altitude (2,300m / 7,545ft) Laguna Chaxa, where flamingos drink from the coloured lagoon, a flash of bright pink against the otherwise barren landscape. There are several high altitude lagoons here at the salt flat, all home to a variety of native bird species, of which the three types of Chilean flamingo are the most famous. As well as walking in this strange setting, we visit the small village of Tocanao, known for its buildings made of the volcanic stone liparite. We visit the church and historic bell tower, as well as the booths of craftspeople who sell their wares in the small village square. We'll make our way back to the hotel in the early afternoon, and have the rest of the day free in charming San Pedro. You have the option to visit the Cejar Lagoon in this free time - here, you can swim in the bright blue hues of these salty waters, and the desert surrounds make for quite an unusual swimming spot."

We'll return to the hotel around midday, and after our early start we'll take the rest of the day to relax.

The area is dominated by the classic volcanic cone of Osorno, an almost picture-perfect representation of a snowy volcanic peak. Our walk takes us through the lush landscapes of the Valdivian rainforest, the slopes of the mountain sprinkled with Andean birch, providing a haven for chingue (Patagonian skunk), culpeo (Patagonian fox), weasels and puma, whilst the bird populations boast hummingbirds, woodpeckers and kestrel.

This area of the Lake District received large numbers of German immigrants in the mid-1800s, and the Gothic architecture of mansion houses such as Casa Kuschel (now the office of a conservation foundation) represents the typical style of the area. Museo Pablo Fierro is another curiosity - worth a visit if you're a fan of a strange and quirky museum! Or alternatively, you might wish to take a walk along the banks of Lake Llanquihue.

We'll continue our sail to Isla Marta, home to a colony of sea lions, as well as birdlife including the imperial cormorant and southern gull. While sailing back to the mainland, there is the possibility (for the lucky!) to spot Patagonian dolphins or sei whales along the strait. In the afternoon, we drive into Torres del Paine, one of the world's most impressive national parks, situated amidst a region of ice-capped peaks, silent blue glacial lakes and wild hills. One of the highlights of our time here will be the views of the Torres, imposing pinnacles of sharp granite that are surrounded by glacial lakes and craggy ranges, formed millions of years ago.

The trail here gently undulates between the two eastern gates of the park, crossing the Patagonian Steppe. In the afternoon, we walk to the magnificent icebergs of the glacier-fed Lago Grey, an easy 6km/4 mile hike of about 2 hours in length, along a flat, shoreline trail that's made slightly harder with its rocky terrain. The scenery is magnificent throughout. It's worth mentioning that our itinerary in Torres del Paine will be flexible, in case of the strong winds that sometimes whip through this wild landscape."

After the hike, you then board a larger vessel and continue the journey south for another one and a half hours arriving for a well-deserved barbecue lunch at a traditional estancia. If some travellers decide to take up this optional excursion, the group comes back together in Puerto Natales in the evening.

Previously, more than 400 seaweed harvesters and their families lived here. Bahia Bustamante was actively operating with a school, a church, a police station, a grocery store, a club, and everything a small \"pueblo\" and its inhabitants needed at the time. Staying at Bahia Bustamante Lodge also allows you to take a journey into the past and discover the life of pioneers in this isolated site in Patagonia.

The Argentine flag flies behind the old Bar, the oldest building and witness of times gone by. We emphasize that at Bahia Bustamante Lodge, we preserve the essence of the place and maintain a balance with nature. The houses of the early settlers have been renovated to accommodate guests, preserving their austerity and simplicity, keeping alive the spirit of those who arrived here more than 60 years ago. At Bahia Bustamante Lodge, luxury means access to the vastness of its pure and powerful nature, and the authentic identity of its history and inhabitants. The program includes a full board (excluding drinks) and activities within the extensive property. Electricity: The Lodge has electricity from sunset to midnight, thanks to a generator.

A triangular archipelago surrounded by the stormy South Atlantic and the Strait of Magellan, Tierra del Fuego offers plenty of natural beauty: scenic glaciers, lush forests, astounding mountains, clear waterways and a dramatic sea coast. The region’s largest city, Ushuaia, is also the ‘southernmost city in the world’ – a major draw for list-tickers – but has also become the main gateway to wondrous Antarctica. Tierra del Fuego is isolated and hard to reach, but for true adventure-seekers in Argentina it’s a must.

In the heart of Patagonia, next to the Andes, is one of Argentina’s most scenic areas, commonly referred to as Lago Argentino and the Perito Moreno Glacier, declared “Universal Heritage” by the UNESCO. The most renown of all the glaciers is the Perito Moreno Glacier. Situated 80 km (50 miles) from El Calafate, it is the most easily reached among them. This is an imposing ice river that descends from the Southern Patagonian Ice Cap down to the lake, at ‘Canal de los Témpanos’ (Icebergs’ Channel). It is the only glacier in the area which is considered to be in equilibrium, that is: not receding. It has always been the most important attraction of the region thanks to its spectacular beauty, but especially because of its unusual behavior. The glacier slowly advances down the mountain slope towards the lake, producing, as it spills down, thunderous noises and ruptures. Recommend visiting Laguna Nimez reserve, a short walk from the town center. This ecological environment lodges an educational circuit with trails and signposts laid up along over 2,500 meters. The guides await visitors at the entrance gate to assist them with the interpretation of the natural environment. Likewise, a complete herbarium that helps visitors identify the local plants is located in the entrance area. The reserve has good vantage points that enable visitors to watch how the flamingoes, geese, silvery grebes, black-necked swans, ibis, lapwings, ducks, coots, hawks and chimangos, among other 70 species, fed in the clump of rushes."

You’ll also see the famous Uyuni Salt Flats, and Laguna Hedionda, where colourful lagoons shelter beautiful flamingos. Next, you’ll head south from here into Chile to spend time in Valley of the Moon, an exceptional stargazing spot, and explore the vast expanse of the Atacama Desert.<br/><br/>The Bolivian Salt Flats are a highlight on this trip at any time of year. Whilst they are most famous for how they look in the December to March rainy season, when they become an amazing mirror (and an irresistible photo op), the rest of the year the dry salt flat forms create incredible patterns that stretch as far as the eye can see. <br/><br/>This is a full-on tour that includes some long driving distances, high altitudes and simple accommodation – though this well-planned trip helps you adjust to dramatic altitudes of 4,900m with plenty of acclimatisation and you’ll be accompanied at all times by a professional local Argentinian guide.

        "description": ": Our trip begins in Buenos Aires, Argentina's capital, located on the southern shores of the Rio de la Plata. Since its founding by Pedro de Mendoza in 1536, the city has thrived on trade and its vibrant streets are brimming with an eclectic mix of European architectural styles, with Spanish, French and Italian classicism rubbing shoulders with the remnants of Victorian grandeur. Our tour leader will meet us in reception at 6pm for a welcome meeting and, for those who wish, there is the chance to go out for dinner. There are no activities planned today, so you're free to arrive in Buenos Aires at any time. If you'd like an airport transfer, you'll need to arrive into either Aeroparque Internacional Jorge Newbery (AEP) or Ezeiza International Airport (EZE), a 30-minute or one-hour drive from our hotel respectively. If you miss the meeting, your tour leader will inform you of any essential information as soon as you catch up. On Day 2, we fly to Salta and it's possible that our flight might depart very early in the morning, so we highly recommend adding additional nights in Buenos Aires to your trip. Arty San Telmo, up-scale Palermo or colourful La Boca are just some of the neighbourhoods worth exploring."

This was as far south as the Inca civilisation came, and the city is more akin to Peru or Bolivia in its food, culture, and indigenous heritage. We'll tour the main sites, including a cable car ride up San Bernardo Hill where we'll soak in the panoramic views. Tonight, we'll get a taste of Salta's music scene at a 'pena', a traditional folk music hall where locals come with guitars and take turns to play and sing. Dinner is included; the menu will vary, but it may include locro (corn) soup, meats cooked local-style over the parrilla (grill), or tasty empanadas (delicate flaky pastry wrapped around slow-cooked meat or veggies). Please note that flight schedules in Argentina change regularly. We aim to fly in the morning (this may require leaving in the early hours) to Salta. If we need to fly in the afternoon, then we'll take a tour of some of the highlights of Buenos Aires in the morning, rather than our city tour of Salta."

The landscapes around Northern Argentina are vast and breathtaking, with rust-red geological formations carved out of massive gorges, and green pastures giving way to giant, craggy mountains. We'll travel down Ruta 68, through the 'Quebrada de las Conchas' (Shell Gorge), where water and wind have carved impressive shapes such as The Amphitheatre, the Devil's Throat and the Titanic out of the rock. Arriving into Cafayate for lunchtime, we'll plan a round of wine tasting in two of the region's rustic wineries, their rows of green vines backed by the spectacular mountains beyond. Argentina's main white wine, Torrontes, is famous in this region, so we'll no doubt try this as well as enjoying a traditional lunch at one of the vineyards. We'll make our way back to Salta in the late afternoon. Our total driving time for today will be approximately seven hours, with plenty of photo stops along the way."

On arrival, we'll head out on foot for a circular walk on the Paseo de los Colorados, which surrounds the hill itself. This easy dirt trail covers 3-4 kilometres/2 miles and is surrounded by an explosion of colour throughout. In the afternoon, we'll drive out to Salinas Grandes. At 4,150 metres/13,943 feet of altitude the road up, called the Cuesta de Lipan, is a series of meandering switch-backs - we'll watch the landscape change quickly as we climb higher. On arrival at the enormous salt flats, we'll see this vivid white expanse stretch out before us, with the ragged edges of salt pools providing a flash of colour.

The journey is awash with colour and scenic roadside lookouts; one appropriately named mountain is The 'Painters Palette'. While we explore today, we'll visit the region's old traditional villages, including Tilcara, Uquia and Humahuaca - allowing us to see how the villages' pre-Columbian heritage gives this area of northwest Argentina a distinct sense of cultural identity. This is not only manifested in the woven items that we'll have seen in Salta and Purmamarca but also in the local diet, with northern food including llama stews and corn dishes. We'll visit the ancient ruins of Pucara, which date back to the 12th century and were eventually settled by the Incas in the late 15th century, before the domination by the conquistadores. We'll also visit the church of San Francisco de Paula in Uquia; this small, dusty, cactus-strewn town is quite unassuming, but well known for the large and unique series of 17th-century paintings found in the church, depicting the 'Angeles Arcabuceros', or armed angels. We'll return to Purmamarca this evening; a round-trip drive time of approximately three hours."

On the town's deserted outskirts, we'll pass through the train graveyard; a collection of early 20th-century train carriages rusted by the salt and left for dead after a major transportation project failed. The iron carcasses are a ghostly but photogenic sight. After checking into our hotel, we should have a little free time before heading out in the evening for our first glimpse of the Salar de Uyuni. The full expanse of the flats will be appreciated in the daylight tomorrow, but tonight we'll hopefully have a clear sky to gaze up at the stars, together with a hot drink.

Heading into this natural wonder, the sky seems to almost disappear into the land through the reflections of the blinding-white plains. Flamingos inhabit the shoreline of the small lagoons, whilst the snow-capped peak of Volcan Tunupa (5,400 metres/17,716 feet) looms far in the distance. Crossing the salt flats in our 4WD vehicles, we'll head for Incahuasi Island, where we'll find an expanse of huge cacti occupying an isolated island in the heart of the flats. The cacti have been here for millennia, and the tallest towers 9 metres/30 feet above the floor of the plains, no mean feat given that it is estimated that they only grow one centimetre a year! We'll also have the chance to climb the 'Staircase to Heaven' artwork, installed on the flats by Bolivian artist Gaston Ugalde. We'll spend most of the day crossing the flats in our 4WD and making several stops to explore and enjoy the dreamlike landscapes. Our accommodation is in a very remote location at the Laguna Hedionda, at around 4,250 metres altitude (13,940ft), where the famous flamingos roam. This evening's simple hotel has limited hot water and electricity and will be cold in the evening - warm sleepwear is highly recommended. Despite its simplicity, which is all part of the adventure when travelling in Bolivia, the location alone is worth the trip - you can walk out of the front door to spectacular views of the mountain and the lagoon."

We'll make a stop at the 'Sol de Manana' geysers, the highest point of our tour at 4,900m (16, 076ft) altitude, where the hot steam and bubbling mud pots provide a strange contrast to the serene salt flats. We'll also visit the blood-red Laguna Colorada and the emerald-green Laguna Verde on the way to the Chilean border. Three of the world's six flamingo species can be found here; the Chilean, Andean and James flamingos - with the latter being incredibly rare, and thought to be extinct until the 1950s.

In the heart of Patagonia, next to the Andes, is one of Argentina’s most scenic areas, commonly referred to as Lago Argentino and the Perito Moreno Glacier, declared “Universal Heritage” by the UNESCO. The most renown of all the glaciers is the Perito Moreno Glacier. Situated 80 km (50 miles) from El Calafate, it is the most easily reached among them. This is an imposing ice river that descends from the Southern Patagonian Ice Cap down to the lake, at ‘Canal de los Témpanos’ (Icebergs’ Channel). It is the only glacier in the area which is considered to be in equilibrium, that is: not receding. It has always been the most important attraction of the region thanks to its spectacular beauty, but especially because of its unusual behavior. The glacier slowly advances down the mountain slope towards the lake, producing, as it spills down, thunderous noises and ruptures. Recommend visiting Laguna Nimez reserve, a short walk from the town center. This ecological environment lodges an educational circuit with trails and signposts laid up along over 2,500 meters. The guides await visitors at the entrance gate to assist them with the interpretation of the natural environment. Likewise, a complete herbarium that helps visitors identify the local plants is located in the entrance area. The reserve has good vantage points that enable visitors to watch how the flamingoes, geese, silvery grebes, black-necked swans, ibis, lapwings, ducks, coots, hawks and chimangos, among other 70 species, fed in the clump of rushes."

Half of the park is occupied by the Patagonian ice field, the second largest ice field after Antarctica. Upon arrival to the National Park, your guide will show you the different walkways from where you will be able to walk in front of the colossal ice wall, and, if you are lucky, perhaps see some landslides. When the ice breaks and falls, the world holds its breath: all other sounds stop at the earth's surface. You will start the adventure from the main balcony and then, have some free time to wander freely until the meeting time agreed with your guide. For lunchtime, the National Park offers a service area with a restaurant and a snack bar (lunch is not included).

And to travel deeper and have a firm grip of the Argentine spirit, find the perfect leather jacket or handbag (Buenos Aires is home to some excellent local designers), enjoy a typical dinner-tango show in the worldwide known home of the tango, and explore the colorful San Telmo and Recoleta neighborhoods."

This would be followed by the plaza San Martin and the Plaza de Mayo. This plaza has a rich history and the mothers of the plaza de Mayo still march their every Thursday holding the pictures of their disappeared youngsters and wearing their iconic headscarves. This is also the sight of the Casa Rosada where Evita made her famous balcony speech. From there we would move on to take in San Telmo and la Boca with the famous Caminito.

We explain the social etiquette, the unwritten code of the milonga called ¨codigo.¨ Apart from the physical dance itself, with its close embrace and intertwining limbs, the tango dancers participate in a complicated social dance as they navigate in the environment of the milonga. The culture, the lyrics, and the idiosyncrasies of the milongueros...all this adds to the stew which we wish to share with you. Milongas feature live tango music as well, and we make sure to include this in your tour. To hear the bandoneon live and watch tango being danced for enjoyment in its purest form is the best way we can think of to introduce you to the real Buenos Aires."

These huge figures and shapes, carved into the desert floor are best viewed from the air, with various optional flights available - South America travel is not complete until you have seen these unbelievable ancient mysteries. Still heading south we visit Chauchilla Cemetery with its well-preserved mummies, on our way to Puerto Inca, at this ancient Inca harbour we camp at the beach and enjoy our last night at sea level before beginning our climb back into the towering Andes. The next two nights are spent in Arequipa at 2325m, giving us time to acclimatise, and enjoy this beautiful colonial city with its impressive El Misti Volcano in the background. Arequipa is also the gateway to one of the deepest canyons in the world. Twice as deep as the Grand Canyon, Colca Canyon is an awesome sight. Here, if you get up early, Condors can be seen circling lazily on the thermals rising from the canyon floor. A couple of day’s driving and an overnight bush camp then bring us to Cusco."

        "description": "CUSCO, INCA TRAIL AND MACHU PICCHU Widely considered to be the most interesting city for South America travel, our next stop Cusco is surrounded by the Sacred Valley of the Incas and offers a wide range of activities to explore the region. We will base ourselves here for 6 days giving us enough time for the Inca Trail trip and to visit Machu Picchu, which is regarded by many to be the highlight of their South America tour. There are several treks which you can take to Machu Picchu. These are all available as Optional Add Ons which you can add to your booking. When permits are still available, we will organise the Classic Trail trek for those booking the trek option, but great alternative Inca Trail treks, like the Lares or Salkantay can be arranged when the Classic is not available or by your choice (must be pre-arranged at time of booking). These alternatives mean that you still get to visit Machu Picchu. If you do not want to trek, then you can remain in Cusco for a couple more free days, and then we offer an option to visit Machu Picchu by train instead. This must also be booked and paid for in advance. Tours to Machu Picchu are absolutely unbelievable; a trip to this City in the Clouds is an ancient and awe-inspiring part of our South America travel tour. Besides seeing Machu Picchu, you are able to enjoy the architectural uniqueness of Cusco and explore some of the colourful surrounding markets. Please note that for all those visiting Machu Picchu there is now the option to buy a ticket to go up the summit next to Machu Picchu, Huayna Picchu. Tickets for this must be requested at the time of your booking with us, and payment made in advance in the UK."

By boat we visit the floating islands during the day and then we go that one step beyond the average tourist and spend the night with one of the Indian families on the lesser known islands Isla Amantani or Taquile. Spending some time during South America travel in these local communities will provide a unique opportunity to learn more about the traditional lifestyle of the Andean people and their customs. From here it is a days drive to the capital of Bolivia - La Paz. This is a great place to visit a 'peña' club, dedicated to Andean folk music, and perhaps buy some souvenirs in one of the authentic markets such as the witches market. It’s also well worth while exploring the city using the network of cable cars stretching up the hillsides."

A couple of day’s driving and overnight bush camp bring us to one of Bolivia’s most beautiful cities, Sucre. Known as the ‘4 Names City’ because of its long and varied history, the city is at a lower altitude than La Paz and enjoys a warmer and greener climate. The Cretaceous Park is well worth a visit, as you can see and learn about the thousands of remarkable dinosaur footprints discovered here, including the largest ever found, from a Titanosaur weighing over 70 tonnes!. A short drive then brings us to Potosi. At over 4000m it is the highest city of its size in the world and 400 years ago it was the largest city in all the Americas. Vast amounts of silver were extracted from Potosi and shipped to Spain in years gone by. The adventurous may take the opportunity to go down one of these mines where mining techniques have remained unchanged for centuries, though read up on safety concerns first. Visiting the ancient mint or having a tour around the Casa Nacional de Moneda (National Money House) also provides a good look into Potosi's and Bolivia's past. Leaving the bleak Altiplano we arrive at the shimmering white Salt Flats of Uyuni. With no roads and only vague tracks to follow, taking an optional jeep trip out onto the salt flats and salt lakes makes for an unforgettable experience"

Winter in Patagonia - Please note that any trips which travel through this part of Patagonia between July and September will coincide with winter in Patagonia. This will give us the opportunity to see the Andes at their most impressive, driving past towering snow-capped peaks and experiencing this rugged wilderness at a time of year that not many other travellers get to see! We will hopefully have the chance to ski or snowboard in Bariloche and Ushuaia, ice-climb across glaciers in El Chalten, and hike in national parks at the most dramatic time of year. However, weather conditions can be unpredictable, and there is a chance that certain roads will not be passable, so we cannot guarantee following our planned itinerary to Tierra del Fuego; changes may have to be made with little or no notice.

        "description": "Transfer across the border to the town of El Calafate and to your hotel. In the heart of Patagonia, next to the Andes, is one of Argentina’s most scenic areas, commonly referred to as Lago Argentino and the Perito Moreno Glacier, declared “Universal Heritage” by the UNESCO. The most renown of all the glaciers is the Perito Moreno Glacier. Situated 80 km (50 miles) from El Calafate, it is the most easily reached among them. This is an imposing ice river that descends from the Southern Patagonian Ice Cap down to the lake, at ‘Canal de los Témpanos’ (Icebergs’ Channel). It is the only glacier in the area which is considered to be in equilibrium, that is: not receding. It has always been the most important attraction of the region thanks to its spectacular beauty, but especially because of its unusual behavior. The glacier slowly advances down the mountain slope towards the lake, producing, as it spills down, thunderous noises and ruptures. Recommend visiting Laguna Nimez reserve, a short walk from the town center. This ecological environment lodges an educational circuit with trails and signposts laid up along over 2,500 meters. The guides await visitors at the entrance gate to assist them with the interpretation of the natural environment. Likewise, a complete herbarium that helps visitors identify the local plants is located in the entrance area. The reserve has good vantage points that enable visitors to watch how the flamingoes, geese, silvery grebes, black-necked swans, ibis, lapwings, ducks, coots, hawks and chimangos, among other 70 species, fed in the clump of rushes."

Elsewhere the river flows decorously through the rainforest, breaking up into dozens of smaller falls. You might spot toucans with their outsized bright orange beaks perched in the foliage above the tumultuous waters. You have a guided tour to explore the Argentine side of the falls. From the National Park Visitor Centre, where there is a display that illustrates the biodiversity of the region’s tropical rainforest, a little natural-gas-powered train transfers you to Cataratas Station where the Upper Walk begins. This sequence of causeways and passarelles links dozens of tiny basalt islands at the top of a sheer rock face and the walkways cross the myriad streams of the River Iguazú as they cascade over the lip of the precipice. Your breath is quite literally taken away as the water thunders on to the rocks below. The train continues to Devil’s Throat Station where a 1km-long walkway leads across the river to the thunderous Garganta del Diablo, the Devil’s Throat.

You will then have a 10.2 km (approximately 5 hours, excluding stops) hike to reach the final destination. After a final ascent, you will be there! You'll be at an altitude of 1,170 meters. Mount Fitz Roy will emerge in front of you, and a turquoise blue lake will stretch at your feet. The trail is fully marked and well-maintained. Another option is to take the transportation to Hostería el Pilar. From there, you start towards Laguna de los Tres, taking a different trail than the return route. You will arrive at the viewpoint of Glacier Piedras Blancas, which starts from the Rio Blanco bridge and involves an 800-meter elevation gain. Continue your path towards the Poincenot campsite, towards Laguna de los Tres, and from there, begin your return to the accommodation passing by Laguna Capri. This way, you avoid 2 km and get to admire another trail. Important: The last kilometer to Laguna de los Tres is of difficult difficulty. It is a steep and rocky ascent that takes approximately 1 hour to complete. Total round trip: 20 km - Approximately 9 hours. Return to Refugio de Glaciares at a pre-established time.

The goal of this organization was to create a natural reserve of 74,130 acres. With the acquisition of Socorro and other areas within Iberá, CLT's objectives were simple and ambitious: to create the largest natural park in Argentina, restore species that had disappeared from the region, and promote an economy based on ecotourism. They launched the most extensive rewilding program in the Americas: giant anteaters, pampas deer, tapirs, and collared peccaries have been reintroduced. Rincón del Socorro is located within the Iberá National Park, where one can observe a variety of natural ecosystems: vast grasslands temporarily flooded known as marshlands, beautiful Caranday palm trees, red grasslands, savannas, thorny hills, and gallery forests. Lunch will be prepared with organic vegetables from the garden, and you will taste typical recipes from the province of Corrientes as well as Argentine and international dishes.

Upon arrival, the guide will explain the schedules and options for the next day. On foot, you will have the possibility of concentrating on looking for tracks detecting the presence of recently reintroduced animals. While walking there will be time to look for the best angle for a photo, to dwell on the details, and to know more about the species around. Over the past years in Rincon del Socorro, Reserve Giant Anteaters, Collared Peccaries, and Pampas Deers have been reintroduced with success. Alternatively, in outings on horse, you will have a different point of view that will allow for an enjoyment of the landscape heightened by the contact with the animal, which will easily sort through streams and pastures, and will also favor the sighting of different types of Deers, among other creatures. On a horse, one can reach the coast of the marshlands and ride along it. The boat trips are done in the area of Laguna Iberá (lagoon) and Colonia Carlos Pellegrini. The village has an interpretation center and very nice trails along the lagoon and through the native forest. The economy of this town was transformed in 1983 when the Provincial Park was created. Before then the inhabitants used to hunt for a living. Today Pellegrini is a proud town that learned how to conserve and care for its natural heritage and make it a way of living. The boat trips allow you to get close to Alligators, Capybaras, and hundreds of birds without scaring them. The tours take around 2 hours and are frequently done over the Iberá Lagoon and sometimes we can also kayak through the floating islands or embalsados. Horseback rides, walks, and boat trips might be combined with night safaris that make possible magnificent encounters with very active wildlife that take advantage of the cool nights to go hunting. If the sky is clear, night sky watching might also take place. This activity sometimes is also accompanied by a spectacular nature show: thousands of fireflies decorating the surroundings. It seems like they are trying to copy the Milky Way. Many of the roads can also be cycled on mountain bikes. Rincón del Socorro sets itself as an excellent location for bird watching, where the visitor has the possibility of observing native species like the Yellow Cardinal (Gubernatrix cristata), and the Strange-Tailed Tyrant (Alectrurus risora), among others. In total, the complete list of birds in the region reaches 350 species. Many of the activities can be accompanied by picnics, food always tastes better in nature. These stops present a good opportunity to recover energy and to observe every detail that nature has to offer. It is worthwhile also taking the time to visit Uguay, the nearest village, to learn about the culture of the inhabitants of the wetlands, its crafts and its way of life. There the visitant can try a “mate correntino” (local beverage) perhaps for the first time, accompanied by some “torta fritas” (a traditional fried bread) and great stories of the hosts. At the lodge, you will have the possibility of enjoying the different areas of the house by relaxing by the pool, being captivated by the books in the library, or participating in talks and videos that will allow the visitor to gain deeper knowledge in the projects carried out by Fundación Rewilding Argentina. The ample gardens are constantly visited by the local fauna and can be easily walked in order to reach a nearby small wetland where one can observe and appreciate the native animals. In addition, the vegetable garden provides another beautiful attraction through its sustainable growth and its production of vegetables that reach everyday meals. Being a guest in Rincón del Socorro is a way of being a part of the ambitious project that CLT has proposed and carried through with undeniable success."

A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on blue whales which are available to watch throughout the tour.<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>The exact season varies a little but from late February to early April is usually the entire season for this tour. During a 5-6 week period from late February to early April the transient pod of orcas start to hunt the southern sea lion and southern elephant seal pups as they take the water for the first time. The exact time of this unique behaviour varies and is dependant on fish stocks which speed up or slow down the seal development and therefore when they take to the surf for the first time. Over the last couple of decades the vast majority of attacks have been recorded in March and this is when the hunting usually reaches a peak.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/><br/>There are no other UK based tour operators that offer a tour specifically to view this unique and stunning hunting behaviour. Ever since the 1993 BBC Natural History series ‘The Trails of Life’ aired footage of magnificent orcas launching themselves onto the beaches of Patagonia in an attempt to catch the young seal and sea lion pups; this wildlife spectacle has become one of the top destinations on most whale watchers and wildlife photographers wish lists. However arranging all the necessary permits, paying the government and national park fees and just finding access to the correct hunting beach can be very hard to organise and understand. Which is why we decided to simplify things and offer the chance to see the only beaching orcas in the world hunting without any of the hassle of having to organise the permits yourself. In addition to this we have broken down the type of viewing available for this tour into three easy to understand and different options. The reason for this being that Patagonia in general and this tour particularly can be very expensive so depending on your budget we can tailor this tour for you. Below are the 3 different budget options for this tour.<br/><br/>1.\tThe cheapest option is to use public viewing area on the edge of Peninsula Valdes, this is where the vast majority of tourists coming to see the orcas base themselves and the distance to the hunting beaches is around 200-300m. We recommend this for people who are interested in other wildlife as well as the orcas, as we can spend more time searching for guanacos, armadillos, foxes, seals, dolphins and penguins around Peninsula Valdes. Also if you are interested in exploring more of Patagonia we recommend this option.<br/><br/>2.\tThe mid range option (which is included in the below itinerary) differs from option 1 in staying on the hunting beach itself. The beach where the seals and sea lions pup and the orcas hunt is the private property of a local estancia (ranch). This is a very small boutique ranch (6 rooms) and we have an arrangement with the owners. This is where the BBC (and all other documentary makers) based themselves to film the spectacle. The ranch owners and knowledgeable staff understand the behaviour of the orcas here better than anyone and will help you by setting up hides on the beach and even taking you out on boats to where the orcas launch their attacks, you will be in the best place for a beaching attack. <br/><br/>3.\tThe final option is only recommended for dedicated wildlife watchers and professional photographers. This is due to the heavy permit fees involved with gaining access to the ‘Attack Channel’. You will use the same estancia as described in option 2 but with special permission from the Argentine government you will be taken to less than 50m or so of the ‘Attack Channel’. The ‘Attack Channel’ is where the orcas usually perform all their hunting. It is the location where all of exceptional shots and footage of the hunting orcas are taken from. This is a real heart pounding experience and can only be done with the an overseer employed by the government and only a handful of permits are granted each year, but you will be standing only a few meters away from the surf zone and you will never forget the sight of a 10 ton orca rushing out of the waves in front of you to pluck a seal pup from the beach.<br/><br/>We ask anyone interested in this tour to please let us know what budget you have for this tour and if you have any specific ideas on which option you would like to book. We specialise in tailoring wildlife watching tours all over the world to suit all people’s requirements and budgets and are confident that whatever your budget for this tour we can arrange your ideal Patagonian wildlife experience.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>•\tWe offer three different options for this tour (detailed above), depending on your budget and particular interests.<br/>•\tYou have the chance to stay in the one and only estancia which owns the land where the orcas hunt and have exceptional access to the seal and sea lion colony for close up shots.<br/>•\tWe can arrange use of a boat to go out to where the orcas patrol, this is an exciting and new way of observing the hunting orcas before and during their unique hunting.<br/>•\tIf requested we can bring equipment such as a hydrophone (to hear the orcas under the water) and also an underwater camera which will attempt to film the whales and dolphins underneath the waves. <br/>•\tThis tour is like none other being offered by a UK based operator, you will not only get access to the best locations to watch the hunting orcas but we can also arrange further wildlife watching throughout Patagonia as well as taking in some of the most spectacular landscapes in the world. <br/>•\tWe have an unrivalled network of experts and guides all over Argentina that are able to find and observe animals like Commerson’s dolphins, southern fur seals, Magenellic penguins, culpeo foxes, giant anteaters, greater rheas, pumas, fairy armadillos, southern elephant seals, coypus, jaguarundis and hundreds other endangered, rare or endemic species throughout this wilderness land. Whether it is Los Glaciares, Tierra del Fuego, Chaco, Iguazu, Campo de los Alisos, El Palmar and many other wildlife watching locations you want to visit we can arrange it. Please inform us if you wish to add a Argentina extensions to this orca watching itinerary below and we can provide an excellent wildlife watching itinerary and quote for you.<br/>•\tUnlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>The only place in the world where this orca hunting style exists in the world is off one or two beaches along the Peninsula Valdes in Patagonia, Argentina. Making Punta Norte just about the most exciting whale watching destination in the world. We recommend at least 3 full days here (the longer the better) and can also arrange tours to all other areas of Patagonia and Argentina in general.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>There is no real fitness level required for our orca watching holidays to Patagonia, you decide on the amount of walking involved in the tour.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; but as a rule of thumb we recommend that you bring your own binoculars or spotting scope as well as suitable clothing which would be a mix of cool, light clothing as well as warm winter clothes as the weather can be unpredictable and long hours on exposed beaches can get windy. Water proofs and a wind-breaker are also recommended. Comfortable walking shoes are a must, just in case you decide to head out for a hike in search of armadillos or guanacos. A sunhat and sun cream are also recommended. Of course plenty of film or memory cards for your camera as well as any other items of a personal nature which you will require whilst away.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 12 Years old.",

As well as the orca which will probably be on a morning patrol there are up to 10 other species of marine mammal you can see here. There are no fewer than 5 species of dolphin to spot, not including the largest dolphin of them all the orca. There is also the chance of seeing southern right whales here (even though they are not calving at this time of year they are still here in reasonable numbers). Then there is the orcas prey, the southern sea lions, southern elephant seals, Magellanic penguins occupy the beaches in large number and always make for interesting watching. After lunch you will have the rest of the day to explore the terrestrial side of the Peninsula. But do not despair as the land is also rich in wildlife, hairy armadillos, guanacos, foxes and various caracaras all live around here, so the wildlife watching is defiantly not confined to the sea.

        "description": "Punta Norte – Orca Watching – The next three days will be spent at the exclusive estancia where the orcas beach themselves in pursuit of the seal and sea lion pups. Depending on what you are after we can tailor these three days to your perfect requirements. If you would like we can set up hides on the beach for you to stake out the orcas and wait for the famous attacks, we can see about getting a boat out onto the water to be in and amongst the orcas as they launch their attacks and see the beach and the seal colonies from the orca’s point of view. This is not always available, as the weather, tides and general behaviour of the orcas has to be taken into account as all these factors can lead to going out in a small boat being far too dangerous. Another option would be to just walk amongst the seals and sea lions and watch the patrolling orcas and hope that you catch an attack. We can also arrange for you to visit the Megallanic penguin colony at Punta Tombo (an hour or so drive north), the penguin colony is at its peak in February but there are often a few penguins still around in March. But probably the most exciting option is to access the ‘Attack Channel’, this can only be arranged well in advance and has a heavy price tag (usually around US$750-1000 per person per day), but this price does fluctuate and is worth it, when you catch the photos of orcas rushing into shore in front of you. There are also plenty of land based activities and wildlife watching as well and you will have the use of the 4x4 jeeps (with a driver) to explore the ranch and try to spot some of the unusual wildlife here.

The Argentine and Uruguayan tradition of tango, now renowned worldwide, was born in the popular circles of Buenos Aires and Montevideo, in the Rio de la Plata basin. In this region where European immigrants, descendants of African slaves, and natives mix, the Criollos, a heterogeneous mix of customs, beliefs, and rituals, emerged to evolve into a characteristic cultural identity. Among the best-known forms of expression of this identity, the music, dance, and poetry of tango are both a reflection and a vector of cultural diversity and dialogue. English-speaking guide.

    "generalInfo": "Argentina, the eighth largest country in the world, takes some time to get to know. This luxury holiday in northern Argentina divides 23 days between the north-eastern province of Misiones, and the north-west province of Salta. You get rainforests, waterfalls and wildlife in Misiones province, followed by the bare and striking rock formations and mountains of Salta province.<br/><br/>For the first part, you’ll head north from Buenos Aires, via the floating safari of the Ibera wetlands and vivid tea plantations where yerba mate is grown. Watch as the land gets wetter and wilder – until it culminates in the Iguazu Falls, the largest water system in the world, a dramatic natural boundary between Brazil and Argentina. You get plenty of time to explore here, with three days in a jungle lodge, and a full day either side of the falls, before flying to Salta for the second half of your trip.<br/><br/>In Salta province, the altitude is high, and the landscape is highly strange. Purmamarca is a town famous for the multicoloured mountainside that rises behind it. Weirder is to come as you wind higher and higher – to The Puna, a high plateau between Argentina and Chile, where you’ll drive between ghost towns and abandoned mines. <br/><br/>Descending to enjoy the winelands at Cafayate, famous for its viticulture, you’re soon hitting the road again in the Calchaquí Valleys, winelands which offer rugged mountains, and roads twisting up into them beyond the regimented rows of vines. Don’t worry, you won’t leave without seeing a guanaco – likely in Los Cardones National Park. <br/><br/>What makes this trip luxury? It’s the private guide, and the boutique hotel in Buenos Aires, the luxury jungle lodge at the Iguazu Falls, and the ecolodges on the banks of the Macona Falls. Since this is a tailor made tour, you can edit the trip to suit your particular interests – after all, there’s plenty to capture your attention in Argentina.<br/><br/>This trip operates with minimal internal flights, and the rest of the sights are seen on some truly epic – yet still manageable – drives into the country. <br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to Buenos Aires One of Argentina’s top attractions is the leviathan metropolis of Buenos Aires, the most fascinating of all South American capitals. It’s a riveting place just to wander about, people-watching, shopping or simply soaking up the unique atmosphere. Its many barrios (neighborhoods) are startlingly different – some are decadently old-fashioned, others daringly modern – but all of them ooze character. Buenos Aires has got everything: night-life, tango, culture, football, excellent beef and the best local wines. Private City Tour. The city tour would be a mixture of driving and walking and would take in all the major sights of Buenos Aires. From the Flor Generica And the Rose gardens we would make our way to the park of memory . This park is dedicated to the 30,000 Argentines who disappeared during the dictatorship between the years 1976 to 1983. We would then visit Recoleta and the final resting place of EVA (Evita) Peron. This would be followed by the plaza San Martin and the Plaza de Mayo. This plaza has a rich history and the mothers of the plaza de Mayo still march their every Thursday holding the pictures of their disappeared youngsters and wearing their iconic headscarves. This is also the sight of the Casa Rosada where Evita made her famous balcony speech. From there we would move on to take in San Telmo and la Boca with the famous Caminito. We would move on then to the Theatro Colon and the 9th of July Avenue which at 18 lanes wide is the worlds largest and quite a sight to be hold. Argentine Dinner Party Experience. You will take part in the Argentina Dinner Experience this evening . This unique dinner party's concept is to teach you the fundamentals of what being an Argentine is all about, whilst simply having more fun than is available anywhere else. Learn how to close your own empanada using the 'repulge' technique, to order steak your way in Spanish, to prepare your own 'mate' drink. During the experience you get to take part in the ritual of preparing an Argentina Asado with the best of Argentina beef whilst sampling the best of Argentine wines. This is a group experience and is a lot of fun and great way to meet fellow travellers."

Located at an altitude of 1,200 m, in the heart of the Lerma valley, the city of Salta was a strategic stopping point for troops and carts traveling to the Potosí - Bolivia silver mines, more than 400 years ago. Today the colonial city of Salta has a population of over 1 million and is considered by many to be one of the most modern cities in Andean South America. On arrival in Salta we drive a short distance to San Lorenzo canyon and check-in to the picturesque Selva Montana Ecolodge, located amongst the forest clad mountain slopes. Time permitting there will be an afternoon visit to the nearby Huaico Reserve protecting a stand of pristine Cloudforest, where we spend a few hours in search of Dusky-legged Guan, Cream-backed Woodpecker and a number of forest birds, but also a few attractive mammals are possible to see here including Forest Fox and Brown Brocket-Deer. Dinner and overnight at Selva Montana Hotel."

An early start sees us driving westwards along El Toro canyon where impressive geological formations painted by diverse minerals exposed on wind-carved slopes explain why this area is a mecca for Nature photographers. We will look out for Andean Condor soaring high above, but our stops along the canyon and sided trips to nearby lagoons should also produce good views of Andean and James's Flamingos. We will spend the day in this area at an altitude of around 9,000 ft. enjoying the solitude, grandeur and intensely clear atmosphere which are characteristics of Altiplano habitat, home of domesticated llamas, wild maize and potatoes. This mostly paved winding road climbs up the Cordillera to c. 4,000 mt. where flowering tobacco bushes attract the striking Red-tailed Comet and Giant Hummingbird. We plan to undertake short hikes in idyllic surroundings in search of Mountain Vizcacha “looks like a cross between a Squirrel and Kangaroo- and the secretive Highland Tucu-tuco, but we may also come across with one of their predators such as Andean Red Fox, Pampas Cat and/or Black-chested Buzzard Eagle. Beyond the mountain pass we start travelling towards the small mining town of San Antonio de los Cobres in search of perhaps the most attractive South American camelid, the elegant Vicuna, but also Puna Rhea is a possible sighting in the area. We stay tonight at the very nice Hosteria de las Nubes in San Antonio."

Andean Red Fox is one of the likely targets for us today but we will also have good chances for Andean Deer and more Guanacos and Vicuñas. Even the rare and secretive Andean Cat inhabits this region and so we will keep a sharp eye on the barren slopes. At this high altitude the avifauna is represented by a fine selection of Sierra Finches, Earthcreepers and Miners plus the scarce Puna Tinamou and the rather tame Rufous-bellied Seedsnipe. We have chances to find perhaps a Brush-tailed Vizcacha Rat near the stone-walls, while several falcons and hawks will be spotted soaring around. Later in the afternoon we descend south and eastwards following the railroad of the famous Train to the Clouds, enjoying spectacular Andean landscape on our way back to Salta and our hotel in San Lorenzo for dinner and one night at the Selva Montana."

We have a full day excursion devoted to exploring the El Rey National Park, one of the most isolated and wild protected areas in Argentina. This Park is ringed by mountain ridges and with only one entrance. Our drive along a narrow canyon will cross several rivers where our 4 wheel drive vehicle will be put to the test! Good transitional forest dotted with a few small farms give us the chance for roadside searching where Brown Brocket Deer, Red Tegu-Lizard and Forest Rabbit can suddenly appear. Amongst the birds, Toco Toucan, King Vulture, Scaly headed Parrot, the elegant Red-legged Seriema and Gray-necked Wood Rail, must be mentioned. Once in the Park we will take leisurely walks along several good trails in search of mammals like Jaguarundi, White-lipped and/or Collared Peccaries and with a bit of luck we can even get views of the shy River Otter swimming along the streams. The isolated situation of this Park and the absence of Jaguar – exterminated by local ranchers before the creation of this protected area - offer perhaps our best chances to find the Anta (local name for Tapir) during our tour. We camp overnight here and enjoy a robust barbeque for dinner in the field."

This will be an opportunistic day as we explore a diversity of habitats while we travel to our destination. The likely species to be seen this day along the road will include Common Hog-nosed Skunk, Southern Dwarf Cavy, Argentine Gray Fox, a couple of species of Armadillos and some of the characteristic birds of this open habitat with grasslands, spiny bushes and mesquite type woodland that will include Greater Rhea, Brushland Tinamou, Aplomado Falcon and Savanna Hawk. Our destination for today and tomorrow is the Calilegua National Park. We stay two nights in our comfortable hotel in Calilegua town near the entrance to Calilegua Park but this evening we plan to visit the Aguas Negras river where we hope to find an Ocelot or perhaps a Tayra patrolling the forest edge in search of prey such as Forest Rabbit or local snakes. These carnivores are never assured but we will certainly find and identify lots of animal tracks on the muddy shores of the river."

Here we hope to find a group of Red Yungas Squirrel foraging on the Nut-trees and the confiding White-throated Antpitta grubbing among leaf debris. Golden-collared Macaw and the endangered Alder Parrot are two members of the parrot tribe that will hopefully be found as well.

We depart early from Resistencia and head to the province of Formosa, crossing the boundary of Rio Bermejo and enter La Estrella Wetlands. La Estrella Wetlands, together with Brazilian and Iberá wetlands (the latter in the province of Corrientes) is one of the most important ecological reservations of the continent. It is inhabited by aquatic birds, capybaras, neotropical otters, boas and yacare caimans. During the rainy season (summer) the flood produced by the Pilcomayo river creates a large lagoon that permits boat sailings. Wading birds (storks, herons and jabiru) also appeared to nest and share territory with otters, alligators, viscacha, capybaras, anteaters. The Estrella has “high” and “low” forests. Among the tree stands taller black and white carob, quebracho Colorado and Blanco, mistoles, guayacanes and white sticks are counted. While \"low\" forests are represented by species such as chañar, water primrose, vinal, the itín and cross bar. Floating plants such as water hyacinth sprouts out lining much of the water, giving it a very peculiar appearance. The Estrella is considered the third most important wetland Pantanal of South America after Brazil and the Ibera Marshes. In this world wildlife reign, black birds and alligators live, giant river capybaras, boas and anteaters, among other species. We enjoy the hospitality locals in the estancia of Fort Soledad."

After breakfast, we head south west passing through the provinces of Formosa & Corrientes to arrive in the area known as the Iberia Wetlands. During the next 4 nights, you will have the pleasure of staying at Aguape Lodge. All meals and activities included. Aguape Lodge is placed on the coasts of the Iberá Wetlands with an overwhelming view to the marshes and the lagoon. The Iberá Wetlands are one of the most important wetlands in the world. They are second in size in South America. It is a twin ecosystem of the Pantanal de Brasil. It covers over 1.300.000has, the nature reserve occupies 14% of Corrientes. It is one of the most important water reserves in the continent. A true nature sanctuary in which you willl be able to enjoy the closeness and meekness of the animals in their own habitat. This is made possible because they are no longer threatened by men. This natural paradise is unique and it is one of the most relevant in the world, not only because of the preservation of the living creatures that inhabit the place, but also because it is one of the most important water reservoirs in the planet. For this reason, it was catalogued as a Wetland of international importance, by the RAMSAR convention held on January 2002. Inside the Reserve there are 4 species recently declared Provincial Natural Monuments: the otter, the maned wolf, the Pampas and marsh deer. It is also home to both of Argentinas caiman species, the caiman yacaré and the broad-snouted caiman. Its ornithological richness is represented by 350 types of birds. Animal Sighting tours are always fun and surprising. You can enjoy this while you canoe through the Natural Iberá Reserve, or trek along the paths in the jungle or the esteros. The limits of the lagoon are defined in large part by an extensive perimeter belt dammed. On the floating, windblown seeds are deposited; the density of the base is sufficient to grow in it, shrubs and trees. Aquatic vegetation is lush and covers large areas. Formed by beautiful plants with blue flowers, water fern or Aguape that looks a beautiful flower with violet petals of yellow bodies. ACTIVITIES: • Skilful guides to guide us in our excursions through the Iberá Natural Reserve. • Motorboat fauna sighting, trekking, horse riding, canoeing & kayak, night tours. • Long trekking with lunch and refreshments – Excellent for photographers and bird-watchers. • Tours in 4Wd vehicles in the Iberá Natural Reserve. • Outings for bird-watching and taking photographs. • Bikes for our guest to go around the Colonia Carlos Pellegrini."

        "description": "Pick-up starts at 8 hs Every land has its secrets, but not everyone is chosen to know them. A lighthouse on a lonely cape, a mysterious ship that ran aground 40 years ago, and a distinguished old estancia are just some of the icons that will reveal the unknown stories of Tierra del Fuego. Early in the morning, you will leave Ushuaia along National Route 3 and cross the Andes via Paso Garibaldi. At 450 meters above sea level, this is one of the most interesting points of the journey. After around 60 km, Lake Escondido will surprise you amid the high rock faces. As you continue, you'll notice that the ecosystem is gradually changing from forest to steppe in the northern part of the island, a region known for breeding the best lamb in the world. Next, you'll head for provincial road \"A\", where you'll take a gravel road and visit Estancia Rolito. This beautiful estancia, which retains the spirit of a family business founded on the tradition of sheep farming, is the first to open its doors to rural tourism. It's here that you'll pause for a delicious tea with homemade cakes, biscuits, and jams. You'll also have time to take a stroll through part of the magnificent ancient Lenga forest. After enjoying this picturesque setting, you will continue towards the Atlantic Ocean and Cape San Pablo. At this point, you will climb a secluded mountain at the foot of which is an abandoned lighthouse (easy walk). When you reach the top of this lighthouse, you'll see the Desdemona, a ship that has been abandoned for almost 40 years and invites you to step back in time. It was on a cold winter's morning in 1983 that this enormous ship ran aground on the shores of the Argentine Sea. After exploring this mysterious giant, you'll pay a visit to local fishermen who will invite you to enjoy a home-cooked lunch of fresh fish on their premises. You will be welcomed into their home by Silvia and Miguel. Return to your hotel after a unique experience. Excursion in a small group with an English/Spanish-speaking guide. Available only from October to April"

Its faraway location has drawn explorers since the days of Magellan and Darwin, and this tradition continues with today’s travelers. A triangular archipelago surrounded by the stormy South Atlantic and the Strait of Magellan, Tierra del Fuego offers plenty of natural beauty: scenic glaciers, lush forests, astounding mountains, clear waterways and a dramatic sea coast. The region’s largest city, Ushuaia, is also the ‘southernmost city in the world’ – a major draw for list-tickers – but has also become the main gateway to wondrous Antarctica. Tierra del Fuego is isolated and hard to reach, but for true adventure-seekers in Argentina it’s a must. After settling into your hotel, we recommend that you visit the End of the World Prison Museum in the afternoon."

        "description": "Transfer from hotel to airport to take flight to Calafate. Upon arrival, transfer to hotel. In the heart of Patagonia, next to the Andes, is one of Argentina’s most scenic areas, commonly referred to as Lago Argentino and the Perito Moreno Glacier, declared “Universal Heritage” by the UNESCO. The most renown of all the glaciers is the Perito Moreno Glacier. Situated 80 km (50 miles) from El Calafate, it is the most easily reached among them. This is an imposing ice river that descends from the Southern Patagonian Ice Cap down to the lake, at ‘Canal de los Témpanos’ (Icebergs’ Channel). It is the only glacier in the area which is considered to be in equilibrium, that is: not receding. It has always been the most important attraction of the region thanks to its spectacular beauty, but especially because of its unusual behavior. The glacier slowly advances down the mountain slope towards the lake, producing, as it spills down, thunderous noises and ruptures. Recommend visiting Laguna Nimez reserve, a short walk from the town center. This ecological environment lodges an educational circuit with trails and signposts laid up along over 2,500 meters. The guides await visitors at the entrance gate to assist them with the interpretation of the natural environment. Likewise, a complete herbarium that helps visitors identify the local plants is located in the entrance area. The reserve has good vantage points that enable visitors to watch how the flamingos, geese, silvery grebes, black-necked swans, ibis, lapwings, ducks, coots, hawks and chimangos, among other 70 species, fed in the clump of rushes."

Is El Calafate all about the glaciers? Well, yes and no…glaciers are main attractions that you can visit via hiking or a boat ride. But you have lot more to discover about Argentine rural culture. From Calafate you can also visit a typical Patagonian finca (ranch) and learn all about the gaucho culture and enjoy a great asado (barbecue). You’ll soon realize that Calafate is much more than the gateway to the Perito Moreno glacier. Upon arrival you will be taken to the hotel and have the rest of the day to relax or explore the surroundings."

If there is time your tour leader will take you on a guided city tour takes you to all the major sites of this fascinating city concentrating on Santiago’s bustling historic centre, which in recent years has taken on a new lease of life. Awakening from years of neglect, the traditional residential neighbourhood of Lastarria is a delight to explore, replete with shops, arty cafés and characterful hotels. Nearby, leafy Parque Forestal was inaugurated in the early twentieth century to celebrate the first 100 years of the republic. It is just a few blocks from the beating heart of old Santiago, the Plaza de Armas, the capital’s main square which is graced by elegant Chilean wine palms with their characteristic bottle-shaped trunks. Grouped around the plaza are Santiago’s Cathedral, the main post office, the National Historic Museum and the Municipalidad de Santiago (city hall). From here, if time, visit San Cristóbal Hill by riding the cable car to the top. On clear days there are spectacular panoramic views across the city towards the Andes."

        "description": "A guided excursion takes you out of the city through a pretty Mediterranean landscape to a nearby winery. An hour’s drive from Santiago takes you to the Central Valley, blanketed in a patchwork region of regimented vineyards. Here you will have the chance to sample some of the wines, and learn about the national grape varieties. The Carmenère grape originated in France but has been all but wiped out in Europe. Cuttings of the vine arrived in Chile in the 19th century, and the region’s natural boundaries (bordered by the Andes, the ocean, the desert and glacial plains) protected it from disease. For many years it was processed as Merlot, but the distinct properties of Carmenère were recognised in the 1990s. It produces a spicy, fruity red which is deep crimson in colour. As the vineyards are located to the west of Santiago, you may like to extend the excursion with an optional visit to Chile’s second city, Valparaíso. This lively seaport is built on a series of hills which form a backdrop to the wide bay, with views over the seaside resort of Viña del Mar. You can wander through the steep, winding streets and among the brightly-coloured colonial homes built for 19th century British and German merchants, or take a ride in one of the creaky wooden funiculars which link the cliff-top communities."

Private City Tour The city tour would be a mixture of driving and walking and would take in all the major sights of Buenos Aires. From the Flor Generica And the Rose gardens we would make our way to the park of memory . This park is dedicated to the 30,000 Argentine's who disappeared during the dictatorship between the years 1976 to 1983. We would then visit Recoleta and the final resting place of EVA (Evita) Peron. This would be followed by the plaza San Martin and the Plaza de Mayo. This plaza has a rich history and the mothers of the plaza de Mayo still march their every Thursday holding the pictures of their disappeared youngsters and wearing their iconic headscarves. This is also the sight of the Casa Rosada where Evita made her famous balcony speech. From there we would move on to take in San Telmo and la Boca with the famous Caminito. We would move on then to the Theatro Colon and the 9th of July Avenue which at 18 lanes wide is the worlds largest and quite a sight to be hold. Argentine Dinner Party Experience You will take part in the Argentina Dinner Experience this evening . This unique dinner party's concept is to teach you the fundamentals of what being an Argentine is all about, whilst simply having more fun than is available anywhere else. Learn how to close your own empanada using the 'repulge' technique, to order steak your way in Spanish, to prepare your own 'mate' drink. During the experience you get to take part in the ritual of preparing an Argentina Asado with the best of Argentina beef whilst sampling the best of Argentine wines. This is a group experience and is a lot of fun and great way to meet fellow travelers."

Whales, penguins and elephant seals make up part of the profusion of marine life, whilst guanacos, rheas and armadillos roam around on the land. Southern right whales can be spotted during their breeding season of June to December, killer whales can be spotted from November through to April, and August to October is the best time to observe the elephant seals."

During the warm months (September to April) Punta Tombo reserve is home to the world's largest colony of Magellanic penguins. Spending much of their lives in the water, these penguins return yearly to the Patagonian coast to court, breed, and raise their young. Approximately half of the colonies of penguins that nest at Punta Tombo burrow underground. Males arrive prior to the females, preparing and settling into their old nests. When the females arrive, they search out their lifelong mate through a series of calls and a chorus of answers. After an elaborate courtship, the female will lay one egg and both male and female will share the two-month incubation. Once the baby penguin, or chick, hatches, the parents will forage for food, feeding the chick by regurgitation until it can fend for itself. After the chicks learn to swim, the family will return to the ocean and migrate north to southern Brazil. Some Magellanic penguins may migrate 3000 miles round-trip between Brazil and Patagonia. When the immature penguins return to Punta Tombo the following year, they will molt their feathers, and breeding will once again resume. Besides penguins it is also possible to see many other kinds of birds in the area. Driving back to Puerto Madryn, the tour stops at Gaiman, one of the oldest Welsh colonies in the area, where it is possible to taste an excellent tea with homemade cakes."

In the heart of Patagonia, next to the Andes, is one of Argentina’s most scenic areas, commonly referred to as Lago Argentino and the Perito Moreno Glacier, declared “Universal Heritage” by the UNESCO. The most renown of all the glaciers is the Perito Moreno Glacier. Situated 80 km (50 miles) from El Calafate, it is the most easily reached among them. This is an imposing ice river that descends from the Southern Patagonian Ice Cap down to the lake, at ‘Canal de los Témpanos’ (Icebergs’ Channel). It is the only glacier in the area which is considered to be in equilibrium, that is: not receding. It has always been the most important attraction of the region thanks to its spectacular beauty, but especially because of its unusual behavior. The glacier slowly advances down the mountain slope towards the lake, producing, as it spills down, thunderous noises and ruptures. Recommend visiting Laguna Nimez reserve, a short walk from the town center. This ecological environment lodges an educational circuit with trails and signposts laid up along over 2,500 meters. The guides await visitors at the entrance gate to assist them with the interpretation of the natural environment. Likewise, a complete herbarium that helps visitors identify the local plants is located in the entrance area. The reserve has good vantage points that enable visitors to watch how the flamingos, geese, silvery grebes, black-necked swans, ibis, lapwings, ducks, coots, hawks and chimangos, among other 70 species, fed in the clump of rushes."

Your icy adventure begins with pickup at your El Calafate hotel and a scenic drive to Los Glaciares National Park, so named for the abundance of glaciers found here, including Upsalla, Onelli and Spegazzini. Let your guide handle the driving while you soak up the splendor of Lago Argentino framed by majestic peaks and icy islands. Stretch your legs and take an easy hike along park pathways for diverse views of Perito Moreno’s 200-foot-(60-meter)-high, blue-tinged walls. Watch closely to see giant slabs of ice detach from the glacier and slide into the surrounding lagoon. Loud cracking noises are sure to alert you to any movement! For another perspective, enjoy a 1-hour cruise through the lagoon in front of Perito Moreno. Sail along the massive glacier wall and in between floating icebergs for an awe-inspiring watery perspective on this natural wonder. After exploring the park, relax on the return drive to El Calafate, where your 9-hour tour concludes in the early evening."

For example, after crossing the Magellan Strait, we stay at a remote estancia or ranch and learn about rural Patagonian lifestyles.

Announced by unusually radiant, glowing rosary beads and followed by a number of brief visions, Gladys subsequently received repeated interior locutions, beginning on October 13 the anniversary of apparitions at Fátima.

        "description": "4WD Adventure to Uyuni Today you will start the 3 day adventure in the stunning landscapes between the Salar de Uyuni and the Atacama Desert (Chile). It is a fantastic and different experience from anything you might have seen before. You will be going into the Bolivian salt flats, with the contrasting blue sky against the background of the mountains, volcanoes and geysers. In the early morning you will be picked up from your hotel (shared service) and head to the Bolivian border, passing by Chile and Bolivia immigration offices. Once on the Bolivian side, at 14,435 feet above sea level, you will change to a 4WD Jeep with a maximum capacity of 6 people. During the first day the group is in the Bolivian high plain visiting places like Laguna Verde and Laguna Blanca, located at the foot of the Licancabur Volcano, continuing to Dali Desert where you can admire a surrealistic landscape, thermal water pools, Sol de Mañana geysers –intermittent springs coming up at 194º F – and fumaroles; cracks with emerging volcanic lava. The journey ends up at Laguna Colorada, the main nesting centre for more than 30,000 flamingos of 3 different species. These places are located at an average height of 4.500 metres 14,764 feet above sea level and it is possible to gaze at endemic flora and fauna such as flamingos, vicuñas and other animals. The night will be spent in a basic refuge, in shared rooms for 6 people. Please note, that since you will be visiting a remote and not developed area, the accommodation is basic. It is important that you bring a sleeping bag to spend the night, especially during the months of June, July, August and September- though they can be rented on arrival."

Continuing towards the eyes of the salt flats, you will arrive at Colchani town, located in the limits of Uyuni salt flat. From here you will head to the tranquil Bolivian city Uyuni , where you will arrive in the late afternoon. NOTE: The landscapes that you will see during this adventure trip are absolutely amazing, but you must know that the quality of service is basic in the 4WD 3 days tour from San Pedro de Atacama to Uyuni Salt Flats. Food is included but it is basic food. Accommodation is really basic. Nights are in shelters with shared rooms and without private bathrooms, sometimes without hot water and sometimes, even without water and sometimes dirty. Weather during the night can be 20º Celsius below zero. Drivers don`t always speak English and are not tour guides, they are just drivers. You will be in places with an altitude of 5000 mts over the sea level. So, the idea that we want you to have clear is that service is not luxurious during these days, but landscapes are fabulous and make the trip really worthwhile. This is an adventure trip and the most remarkable thing about it is the unique landscapes that you will be able to enjoy. If you don`t care about this lack of comfort, we can guarantee that you will enjoy one of the most spectacular landscapes of South America. It is very important that you know this at the moment of booking this trip."

This ascent takes about an hour and its main attraction is the “Temple of the Moon”, a complex of underground structures likely to have been used by the elite. Or, if you would prefer a different option, take the day to visit the interesting town of Aguas Calientes, its historic Plaza de Armas, and the many local markets nearby. In these markets you can find various types of local handcrafts, typical food, and even different potions for finding love or keeping good luck on your side. In the afternoon you will head to the train station in Aguas Calientes and take the train to Cuzco."

Machu Picchu is the most famous example of this practice. In the afternoon, we’ll pick you up at your hotel to start your Cuzco city tour with a visit to the Coricancha, also known as the “Temple of the Sun”, the construction of which was ordered by Inca Pachacútec (1438-1471) when he was a powerful Incan leader. This is where the Sun (Inti, in Quechua) was worshipped during the reign of the Inca Empire. We’ll continue on to visit the Cathedral, the most important building in the Main Square (construction lasted almost a century) and one of the most breathtaking Spanish colonial churches in America. Our next stop will be the Sacsayhuamán fortress, an emblematic Incan piece of work, which protected the Holy City. It was built with giant megalithic blocks, the transportation and construction of which continue to be a mystery. This day will end with a visit to some archeological main attractions. You’ll visit Qenqo, located just over 2 miles away from Cuzco City (where it is believed that agricultural rituals took place), to finish with the visit of the vestiges of Puka Pukara, the “red fortress”, located 4.5 miles away from Cuzco. At the end of this full historical and natural immersion in Cuzco’s heritage, we’ll drive you back to your hotel."

This 500 year old colonial city sits on a wide plain with a magnificent Andean backdrop. You will spend a night here, with plenty of time to enjoy a guided tour of this fine city. Next up is coastal Valparaiso, Chile’s second city, and worth the day trip before hitting the more remote spots of northern Argentina.<br/><br/>We then take one of four internal flights on this trip into Mendoza in Argentina, located in an extraordinary setting where desert meets the Andes. It is home to equally extraordinary vineyards and visits to wineries are very much on the cards here. More Andean treats await after our next flight north to Salta, a town with more incredible vistas and vineyards, as well as a fascinating indigenous history. <br/><br/>Every day brings new landscapes and colours on this trip, from the red canyons around Cafayate to the dramatic Iguazú Falls on the Brazilian border. If Iguazú is the natural heritage finale of this trip, the cultural heritage one is in Buenos Aires, considered to be one of Latin America’s most cosmopolitan cities. You’ll have plenty of time to enjoy a guided tour of the capital, eat fine food in the San Telmo district and, of course, try out some tango. <br/>",

Nearby, leafy Parque Forestal was inaugurated in the early twentieth century to celebrate the first 100 years of the republic. It is just a few blocks from the beating heart of old Santiago, the Plaza de Armas, the capital’s main square which is graced by elegant Chilean wine palms with their characteristic bottle-shaped trunks. Grouped around the plaza are Santiago’s Cathedral, the main post office, the National Historic Museum and the Municipalidad de Santiago (city hall).

With its colonial past and Unesco World Heritage status, the old city is an ideal place to just wander the maze of cobbled alleys amongst churches, monasteries, plazas and bougainvillea draped balconies. Las Murallas, the thick walls built around the old city to protect it from pirates, are wonderfully preserved and make for an interesting walk, before stopping off in one of the hidden patio cafes. We spend our first night here to get a flavour of both the old city and also the trendy area of Bocagrande. We will also include a boat trip to Playa Blanca, which is one of Cartagenas most famous beaches with its turquoise waters and golden sand. We then set off in the Truck heading eastbound with a quick dip in Volcan de Lodo el Totumo before we continue to Taganga where we spend a night in this chilled out Caribbean town with a strong alternative feel. Some of South America's loveliest coastline lies east of Taganga in Tayrona National Park. We spend time exploring trails to beaches set in deep bays, shaded by coconut palms.

Known as the ‘4 Names City’ because of its long and varied history, the city is at a lower altitude than La Paz and enjoys a warmer and greener climate. The Cretaceous Park is well worth a visit, as you can see and learn about the thousands of remarkable dinosaur footprints discovered here, including the largest ever found, from a Titanosaur weighing over 70 tonnes!. A short drive then brings us to Potosi. At over 4000m it is the highest city of its size in the world and 400 years ago it was the largest city in all the Americas. Vast amounts of silver were extracted from Potosi and shipped to Spain in years gone by. The adventurous may take the opportunity to go down one of these mines where mining techniques have remained unchanged for centuries, though read up on safety concerns first.

We cross by ferry to the most southerly town in the world Ushuaia, from where you can view the green waters of the Beagle Channel, and the snow clad peaks beyond. We have a few days here, and boat trips on the Beagle Channel and to Penguin Island are available as well as hiking trips to the Emerald Lagoon or the Vinciguerra Glacier. For those not feeling so active, a fun and scenic vintage steam train ride is available on the Fuegian Railway into the Tierra del Fuego National Park. Ushuaia is also the starting point for many cruise ships and expeditions heading to Antarctica, and you could aim to time a trip there with the end of your expedition with us. Winter in Patagonia - Please note that the trips which travel through this part of Patagonia between July and September will coincide with winter in Patagonia. This will give us the opportunity to see the Andes at their most impressive, driving past towering snow-capped peaks and experiencing this rugged wilderness at a time of year that not many other travellers get to see! We will hopefully have the chance to ski or snowboard in Bariloche and Ushuaia, ice-climb across glaciers in El Chalten, and hike in national parks at the most dramatic time of year. However, weather conditions can be unpredictable, and there is a chance that certain roads will not be passable, so we cannot guarantee following our planned itinerary to Tierra del Fuego; changes may have to be made with little or no notice. But if this is required we will make a new plan and find a different route that will be sure to offer its own attractions and experiences, so come prepared for an adventure!"

Penguins, Sea Lions, Elephant Seals, Sea Birds and sometimes Whales can be seen. Following the excellent paved roads north along the coast we pass through some quite affluent towns. One, Puerto Madryn, was the landing place over a century ago for the first group of Welsh settlers that subsequently colonised and now farm the surrounding area. We traverse the vast Pampas grasslands, South America's cowboy country, where gun-toting gauchos on horseback look after vast herds of cattle. Travel to Argentina is not complete without a visit to the country's capital, and so we follow the coast further north to Buenos Aires. The city is renowned for it's steaks, fine wines, tango dancing, ice cream and great nightlife! A few days in this smart cosmopolitan city and you could be forgiven for thinking you were back in Europe."

Another great way to explore the secluded islands of this pristine coastline is taking a sailing trip in one of the traditional schooners. Our final drive takes us to the hedonistic playground of Rio de Janeiro, where people famously enjoy a party and live for the moment. Many people in the group will finish their trip on arrival into Rio. The Carnival and New Years Eve celebrations are always chaotic, crowded and fun and a must during any stint of travel to Brazil! We have Carnival and New Year accommodation packages available if you would like to extend your stay and remain with other people in the group for the celebrations.

Porto Seguro is our next stop and is the region where Portuguese sailors first landed in the New World over 500 years ago, and where you can still see relics from those early settlement days. A steep climb up to Cidade Historica will be rewarded with sweeping views, colourful old buildings and museums. Porto Seguro is also known for its nightlife and 'beach action!' We then take the ferry across Brazil's largest bay, Baia de Todos os Santos, and arrive in the Afro-Brazilian city of Salvador. Around 40% of all African slaves transported to the new world, came to Salvador and this has left a very particular vibe - tropical, soulful and intoxicating, that is unique to this corner of Brazil. The centre is separated by a steep bluff, in to the Cidade Alta (Upper City) and Baixa (Lower City) and access is gained in the beautifully restored art-decoelevator - Elevado Lacerda. We have a few days to wander and take in the music, cuisine and religion of the region. You can also stop off in the Praca da Se and watch locals practicing the dance fighting known as Capoeira."

After a night quite possibly spent under the stars, we continue into the interior where roads start to become more arduous, and we make a stop in Navidade, in the green and wooded valley of Serra Geral. More cobbled streets and prettily painted, tile roofed 18th and 19th Century houses await and we have time to explore the town before following the highway north and to reach the confusing layout of Palmas.

For those that want to go wildlife spotting, several optional tours are available to the nearby parks of Estadual do Jalapao and Ilha do Bananal. In the latter, there is a good chance to see dolphins, caiman, giant river turtles and lots of bird life. Although difficult and unpredictable, you may also catch a glimpse of a Tapir or Jaguar! Next we start a long drive north towards Belem on the Atlantic coast. Upon its completion in the 1960s this road was heralded as a feat of engineering as it overcame the unforgiving Amazon to allow people and goods to be transported from the Brazilian interior to the ports of Belem for exportation. Now the rainforest has given way to further development and we pass through vast stretches of farmland, camping overnight in remote Postos before arriving in Belem.

Nothing can prepare you for the sheer size of this area, as it will take us 24 hours to journey from Belem on the south bank to Macapa on the north. Macapa is an overnight stop as we wait for our truck to arrive on a separate ferry from Belem. This gives us time to explore this commercial hub where gold, iron, timber, oil and tin ore pass through on its way to neighbouring Santana. The Equator also runs through the centre of the city, which has lead residents to call it ‘The capital of the middle of the world’. We journey north on dirt roads, quite possibly having to use our sand mats to make it through the mud and to reconstruct wooden bridges! Oiapoque is the gateway to French Guiana, and here so we pass through European immigration and customs before , we continue on to the Capital of Cayenne where we normally apply for our Suriname visas. Cayenne is full of colonial architecture that just has to be explored. The two most impressive are the town hall, built by the Jesuits in 1890, and St. Saviours Roman Catholic Cathedral. The city’s botanical gardens are also worth a look, or just chill out on the mail square with a beer, watch the world go by and try some of the fantastic street food.

More recently Russian Soyuz rockets have also used this facility and if we’re lucky we may even see a launch! Time allowing we will also visit Devil’s Island, prior home to one of France’s most notorious prisons. We may then return to Cayenne to collect our passports and spend another night in the vibrant city, before journeying west to St Laurent. Along the way we will stop head to an area on the coast which is a nesting site for 4 of the world’s most famous turtle species. Nothing can compare coming up close and personal to a giant leatherback turtle. April is normally the start of nesting time, where turtles make the journey up the beach to deposit their eggs in the warm sand. We’ll keep our fingers crossed for sightings. Founded in 1880, the penal town of St. Laurent du Maroni was inhabited almost entirely with guards or liberated prisoners from the nearby Transportation Camp. Here the famous writer Henri Charriere, who went on to write Papillon, spent some of his days before being moved to the ‘inescapable’ Iles du Salut prison.

        "description": "PARAMARIBO & JUNGLE EXCURSIONS Leaving French Guyana behind we take another ferry and cross into Suriname, where we feel the atmosphere and culture palpably change from French to Dutch. Suriname was a colonial outpost of the Netherlands from the seventeenth century until it achieved full independence in 1975; the country retains much of its Dutch character, while also having the distinctly Caribbean and African feel that permeates the whole region. Throw in some indigenous cultures and you have a unique and intoxicating mix! We follow the road west and cross the Suriname River on the Jules Wijdenboschbrug (bridge) and arrive in Suriname’s capital, Paramaribo. Positioned where the Surname river meets the Atlantic Ocean, Paramaribo is a typically relaxed Caribbean city, with a long waterfront ideal for sitting back and relaxing in the cooling winds while watching local life go by. The historic inner city of Paramaribo is a UNESCO World Heritage site, and walking the streets here the fusion between colonial, Caribbean and local architecture is pronounced as European styles were combined with local materials to produce a style of construction that is only found in this city. Throughout the city there are many signs hinting at Paramaribo’s multicultural history and present day, and it is possible to visit the Suriname Mosque, Neveh Shalom Synagogue, St Peter and St Paul Cathedral and Arya Dawaker Hindu Temple, as well as the grand presidential palace. In the evenings head for the river, and join a river cruise to hopefully spot rare freshwater dolphins. After a couple of nights in Paramaribo to relax and recharge our batteries we now include a jungle excursion before we continue our adventure. We’ll drive inland for a couple of hours and then travel by motorised canoe to our resort near the foot of the Felullasifalls. We’ll have a a couple of nights here to explore the surrounding Amazon rainforest and several Maroon villages. from Pokigron to an island on the Suriname River. Here we spend a couple of nights exploring the surrounding Amazon rainforest, learning about the Saramaccan culture and visiting local villages.

We cross by ferry and continue to travel along the coast towards Georgetown, Guyana's capital. On the way there is an optional overnight visit to Bigi Pan, the largest lagoon in Suriname. This area has received international recognition because of the hundreds of thousands of migratory birds including flamingos and the striking scarlet ibis that use the lagoon as their feeding area. As well as the birdlife the area hosts many reptiles, snakes and extensive mangrove swamps. As a former British colony, Guyana offers something different again to the previous countries we have visited so far, but still has a distinctly Afro-Caribbean feel; strolling around Georgetown you could be forgiven at times for thinking you were in one of the many other past British territories in the region, such as Jamaica or even Barbados! Guyana, which was granted independence in 1966, is the only English-speaking country in South America, and is to many an unknown entity, relatively untouched by mass tourism. For a small and often forgotten country, however, it punches well above its weight, offering some of the most pristine and ecologically diverse and plentiful rainforest found anywhere, the world's highest single drop waterfall, and a rich and established cultural history, with many noted poets, musicians and literary figures coming from its small population. Rhianna is half-Guyanese, too, should that be of any interest. We will spend a few nights in Georgetown, from where it is possible to take an optional flight and short hike to visit Kaieteur Falls in Kaieteur National Park in the Amazon rainforest. At 221 metres, Kaieteur Falls is the world's highest single drop waterfall. Set in a stunning location, the falls and surrounding area are for many visitors to Guyana the highlight of their travels, as their remoteness and obscurity make you feel that you are really seeing a part of the world that very few people have ever been to."

We'll have the chance to taste the multiple varieties of grapes found in the area during our tour, before returning to Mendoza. The late afternoon is free to explore the city, and on our first full day in Argentina, it's a good idea to try some of the local delicacies - visit an afternoon coffee shop for an alfajor (an Argentinian speciality - a cakey biscuit filled with 'dulce de leche') or take a walk around the lively Plaza Independencia."

The trail is relatively flat and rocky, with mountains at either side of us and the peak of Aconcagua rising before us in the distance. Before returning to Mendoza, we'll also make a stop at the Puente del Inca, a geologically formed bridge once allegedly used by Incas to cross the river. The reddish oranges of the formation are caused by the minerals in the waters running beneath the bridge, and the remains of a slightly curious-looking stone chapel are still found built into the rock. We'll drive back to Mendoza after our visit. The drive to Mendoza takes approximately three hours each way."

Once the kingdom of dinosaurs, these two parks contain the most complete fossil record known from the Triassic Period and have together been granted UNESCO heritage status. Talampaya National Park is up first. The scrub desert boasts fossilised remains of a wide range of ancestral animals and plants. Even for those amongst us who are not scientifically minded, the park is an impressive show of geological wonders. We'll be undertaking an easy hike through the immense red rock canyon of the Don Eduardo Gorge, which is approximately 8 kilometres/5 miles on flat terrain. The dry riverbeds, red dunes and sand plains are more akin to a Martian journey than our expectations of Andean scenery. Popularly known as 'Moon Valley', Ischigualasto National Park, the next stop on our visit, is home to geological oddities that have been formed by water, wind and sun over the last million years. 'Bowling Lane' is one of the most iconic sites, with scores of perfectly polished round balls sitting on a flat surface, with apparently no explanation for their formation. We'll drive through this park by bus, stopping at the most interesting shapes to explore them further. After a thorough exploration of both parks, we'll return to Villa Union."

        "description": ": We'll get back on the Ruta 40 today, driving towards the small town of Belen and passing through characterful, rural villages en route. Part of the drive takes us on a winding upward journey over the Cuesta de Miranda, perhaps one of the most photogenic and visual climbs in the region - taking us from 1000 metres/3280 feet to 2000 metres/6561 feet above sea level and back down, in just a couple of hours. The highway was originally built in the early 1900s, following the path of the ancient Inca Trail that eventually led to Cusco. That early road was precarious - you could barely fit two cars abreast, with one side of the road dropping into the deep Miranda gorge. Thankfully it was updated in the last ten years, and a new highway was built - we'll pass the old one during the drive for comparison. After the Cuesta de Miranda, it's an easy drive for the final 200 kilometres/124 miles to Belen. There is a women's weaving co-operative in Belen that we've been visiting with groups for the last few years. Weaving, with both sheep and llama or alpaca wool, is an essential part of the economy up here in the northwest, and the co-op is a fascinating way to learn more about the process and its important place in this society. Our drive time today is approximately six hours including stops, arriving into Belen around 2pm."

The Quilmes people, dating back to around AD1000, famously resisted the Incan invasion and lived through over a century of Spanish colonisation. The large site is made up of the remains of terraces rising up the cacti-covered hillside - we can walk to the top for excellent views of the valley and the site. Although not as impressive as other archaeological sites in the Andes, it helps us to understand the indigenous heritage in this part of Argentina. Finally, we'll arrive in Cafayate in the early afternoon for a round of wine tasting in one of the region's rustic wineries, its rows of green vines backed by the spectacular mountains beyond. We might try Argentina's main white wine, Torrontes, famous in this region. Our drive to Cafayate takes approximately six hours."

Today our journey takes us to Cachi through the 'Arrows Gorge', a spectacular formation of sharp, pointed rocks shooting up through the air at all sorts of different angles; the road that we travel on pierces this dramatic and surreal landscape. It's an unsealed road, and as such the drive will take the whole day, with a number of spectacular scenery stops (including at the highest point of the tour, just over 3,400m / 11,154ft).

We'll stop to discover the spectacular mountain views at the various viewpoints on route to Salta - one of the livelier cities in the north of Argentina, it is a blend of colonial architecture, fascinating museums and buzzing nightlife.

Our first stop is three hours north, at the colourful desert town of Purmamarca. This town has an incredible backdrop - a mountainside named the 'Seven-Coloured Hill' for its bright shades of yellows, oranges, reds and greens. This town is well worth visiting in depth, and we'll spend a couple of hours here hiking on the Los Colorados path, an easy trail of 2.5km / 1.5 miles, exploring the town and taking our lunch stop. From Purmamarca we'll move to the traditional village of Tilcara, with its charming village square, market and church. The rest of the day's journey is awash with colour and scenic roadside lookouts; another appropriately named mountain is The 'Painters Palette', which we'll see over the town of Maimara. It's interesting to see once again the heritage from the pre-Columbian period which gives this area of northwest Argentina a very distinct sense of cultural identity. This is not only manifested in the woven items that we've spotted in other towns but also in the local diet, with northern food including llama stews and corn dishes on offer. After a day exploring, we'll return to Salta and will get a taste of its music scene at a 'pena', a traditional folk music hall where locals come with guitars and take turns to play and sing. Dinner is included."

The afternoon is free to settle in. Tomorrow we'll visit the eclectic and bohemian south of the city, so this afternoon you might want to visit the elite north, home to the embassies, the richer neighbourhoods and many of the city's green spaces.

Each neighbourhood of Buenos Aires has a distinct character, with grand Italianate architecture rubbing shoulders with winding cobbled streets or tree-lined avenues. To get a feel for the heart of the city, we'll stroll towards its founding point at the Plaza de Mayo, where the President's dusty-pink mansion is located. Every big event in Buenos Aires's history has been witnessed by the Plaza, from the continued protests of the Madres de la Plaza de Mayo back to Eva Peron's mass demonstrations in 1945. From here, we'll hop on a bus towards the colourful neighbourhood of La Boca. Settled originally by Italian migrants, the area is famed for its bright houses, a ramshackle affair of corrugated iron, and the tango dancers who perform in the streets. We'll visit a local Cafecito during our tour, taking a traditional Porteno elevenses of coffee and pastries. We end our morning in bohemian San Telmo, with its small one-way streets, historic mansions and walls covered with street art. Our Tour Leader will suggest lunch at a traditional Bodegon, sampling specialities that an Argentinian grandma would be happy with. Empanadas, locro (corn and pumpkin stew) or a delicious choripan (a fat chorizo sausage in bread, with chimichurri sauce) may be on the menu. The afternoon is free to explore with much on offer. You could stay and see more of San Telmo, which is particularly interesting when the antiques market takes over the cobbled streets. For book lovers, the Ateneo Grand Splendid, set in a converted theatre, is one of the most impressive bookstores in the world.

The evergreen trees and shimmering snowy peaks along the gateway of Patagonia fade, replaced by the endless jade canopy of the tropical rainforest. Settle into the comforts of your luxury hotel, offering your first view of Iguazu Falls from between the lush trees. Your guide greets you in the lobby and escorts you to Iguazu National Park for a closer look at the dramatic scenery. You can hear the echo of thundering water from around the park. The rainforest canopy shades the walkways along the Lower Circuit paths. You take a scenic train to the Upper Circuit, which encompasses 5,750 feet of trails over the rushing waters. The sound of crashing waves grows louder as you traverse the walkways for an unfettered view of the semicircular chain of waterfalls. A rainbow spreads through the mist rising from the Devil’s Throat. From above, you can peer over the narrow gulf into which the majority of the falls feeds from a height of up to 270 feet."

The river forms the natural boundary between Brazil and Argentina and was officially discovered by European explorers in the 16th century. The wooden walkway ends with a view of the staggering waters trundling over the cliffs. The thunderous splash continues to echo throughout the air. The wide mouths along the cliffs give way to the terraced, thinner falls across the viewing platform, providing a view of the interior of the landscape’s natural semicircular design.

Your guide greets you in the lobby and leads you first through the graceful cobbled streets of Recoleta, a barrio known best for the shaded boulevards, boutique shops, and the historical grounds of the eponymous cemetery. A Franciscan convent established the cemetery in the early 18th century and has since been garnished with elaborate mausoleums. The marble and stone fixtures house the remains of some of the most illustrious residents of the city, including Eva Perón, a popular former First Lady of Argentina, better known as Evita. Porteños stroll along the lanes with flowers and cards, honoring their family member’s birthday and day of death.

        "title": "Buenos Aires – Arrive in Gorgeous Buenos Aires with an Introductory Tour",
        "description": "The city of Buenos Aires has an elegant ambiance emanating from the blend of South American spirit and European architecture reminiscent of the tree-lined streets of Paris. The 19th-century facades intersperse high-rise luxury apartments. Also, like Paris, each of the 47 “barrios” of Buenos Aires has a distinct character separate from the rest of the city like an enclave devoted to bohemian art, antiques, or certain cuisine. Your flight arrives at Ministro Pistarini International Airport, where your private transfer greets you upon arrival. The aroma of rich coffee emanates from the cafes fading beneath the buttery scent of pastry dough emanating from the bakeries making savory empanadas. You take some time to settle into the comforts of your elegant hotel in the Recoleta. The barrio has established itself as the center of culture with broad, shady avenues, fashionable boutiques, and an undeniable European ambiance. Your guide meets you at the hotel and escorts you on an introductory tour of Buenos Aires leading you to the city’s civic heart at the Plaza de Mayo. The president’s mansion, known as the Casa Rosada crowns the plaza with 19th-century architectural design and an unforgettable pink hue. The structure was erected over the foundations of the 16th-century Spanish fortress. A museum opened in 1957 displays presidential memorabilia such as sashes, batons, and furniture, as well as excavations of the original fortress. The mansion brings the prestige of the city to the forefront, as well as the history of Argentina from the Spanish Rule to Independence as the long avenues connect with the shopping district of Avenida Florida."

Dancers take center stage on the corners ready to perform for the passing tourists near the crafts market. The aroma of cappuccino emanates from the cafés in Recoleta amidst the shading tilos trees. You venture to a wine-tasting shop in the Abasto, one of the largest shopping centers in the city. The structure originally contained a produce market in the late 19th century but now boasts 174 shops spanning four floors. The quiet boutique winery provides you with eight different glasses of wine from across Argentina’s diverse regions for an introduction to the variety of flavors Argentina produces. You reach a sample of the Torrontes, an aromatic white wine providing fragrant scents of rose petals giving way to flavors of white peach and lemon zest. The sweet aroma and dry body derive from the high elevation of the vines located around Salta. In the evening, your dining experience introduces you to the variety of flavors for which Argentina is known, from the deep and hardy barbecue to flaky savory empanadas. By the end of dinner, your attentive guide through the meal teaches you the proper way to brew the Argentine drink, made by measuring half-ounce portions of loose leaf tea, using cool water to preserve the nutrients, and steeping the tea in hot—not boiling—water for up to four minutes until the herbal aroma becomes potent."

The café sits on the old stage overlooking the rows of printed books revealing a serene ambiance in which locals read, study, or sip a rich coffee. Your private transfer greets you at the hotel after breakfast and escorts you to Ministro Pistarini International Airport for your flight to Mendoza. The city has a similar atmosphere to Buenos Aires due to the wide avenues shaded by tall, lush trees. The cafes provide a cosmopolitan ambiance with outdoor seating and indulgent aromas. Tranquil fountains trickle and splash in the plazas and the scent of chocolate drifts out of the various chocolateries. You have a private escort from Governor Francisco Gabrielli International Airport to your charming hotel overlooking the grandeur of the Andes to the west beyond the chocolate hue of the pampas. The region is essentially desert, but the lush trees, vibrant gardens, bustling shops, and nearby vineyards juxtapose the desert landscape due to the plentiful irrigation ditches crisscrossing the region carrying meltwater and rainwater from the Andes. Your guide leads you across the city before arriving at Cerro de la Gloria, a small hill crowned by a statue dedicated to the Army of the Andes. The statue commemorates the forces amassed to fight for independence against the Spanish in the 19th century as armies cross the rugged Andean summits as led by General José de San Martin."

You stop at a vineyard opened in 1998 and committed to the development of quality wines in the region rooted in the authenticity of the cultivation process. The vineyard's dedication to keeping the tradition alive resulted in a blend of New World flavors with Old World techniques. You stroll through the vineyards noticing heat of the desert landscape taking shape. The aroma of dry soil drifts upwards from beneath the vines. Your guide explains how the roots help create balanced flavors by absorbing the minerals from the soil. The staff prunes and thins the bushels for optimal sunlight and moisture without adding any artificial substances. In the tasting room, your guide pours a sample of the Malbec.

        "description": "The traditions of local wineries around Mendoza often follow the European traditions brought over by immigrants from Spain, France, or Italy during the 19th and 20th centuries, who also carried the vines from their home regions. While traveling through the heart of the Maipu region less than nine miles outside of Mendoza’s city center, the relaxed ambiance is immediately apparent. The trees shading the wide avenues provide a sleepy quality between the vineyards. The first winery you visit maintains the tradition connecting the terroir with the body, as staff toil the soil and trim the bushes across the vineyards sampling quality at every step. Oak barrels hide in the cool air of the subterranean cellar as the wine ages. The slight changes in temperature allow the wine to absorb some of the natural flavors from the barrel by expanding and contracting against the wood. The tasting room also has a cool temperature contrasting the mid-morning heat spreading over the vineyard outside. Your guide pours a sample of the Bonarda. The grapes originated from Savoie, France and have a deep ruby hue. You find the fruity aroma of black cherry, plum, and allspice with hints of tobacco leaf. The lightly smoky flavor contains a touch of sweet figs and chocolate with juicy acidity and smooth finish. The grape delivers lower tannins and more acidity than Malbec, perfect for fans of wines with less oaky qualities."

Your guide greets you at the hotel and escorts you into the untamed landscapes traveling along the Pan American Highway connecting Argentina to Chile through the Andean Foothills. The urban charms of Mendoza and the lush greenery of the vineyards quickly fade to the rugged seclusion of the desert scenery spreading to the dramatic rising foothills of the Andes. The white-capped peaks of the mountains on the horizon reflect the distance and immensity of the longest mountain range in the world. You stop in the charming village of Uspallata. The tranquil scenery once used as a stand-in for the highlands of Central Asia for the film Seven Years in Tibet starring Brad Pitt. On the outskirts of the village stand remarkable 18th-century beehive structures erected by Jesuits. The complex originally was constructed to process minerals from the nearby San Lorenzo mines but was also used as offices and storage facilities during the War of Independence. The climax of the tour takes you to a prime lookout atop Aconcagua, the tallest mountain in the Americas at nearly 22,850 feet above sea level."

You venture away from Mendoza to reach a quiet village known for its tree-lined streets, lush rows of vineyards, and stunning views of the Andes. Your guide meets you at a small shop in the heart of town before you set out through the countryside on the paved and unpaved roads along the outskirts of Mendoza. The scent of dried soil blends with the herbaceous scent of the trees. You can travel through the vineyard with a guide and taste the struggling grapes, which helps fortify the flavors from the mineral-rich soil. Like many of the vineyards you’ve visited in Mendoza, the winery focuses on traditional methods for production including handpicking the grapes. The bushels are stored in cold or low-temperature rooms depending on the heat of the soil to help keep the conditions optimal for avoiding oxidation. They store the barrels in a cellar without losing the natural humidity before storing the wines in a temperature-controlled room holding up to 400,000 bottles. Sample a varietal consisting of over 60 percent Malbec and nearly 40 percent Cabernet Sauvignon for a distinct combination of French oak and licorice aromas with soft tannins, in addition to a velvety texture."

Upon reaching Cafayate, you notice the small-town feel supported by the mixture of colonial and baroque architecture from the 19th century.

Once in Jujuy, you find a charming city home to the largest population of indigenous peoples out of any in Argentina. Spanish settlers founded the city in 1593 retaining solidarity with its indigenous citizens or communities known for existing on the margins. The cathedral was erected in the 18th century and features a shimmering baroque pulpit laminated in gold.

After breakfast, your guide will lead you back to the La Boca neighborhood to visit the renowned Bombonera stadium, home of the Boca Juniors football club. The stands shine blue and yellow as they look down on the pristine field, representing one of the world’s most emblematic stadiums. During a game, the cheers and songs from the crowd can spill out of the arena and onto the streets of the neighborhood, known for the cheering effect nicknamed “the twelfth man,” which turns the unique design into an unforgettable visceral experience. A mural by Quinqueal Martin depicts the team’s founders selecting the club’s distinctive colors. Inside the Boca Juniors Museum, you can trace the history and connection of the club to greater Argentina, representing one of the country’s most important teams. The collection of trophies may glint under the room’s lighting demonstrating the deeply rooted love of the sport with the neighborhood, city, and country dating back to the club’s founding in 1905. The kids may also see the large mural of Diego Maradona, one of the team’s most notable alumni featured in the hall of fame."

Today, you step away from the city once again, this time venturing to the traditional town of San Antonio de Areco, located approximately 72 miles northwest of Buenos Aires. Lush farmlands encircle the pleasant town. The peaceful atmosphere and historic, colonial streets welcome the family with open arms. The 18th-century allures remain, not just in the preserved culture of the Spanish descendants born in the New World, but in the traditions of the Gauchos. Artisans craft saddles and forge exceptional silverwork. Cowboys from all over the region promenade their horses down the cobbled streets during the November festival. Puente Viejo, the Old Bridge, was erected in the 19th century across the Rio Areco forming the pathway to the north. The parish church decorates the edge of the historic Plaza Ruis de Arellano. A barbecue provides the scent of slowly cooking meat sweeping across the fields. You may find your kids playing soccer in the open green spaces with local children calling out their favorite player from the World Cup team between marveling at the horses and cowboys."

The town of Puerto Iguazu sits on the confluence of the Rivers Paran and Iguazu. The family notices the remarkable contrast in the city, no longer feeling like Argentina, and instead emerging a more exotic and tropical atmosphere. The town borders both Brazil and Paraguay. Your private transfer meets you at the airport and, after a brief visit to the hotel, leads you across the border of Brazil to visit the panoramic view of the Cataratas do Iguacu, also known as Iguazu Falls. The national park is more than 450,000 cars in size and was listed as a Unesco heritage site in the 1980s. The Brazilian side of the park offers you a panoramic view of the falls, taking in the mystic qualities and unparalleled natural power of the 8,858-foot wide semicircle. You can hear the power of the falls in the epic roar of the water crashing against the rocks and river cascading more than 236 feet. Rainbows form in the mist making the kids as excited as when they first set eyes on the natural beauty of the falls."

At breakfast, the kids open up fresh pineapple and mango. You sip on decadent organic coffee farmed and processed in Argentina and Brazil. After breakfast, your guide takes you to the Argentine side of Iguazu Falls, inside Iguazu National Park. The park encompasses 212 square miles of protected land and was established in 1934. Although the park showcases the grandeur of the same falls, the difference between the Brazilian and Argentinian parks are like night and day. Trails and walkways wind through lush trees, both above and alongside the Iguazu and Parana Rivers. Butterflies linger on leaves. Some walkways lead closer to the falls offering the family a view of the cascade and the river below. At that moment, the mist swells upwards and coats the family in fresh water as if you had all jumped into the river. The kids laugh uncontrollably as their shirts stick to their skin."

An animal hospital and rehabilitation center near the edges of the forest help endangered species and injured animals return to full health. You can often hear the monkeys howling at first light and the macaws twittering. After breakfast, your private transfer greets the family at the hotel and escorts you to the Ministro Pistarini International Airport for your flight home.

        "description": "Mendoza has become a panorama of Argentina’s wine country displaying the dynamic flavors and distinct characteristics of an entire region along the shady streets and charming café-culture the city proudly cultivates. Your flight lands at Governor Francisco Gabrielli International Airport, where your private transfer greets you upon arrival. The sunlight betrays the region’s dry climate juxtaposed by the crisscrossing network of irrigation channels bordering the wide streets. Fountains trickle at the heart of the public plazas and students relax on the lush grasses of the Parque General San Martin at the edges of the glistening lake. After settling into the comforts of your luxurious hotel at the heart of the city, the remaining day is yours to explore the relaxed pace and quiet charms of a city only 600 miles away from Buenos Aires but encompassing an entirely different world. The best introduction to Mendoza’s obsession with flavorful treats revolves around a tasting at an artisanal chocolate factory. Your guide walks you through the facilities amidst the aroma of confectionary sugar and caramel. The family-owned business gives you access to their secret recipes as they produce some of the city’s favorite desserts, from buttery alfajores cookies to the rich flavors of hand-rolled dark chocolate truffles.

        "description": "In the morning, the cafes set out tables along the plazas and wide sidewalks offer a space for locals to enjoy their breakfast while watching the city pass by. The scent of dark-roast coffee spills out of the café doors carrying familiar hints of caramel reminding you of the chocolate tour from the previous day. After breakfast, your guide greets you at the hotel eager to introduce you to the fascinating world of wines produced within the Primera Zona , the area in which the main grapes of Argentine wine are produced. The majority of Argentine wines produced remained in the country until 2001 when the plunging peso caused producers to open to the global market resulting in Argentina becoming one of the top wine-producing countries in the world. You stop at a family-run winery devoted to crafting divine wines from the iconic grape of Argentina, Malbec. The different wines produced on the property showcase the variety of flavors the grape can contain, from smoky to fruity, as well a great range of hues spreading from the opaque to a deep purple. The dry soil, warm days, cold nights, and pure waters provide a natural environment in which the grape thrives. You run your fingers along the tender, plump grapes noticing the thick skin caused by the harsher conditions forcing the crop to fortify its flavor. You touch the sandy surface of the soil, notice the drip irrigation system, and even sample one of the grapes and taste the sweet juice. In the tasting room, you see hints of blackberry emanating from the glass. A black pepper spice lingers on your palate with touches of dark berries that balances the intense finish."

        "description": "The Andean foothills become a lingering presence on the outskirts of Mendoza. The snowcapped peaks drip with melted snow bringing ample water to the city and surrounding vineyards contrasting the dull arid landscapes with bright, verdant vines. At breakfast, you have your choice of international cuisine but enjoy dining like the locals, choosing to sip a frothy cappuccino accompanied by the buttery, flaky crust of a media luna , a croissant-like pastry. You make your way to the Uco Valley where lush vines spread across the vale and along the foothills. You visit a winery blending old traditions with contemporary ideas on an estancia first established in the 17th century. Trout swim in the large pond supporting an active trout farm and orchards grow across the harmonious landscape. The combination of soils, irrigation systems sourcing the pristine mountain water, and high elevation create the distinct characteristics of the wines produced in the area, amounting to great success with Semillon, Bonarda, and Barbera grapes. Your guide pours a sample of the Chardonnay. The clean golden yellow hue glistens in the glass. Layers of tropical fruit aromas and honey drift out of the glass. You find flavors of pineapple and citrus fruit in the full-bodied, balanced wine with a long and smooth finish. In the evening, you visit a restaurant highlighting the influence of European culture on the local cuisine during a six-course tasting menu. Instead of focusing on the regional dishes of the European influence, the chef takes care by showcasing the wines and pairings of the Uco Valley, beginning with your first course of baked brie with a Malbec sauce. You bask in a view of the Andes as the sun sets behind the undulating peaks. The meltingly creamy cheese coats your tongue allowing the sweet flavors of the dark fruits to permeate the glaze."

The terrain forms the longest mountain range in the world reaching 4,500 miles across the South American continent-crossing through seven countries. Your guide offers you a gourd of mate, the favorite tea of Argentina. The high caffeine content adds to the herbaceous flavor best revealed when steeped for up to five minutes in hot water. The beauty and untamed drama of the Andes are quickly visible as you exit the city and reach the base of the soaring foothills at the Cordon del Plata range nearly 50 miles west of Mendoza. You step up the rocky terrain gripping tight to your walking poles. Pebbles and sand shift beneath your walking shoes as you labor towards the peak of Mount Lomas Blancas at 11,975 feet above sea level, the tallest summit of the range. The panoramic view from the top of the peak spreads across the valley and over the surrounding crests. A make-shift cross left by climbers blesses the space, the view, and those who never made it to the point. You take a deep breath in the thin air and enjoy the peaceful moment in the breeze with the sporadic patches of clouds rolling over the foothills below."

You fly from Mendoza to Salta and arrive at Marine Miguel de Güemes International Airport. Your private transfer escorts you through the city on a brief but immersive tour of the cobblestone streets, plazas brimming with cafes, and vibrant folk music scene. The Museo de Arqueologia de Alta Montaña has exhibits focusing on Inca culture and the child sacrifices left on the Andean peaks. Iglesia San Francisco glows with an exuberant yellow and magenta façade hiding while the Museo de Arte Étnico Americano highlights the historic and contemporary artwork of Andean culture juxtaposing archeological finds with contemporary Latin American art galleries. Before leaving the city, you stop at a restaurant considered an empanada mega-market to sample what many consider the best empanadas in Argentina. Vendors line the walls and hustle for your attention, calling you over with vibrant colors, enthusiastic waves, or the promise of a sample. Residents and visitors to Salta sit on the patio enjoying their giant portions of a variety of empanadas while sipping Torrontes wine in the warm mid-morning light. You order a traditional carne empanada and bite into the crunchy, flaky exterior revealing a savory filling of ground beef, onions, and potato. You continue towards Cafayate enjoying the view nestled between the striated cliffs of the nearly vertical walls of Shell Gorge or Quebrada del Rio de las Conchas . The bright orange hues shimmer against the bright light around the rock formation known as the Amphitheater. An ancient waterfall carved and smoothed the rock in the landscape now void of free-flowing water. The walls carry your voice around towering rock formation accounting for its name."

You travel to a bodega located on a mountain slope offering spectacular views over the town. The family-owned winery has created an impressive facility. Trees on the property provide plenty of nuts during harvest time and goats roaming the landscape offer milk from which the family makes delicious cheese. An organic garden produces ample vegetables and greens like spinach, and the vineyard not only helps produce the wine but also provides the family with an abundance of raisins. During the harvest, workers handpick the bushels before aging the wine in French oak barrels. The cellar fills with the aroma of old oak in the cool, climate-controlled room. Your guide pours a sample of the famous regional white grape of Torrontes. The harsh conditions of the region cause the grape’s skin to thicken resulting in a fortified flavor. The white wine rests in unoaked barrels resulting in an aroma of jasmine and rose petals. The white pepper lingers on the palate from the tannins rounding out the flavor of soft citrus fruits."

Beyond the wine, the estate possesses the James Turrell Museum as part of the Hess Art Collection. The gallery opened in 2009 featuring the contemporary artist’s ability to bend light and space. Nine outfitted rooms include the largest “skyspace” exhibit in the world situated in the inner courtyard.

You set out with one of the gauchos on an early horseback ride through the pampas noticing how the cowboy’s horse responds to his relaxed body language. You ride a Peruvian horse, which is known for its easy, smooth gait absent from the bounce indicative of riding horses, even at a trot. Upon returning to the ranch, your guide takes you north to tour the world’s highest vineyards located at 10,000 feet above sea level. The vines at altitude grow mainly Torrontes and Malbec. The cold air keeps the grapes struggling for survival accounting for their stronger flavor. When your guide pours a sample of the Torrontes and Riesling blend, you notice hints of citrus with flavors of lemon sorbet and honeysuckle. Malbec has an aroma of strawberry, ripe raspberries, and white pepper giving way to a bouquet of vanilla with smoked bacon and Indian spice."

Your private transfer greets you at Ministro Pistarini International Airport upon your arrival in the city.

Tables stand on the former stage and books wrap around the upper balconies. Various antique shops fill the streets of Defensa in the historic neighborhood of San Telmo. Window displays create a Bohemian ambiance, depicting vintage clothing and hand carved tables and chairs. People stroll along Plaza de Mayo, the central square bordered by the pink façade of the Presidential Mansion, referred to locally as the Casa Rosada. The structure was erected in the 19th century, but the plaza was founded in the 16th century, making it one of the oldest squares in the city.

The region is known as the “Switzerland of the Americas” due to his alpine ambiance. Bariloche maintains a remarkably European quality commensurate with the German and Swiss émigrés after World War II. The scent of German chocolate drifts out of the celebrated chocolaterie of Rapanui and onto the cobblestone streets. The shop was opened in 1939 and continues its rich tradition of producing European-style sweets. Exceptional mountain peaks encircle the town, rising more than 6,561 feet above sea level and creating a picturesque skyline from any angle. During winter, the slopes transform into a wonderland. In summer, trails for trekking, mountain biking, and horseback riding take precedence. Local hardwood and unique honey-hued stone are the foundations of the main structures inside the town center."

After breakfast, your guide meets you at your luxurious hotel and escorts you to the banks of Lake Nahuel Huapi. The water surface encompasses more than 250 square miles and reaches a depth of 1,489 feet. Lenga forests line the shores. Spindly red flowers glow against the lush leaves.

You have your first view of Cerro Tronador, a mountaintop rising 11,660 feet above sea level. Wild horses graze on the open prairies. Chucao tapaculo, an indigenous bird with a bright orange breast and orange streaks around its eyes nests in the trees. Tronador is an extinct volcano with an impressive outcropping of stone breaking through the snow. Your guide explains the natural history of the region as you journey to Ventisquero Negro. The summit of Tronador disappears behind the foothills. In its place, you see the 328 feet of ice rising above the black frame. The radiant white ice above the black crags of the glacier creates an enticing contrast. The dark coloration of the ice stems from a history of sediment picked up by the glacial movement, fed by the Rio Manso Glacier above. Chunks of ice sporadically break away from the ice wall. The rumble echoes through the mountain pass, which is why the towering summit of Cerro Tronador is named “Mount Thunder.” The sound reaches you after the ice has already calved. You catch the remaining moments of the pieces of glacier falling before splashing into the lake."

As the day passes, you can see the clouds drift over the summit of Mount Fitz Roy, which was once regarded as the “Peak of Fire,” by the local Tehuelche when they first settled the land. Trails lead from the edges of town and wind through the marvelous hillsides reaching ice fields, glaciers, lakes, and the mountain bases. Gray foxes hide in the grassy clearing, searching for prey. Black-face ibis linger on marshy shores. The wonderful world of Patagonia comes to life along the borders of the secluded alpine village."

Lenga trees, a type of beech tree, sprout into forests, which was once an ancient seabed. Green parrots call to one another in the canopy. You arrive at the viewpoint facing the De las Vueltas River. You can hear the water rushing over the riverbed. The scenery opens to a view of Mount Fitz Roy Peak standing 11,171 feet above sea level. The summit even towers over the surrounding mountains. You can walk along the gravel shores of the lagoon and dip your toes into the water. The lake is cold, formed by glaciers and sustained by melting snow.

You reach the lookout and find an incredible view of the icy spires reaching out of Cerro Torre at 10,262 feet above sea level. Snow carpets the rugged boulders and lunar landscape along the base of the mountain. In the sunlight, the ice crystals glisten against the rosy hue of Cerro Torre’s rock face. If you choose to continue to Laguna Torre, you follow your guide along the shores of the Fitz Roy River. The water cascades down the hillside, and you soon reach the glacial lake of Laguna Torre. On the northern shore of the lagoon, you have an unparalleled view of Cerro Torre’s spire. What was once an unclimbable peak was conquered in 1959. Along the water’s edge, you can look up to see the ice clinging to the tips of the tower-like frame of the peak, which climbs above the sweeping ice field of the Torre Glacier."

You can hear the tumult of water emanating from a nearby waterfall. The waters of the De las Vueltas River become more transparent as you get closer to the lake. A more intermediate trail opens up to a breathtaking view of the Torre Mountains and a glacier that almost reaches the edges of the water. In the skyline, you find the familiar image of Mount Fitz Roy once again. The rock face is inescapable and is always thrilling to find. The lake had been the site of a land dispute between Chile and Argentina for decades but was resolved in 1999.
