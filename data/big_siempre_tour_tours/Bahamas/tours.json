After some kayaking instruction, we will pack our kayaks and get ready to start paddling. Once launched we will kayak towards the Brigantine Cays. These mostly uninhabited Cays are surrounded by very shallow sandy areas which dry out at low tide. This makes it a great place for exploring by kayak as most boats cannot access this shallow area. Our destination for tonight is either Long Cay or Brigantine Cay. Once there we will set up camp, snorkel and relax."

If the tides are right we will paddle through some of these incredibly important and diverse ecosystems which are often nursery habitat for all sorts of fish species, small sharks, sea turtles and many different types of birds. Our destination for this evening is either Norman’s Pond Cay (apx 7 miles) or Leaf Cay (apx 9 miles)."

These iguanas are friendly and curious and really quite interesting to watch. Tonight we will either camp in the same spot again or, depending on the group desires and weather, move campsites."

Along the way we will stop at an absolutely picture perfect beach for a stretch break as this is also the trail head for a short walk to the highest point in the Exuma Cays (123ft or 37m). From here we enjoy a great view out over the Southern Exuma Cays and usually a nice cooling breeze. We will arrive at camp in time for snorkelling or lounging on the beach with a book."

        "description": "Today we will likely keep our camp on Rat Cay and use it as a base for exploring several of the nearby Cays. If tides and weather permit we will head to Square Rock Cay and try some snorkelling from our kayaks or a nearby beach. Then to Boysie Cay to check out a blow-hole and watch the power of the ocean on the exposed side of this perfect little piece of sand. The afternoon will be leisurely enjoying more snorkelling here or a nap on the beach. Then back to our campsite on Rat Cay for our final evening in the cays."

        "description": "After breakfast we will pack up our kayaks one last time and paddle from Rat Cay back to Barraterre on Great Exuma Island. Here we will be met by our transportation and will transfer back to George Town to the hotel of your choice. This brings the tour to an official close. Often groups like to share one last meal and few cold drinks together to celebrate the completion of an excellent trip at one of the local restaurants. Most flights leave in the morning or afternoon so it is likely you will need to spend this evening in George Town anyway, so why not spend it with new friends? Meals (other than breakfast and lunch) and accommodation this day are NOT included in the tour price. Airport transfers are not included in the tour cost, but can be easily arranged with your hotel."
