The fortress towers above the sea along the edges of snowy coastline, and the facades of colorful homes will reflect in the light beneath the delightful image of snow-covered rooftops. Visiting Norway in winter and the beginning of spring opens the whimsical world of Frozen with sheets of snow and ice that transform the charming city and surrounding landscape into a winter wonderland. Here, every day holds cool, crisp air and the aromas of cinnamon, cardamom, and pine to make you feel as though you could run into Elsa around every corner. Your private transfer will meet your family at the airport and escort to your luxurious accommodation in the heart of the city. Once you have arrived and checked in, you can settle into the comforts and pace of Oslo before meeting your guide for a private introduction to the history, culture, and marvels of Oslo.

Once inside the museum, you can view the captivating Oseberg Viking Ship, which is an actual ship that dates back to the 9th century. You also have the option of adding a private glassmaking workshop, during which, your instructor and experienced glassblowing artisan will teach your family how to craft an intricate and unique souvenir to take home with you. The heat in the room will drift from the kiln with an orange glow as your instructor demonstrates how to shape the molten glass into a snowflake. Each curve, twist, and turn will be different for every member of your family, which will allow everyone to feel as though they have Elsa’s magic for creating snow."

You will travel into the heart of the fjord on a RIB boat, which will provide you with an up-close look at the small villages and stunning waterfalls that break through the frozen landscape in the springtime. The journey will resemble the intrigue that you felt when watching Anna and Olaf paddle down a canyon during the trailer for Frozen 2 . Furthermore, you will hear the waterfalls as they cascade down the steep slopes with enough force to break and melt the surrounding ice. You can search for eagles in the sky or otters that habitually cruise through the fjord in search of fish. You will then stop at a village that overlooks the glassy inlet, where you will meet with a local grocer to learn more about life in the remote corner of Norway.

The cozy and casual ambiance will welcome you into the market with a sample of the local goat cheese that is known as “Undredalsosten.” The surrounding village dates back to the 12th century and stems from the foundations of the Undredal Stave Church. The shop acts as a central, social gathering space that plays a large role in the daily lives of the villagers."
