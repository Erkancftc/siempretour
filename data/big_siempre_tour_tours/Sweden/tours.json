    "generalInfo": "The remote Saint Anna Archipelago on the East Coast of Sweden is heaven for kayakers. Nowhere in Europe can you find 6000 islands so closely clustered together - a maze from the forested sheltered islands close to the mainland out to the barren islets bordering the open sea. You are free to paddle and wild camp wherever you like! <br/><br/>This is a self-guided long weekend and you decide your own route. All top-notch equipment is provided along with a detailed guide book, and 24/7 support while kayaking. Your pre-ordered groceries are packed when you arrive, and after a briefing on safety, navigation and the area, you're ready to hit the water!<br/><br/>Saint Anna boasts one of Sweden's highest number of sunny days with some of the warmest temperatures in the sea. Almost all the islands are uninhabited, but the area also has a rich history of people living their whole lives out here. It’s completely your choice what to explore – visit cultural points of interest,  do all wilderness, or more likely, a blend of both!<br/><br/>One suggested itinerary would take you to Kupa Klint, the famous lookout with a spectacular view of the hundreds of islets below. Harstena, the idyllic village seemingly frozen in time, is a great place to stroll, enjoy traditional archipelago cuisine at the restaurant or heavenly cinnamon swirls from the bakery. <br/><br/>Along the way you’ll pass fantastic bird sanctuaries. As many as thirty-five coastal species breed here, including White-tailed eagles, Ospreys, Arctic skuas, Razorbills and Guillemots. There are regular sightings of Grey seals bobbing their heads above the water while hunting for fish. It's all up to you how relaxed or hard you make your route, and daily weather reports from the base help you plan your itinerary.<br/><br/>A perfect tour for beginners or experienced sea kayakers alike!",

We'll do a briefing on navigation, safety and the area, and go through a rough plan for your expedition. You'll repack your clothes into drybags and load the kayaks. Using our top-of-the-line equipment is a real treat! It can be hard to justify purchasing gear of that caliber on your own! Our launch site is situated in a sheltered bay – soon you round the first islands and see a maze of islands spreading out in all directions. During your paddle northeast towards Aspöja you’ll pass through many clusters of forested islands and islets. A variety of different ducks, as well as swans and Grey herons breed around here, and White-tailed eagles are sighted regularly since they nest in large trees nearby. Continue paddling through the Uggelholmarna Nature Reserve, a great spot for a break. Three hundred year-old pine and linden trees grow here, and the open forest is perfect for a short wander. Aim east towards the narrow inlet between Lammskär and Kalvskär - you'll end up surrounded by a beautiful and sheltered atoll formation of islands. Sunset views here are amazing!"

This crescent-shaped smooth islet is surrounded by shallow waters, and is superb for swimming and even snorkelling! Another absolutely stunning route goes through a massive cluster of hundreds of barren islets close to the open sea. This is the most finely-chiselled archipelago that exists in Sweden, and the paddle is so beautiful with the blue horizon as your backdrop. You may spot Ospreys, Great Cormorants and Arctic skuas along with many other types of birds. Grey seal sightings are frequent around Norrbådarna and Ådskär. Continue towards one of the most famous points of interest in Saint Anna - the old navigation mark Kupa Klint. It’s a fantastic lookout with spectacular views of the archipelago spreading out below. Inside the outer band of skerries you find the large island Missjö with its parallel islands. There is a rustic pub on Missjö run by local boat taxi man and sea dog Mats. He's often there to host and tell stories and it's a very fun time indeed!"

Learn more about the history of the village at the museum in the old school, munch on delicious cinnamon swirls from the bakery and treat yourself to a meal of delicious archipelago cuisine at the water-side restaurant. A short paddle west takes you to Torrön and its mosaic of surrounding islets. It’s a very beautiful sheltered area with shallow waters, smooth rocks and calm creeks – great for swimming and sunbathing. Make sure to look down as you glide through the myriad of skerries to view the bladder wrack forests on the rocky bottoms."

Cook up a hearty breakfast in preparation for a somewhat strenuous paddle ahead. Head north across some pretty exposed waters until you reach the pretty narrow passage between Missjö and its inner parallel island. A quick paddle west and you reach the bustling mainland hub Tyrislöt. Take some extra time here to visit the Archipelago Museum and stroll the nature trail. Down a couple of cold lagers among the cherry trees outside the countryside pub. A great way to end your weekend of wilderness and archipelago culture! A pad on the back is in order, you just completed an impressive kayaking expedition all by yourselves in a truly wild coastal landscape!"

It’s an ideal area for our first steps on touring skis with small variations in altitude and actual tracks to follow. We filled our thermoses with coffee and tea this morning, packed some firewood, and find somewhere along the tracks to grill sandwiches on the fire along with a warming cup of soup. Down in the valley after our skiing trip, we take a stroll around the Ribbåsen “Fäbodar”. They are small log houses, where farmers used to bring their cattle for grazing. Farmhands would stay in these little cottages all summer long, and most of them date back to the 1700s. A whole culture emerged from this way of life with cooking traditions, superstitions and folk music. This region is famous for these idyllic settings and their cultural heritage."

In truth, it’s not really classified as such, but rather a fell with a high enough altitude to lack trees, the highest point is 764 m.a.s.l. Our journey towards the peak offers some steeper inclines, but mostly quite flat terrain over frozen mires. Mother nature offers up many types of snow. Maybe the crust is hard enough to tread on top, maybe the snow is powdery and deep. Perhaps the wind has created beautiful ripples across the snowy expanses. Either way, our touring skis are perfect for moving slowly through this amazing white landscape. Along the way we’ll pass low lonely trees completely covered in snow. They create fantasmic shapes and forms often depicted in photographs from this wild and unique nature reserve. Once at the top we enjoy soup pre-prepared by our wilderness chef at the log shelter. If the weather is clear, we get a beautiful view of the Transtrand and Fulufjället mountains to the west."

A 2-night expedition up the Fulufjället mountain plateau, close to the Norwegian border. The skis have built-in 'skins' which give them a good grip when going uphill. After the initial ascent, we'll spend a couple of hours skiing across the vast alpine plateau. These are true alpine conditions, white as far as the eye can see, no trees, and an amazing vista of the lowlands spreading out below. By late afternoon it’s time to set up camp, cook dinner and simply enjoy this amazing place. The solitude up here and the sounds of the wind sweeping across the plains are hard to describe in words. You’ll spend the night either in a tent, or if you’re keen, a bivouac of your own making. Each group member will pull a small sled with all the gear needed to comfortably stay for two nights outdoors in subzero temperatures. The next morning we'll leave our camp behind and head off on a day trip. We may ski to the “altar ring”, an ancient monument that’s considered Sweden’s highest altar of worship. It was likely built by the Sámi, who have inhabited this area for thousands of years. Darkness falls early this time of year, and we’ll be back at camp by the afternoon. We’ll spend the evening together in a yurt, where we can all hang out, cook dinner, and do some wood carving, protected from the elements. One of the many amazing properties of snow is that you can dig and form your own structures. By digging a canal for your legs, voilà, we got ourselves a couch and a table! Light up some lanterns and candles, put down some sheep skins and we have a cosy living room on the snowy wind-swept plateau. We’ll take our time descending to the valley, downhill is indeed the trickier part of tour skiing. It's then a 2 hour drive back to the base cabin at lake Navar. Exhausted but full of a feeling of accomplishment, we enjoy a final dinner and a last sauna together."
