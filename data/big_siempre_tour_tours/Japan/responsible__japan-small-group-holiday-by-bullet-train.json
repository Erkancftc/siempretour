  "generalInfo": "This Small Group Tour combines the famous cultural sights of Japan with the staggering natural beauty of its mountainous region. You'll visit the “golden route”: Tokyo, Kyoto and Hakone, but also spend four days in and around the beautiful Japan Alps – including Kamikochi National Park, a place we think is a contender for one of the most stunning on Earth. <br/>With our Insider guide connections and know-how, you can see the best of Japan's ancient culture, modern-day cities, and stunning nature all in a two-week trip.<br/><br/>•Tokyo – Begin in the electric capital, using historic Asakusa as your base. Explore modern districts, ancient temples, and old Edo charm. <br/>•Hakone – Cruise Lake Ashi on a pirate ship with Mount Fuji on the horizon, and try eggs boiled in volcanic hot springs. <br/>•Kyoto – Share tea with a maiko (trainee geisha) in a rare, Insider-only cultural encounter. <br/>•Osaka – Feast on street-food favourites like okonomiyaki, takoyaki, and kushikatsu. Optional day trip to Nara and its friendly deer. <br/>•Takayama, Japan Alps – Wander an extensive preserved merchant district, sample local sake, and discover master woodcarving traditions in this mountain-shielded historic town. <br/>•Kamikochi – Hike one of the most beautiful alpine valleys on Earth, with snow-capped peaks, glacial rivers, macaque monkeys, and fresh mountain air. Stay in nearby Hirayu Onsen for outdoor hot-spring views. <br/>Two nights at every stop means you can truly soak in each destination without rushing. By the end, your idea of “Classic Japan” may be forever changed. <br/> <br/>Dietary requirements <br/>We can cater for vegetarian diets on all of our Small Group Tours. Vegan diets can usually be accommodated, though options may be more limited on certain itineraries—particularly in remote areas where meals are provided by local accommodations. In these cases, vegan travellers should expect simpler meals than the standard offering, but we’ll always do our best to make it work. <br/>",
