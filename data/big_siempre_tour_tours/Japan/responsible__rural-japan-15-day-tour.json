      "description": "Zazen Meditation - Gesshin-in is a sub-temple Kodai-ji which is located North East of Yasaka Hokanji Temple at the foot of beautiful Higashiyama Mountains in the east of the city.

      "description": "Exploring Miyajima - Today you will have a free day to explore Miyajima Island. Miyajima is famous for its floating torii gate at Itsukushima Shrine, which is ranked as one of Japan's Top Three Sights and is a UNESCO World Heritage site. The other main highlight is the view from the top of Mount Misen, which can be hiked or reached by cable car. Hiking up the 500 m peak takes 1.5 to 2 hours, and at the summit you’re rewarded with sweeping views of the island-dotted Seto Inland Sea and the coastline of Hiroshima Bay. You may even encounter some of the native monkey population! You may also like to hire bikes to get around. These are available to rent from 8am to 5pm at the JR ferry pier (last checkout is 3pm) costing 1,050 yen for the entire day. The island has excellent cycle paths and the coastal routes are fairly flat. On the northeast coast lies Tsutsumigaura, a 1 km long white-sand beach lined with pine trees."

      "description": "Transfer to Matsumaya - Matsuyama is a charming castle town in Ehime Prefecture which is most famous for its hot spring area, Dogo Onsen. Dogo Onsen is the oldest hot spring in Japan and is even mentioned in the oldest book of Japanese classical history, Nihon Shoki. The top of the main hot spring building is decorated with the legendary white heron and a large drum is beaten at 6:30 every morning to announce the bath opening. You can enjoy a bath with the locals or just dip your feet in the outdoor footbath to take away those aches and pains after a long day sightseeing. Matsuyama's samurai castle is also impressive and gives great views of the town. You’ll stay one night at ANA Hotel Matsuyama (breakfast included), a four-star hotel close to Matsuyama Castle."

      "description": "Transfer to Takamatsu - Takamatsu is the largest city in Kagawa Prefecture in the northeast corner of Shikoku Island. Takamatsu faces the Inland Sea and has a long history as a port, acting as something of a link between Shikoku and the main island of Honshu. The city's top attraction is Ritsurin Koen, one of Japan's finest examples of a landscape garden and considered by many to be on a par with the famous 'Big Three' gardens of Mito, Okayama and Kanazawa. Also of interest are Yashima, a flat-topped mountain and nearby Shikoku-Mura, a collection of traditional houses and other buildings brought from all over Shikoku to display local architecture and construction techniques."

      "description": "Ferry to Naoshima Island - Naoshima could easily be another pretty, but forgotten island in the Seto Inland Sea scraping a living from fishing. However a unique art project has given Naoshima its deserved global reputation. Naoshima is home to a large collection of contemporary art galleries, exhibits and installations which offer a tour de force of architectural expression integrating art and the natural environment. Two of the main galleries, the Chichu Art Museum and Benesse House, were designed by the world famous architect Tadao Ando and feature works by Claude Monet, Walter de Maria, James Turrell, Andy Warhol, Richard Long and Bruce Nauman among others. Distances between the main art sites are small and the picturesque island can be explored on foot or by bike. Bicycles are available to hire at Miyanoura Port."

      "description": "Driving the Iya Valley - Today you will collect your rental car in Takamatsu and drive to the Iya Valley. We recommend taking Route 32 which will see you drive along the length of the Iya Valley. This road is not for the faint of heart though, as it is mostly one lane, very twisty, and often on the side of steep cliffs, though the scenery is breathtaking and the gorge here is almost completely undeveloped. You’ll stay at the Iya Onsen Hotel, which has its own natural hot-spring baths that you can reach via a scenic ride in a private cable car."

      "description": "Exploring Iya Valley - Today you have a free day to explore Shikoku’s Iya Valley at your own pace. Making the most of your rental car you'll be able to explore all the dramatic mountain scenery, historic vine bridges, hot springs and thatched-roof villages across this beautiful region. Most visitors only get to Kazurabashi vine bridge, while the other bridges are much quieter. So too is stunning Iya Gorge at the lower end of the valley which is still very undeveloped and known as one of the three \"hidden regions\" of Japan. Ochiai Hamlet meanwhile boasts some of the prettiest traditional buildings and farmland."

      "description": "Return to Takamatsu & Transfer to Himeji - Today you head back to Takamatsu. We recommend taking Route 32 which will see you drive along the length of the Iya Valley. About half-way you can also stop at the famous Peeing Boy statue, or ride down to the bottom via cable car for a riverside bath at the Iya Onsen. Himeji is home to the famous 'White Heron' Castle, one of only 12 surviving original castles from the feudal era in all of Japan, Himeji-jo is certainly the most impressive with its extensive ramparts and dramatic keep rising up above the city. Just outside the castle grounds you can find Koko-en gardens, a haven of tranquillity with a range of different garden styles. The central tea house provides an opportunity to sit down, relax, rest your feet and contemplate."

      "description": "Your next stop is Mount Koya (known as Koya-san in Japanese) is one of the holiest mountains in all of Japan and the plateau at the top is home to more than 100 temples and monasteries. You will take the bullet train via Osaka and will arrive at Mount Koya, the train winds through the Wakayama countryside. Koya-san is the headquarters of the Shingon sect, an esoteric school of Buddhism which has over ten million members and 4,000 temples in Japan. There has been a religious community here since 816 when it was founded by a monk named Kukai after he returned from studying for two years in China. Koya is a very peaceful and beautiful wooded area and some great walking is also available. The atmosphere is truly magical, making this a lovely place to unwind and relax. Japan can often be a hectic place and this is a real tonic!"

      "description": "Transfer to Osaka - After a relaxing time in Mount Koya, you will head to Osaka which is Japan's second city and an extremely vibrant and lively place to stay. There may not be any real 'tourist' sights but it is just the life on the streets that makes Osaka such a fascinating city to visit. The city aquarium is world class and you cannot stay in Osaka without taking a ride on one of the city's several giant big wheels, perhaps the most dramatic of which is perched on top of the Hep 5 department store in the Umeda district of the city - just don't look down if you are afraid of heights! Osaka Castle is well worth a visit despite being a reconstruction as the original was burnt down during the firebombing at the end of World War Two and you will find a variety of very interesting museums scattered throughout the city. After dark Osaka really comes alive, and a walk through the bright lights of the Nanba district is a great way to take in the atmosphere, with some great people-watching opportunities. With literally thousands of restaurants, bars and entertainment spots to choose from, Osaka is perfect for a big night out, some hearty local food and the chance to let your hair down. Be sure to visit the restaurant and bar district of Dotonbori, down by the canals, where you’ll be able to try local delicacies such as takoyaki (octopus dumplings). Osaka really is one of Japan's truly all action cities and a stay here is a chance to experience what life in modern day urban Japan is really like."

From there the group heads to Osaka's most famous landmark, Osaka Castle. After exploring the Castle grounds, you'll visit the beautifully manicured, historically interesting, and ridiculously photogenic Utsubo Park, where you can enjoy the gardens. Water, helmets and bike rental are included in the price so you can just sit back, relax and enjoy the city!"
