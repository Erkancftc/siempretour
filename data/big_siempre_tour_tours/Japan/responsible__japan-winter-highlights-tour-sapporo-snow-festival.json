  "generalInfo": "This isn’t the Japan most people see. Timed for the Sapporo Snow Festival, this guided group tour takes you deep into Hokkaido — the country’s rugged, remote far north — where few visitors venture. It’s a landscape shaped by drift ice, crater lakes and volcanic plains, and ideal for those drawn to wild places, rare wildlife, and the thrill of the unexpected.<br/><br/>Starting in Tokyo, you’ll quickly leave the city behind. In Tsurui, you’ll head out with a local birding expert to observe the red-crowned cranes — a species found only in East Asia, whose winter courtship dances are a striking sight against the snow. Then it’s north to the coast, where an icebreaker cruise on the Okhotsk Sea brings you into Japan’s drift ice belt. It’s one of the best places in the world to spot Steller’s sea eagles, alongside other Arctic migratory species.<br/><br/>But Hokkaido isn’t all hard edges — there are warm springs at Kawayu, colourful local legends at Abashiri Prison, and butter-rich ramen served with blue beer at the dazzling Sapporo Snow Festival, home to more than 400 sculptures.<br/><br/>With our Insiders by your side, every stop becomes easier to navigate and richer in meaning — whether it’s translating a menu, guiding you through a national park, or helping you uncover a story behind the sights.<br/><br/>After the north, the tour arcs back through Hakodate, Kyoto, Shirakawago, and Kanazawa — a route that lets you experience some of Japan’s most iconic destinations, minus the crowds. Snow-dusted temples, mountaintop views, and moments of quiet beauty round out the journey.<br/><br/>This is Japan through a different lens — remote, real, and ready to reward anyone with a little intrepid spirit.<br/><br/> <br/>Activity rating: Active: <br/>Requires a moderate level of fitness. Activities will generally involve walking and being on your feet for most of the morning and/or afternoon<br/><br/><br/>Dietary requirements <br/>If you have any special dietary needs, please let us know in advance—we’ll do our best to accommodate them in your included meals. Please note that dietary requirements like vegetarian, gluten-free, or certain allergies are less common in Japan, so meals tailored to these needs may be simpler and less varied than typical offerings.",
