  "generalInfo": "Spend two weeks on Japan’s main island Honshu, exploring its northern region, home to beautiful national parks, temples perched on mountain tops, and pretty villages built around hot springs. This small group tour reveals Japan’s secret delights, revealing a side of the country that few visitors ever see. You’ll travel by public transport, eat at local restaurants and stay at Japanese owned accommodation, to really get to know this beautiful part of Japan.<br/> <br/>The tour focuses on the Tohoku region, which sits north of Tokyo and stretches up to the northernmost tip of Honshu islanda, and contains six prefectures. This remote part of Japan is known for its wonderful scenery, long winters and warm hospitality. Previously little-known to the outside world, Tohoku hit the international headlines in  2011 when it was struck by an earthquake and tsunami. Visiting now is timely. Though most of Tohoku was not affected by the disaster, the region has seen a decline in tourism, so your presence will be greatly appreciated by the hotels, restaurants and museums we visit. For an insight into the devastating earthquake, you will also visit Ishinomaki, one of the towns worst affected by the tsunami, where you can hear first-hand about events from a local volunteer guide.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful itinerary which ventures well of the beaten track into Japan's magical north. You will visit Matsushima Bay, where you can admire one of the top three scenic views in Japan; historic Hiraizumi, with its golden temple; and Naruko Onsen, a charming hot spring town of wood-panelled streets and steamy baths. Outside of the Tohoku region, visit the elaborate temples of Nikko and the abandoned gold mines of Sado Island, known for its taiko drummers.<br/>",

      "description": "TOKYO | Begin your tour in Tokyo, where towering skyscrapers and brilliant neon provide the perfect introduction to modern Japan. On arrival at Tokyo's Narita Airport, you will travel by shared shuttle bus to your hotel in Asakusa, Tokyo's most traditional district. Here you'll meet your tour leader and have the chance to begin getting to know your travel companions. Asakusa is a fascinating and very accessible district of Tokyo, known for the bright-red Senso-ji Temple, its many market stalls, and Kappabashi-dori (“Kitchen Street”). This is a fantastic place to begin your trip to Japan, and this evening your tour leader will take you out for a welcome meal at one of the area's many excellent restaurants."

You'll also visit serene Hamarikyu Gardens, an oasis of calm in the midst of the hubbub for an alternative perspective on the city."

      "description": "NIKKO | Begin your journey northwards with two nights in Nikko, the home of some of Japan's most elaborate religious architecture set in a beautiful national park. On day three you will take the train direct from Asakusa to Nikko, just a couple of hours' north of Tokyo yet worlds away in character and charm. This World Heritage Site is the final resting place of Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu, the founder of Japan's greatest shogunate, and exhibits some of the most impressive traditional architecture found anywhere in Japan. After checking in at your hotel, you will be met by an expert local guide for a full day's tour of the area's most impressive sites. This is sure to include Tokugawa's mausoleum, Shinkyo Bridge, and the “three wise monkeys” carving from the proverb “see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil”."

      "description": "HIRAIZUMI | Move on to Hiraizumi, where beautiful temples and shrines remain as a legacy of the town's illustrious past. In the 12th century, during the Heian Period of Japanese history, Hiraizumi was the seat of the powerful Fujiwara clan and was important enough to rival imperial Kyoto in the south. Today a glimpse of Hiraizumi's former glory remains in its beautiful temples and shrines, which are the most impressive in the Tohoku region - and another World Heritage Site. After checking in at your accommodation in Hiraizumi, you will head out with your tour leader to visit Chuson-ji, the town's most famous temple. Chuson-ji is set in beautiful woodland and once comprised an extensive complex of buildings, but today there are just two – one of which, Konjikido, is entirely covered in gold like Kyoto's famous pavilion. Following this, you will have the option to join your tour leader on a cycle ride to Genbikei Gorge (weather permitting) or to take part in a traditional lantern-painting workshop (if it's raining)."

Your transport costs will be included as you take a boat ride through the Geibikei Gorge (not to be confused with Genbikei Gorge, visited the day before), visit the Yugendo Caves, and take part in a paper-making workshop. In Hiraizumi you'll be staying at a Japanese-style hotel, where a traditional multi-course meal will be served on both nights of your stay."

Today you'll transfer by private coach from Hiraizumi to Naruko Onsen, stopping off in rural Izunuma town on the way for a mini-tatami mat making experience and a cooking class with the local women's association to make 'hatto jiru', a local soup dish, and mochi rice cakes. In the afternoon, you will continue to Naruko Onsen, a traditional town known for its nine different hot springs – each with its own mineral composition and reputed health benefits. Your tour leader will accompany you to some of the area's sights, including the Naruko Gorge, the impressive Naruko Dam, a visit to a nearby geyser, and an optional rowing boat trip on the Numata Crater Lake. Tonight you'll be staying at a traditional ryokan inn, where a delicious kaiseki dinner will be served this evening."

      "description": "KESENNUMA | Learn about the devastating events of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Kesennuma, one of the towns worst affected by the disaster. On the 11th of March 2011, Tohoku was hit by the largest earthquake in Japan's history, which in turn triggered a massive tsunami that devastated the region's eastern coast. Kesennuma was one of the towns almost completely washed away by the wave, and in the aftermath several InsideJapan staff members travelled to the town to help with the clean-up and witness the scale of the damage first-hand. Though the detritus has now been cleared, there are still many signs of the tsunami in the area, and it will be many years before the trauma of the disaster has faded. Today you will visit the Kesennuma Memorial Museum, a high school that was almost completely destroyed by the tsunami and has been kept in its ruined state; you will explore the site with an English speaking guide who will recount the events of that day and continuing efforts for recovery. Though it's certainly sobering subject matter, the warmth and generosity of the people of Kesennuma will ensure that your stay here is a highlight of your trip – and you will be left in no doubt that your visit is vastly appreciated. While visiting Kesennuma, you'll also make a stop at the Otokoyama sake brewery for a tour to learn about how rice wine is made, concluding with some sake tasting. There will also be some free time to explore the Kesennuma wharf, a revitalised area where many local businesses, shops and cafes have opened or re-opened in the years since the disaster."

      "description": "SENDAI | Following your visit to Kesennuma, visit Matsushima Bay and spend a night in Sendai: the biggest, most energetic city in the Tohoku region. Today you'll travel by private bus for the journey from Kesennuma to Matsushima Bay, an ocean inlet studded with leafy islands which is officially designated one of the Nihon San-Kei, or ‘Three Great Sights of Japan'. You'll explore the area by boat, visiting some of the bay's scenic piers and islands, as well as the lovely Entsuin Temple Gardens. After the day's sightseeing you'll continue onwards to Sendai, where the rest of the afternoon will be at leisure to enjoy the city. Sendai is known by the locals as the ‘city of trees' for its wild, tree-lined avenues and spacious parks, one of the more positive outcomes of the heavy bombardment the city suffered in WWII. As the capital of the north it has the best restaurant scene and nightlife in Tohoku, as well as plenty of excellent shops and galleries, so you'll have no problem entertaining yourself for the remainder of the day."

This morning, if you have time, you'll have the opportunity to visit the Sendai morning market and head to the top of the AER Building for fabulous views across the city, before jumping onboard your coach again for the journey from east to west. In Zao Onsen you'll stop at the local dairy farm, where you can meet the farm's cows and try your hand at making (and tasting) ice cream, while at Togatta Onsen you'll stop to give your feet a rest in the ashiyu hot spring foot bath. From here, the ‘Zao Echo Line' will lead you past spectacular waterfalls and mountains to Kattadake Peak, which boasts stunning views over the Okama Crater Lake and its mysterious colour-changing waters. Your final destination today is Niigata, a sizeable city on Japan's western coast."

      "description": "SADO ISLAND | Spend two nights on Sado Island, a former place of exile for Japanese dissidents that has its own unique culture and beautiful scenery. On the morning of day 12 you will be picked up by taxi from your Niigata hotel and driven to the port, where you'll catch the ferry to Sado Island. Sado's remote location made it the perfect place for Japanese rulers to send dissenting politicians, artists, and other prominent figures – beginning with a poet in 722 and concluding almost a millennium later in 1700. During this time, Sado became home to banished emperors, monks and aristocrats alike, developing its own religious and cultural scene whose influence is still evident today. On arrival on Sado you will meet your local guide, who will be with you for two full days to help you get beneath the surface of the island. Travelling in a private minibus you'll visit the island's former gold mine, where gold was discovered 400 years ago and briefly made Sado the largest gold producer in the world. After learning about the mining process, you'll pay a visit to the Sado Bugyosho, or former magistrate's office, from where the mining operation was governed, and stop in at the intriguingly bizarre Dentetsu Museum, where the history and folklore of Sado is illustrated with animatronic displays. At the end of a busy day of sightseeing, you'll return to your traditional ryokan inn this evening for an included dinner of local, seasonal produce."

      "description": "SADO ISLAND | On your second full day on Sado you'll get the chance to learn about Sado's other most famous export: taiko drumming. Taiko is enjoyed throughout Japan, but Sado's taiko group, Kodo, is the most famous – having toured extensively through Japan, Europe and the US. You'll get a chance to have a go yourself with a lesson this morning. The rest of the day will be spent exploring a few more of the island's attractions, including a ride in a distinctive tub boat and a visit to the Ibis sanctuary. Dinner will be included at your ryokan again this evening."

      "description": "TOKYO | Return to Tokyo for one final exciting night amongst the bright lights of the capital. On day 14 you'll board the ferry once more for the journey back to Niigata, where you'll catch a taxi to the station and jump on the bullet train to Tokyo. Japan's Shinkansen is an experience in itself, and you're bound to enjoy zipping through the countryside as you return to Tokyo to conclude your trip. For your final tour night, you'll be staying in Shinjuku – one of Tokyo's brightest, most exciting entertainment districts, crowded with skyscrapers packed to the rafters with bars, shops, restaurants and karaoke booths. This is the perfect place to head out and make the most of your last few hours in Japan – and it's well connected to every other part of the city, so if there's one last museum you want to squeeze in or a special souvenir you'd like to seek out, this is the time to do it. Dinner is included tonight, and your tour leader will be heading out to one of their favourite local restaurants for a farewell meal!"
