Start in Tokyo, before heading north on this tailor-made 13 day tour. <br/><br/>After a couple of days to take in as much of Tokyo as you can, you can head to Kakunodate, and be inspired by tales of samurai. In scenic Matshushima Bay you‘ll admire a sea view speckled with 260 islands, in the Minikami mountains you can soak in hot springs, whilst Obuse is an artistic city where you can admire the works of  Katsushika Hokusai (famous for his masterpiece, The Great Wave off Kanagawa). The castle of Matsumoto is impressive, but Mount Fuji is even more imposing – and a fitting finale to your trip, before you return to Tokyo.<br/><br/>On this independent tour, you’ll travel alone, but be supported by a tour organiser who’s always just a call away.  Independent tours are a great way to see Japan, without being overwhelmed by Tokyo, or getting too lost along the way.<br/>",

      "description": "TOKYO - (no meals) | You will be met at Narita International Airport or Hanade Airport (assuming your flight arrives after 8:00am and before 21:30) and taken to your hotel in Tokyo by public transportation. They will hand you all your transportation tickets including an IC Card with an initial credit of 2000 yen. They will also hand you a pocket internet device and give you an orientation. When you arrive at your hotel they will check you in and show you where you can find some food and the like. The train from Narita Airport to Tokyo Station will take approximately 1 hour. Tokyo is home to approximately 12 million people and can be a bit overwhelming. Beneath this surface lies a city of contradictions: ancient temples and shrines beside high-tech department stores; traditional festivals held in modern neighborhoods; peaceful Japanese gardens below intelligent skyscrapers. For its size and sprawl, Tokyo is an incredibly safe, efficient city with a low crime rate, the trains running on time. Tokyo is a vibrant metropolis overflowing with many fascinating sights, sounds, and experiences for you to enjoy."

The Ishiguro House has a collection of samurai armor and clothing on display. The bullet train from Tokyo Station to Kakunodate will take a little over 3 hours."

Along with Miyajima and Amanohashidate, Matsushima Bay is considered one of the most scenic places in Japan. The islands can be viewed from various lookout points, or by taking a local cruise. Please let us know if you wish to take a bay cruise and we will add this to your trip. Godaido temple, located next to Matsushima Pier, is interesting, for its outer walls are decorated with carvings. Zuigan-ji temple is well known for its caves carved into the rock which are used for memorial services. An art museum on Zuigan-ji's temple grounds displays calligraphy, fusuma paintings, tea cups and portraits. Oshima Island, close to Matsushima Pier, can be reached on foot by crossing a bridge. The island has caves which were used by monks to pray and meditate in. Overlooking Matsushima Bay, Karantei is the largest Momoyama-style tea house in Japan. Originally built in Kyoto, it was moved to Matsushima in 1645. Behind Karantei the Matsushima Museum has tools, armor and weapons on display.

      "description": "OBUSE - (breakfast) | Obuse (oh - boo - say) is a lively city of culture and the arts, where good food, sake, and the company of friends are appreciated. Katsushika Hokusai, internationally renowned ukiyo-e (woodblock printing) artist, lived in Obuse during his later years. His huge ceiling painting of a Chinese Phoenix, done in 1848 when he was 89 years old, can be seen in Gansho-in Temple. Many of the artist's paintings are on display at the Hokusai Museum. Joko-ji Temple, built in the early Muromachi period (1392 - 1573), stands at the foot of Mt. Karida. The temple's forested setting provides a quiet atmosphere.

      "description": "MT FUJI - (breakfast & dinner) | Mt. Fuji is the largest mountain in Japan. Long worshiped as sacred, Mt. Fuji is one of Japan's “Three Holy Mountains.” Its almost perfectly symmetrical shape attracts artists and photographers, although it's rare to get a clear picture since clouds often block the view. A popular destination for climbers and hikers, Mt. Fuji is also enjoyed by visitors who simply want to experience the region's natural beauty. With its unobstructed views, Lake Kawaguchiko is a popular location to photograph Mt. Fuji. Mt. Tenjo Ropeway is an aerial lift that extends from Lake Kawaguchiko to the observatory on Mt. Kachi Kachi. From here visitors can view the Aokigahara forest and Mt. Fuji. The trains from Nagiso to Kawaguchino near Mt Fuji will take a little over 4 hours."
