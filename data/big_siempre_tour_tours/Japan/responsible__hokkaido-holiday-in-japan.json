  "generalInfo": "The high mountains, crystal lakes and wide open spaces of Hokkaido Island set it far apart from the hustle and bustle of southern Japan. During this trip keep an eye out for Kokkaido red foxes, as well as bears in Shiretoko and possible dolphin sightings on a Shiretoko cape cruise.<br/><br/>This is Japan’s last wilderness region, boasting the nation’s greatest concentration of national parks, re-known for its Volcanoes and geo thermal springs and brimming with a wonderful abundance of flora and fauna. A particular highlight for many is watching the Red-Crested Crane mating rituals in Kushiro. <br/><br/>As Tokyo swelters through long summer days Hokkaido savours warm, temperate weather ideal for hiking in the high peaks of Daisetsu-zan or relaxing by the crystal-clear waters of the island’s many caldera lakes. In winter arctic air from Siberia is drawn across Hokkaido, ensuring the plentiful snowfall that makes this area a popular winter sports destination and providing the raw materials for the fantastic annual Sapporo Snow Festival.<br/><br/>Western Hokkaido is readily accessed by public transport, but for those wishing to explore in more depth Hokkaido’s wide, empty roads make driving a delight. Self-drive itineraries of all lengths can be arranged to suit your interests and schedules.",
