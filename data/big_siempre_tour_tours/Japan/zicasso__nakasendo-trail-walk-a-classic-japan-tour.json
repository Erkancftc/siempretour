      "description": "Today you travel south by train, back into the Japanese Alps. You emerge from the mountains as you enter the Kansai plain, home to some of the largest cities in Japan. But they are not your destination today. Your train continues on into a new set of mountains which reveal greater natural wonders. Your destination, Mount Koya, is considered to be one of the holiest sites in Japan. 1,200 years ago, the Buddhist monk Kukai chose Mount Koya as the site for his monastery. To Kukai, the location was perfect, as the mountain’s eight peaks resemble the shape of a blooming lotus flower. Throughout the centuries, over 100 temples were founded on the mountain slopes. Each follows Shingon Buddhism, a Buddhist sect imported from Tibet. For hundreds of years, these temples have offered to lodge pilgrims and travelers alike. Tonight, you become part of this tradition as you arrive at your accommodation, a functioning Buddhist temple. Expect your room to be modest, but comfortable. Before dinner, get to know your surroundings by taking a walk on one of the many stone paths that link the temples together. At sunset, monks light the stone lanterns that line the path. The flickering lights turn your walk into a mystical experience. For dinner, dine on shojin-ryori , a vegetarian cuisine that respects the monks’ abstention from meat."

From its edge, you can see Todai-ji, the largest Buddhist temple in Japan and one of the largest wooden buildings in the world. Before venturing there, though, you meet Nara’s wild deer. Considered sacred, they have been allowed to live without fear of hunters. Therefore, they are quite tame and are known to bow to visitors to receive a treat. Even before you enter Todai-ji, you are taken aback by its sheer size. Inside is a greater wonder, the Daibutsu . This 49-foot tall bronze Buddha dates back to 752 when the original temple was founded. Though fire and earthquakes throughout the centuries have caused much of the temple to need restoration, the Daibutsu has withstood the test of time. It is a sight to behold and is as breathtaking today as it was when it was first unveiled over 1,200 years ago. In the early evening, you return to Kyoto by train."
