Like Kyoto, its historical monuments were considered sufficiently important by Allied forces to escape air raids, meaning that today you can still find something of the atmosphere of pre-war Japan in its old town districts. No visit to Kanazawa would be complete without a visit to the city's star attraction: Kenrokuen. Ranked as one of Japan's top three landscape gardens, Kenrokuen is truly stunning."
