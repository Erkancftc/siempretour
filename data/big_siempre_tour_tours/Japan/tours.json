You’ll have the use of a pocket WiFi device throughout the trip. This type of tour is perfect for Japan, a country that’s often bewilderingly different for even well-seasoned travellers. <br/><br/>Japan is a country that sits on a knife edge between millennium-old traditions and cutting-edge technology. On one hand: traditional temples, tea ceremonies and sleeping on tatami mats – on the other: street style, skyscrapers and high-speed bullet trains. But to see Japan as a dichotomy is to miss much of it – the gorgeous nature, the peaceful gardens, the tall mountains – and, of course, the food. <br/>",

        "description": ": Our tour starts today in Fukuoka on Kyushu Island, Japan's third-largest island and the historic gateway to Asia. This southernmost island of the mainland is influenced by a long history of contact with the rest of Asia and the West. Fukuoka is the largest city and a hotspot of culture, art, history and food. This is a great place to start our exploration of northern Kyushu, through a landscape of dramatic mountains, volcanic terrain, varied hot springs and peaceful beaches. Fukuoka is known as one of the top destinations in Japan for delicious food. While the seafood and vegetables are excellent, the city is also famous for its chicken dishes. Local specialties include mizutaki (a hot pot made with chicken) and yakitori (grilled chicken skewers). The city also has a great street food scene, and one dish that has gone global is tonkotsu ramen - a local variation on a famous noodle dish. If you are arriving early, you may choose to visit the Kyushu National Museum or Fukuoka Tower. For those arriving on time, our tour leader plans to meet you in the hotel reception at 6pm for a welcome meeting, with the chance to go out afterwards with the rest of the group for dinner. If some of the group are arriving on later flights, the main introductory briefing will take place on the morning of Day 2 with everybody present. There are no activities planned today, so you're free to arrive at any time. If you miss the welcome meeting, your tour leader will inform you of any essential information as soon as you catch up. We don't provide arrival transfers on this tour, but information on how to reach the hotel will be provided in your final documentation. Fukuoka Airport (FUK) is around 20 minutes away from the hotel by metro or slightly longer by a relatively inexpensive taxi, depending on traffic. If you're joining this trip after participating in one of our other trips that end on Honshu Island, such as Simply Japan, you can either make your own way to Fukuoka or contact us to put you in touch with our local partners who will help arrange your train ticket."

Hundreds of Tenmangu shrines exist across Japan, dedicated to the exiled scholar Michizane and, among these, two reign supreme - one in Kyoto and this one in Fukuoka, which is built atop his grave. Thousands of plum trees are planted here, adding to the natural beauty. After heading back into town, we explore Ohori, a scenic city park with a large pond, which was once part of the moat system of a castle. After an included tonkotsu ramen lunch, we continue to Tochoji Temple, home to Japan's largest seated Buddha, and Jotenji Temple - the birthplace of udon and soba noodles. We end today's tour with a glimpse into traditional life, crafts and culture in the Meiji and Taisho eras at the Hakata Machiya Folk Museum, which focuses on the houses from that period. Fukuoka is well known for its open-air food stalls (Yatai), and tonight we recommend trying some of them out. They're not suitable for a group meal as they can only seat a few people, so we suggest splitting up into mini groups or exploring on your own.

        "description": ": We have a busy day ahead today as we set off on our travels around Kyushu. First, we take the bullet train to Nagasaki - a journey of around one hour and a half. Nagasaki is an important deep harbour city with an eventful history and was, of course, the target of the second atomic bomb attack on Japan. Our first visit is to the poignant and moving Peace Park and Museum, a memorial site dedicated to the victims of the 1945 atomic bombing, which symbolises the hope for world peace and the abolition of nuclear weapons. The city was, for long periods in its history, Japan's main contact with the outside world. In the 16th century, it was established as the main trade point with the Portuguese. As well as providing wealth from trade, the Portuguese introduced Christianity. After almost a century of turmoil, the religion was banned, foreign traders were expelled, and Japan closed its doors to the West. The one exception was the artificial island in Nagasaki harbour, Dejima. This small, closely guarded enclave was the site of the Dutch Trading Mission, which remained Japan's only contact with the outside world for almost 200 years. During our visit here and to the residential quarters of Glover Gardens this afternoon, we'll see that some of the original features remain, as well as some excellent reconstructions of the 18th-century buildings. We also plan to visit Oura Cathedral, Japan's oldest standing Christian church and a UNESCO World Heritage site. Our hotel isn't located in this area, so we'll stop for a group dinner in Dejima, for those who want to join, straight after our tour. This evening, you have the optional opportunity to catch one of the 'three greatest nighttime views in Japan' from Mount Inasa - wait until night falls and then take the cable car, which is just a few minutes' walk from our hotel. Please note, our main luggage will be forwarded to our hotel in Kumamoto today, and we'll be travelling with just our overnight bags. Depending on local arrangements, you might need to leave your luggage in reception the night of Day 2 or before breakfast this morning - your tour leader will advise you on the time.

At times, we'll be travelling through Aso-Kuju National Park - a dynamic landscape with volcanic peaks, hot springs, virgin forests and vast grasslands. The southern part of the park is dominated by Mount Aso, one of the world's largest calderas with five peaks within it that are said to resemble a sleeping Buddha. This morning, we plan to visit Aso Sanjo Shrine, located high up Mt Aso, enshrining a volcanic crater. Kamishikimi Kumanomimasu shrine offers a contrasting setting amid the forest, and we access it on a stone staircase through sacred torii gates. For over a millennium, the park's grasslands have been seared away in a controlled burn from mid-February to March. This helps preserve the grasslands for cattle and horses. Parts of the caldera and national park are 'regular sections' where inhabitants farm and graze the rich soils, and we plan to stop at the Aso Milk factory, famous in Japan for its high-quality milk and cheese products. Our journey continues this afternoon with a stop at the Daikanbo Lookout for commanding views over the caldera. Our final stop is at the ancient and revered Aso Shrine before we continue to our nightstop in the attractive hot spring town of Kurokawa Onsen. This resort town has managed to maintain a pleasant, traditional atmosphere, and we recommend a walk through town in yukata and geta sandals to explore the lanes lined with wooden buildings, ryokan, onsen (public bath houses), shops and cafes. In Kurokawa Onsen we stay in traditional Japanese-style accommodation. The rooms are twin-share or single with traditional tatami-mat (woven soft 'igusa' straw) flooring and futons to sleep on. Generally, the rooms are simply decorated with a low 'kotatsu' table to sit around and a scroll or picture in an alcove. Shoes are removed at the entrance and are not permitted anywhere within the accommodation. There are shared toilets and traditional baths. The shower in the bathing area is used to cleanse before a relaxing soak. Please note that, due to the small size of each accommodation here, the group will be spread out over several Ryokan. In cases of limited availability this overnight stay may be in another location in the wider Aso-Kuju area, or alternatively in a hotel accommodation in Kurakawa Onsen. Please also note that occasional volcanic activity may cause changes to our planned itinerary - our tour leader will inform you of any necessary changes."

This afternoon, if the weather allows, we plan to see a taiko drum performance on an open-air stage against a dramatic backdrop. Please note that this will not always be possible from January to March as the group performs only occasionally through these months. The order of visits today may vary according to local conditions and daylight hours. Tadewara is one of two protected marshes at the edge of the Kuju mountain range, which runs through the centre of the National Park. It is home to a variety of rare plants as well as birdlife, and we will spend some time walking the elevated cedar boardwalks to explore these marshlands. Finally, we reach our hotel in Beppu, where we'll spend the next two nights. With over 2,000 hot springs, Beppu is one of Japan's most famous hot spring resorts, and only Yosemite produces more. Despite being heavily geared up for tourism, Beppu is still a place of interest and worthy of inclusion in the itinerary. Please note, our main luggage will be forwarded to our hotel in Fukuoka for our arrival on Day 8, and we'll be travelling with just our bags for the next couple of nights. Depending on local arrangements, you might need to leave your luggage in reception the night of Day 5 or before breakfast this morning - your tour leader will advise you on the time. For more information, please refer to the Budgeting & packing section of the Trip Information."

This morning we will visit some of the popular and colourful hot springs in what is locally known as a hell tour - including Sea Hell (Umi Jigoku), Cooking Pot (Kamado Jigoku), Blood Pond Hell (Chinoike Jigoku) and depending on the time of your visit you may be lucky enough to see a Geyser erupting. For lunch today, we've planned jigoku-mushi or 'hell steaming'. With the help of a local guide, we'll source our ingredients from the local market and shops before cooking over the natural geothermal steam. Then, this afternoon, we'll visit Myoban Yunosato, a hot spring with views over Beppu. The yu-no-hana thatch-roof huts here continue to make bathing salts in the traditional method, maintaining 300 years of Edo-period craftsmanship. The rest of the late afternoon is free for you to explore solo. Takegawara Onsen was built in 1879 and is one of the oldest and most famous, so you may wish to visit to see the distinctive architecture and perhaps even have a communal hot bath or a sand bath."

We've planned a short walking tour with a local guide to explore the samurai townscape, seaside castle setting and streets infused with the Edo-era and four historic artisan shops - accessible only with a local guide. The tour includes a rare magewappa (woodcraft) workshop run by one of only two remaining craftsmen in Kyushu, a miso brewery founded in 1900, a traditional tea shop from the mid-Edo period, and a sake brewery established in 1874 with multiple awards. Enjoy tastings of miso, matcha and sake. This is a rare opportunity to experience over a century of craftsmanship and tradition. After some free time for lunch here, we'll return to Fukuoka by express train (a journey of around two hours). We'll check into our hotel, and the rest of the afternoon is free for last-minute shopping or sightseeing before our final supper and a chance to reflect on the holiday."

For those arriving in time, our tour leader plans to meet you in the hotel reception at 6.30pm for a welcome meeting. If some of the group are arriving on later flights, the main introductory briefing will take place on the morning of Day 2 with everybody present. After the meeting, we'll have dinner (included) at a nearby local restaurant where you'll have the chance to try 'izakaya' style Japanese cuisine. There are no other activities planned today, so you're free to arrive in Tokyo at any time.

Should you miss the welcome meeting, your tour leader will inform you of any essential information as soon as you catch up. The Tour Leader will issue each client with a Suica transport card either today or tomorrow morning, that is pre-loaded to cover your included sightseeing public transport journeys. Please note, while our itinerary gives us a full day in Japan's capital, there's a lot to pack in. If you really want to get to grips with Tokyo's sites, we recommend adding additional nights to your trip pre-tour. Japanese hotels have strict rules regarding check in and all customers are required to wait until 3 PM for room access. You will be able to store your luggage while waiting but if you require an early check in, then you should request this at the time of booking.

Our main bags will be forwarded to Osaka today and we'll make do with an overnight bag for tonight. The bullet trains are known for their extremely punctual service, comfortable carriages, and lack of noise as you travel at speeds of up to 300 kilometres/186 miles per hour. Alighting at Nagano in the Japanese Alps, we'll make our way by private coach to Jigokudani Onsen, home to Japan's famous snow monkeys. Here the indigenous macaques descend from the hills to bathe and play in the hot springs, a unique behaviour not found anywhere else in the world. Despite their wintry moniker, the monkeys can be observed in and around the pool throughout the year (although sightings are more likely in colder months). Our walk to the spring takes 30 minutes along a pretty forest trail which is mostly flat with some steep stairs and narrow sections. Once at the spring, we'll spend around an hour observing the monkeys before returning along the same path. Leaving Nagano behind, we'll head for Kanazawa, which until 150 years ago was the 4th largest city in Japan. The city has shunned mass industrialisation and retains its traditional charm with its winding back streets, delicate tea shops and the beautiful autumn maples and spring cherry blossoms of Kenrokuen Gardens. Once ruled by the Maeda Clan, one of the most powerful Samurai families in Japan, the city has several traditional samurai districts and, along with Kyoto, is one of Japan's cultural capitals."

We'll spend some time wandering around the colourful stalls at the town's Omicho market, where fresh fish and crab are brought daily from the Sea of Japan along with vegetables from the surrounding countryside. The market is open but please note that some of the stalls are closed on a wednesday but it is still worth a visit. A great dish to try here is chirashi-zushi, which consists of scattered seasoned sushi rice topped with a variety of seafood, vegetables, and raw fish. We'll also visit Kenrokoen Gardens which took nearly two centuries to complete and translate from their original Japanese as the 'Garden of the Six Sublimities'. This afternoon, we'll travel by train once more (a two-hour journey) to the city of Osaka. Japan's second city is famed for its modern architecture, buzzing nightlife and tasty street food. This evening your tour leader will take you on a walk around the Namba area, one of Osaka's most vibrant and interesting districts where miles of covered arcades criss-crossed by canals and rivers open up to back streets filled with history and small shops. We'll get to see the street food scene with local delicacies such as Takoyaki - also known as Octopus balls, Okonomiyaki - a type of savoury cabbage-based pancake filled with pretty much whatever you like, Kushikatsu - skewered meat and vegetables that are deep-fried, and ramen - pulled noodles served in a meat or fish-based broth, often flavoured with soy sauce or miso. For practical reasons we have included a sit down meal where you get the chance to try some of these specialties this evening."

This thought-provoking city was completely destroyed on the 6th of August 1945 as the target of the first atomic bomb to be used in wartime. Hiroshima has literally risen from the ashes and is now a thriving, friendly city. Travel around the city is easy, thanks to the colourful street trams, brought in all over Japan after the war. Just off the coast of Hiroshima is the tiny island of Miyajima which we'll visit upon arrival today. The relaxed feel of this island is enhanced by the deer that roam freely through the streets. As you arrive on the ferry, you can take in the famous view of the floating torii gate. Considered to be one of the most iconic sights in Japan, these red gates appear to float on the water with the hills of the island forming a spectacular backdrop. If time permits - there are various hiking trails to explore and a cable car to the top of Mount Misen for great views. You might also like to take time to visit some of the island's many shrines before we take the ferry back to the mainland."

Whilst serving as poignant reminders of the nuclear holocaust, their overwhelming message is of hope that such horrors will never reoccur. Later this morning, we'll make our way back to the train station for the journey to Kyoto, which takes around two hours. The imperial capital for more than 1,000 years, Kyoto has more than 2,000 temples and shrines, many set in perfectly manicured landscaped and tranquil gardens. We'll start exploring this fabulous city this afternoon with a visit to Nijo Castle. Built in 1603 as a Shogun palace, it's a great example of the sumptuous setting in which the Shogun would have held audiences with his samurai warriors. The extensive gardens and gates are impressive, but the real ingenuity of the castle is the nightingale floors, so called because they are designed to make a chirping noise when walked upon, thus making it impossible to sneak up on the castle's inhabitants. The rest of the afternoon is left free to explore. You may choose to visit Ryoan-ji Temple with its beautiful Zen gardens and famous rock garden. The exact history of the gardens is unknown, but it's thought the temple was converted from an aristocrat's villa in 1450. Whilst in the gardens try testing out the theory that at least one of the rocks is hidden from every vantage point. Another possibility is the famous Golden Pavillion (Kinkaku-ji). The temple is a three-storey building with the top two tiers covered in gold leaf. Set in a lake, the building appears to float on the water and the reflections, coupled with the background of forest make it worthy of its place on many Japanese postcards."

During this trip keep an eye out for Kokkaido red foxes, as well as bears in Shiretoko and possible dolphin sightings on a Shiretoko cape cruise.<br/><br/>This is Japan’s last wilderness region, boasting the nation’s greatest concentration of national parks, re-known for its Volcanoes and geo thermal springs and brimming with a wonderful abundance of flora and fauna. A particular highlight for many is watching the Red-Crested Crane mating rituals in Kushiro. <br/><br/>As Tokyo swelters through long summer days Hokkaido savours warm, temperate weather ideal for hiking in the high peaks of Daisetsu-zan or relaxing by the crystal-clear waters of the island’s many caldera lakes. In winter arctic air from Siberia is drawn across Hokkaido, ensuring the plentiful snowfall that makes this area a popular winter sports destination and providing the raw materials for the fantastic annual Sapporo Snow Festival.<br/><br/>Western Hokkaido is readily accessed by public transport, but for those wishing to explore in more depth Hokkaido’s wide, empty roads make driving a delight. Self-drive itineraries of all lengths can be arranged to suit your interests and schedules.",

Travel in warm weather and you’ll come across wild flower gardens in Abashiri, admire Furano’s lovely lavender fields, and see unique flower fields in Biei as you cycle through the farmland. <br/><br/>In winter it’s a different story. Furano is world-famous for its winter sports. Hit the slopes in the cold months – or just admire the frosty wonderland. You can see the massive ice floes from an icebreaking ship on the Sea of Okhotsk near Abashiri.

    "generalInfo": "This two week holiday in Japan has been carefully crafted not only to visit the iconic cities, and enjoy contemporary and ancient culture, but also to spend time in rural Japan, with its fascinating feudal history and stunning mountainous landscapes. <br/><br/>Because Japan is so easy to get around using public transport, we are able to cover great distances on this trip, particularly with the use of the world famous bullet train. Travelling with a small group, and an local expert leader guide, we start in Tokyo, a city that takes a while to take in as it is so vibrant and overwhelming. From the markets of Asakusa to the imperial gardens of Chiyoda, there is something for everyone in Tokyo. <br/><br/>The next city stop is Nikko, a sacred city but also gateway to the eponymous national park, so it has a very beautiful setting, enveloped by mountains. Packed with sacred shrines and temples, you start to get an idea of how Japanese religion is so often related to nature. One of the greatest areas of protected natural heritage, Hakone National Park, is our next stop, a mountainous and volcanic area. Here we take a cable car trip which soars over the blue waters of Lake Ashi, to the volcanic crater of Owakudani and, on a clear day, views to Mount Fuji. <br/><br/>The next two towns on this Japanese journey are quite contrasting in character. Takayama is a rural town in the middle of the Japanese Alps, where rural traditions are still kept very much alive and where we also get a chance to spend the night in a ‘ryokan’ inn. After that is Hiroshima, a city with a tragic past but which today is vibrant and very much representative of contemporary Japan. It does not hide its history, however, and visits to the A-Bomb dome, Peace Park and Museum are extremely thought provoking.<br/><br/>And perhaps one of the greatest cities in terms of food for thought, is the finale of our trip: Kyoto, the ancient capital. We spend three days here, taking our time not only to soak up this now modern metropolis but also its fourteen UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the historic district’s narrow streets, and eat fantastic food. The opportunities in Kyoto are endless and, as with all stops on this holiday, our leader guide is always on hand to give you tips of great places to visit, whether you want to stick to the tourist trail or go hiking or cycling a little bit more off the beaten path. Because this is the Land of the Rising Sun, and no matter where you go there is something fascinating, beautiful, peaceful or, as always in Japan, delicious. <br/><br/>",

The dome was just metres from where the bomb detonated so it was able to retain its shape and the fact that it looks almost exactly as it did after the bombing has made it an enduring symbol of peace. The memorial park serves the same purpose, and has museums, memorials and monuments dedicated to the memory of victims.

    "generalInfo": "The term ‘Sakoku’ ??  or ‘locked country’ refers to the isolationist foreign policy of the Japanese Tokugawa shogunate during the Edo period (from 1603 to 1868), when nearly all non-Japanese nationals were banned from entering the country, consciously preserving a completely unique and highly sophisticated culture developed over thousands of years. Although Japan is now very much a part of the world, this is what makes the country so special – there is simply no other place like it. <br/><br/>The deep sensitivity and exquisite craftsmanship of its people have created incredibly beautiful temples and gardens of deep serenity, with an unmatched attention to detail and deep spiritual significances. These contrast sharply with the violent Bushido moral code of the samurai, who’s unrelenting devotion to honour, duty and razor-sharp katana swords also formed their affection for ‘wabi-sabi’ (wabi = less is more, sabi = attentive melancholy), the awareness of and pleasure in the transient nature of earthly things.<br/><br/>These also in turn now mix with the neon lights and technological advances of Modern Japan, a feast for the senses for the curious traveller, a land full of surprises; at the same time timeless yet ever-changing.<br/><br/>Tokyo, the bustling capital, dazzles with its vibrant energy, towering skyscrapers, whilst Nikko enchants with its stunning natural scenery and rich cultural heritage. Yokohama stands out with its futuristic architecture and cosmopolitan atmosphere, while Hakone, famous for its hot springs and views of Mount Fuji, promises relaxation and breathtaking natural beauty.<br/><br/>Journey to the old Imperial capital of Kyoto to view its breathtaking ancient temples, shrines, and historical sites, such as Kinkaku-ji - the famous Golden Pavilion, set amongst beautiful gardens and traditional tea houses.<br/><br/>Between Kyoto and Okayama stand the iconic white castle walls of Himeji, also known as the 'White Heron Castle' dating back over 600 years, it is regarded as the finest surviving example of Japanese castle architecture, comprising a network of 83 rooms with advanced defensive systems from the feudal period. The castle gardens, comprising of nine separate walled gardens were built in the Edo Period, and are especially famous for their Sakura cherry blossoms, blooming only once for about a week in a year; they epitomise the 'wabi-sabi' mentality.<br/><br/>*During this adventure, we mainly travel by rail, which is a fantastic way to see Japan's sights. Trains are comfortable and efficiently connect the bustling streets of Tokyo with the serene temples of Kyoto. Plus, they are more environmentally friendly than cars or planes, helping to preserve Japan's beauty for everyone*",

Your tour leader knows some great authentic, but cheap restaurants – Osaka is brilliant for street food and you’ll get a sushi lesson in Tokyo. You’ll be given a Japan Rail Pass to get around without spending a fortune, and you can ride the famous bullet train. <br/><br/>You need to devote a lot of time to Tokyo, which is why this tour takes four days to get to know the capital – one minute you’ll be taking a swing at a batting cage, the next relaxing in a local bathhouse or going to see a robot show. By doing local activities, there no queues or big crowds involved – except, of course, when you visit Shibuya Crossing, the busiest pedestrian crossing in the world.<br/><br/>A bullet train to Kyoto whizzes you back in time in Japan’s elegant, historic city. Just as it’s essential to spend lots of time in Tokyo, you need to give Kyoto a few day’s attention, too. See geisha performances, witness a tea ceremony and cycle around the city to Zen temples, Kinkaku-ji, and the Imperial Palace. Finally you’ll visit Hiroshima, with its moving Peace Memorial Park, before filling your stomach in Osaka – Japan's greediest city and returning to Tokyo on the bullet train again.",

    "generalInfo": "A two week long, small group tour around Japan’s cultural highlights with our expert and highly experienced local guide. This unique country’s culture and history are so rich, that even a two week long Japan culture tour will still only feel like an introduction, but this itinerary will immerse you deeply and quickly. Every day is different, with the likes of Imperial Kyoto and Nara one day or the ancient Nakasendo Trail, where you can follow in the footsteps of feudal warlords through the mountains, on another. The Trail is 500km long, but we will take on the Kiso Valley section visiting the traditional ‘post towns’ of Magome and Tsumago further over the Magome Pass. <br/><br/>Hot springs and bathing are at the core of Japanese culture, and there are plenty of opportunities to soak on this tour, such as in the ancient city of Takayama in the Hida region, with the backdrop of mountains and ancient wooden houses. Even the monkeys bathe in Japan, as you will see from our visit to the famous snow monkeys of Yudanaka, which take to the hot springs here when mountain temperatures drop. <br/><br/>Kyoto holds the cultural crown of Japan with fourteen UNESCO World Heritage sites. So we spend three days here, allowing plenty of time to visit its ancient temples such as the Golden Pavilion of Kinkakuji, palaces, the historic district of Gion with its omnipresent teahouses and shrines. Also a contemporary metropolis, Kyoto is definitely cultural chic.<br/><br/>Starting and ending in Tokyo, visiting its iconic sites and highlights, one of the high points of this Japan culture tour is on our last night before returning to Tokyo, and something that is in total contrast to its big city lights:  Staying overnight at the Buddhist Temple at Mount Koya, where the chanting, serenity and indeed cuisine of the place is unforgettable. <br/><br/>Other accommodation on this trip includes traditional ryokan or minshuku inns, and smaller hotels in the cities. Travelling in a group that is no bigger than thirteen people, you are able to savour each cultural experience, with the help of your English-speaking Japanese tour leader, in the best way possible. <br/><br/>",

    "generalInfo": "Japan’s Golden Route earns its reputation. This classic itinerary links the bright lights of Tokyo and the quiet grace of Kyoto with the green landscapes of Hakone National Park — a brilliant first taste of Japan. <br/>Your journey begins in Tokyo, a city of contradictions. Known for its sci-fi skyline, eccentric fashion, and famously packed trains, there’s far more here than first meets the eye. Scratch the surface and you’ll find centuries-old shrines, local bathhouses, and age-old traditions alive and well. Modern? Absolutely. But Tokyo’s spirit runs deep — and it’s a thrilling place to dive in. <br/>From Tokyo, the Shinkansen bullet train shoots you into an entirely different world. Hakone is all steam and silence: a national park where volcanic hot springs bubble, modern art museums dot the hillsides, and Mount Fuji occasionally peeks through the mist. This was once a resting spot for shoguns — today, it’s your chance to breathe. <br/>Then there’s Kyoto. Sleek on the surface, ancient underneath. This UNESCO site-dotted city invokes reverence — from its lantern-lit alleys, temples hidden behind bamboo, gardens glimpsed through sliding doors. You’ll feel the presence of Imperial Japan all around you. <br/><br/>Dietary Requirements<br/>Our tailor-made itineraries are designed as flexible suggestions. If a hotel or accommodation on the proposed route is unable to meet specific dietary requirements, we can replace it with a suitable alternative. In cases where no alternatives are available in a particular destination, we will discuss other options with the client to ensure their needs are met. <br/>All itineraries can be adapted to cater for vegetarian and vegan diets, as well as other dietary preferences or restrictions. While the range of options may vary by region, we will always work to ensure that clients are accommodated as comfortably as possible. <br/>",

Unlike many other Japanese towns, it escaped the ravages of both the Second World War and modern urban development, keeping intact much of the spirit and architecture of traditional Japan. Today, we have an introductory tour of the city. Starting with a visit to the impressive Nijo Castle, built in 1603 as a residence for the Tokugawa shoguns, before moving onto the Golden Pavilion of Kinkaku-ji, built in 1397 as a summer villa for the shogun Yoshimitsu Ashikaga. We then visit the Ryoan-ji temple, home to the most famous rock garden in Japan. After, we head to central Kyoto, with free time to eat a leisurely late lunch at a local restaurant, relax at the hotel or explore Kyoto more. Alternatively, stroll around Nishiki Market, known as Kyoto’s Kitchen. It’s a great place to find seasonal foods and Kyoto specialties, such as Japanese sweets, pickles, dried seafood and sushi.

Our walking tour includes a visit to the best-known temples and shrines, including the Todai-ji Great Buddha temple. Built in 752 by Emperor Shomu, this 49ft (15m) tall bronze Buddha is housed in what is reputed to be the largest wooden building in the world. We also spend time in the Nara Koen Park (home to large numbers of overfed and slightly unruly deer) and visit the attractive Kasuga Shinto shrine. Later in the afternoon, we return to Kyoto and stop at the Fushimi Inari Taisha with its thousands of vermilion torii gates. Fushimi Inari is the most important of several thousands of shrines dedicated to Inari, the Shinto god of rice. As we head towards early evening, we can walk around Gion, the most famous geisha district in Kyoto. Packed with bars, restaurants and traditional teahouses, Gion is most atmospheric in the early evening, when the lanterns are lit. At this time, we may also see an apprentice geisha on the way to an appointment, though it’s rare to see one. Accommodation: Hotel Monterey Kyoto (or similar)"

A sprawling metropolis, Tokyo is one of the world's most populous cities and a dazzling blend of traditional culture and all things new. For those arriving in time, our tour leader plans to meet you in the hotel reception at 6.30pm for a welcome meeting, with the chance to go out for dinner afterwards. If some of the group are arriving on later flights, the main introductory briefing will take place on the morning of Day 2 with everybody present. There are no activities planned today, so you are free to arrive in Tokyo at any time. Should you miss the welcome meeting, your tour leader will inform you of any essential information as soon as you catch up. The Tour Leader will issue each client with a Suica transport card either today or tomorrow morning, that is pre-loaded to cover your included sightseeing public transport journeys. If you'd like to receive a complimentary airport transfer today, you'll need to arrive into Haneda Airport (HND) or Narita Airport (NRT). The city centre is around an hour away from Haneda Airport and an hour and a half from Narita. You'll be met in the arrivals hall and transferred to the hotel by public shuttle bus or private vehicle. The shuttle bus may stop at other hotels, before dropping you at our hotel. If we have booked a shuttle bus for you, it will be operated by a local company called Green Tomato, you will be on their list of transfers and we will have sent you an electronic pdf voucher for this service. Please note, while our itinerary gives us three days in Japan's capital, there's a lot to pack in. If you really want to get to grips with Tokyo's sites, we recommend adding additional nights to your trip pre-tour. Japanese hotels have strict rules regarding check in and all customers are required to wait until 3 PM for room access. You will be able to store your luggage while waiting but if you require an early check in, then you should request this at the time of booking. We do not guarantee this will be possible and depending on availability an extra fee will be charged."

Continuing in dramatic fashion, we'll attend the morning fire service at Fukagawa Fudo-do Temple. Here, the esoteric Shingon sect performs a ceremony involving flames and the chanting of sacred texts, accompanied by the loud beat of huge taiko drums. The result is a truly atmospheric experience and an authentic insight into Japanese Buddhist culture. After some free time for lunch, we'll visit Meiji Jingu - an important Shinto shrine dedicated to the deified spirits of the first Emperor and Empress of modern Japan at the end of Japan's feudal era. Its forested grounds offer a peaceful haven in this densely built-up city. Our final stop is Shibuya, known for one of the busiest crossings in the world, Shibuya is a hub of up-and-coming fashion, technology and design in Tokyo with a variety of shops, museums and galleries to explore.

For views across the city, head up to the Tokyo Skytree, or get a different perspective with a cruise along the Sumida River or a walk through Hamarikyu Gardens. For those interested in seeing Mount Fuji and Hakone National Park, we suggest a day trip by local bus to Lake Kawaguchi - the most easily accessible of the five Fuji Lakes from Tokyo. A cable car and walking trails lead to viewpoints and there are also museums. Located right at the base of Mount Fuji, the mountain views are dependent on weather which can change quickly and may be covered by clouds. Visibility tends to be best in the early morning and late afternoon, and the summer months are hazier. Please note that in peak times (March-April and October-November) availability can be extremely limited or fully booked - refer to the optional activities section of the tour notes for alternatives you can pre-book (under Budgeting and packing, Trip Information). Alternatively, you can travel north to Nikko (around two hours by train) and discover the park's great temples hidden among forests of giant cedar trees, great for autumnal colours. Japan's most lavishly decorated shrine, Toshogu, is located here and is well worth a visit. The park's landscape of lakes, waterfalls and hot springs is inhabited by wild monkeys and deer and has several easy-to-follow hiking paths through the delightful scenery. Another option is the beachside town of Kamakura, just over an hour's train ride away from Tokyo. One of Japan's ancient capitals, there are many temples and shrines, and a massive bronze 'Great Buddha' statue which is almost 800 years old. The statue has outlived several buildings that were erected to house it and now stands out in the open with a serene gaze seemingly appraising the surrounding countryside. The town also has several long sandy beaches which are very popular with Tokyoites taking a day away from the city. Whatever you decide to do today your tour leader will help you out with first-hand advice and the finer details of what is best for the time of year and weather, where to go, what to do and how to get around."

Despite their wintry moniker, the monkeys can be observed in and around the pool throughout the year although sightings are more likely in colder months. Our walk to the spring takes 30 minutes along a pretty forest trail which is mostly flat with some steep stairs and narrow sections. Once at the spring, we spend around half an hour observing the monkeys before returning along the same path. In the afternoon, we'll make our way to Nagano, a town that originally evolved as a temple town around Zenkoji, one of Japan's most popular temples. Founded in the 7th century, it's one of the earliest Buddhist temples in the country and was established to house an image brought from India which was believed to lead all who saw it to a state of Nirvana. The image is said to have remained hidden somewhere in the temple since the year 654. We usually visit the temple first thing in the morning, although you are free to explore in your freetime today, so we head firstly to the shukubo or temple lodgings. Originally created to accommodate pilgrims, they are furnished with tatami mats - a traditional floor covering made from rice straw, futons, and paper walls, giving us a very authentic Japanese experience for our overnight stay.

As the town was not targeted during World War II, much of Kanazawa consists of old buildings and gives a sense of what Japan was like in the 19th century. There is plenty to do and see, and a great option is to spend some time wandering around the colourful stalls at the town's Omicho market, where fresh fish and crab are brought daily from the Sea of Japan along with vegetables from the surrounding countryside. A great dish to try here is chirashi-zushi, which consists of pieces of sushi piled on top of rice and often garnished with shredded egg. You can also visit a 'chaya', or teahouse in the Higashi Chaya or Kazuemachi Chaya areas. While Kanazawa's surviving geisha establishments remain off limits to tourists, several elegant tea houses are open to the public - sadly without the presence of a geisha though! At some point today we recommend a visit to discover the fabulous Kenrokuen Gardens, considered to be one of the most beautiful landscaped gardens in Japan.

There are several traditional sake distilleries in the old town and we'll tour one of the breweries and get to try some of the city's famous brew, considered to be among the best in Japan due to the region's pure mountain water and cold winter months. Takayama is also well-known for high quality Japanese hida beef and we recommend trying some tonight for dinner in town. On the outskirts of the town is the fascinating Hida No Sato thatched roof village.

This tiny island has a very relaxed feel which is enhanced by the deer that roam freely through the streets. As we arrive, we'll get a great view of the torii gate considered to be one of the most iconic sights in Japan. The red gate appears to float on the water at high tide with the hills of the island forming a spectacular backdrop. For those who are keen, there is a hike to the top of Mt. Misen for views out across the Inland Sea and a chance to see the monkeys that live on the mountain - the hike takes from two to two and a half hours. For those not wanting to walk, there is a cable car that you can take either up or down or both. From the cable car upper station there is a 20 to 30 minute walk to the observatory which is the highest point. The name of the island translates as 'shrine island' and we'll visit one of the most important, the Buddhist Daisho-in Temple where we can climb the steps to the temple and spin the prayer wheels, believed to bestow the same blessing as actually reading the texts. There is also the opportunity to take in the 16th-century Shinto Itsukushima Shrine, a UNESCO World Heritage Site which is built over the sea and has a stage where key events in Shinto mythology are enacted. After exploring the island, we'll take the ferry back to Hiroshima."

        "description": ": Today, we enjoy a guided day trip to Arashiyama, located just 20-minutes by train from Kyoto. At busy times of year in Spring and Autumn we plan an early start of around 8am to arrive before the crowds. Arashiyama, located on the western outskirts of Kyoto, has been a popular destination since the Heian Period (794-1185), when nobles would enjoy its natural setting. Nowadays it is particularly popular during the cherry blossom and Autumn colour seasons. During the summer months, traditional cormorant fishing is practiced on the Hozu River. We begin our exploration with a visit to Tenryu-ji Temple, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Originally built as an imperial villa, Tenryu-ji was established as a Zen temple in 1340 and has since been recognized as one of the eight chief temples of the Rinzai Sect of Zen Buddhism. Surrounding the temple is a stunning garden, perfect for a relaxing stroll and moments of quiet reflection. From the temple, we step directly into the enchanting Arashiyama Bamboo Grove. Here, towering green stalks rise high above, creating a serene and almost otherworldly atmosphere. Take your time to walk along the path and capture stunning photographs of this iconic landscape. Next, we move on to Togetsukyo Bridge, or 'Moon Crossing Bridge' which spans the Oi River and serves as a famous landmark of Arashiyama. The bridge's name is said to date back to the Kamakura Period when Emperor Kameyama observed the moon as if it were crossing the bridge itself. Admire the picturesque views of the river and surrounding hills from this historic site. After free time for lunch, you have the choice to return to Kyoto under your own steam (your Tour Leader will give clear instructions) or stay and explore Arashiyama's Main Shopping Street, a lively area renowned for its traditional textiles and artisan crafts. Browse shops offering hand-dyed fabrics, Kyoto ceramics, and elegant souvenirs. Don't miss the chance to sample local sweets, such as matcha-flavored treats or yatsuhashi (cinnamon rice crackers), while wandering the charming streets. North of central Arashiyama, known as Sagano, the atmosphere becomes less touristy and more rural, with several small temples scattered along the base of the wooded mountains. Another option is to rent a local bike, available near the train stations, and cycle through rural residential areas and past fields between temples. There is also an attractive preserved town area near the Adashino Nenbutsuji Temple. Finally we return to Kyoto by train in the late afternoon and there will be the option to join a final dinner tonight to reflect on our journey through marvellous Japan."

In the 16th century, it was established as the main trade point with the Portuguese. As well as providing wealth from trade, the Portuguese introduced Christianity. After almost a century of turmoil, the religion was banned, foreign traders were expelled, and Japan closed its doors to the West. The one exception was the artificial island in Nagasaki harbour, Dejima. This small, closely guarded enclave was the site of the Dutch Trading Mission, which remained Japan's only contact with the outside world for almost 200 years. During our visit here, we can see that some of the original features remain, as well as some excellent reconstructions of the 18th-century buildings. Continuing our tour in the Glover Gardens, we'll see fine foreign residences of the Meiji period and enjoy impressive views over Nagasaki Harbour, perhaps the most scenic harbour view in Japan.

After lunch, we'll continue our journey north to Hirado Island, on arrival before checking in to our accommodation we'll visit Kameoka shrine and park as well as Hirado Castle. Hirado city prospered as a castle town for almost 500 years. Its excellent port enabled it to become the central stage for trade with China, Holland and Portugal from the 17th century. For the next two nights, we'll stay in a simple ryokan or Japanese-style accommodation with futon-style beds and the chance to take another hot spring bath. Dinner will be a traditional Kaiseki Ryori - a Japanese multi-course meal. There is traditional onsen communal bathing for those interested. Additionally, each room has ensuite facilities. Once again, we'll travel with our day bags while our main luggage is forwarded to Fukuoka - you'll need to bring with you enough for our two-night stay on the island of Hirado. Please refer to the Trip Information; Budgeting and packing; Luggage on tour sections for more information."

Then, escape the madness by venturing out to Hakone National Park and see the epic snow-capped peak of Fuji-san - you'll discover a whole other Japan outside of the capital.<br/><br/>Take a bullet train to Kyoto to experience the riches of Japanese culture and see the last remaining geisha in the historic district of Gion. Then, head into the Japanese Alps for a cooking course in Kanazawa and a cycling tour around Hida's mountain villages.<br/><br/>Compare and contrast, Japan cannot be defined in one single image or sentence alone. Instead, it's a beautiful paradox of sights, smells and tastes, which are consistently unexpected, but always leave you wanting more.",

The two most popular options are the towns of Nikko (to the north of Tokyo) and Kamakura (to the south). Nikko is famous for its ornate religious architecture, some of the most important in all of Japan, in a beautiful woodland setting. Kamakura is a sleepy coastal town that served briefly as capital of Japan in the 1100s, leaving a rich cultural legacy. The town and surrounding hillsides are dotted with attractive temples and shrines, along with one of Japan largest Great Buddha statues. If Tokyo's concrete and neon is getting to you then you might like to head west to sacred Mt Takao, with its range of hiking trails and mountain-top temple complex, virtually untouched by foreign visitors. There are plenty of more unusual day trip options as well, including the modern port city of Yokohama and the quirky 120m tall 'Bubble Buddha' (built 1985!) at Ushiku.

The area consists of a handful of small villages and hamlets all connected by a variety of local transport, including buses, cable cars and a mountain railway that winds itself through the region's hills and valleys. Hakone has plenty to see and do, from tasting eggs boiled in volcanic waters to taking a boat trip across beautiful Lake Ashi. The outdoor sculpture park and Picasso gallery is a great place to wander around for an afternoon.

The other main draw to this area is the proximity to Japan's most sacred and iconic mountain, Fuji-san (Mount Fuji) with its near perfect symmetrical form soaring skywards and towering over the surrounding hills. From Hakone you have one of the best chances of getting a view of Mount Fuji from the various viewpoints to be found throughout the area.

Surrounded by pine tree covered mountains situated along the picturesque Shokawa River, Shirakawago is to be found in the heart of the Hakusan National Park. Besides the beautiful scenery, the unique Japanese thatched-roof farmhouses or 'gassho-zukuri' (literally 'praying hands houses') are the main attraction. The buildings get their name from the steeply sloping roofs which reach down almost to the ground and were designed to cope with the extremely heavy snow fall which affects this region every winter. There are approximately 180 thatched farmhouses, sheds, and barns, most of which were built about 200-300 years ago. The residents of Shirakawago still live in several small villages. The most popular village for visitors is Ogimachi which in 1995 was declared a World Cultural and Heritage Site. Takayama, in the heart of the Hida Mountains is a delightful town, established in the 16th century as the castle town of the Kanamori family and now famous throughout Japan for its old town area of narrow streets containing many well-preserved inns, tea houses, shops and merchants houses with the latticed windows and overhanging roofs characteristic of the Edo period. The town was also renowned throughout the Edo era (1603-1868) for the very high quality of its craftsmen and many of the temples in Kyoto were built by workers from Takayama. The town has many shrines and temples of its own giving rise to the title of 'Little Kyoto'. Just on the outskirts of the town is the fascinating Hida folk village where old farm houses from across the Hida region have been brought together and rebuilt (beam by beam) on a hillside overlooking the town. Takayama's morning market on the bank of the Miyagawa River is famous and well worth a visit to see the stands selling local farm produce, flowers and crafts. There are also some great micro sake breweries affording the chance to sample the wares of Takayama's most famous product! A stay in Takayama is a chance to get a feel for a way of life that really has all but disappeared from modern Japan."

The Shukkei-en garden is well worth an afternoon stroll with a number of teahouses scattered throughout the grounds. The Hiroshima City Museum of Contemporary Art has many pieces inspired by the 1945 bombing. There are also some great views of the city from here."

        "description": "Transfer to Kinosaki Onsen - Kinosaki Onsen is the quintessential Japanese hot spring destination. The town boasts seven bathhouses which sit among pretty streets of traditional wooden buildings and narrow bridges. Visitors to Kinosaki Onsen enjoy a stay in a Japanese inn where sumptuous cuisine is served at low tables in tatami rooms. Afterwards guests dress in provided ‘yukata’ and ‘geta’, light kimonos and wooden sandals, and take to the streets for a pleasant evening stroll around town. Men and women separate and enter the bathhouses for several dips in the different hot springs. For the Japanese, onsen bathing has always been a spiritual experience, as cleanliness and purity are linked to Shintoism. There is certainly something magical about Kinosaki Onsen and the town has inspired Japanese poets and artists for centuries."

A preservation order has been issued by the local authority to keep the traditional character of the town in place.<br/><br/>Kirishima is the first of Japan's designated national parks and is home to an array of stunning sights, including smoking volcanoes, vast plateaux, sparkling lakes, rugged coastlines and dense forests.<br/><br/>Kumamoto is a pleasant castle town which has its place in Kyushu's turbulent history as the island's major government stronghold during the Shogun period.<br/><br/>Nagasaki is Kyushu’s best-known city, made infamous on 9th August 1945 as the site of the second atomic bomb.

For those arriving in time, our tour leader plans to meet you in the hotel reception at 6.30pm for a welcome meeting. Afterwards, there is the option to head out for dinner at a nearby local restaurant where you'll have the chance to sample various dishes in an 'izakaya' style Japanese restaurant. If some of the group are arriving on later flights, the main introductory briefing will take place on the morning of Day 2 with everybody present. There are no activities planned today, so you're free to arrive in Tokyo at any time. Should you miss the welcome meeting, your Leader will inform you of any essential information as soon as you catch up. If you'd like an airport transfer today, you'll need to arrive into Tokyo's Haneda Airport (HND) or Narita Airport (NRT). The hotel is around an hour away from Haneda Airport and an hour and a half from Narita. You'll be met in the arrivals hall and transferred to the hotel by public shuttle bus or private vehicle. The shuttle bus may stop at other hotels, before dropping you at our hotel. As part of our Upgraded range, we also offer a complimentary transfer to those who have made pre-tour accommodation arrangements through Explore, regardless of your arrival day. Japanese hotels have strict rules regarding check-in and all customers are required to wait until 3 PM for room access. You will be able to store your luggage while waiting but if you require an early check-in, then you should request this at the time of booking. We do not guarantee this will be possible and depending on availability an extra fee will be charged. In Tokyo, we stay in a stylish, recently renovated hotel in the smart and exclusive Ginza district. Ginza means 'silver mint' in Japanese and its name is derived from the mint located here between 1612 and 1800. Following the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 the district evolved to become Tokyo's most famous upmarket shopping, dining and entertainment district, with some of the most expensive real estate in Japan."

The inner market, famous for its tuna auctions, was moved in 2018 and is no longer open to tourists. In your free time here we recommend exploring the many food-related shops that sell anything from cooking knives to aprons. A sushi lunch is included today, so you can sample some of the delicious fresh seafood and learn all about what makes great sushi. Continuing in dramatic fashion, we head across town to attend the afternoon fire service at Fudo-do Temple. Here the esoteric Shingon sect performs a ceremony involving leaping flames and the chanting of sacred texts, accompanied by the deafening beat of huge taiko drums. The result is a truly atmospheric experience and an authentic insight into Japanese Buddhist culture. The rest of the afternoon is at leisure."

Although distances are short, we use a variety of forms of transport including bus, boat and cable car as we make our way initially to the hot, bubbling sulphur springs at Owakudani - a volcanic crater formed during the last eruption of Mount Hakone. From here, on a clear day, there are magnificent views of the snow-capped mountain that is so synonymous with Japan. Whilst at the springs, you may wish to join the locals in eating an egg boiled in the sulphur pools - just one is reputed to increase life expectancy by seven years! Our next stop is Lake Ashi, a magnificent lake created from the eruption of the Hakone Volcano over 3000 years ago. A short boat ride takes us to Moto Hakone where you may choose to relax in one of the lakeside restaurants. In Hakone, we are accommodated in a Japanese-style hotel that we've given a comfortable grading. The relatively simple rooms have en suite facilities and each has a private outdoor 'onsen' hot spring bath. We'll have a mixture of rooms, some where you sleep on comfortable, folding futon mattresses and some with low-slung bed frames (tell your tour leader if you have a preference!). During our stay, we learn about local etiquette, such as when to take off our shoes. If you want to give it a go, you can enjoy the pleasures of taking a communal Japanese bath with other same-sex guests, all of which helps enhance our stay in this traditional establishment.

We visit the moving Peace Memorial Park and museum on the site of the 1945 A-bomb hypocentre. Whilst serving as poignant reminders of the nuclear holocaust, their overwhelming message is that such horrors should never occur again. In the evening we can try an okonomiyaki meal, a type of savoury pancake which is stuffed and cooked on a hot plate in front of the diner.

Considered to be one of the most beautiful sights in Japan, the red gate appears to float on the water at high tide with the hills of the island forming a spectacular backdrop. The name of the island translates as 'shrine island' and upon arrival, we visit a majestic 300-year-old Tokujuji temple where we experience a private Japanese tea ceremony, as well as an omamori (Japanese good luck amulet) making experience. There will be free time to explore, visit Daisho-in Temple and the 16th century Shinto Itsukushima Shrine, a UNESCO World Heritage Site which is built over the sea and has a stage where key events in Shinto mythology are enacted. For those who are keen and if time permits this afternoon, there is a 90-minute to two-hour hike to the top of Mt. Misen for superb views out across the Inland Sea and wider setting of Hiroshima and a chance of seeing the monkeys that live on the mountain. For those not wanting to walk, we recommend the option of a cable car that you can take up or down or both. After exploring the island we take the ferry back to Hiroshima."

We will make a stop enroute in Okayama to visit the beautiful landscape garden, which is considered as one of Japan's finest. It is located beside Okayama Castel and the local feudal lord ordered contruction in 1687 as a place for the ruling family to entertain and receive important guests. You will have your overnight bag with you for this visit (unless there is a locker at the station where you can choose to store it). Later this afternoon we complete our train journey to Kurashiki itself and after dropping our bags off at the hotel we will explore the town on foot. Kurashiki is a beautiful town with a rich history dating back to the 1600s as a major area for rice storehouses and a connecting canal network. Many of these old storehouses have been turned into museums, cafes and boutique shops. After a brief orientation tour the rest of the late afternoon is at leisure. You may choose to visit the oldest Western art museum in Japan, the Ohara Museum, featuring a variety of works such as Picasso, Pollock and Kandinsky. For a step back in time, visit Ohashi House to see an old merchant house which was typical for a Japanese townhouse of the 1700s. There is a lack of suitable premium hotels in town so we have chosen a perfectly comfortable and welcoming local hotel for our stay that is conveniently located. We include the luggage forwarding service today to ship our main bags to Kyoto and we travel light with an overnight bag. Please refer to the Trip Information; Budgeting and packing; Luggage on tour sections for more information."

From the silver mines of Iwami Ginzan, the stunning Edo era town of Tsuwano or the castle town of Hagi which was built during the Mori clan wars period. <br/><br/>And then from the main island of Honshu to the smaller islands of Miyajima with its UNESCO World Heritage Itsukushima Shrine, and also Sensui-jima Island both on the Seto Inland Sea. The former is near Hiroshima, so there is a chance to visit the city and also its Peace Memorial Park and A-Bomb Museum as well, both perfect places to contemplate Japan’s contemporary culture of peace and reconciliation.",

You will enjoy physical comfort throughout, whether it’s travelling by fast, convenient shinkansen (bullet) trains, or staying in a ryokan inn with your own private onsen hot spring. But you will also enjoy the comfort of being warmly welcomed wherever you go. A series of locally led experiences give you a far deeper understanding of Japanese culture than most small group tours manage. <br/><br/>Your adventure begins in Japan’s capital, Tokyo. In truth, you could spend two weeks here alone, and never be bored for a moment. But two nights here are plenty to take in a raft of highlights, one of which is sure to be a guided tour of the outer Tsukiji Fish Market. Explore with a local tour leader filling in the details on where the seafood originates, before taking part in a fun and informative sushi-making lesson with a local chef.<br/><br/>From Tokyo you take a short train journey south-west to the mountainous hot spring town of Hakone. Here, you’ll enjoy what will definitely be one of the most talked-about experiences of your stay. This evening you will stay in a traditional Japanese inn (ryokan). Each bedroom has its own private hot spring bath (onsen), set within attractive greenery, and there are several restaurants serving fresh regional cuisine.<br/><br/>Leaving Hakone, take your first trip on a bullet train to the alpine town of Takayama, an Edo-era, riverside community known for its traditional inns and sake. A very scenic spot to base yourselves for a few days as you explore old villages in the countryside, and naturally taking every opportunity to sample the local food and drink. Here the advantage of keeping group sizes to just 12 becomes very apparent – you can dine in small, locally owned restaurants throughout, whereas larger groups are much more limited in where they can eat.<br/><br/>A stop in Hiroshima features a sobering visit to the A-bomb Dome, combined with entry to the Peace Memorial Park and Museum. Hiroshima has a positive outlook on the future, with a citywide focus on promoting world peace<br/><br/>Your Japan tour comes to an end in Kyoto.

With a knowledgeable local tour leader, carefully chosen experiences, and travel by train that puts you alongside local people going about their daily lives, you’ll enjoy the comfort of feeling welcome wherever you go. <br/>",

The building, which has survived earthquakes and war since the mid-16th century, was restored to its full glory in 2015. Explore the castle that was once home to over 10,000 samurai families, learn about their lives and look out over the castle grounds and the city below. Arrive in Kyoto mid-afternoon. Originally founded as Heian-kyo (literally 'tranquillity and peace capital') by Emperor Kammu in 794, Kyoto had its golden age during the imperial court's heyday from 794 to 1185. Join your leader and walk around Gion, Kyoto’s most famous geisha district, and learn about the history of geisha culture as you explore old wooden teahouses and exclusive restaurants. You might want to return here in the evening when it really springs to life. You may also spot geikos (geishas) or maikos (apprentice geishas) with their elaborate dress and make up on their way out to events."

After, visit Daitokuji Temple – the head temple of the Daitokuji School of the Rinzai sect of Zen Buddhism built about 800 years ago. Take part in a short, guided meditation session, then enjoy a cup of green tea while you speak to a monk about the philosophy of Zen Buddhism and the art of meditation. This spiritual experience will reveal a side of Japan that most visitors don’t get to see and is sure to be one of the lasting memories of your journey.

    "generalInfo": "Japan is the 'The Land of the Rising Sun' and is known for many things; from sumo and bonsai trees to samurais and sushi but lesser known is the wealth of wildlife the Japanese archipelago is home to. Much of this wildlife is also rare and endemic and this tour aims to showcase some of Japan's most iconic and unusual species. <br/><br/>By exploring the highlands of the Japanese Alps as well as visiting the subtropical forests of the far south on Iriomote Island, you will be taken on a comprehensive tour of Japan where you will be sure of experiencing the best wildlife watching that Japan has to offer. <br/><br/>As well as seeing some species that are only found in small areas and face numerous problems in their continued fight for survival. So if you wanted to see the iconic Japanese macaques in their hot springs or try and find the unbelievable Japanese giant salamander or maybe track down the rarest species of cat in the world, then this is the wildlife tour for you.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of specific photography based trips. These trips are geared towards people with a vested interest in getting some top wildlife photographs of some of the world’s most iconic and photogenic species and spectacles. This particular trip heads to the some of the best locations for endemic and engaging wildlife on the islands of Honshu, Kyushu and Iriomote.<br/><br/>Japanese wildlife has entered the country from two different ancient landbridges which used to connect the islands to mainland Asia. One was onto the island of Hokkaido and the other to Honshu when the main island was still connected to the smaller southern islands. But Hokkaido was already seperated and so the animals on both have not mixed, as a result the animals found on Hokkaido are usually from the boreal Eurasian ecosystems of northern Asia whilst the animals which inhabit the southern islands have come from more tropical Asia and so you have good differences in the wildlife. <br/><br/>Most of the endemic wildlife lives on the southern islands and there is a general trend towards higher percentages of endemism the further south you go in Japan. This tour focuses on a large range of different endemic wildlife from whales found mostly in Japanese waters to the well known and entertaining Japanese macaque to lesser known endemics such as the Iriomote cat and Japanese badger. But the oddest species we will be looking for is the alien like and enormous Japanese giant salamander which grows to over 1m long and lives in the pristine fast flowing mountain streams of Central and Southern Japan.<br/><br/>All in all we aim to showcase a great wealth of wildlife that is often overlooked, misunderstood or just not known at all in Japan. Travelling with some expert local guides with their specialist knowledge you will be in the best possible hands to find as much wildlife and understand the unique connection between the Japanese people and their environment. <br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Tokyo. There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Japan. Your naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, cruises, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the Japanese countryside. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>The summer is a great time to travel to Japan and see most of its wildlife, animals are active and out of hibernation, often breeding or busy finding food for their young and it is a great time to be out and exploring the Japanese countryside.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it.<br/>• We will stay in a variety of accommodation when on this tour, from quaint boutique style guest houses, larger hotel chains to hotels and lodges that are the chosen accommodation of the Imperial family. The selection of Japanese food available here is wonderful and it is all presented like works of art.<br/>• Spend all the daylight hours searching for wildlife, either at the specific photography locations or driving / hiking around looking for more wildlife.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our photography tour of Japan’s winter wildlife a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Japan so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the Iriomote cat, Ryukyu flying foxes, Japanese martens, Japanese giant flying squirrels, Japanese badgers, Japanese raccoon dogs and many more species. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Japan at other times of year and focusing on other species such as brown bearsm Blakiston's fish owls, Steller's sea eagles and other animals in Hokkaido. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour visits the main island of the Japanese archipelago; Honshu; as well as travelling further south to Kyushu and then further to the Okinawa island group and specifically Iriomote Island. All in all you will travel from temperate to tropical ecosystems throughout this trip.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The activities to find wildlife is a combination of vehicle based and walking, but walking does make the up the majority of the excursions. Hikes can take several hours, the daytime temperatures can be hot and humid and there are some inclines when in the Japanese Alps.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 Years Old<br/><br/>Photo Credits:<br/>Alpsdake<br/>Ryzhkov Sergey<br/>Frank Schulenburg<br/>Phonon.b<br/>harum.koh from Kobe city, Japan<br/>Ma2bara<br/>Koolah (talk)",

Timed for the Sapporo Snow Festival, this guided group tour takes you deep into Hokkaido — the country’s rugged, remote far north — where few visitors venture. It’s a landscape shaped by drift ice, crater lakes and volcanic plains, and ideal for those drawn to wild places, rare wildlife, and the thrill of the unexpected.<br/><br/>Starting in Tokyo, you’ll quickly leave the city behind. In Tsurui, you’ll head out with a local birding expert to observe the red-crowned cranes — a species found only in East Asia, whose winter courtship dances are a striking sight against the snow. Then it’s north to the coast, where an icebreaker cruise on the Okhotsk Sea brings you into Japan’s drift ice belt. It’s one of the best places in the world to spot Steller’s sea eagles, alongside other Arctic migratory species.<br/><br/>But Hokkaido isn’t all hard edges — there are warm springs at Kawayu, colourful local legends at Abashiri Prison, and butter-rich ramen served with blue beer at the dazzling Sapporo Snow Festival, home to more than 400 sculptures.<br/><br/>With our Insiders by your side, every stop becomes easier to navigate and richer in meaning — whether it’s translating a menu, guiding you through a national park, or helping you uncover a story behind the sights.<br/><br/>After the north, the tour arcs back through Hakodate, Kyoto, Shirakawago, and Kanazawa — a route that lets you experience some of Japan’s most iconic destinations, minus the crowds. Snow-dusted temples, mountaintop views, and moments of quiet beauty round out the journey.<br/><br/>This is Japan through a different lens — remote, real, and ready to reward anyone with a little intrepid spirit.<br/><br/> <br/>Activity rating: Active: <br/>Requires a moderate level of fitness.

    "generalInfo": "This Kyoto to Tokyo small group holiday in Japan takes you through the heart of this fascinating country, discovering temples and shrines, castles and hiking trails, riding the Bullet train and, of course, tucking into the sensational tempura, sushi and noodles. This is a well balanced trip, with a mix of included activities, travel to famous cities but also smaller, less well known spots, and lots of free time so you can explore at your own pace. A knowledgeable tour leader will be with you throughout, to offer advice and steer you towards the best experiences.<br/><br/>Begin by spending three nights in beautiful Kyoto, once the capital of Imperial Japan. Visit the city’s most celebrated sites, including the beautiful Ryoanji Zen Garden, Nijo Castle and the golden Kinkakuji Temple. In the evening, wander the streets of Gion, too, the entertainment district at the heart of geisha culture. You’ll have a full free day here – you might like to join a cookery class or hire a bike.<br/><br/>From here, see the abundance of temples dotted through beautiful scenery at Koya-san, and even stay in one overnight, before travelling to Hiroshima to learn more about its sobering Second World War history. You’ll have the chance to stay overnight in a traditional inn, called a ryokan, in Tsumago, a small but beautifully preserved Edo era town along the ancient Nakesendo Highway. You’ll also have the chance to hike some of the Highway, too. Travel on to Matsumoto where you can see its famous castle and finish your trip with three nights in big, buzzing Tokyo. <br/><br/>We use Japan’s brilliantly run and ultra modern rail system for most of the travel, and a seven day Japan Rail Pass is included in this trip. You’ll also have the chance to ride the famous Bullet train, too, zipping around the country in comfort.<br/>",

If you have some free time, step out onto the streets for your first taste of this beautiful city. Originally founded as Heian-kyo (literally 'tranquillity and peace capital') by Emperor Kammu in AD794, Kyoto had its golden age during the imperial court's heyday from 794 to 1185. Kyoto was the capital of Japan for over 1000 years (the name means Capital City) but the emperor and government are now located in Tokyo. After the meeting tonight, perhaps head out for your first taste of traditional Japanese food.

Visit the opulent Nijo Castle – home to the Tokugawa Shoguns who had power over the country during the Edo period. Check out the ‘nightingale floors’ of Ninomaru Palace, which squeak to warn of intruders (like otherwise-silent ninjas). From the castle, it’s a short bus ride to Ryoan-ji – perhaps Japan’s most famous Zen garden – where carefully placed rocks sit in an immaculately raked sea of gravel. Located also nearby is the extravagantly decorated Kinkakuji Temple, immortalised in Yukio Mishima’s novel 'The Golden Pavilion'. This evening, take a step back in time on a walk through the narrow streets of Kyoto's charming Gion district, an entertainment district and the centre of geisha culture, coming alive at night. If you’re lucky you might spot geikos (geishas) or maikos (apprentice geishas) with their elaborate dress and make up. If you’ve got the budget, perhaps attend a tea ceremony at one of the district's teahouses, or splash out on a kaiseki meal in a ryotei (small restaurants serving traditional multi-course cuisine)."

With its many cultural landmarks and historical sites, and the abundance of traditional arts and literature, Kyoto is regarded as the cultural heart of Japan. Kyoto is also a city that lends itself to walking, and there are a number of paths available. Recommended is a gentle stroll through the nearby eastern hills along the ‘Path of Philosophy’ that links Ginkaku-ji – the Temple of the Silver Pavilion – with Nanzen-ji Temple. This walk can be extended south through well-preserved Old Town areas to Kiyamizu-dera (Temple of Clear Water) from where there is an acclaimed view across a wooded gorge toward Kyoto. Also recommended, for those visiting in spring, is a visit to the theatre for a presentation of Miyako Odori (the Cherry Blossom Dance) performed by elaborately dressed maiko (apprentice geishas). Close to Kyoto station, you'll also find the architecturally impressive Higashi Honganji Temple and the almost surreal Sanjusangendo, home to 1001 statues of Kannon.

Founded in the eighth century by the Buddhist saint Kobo Daishi, Koya-san has been a centre for religious activities for over 1200 years. The last leg of the journey takes you through some of Japan’s finest scenery, on a mountain road rising through the clouds, 915 m above sea-level. The most impressive sight on Mount Koya is the massive and mysterious Okunoin cemetery, the resting place of many of Japan's most famous people. Some 200,000 stone statues, wooden totems and sometimes bizarre memorials (a rocket marks the site of a mausoleum interring the workers of an aerospace company) lie throughout this moss-laden forest. After visiting the more interesting of the mountain’s sights, make your way to the comfortable Shukubo Temple Lodging for the night. Here you might interact with some of the monks that run the lodgings, learn about the customs of traditional Japanese accommodation and enjoy some monastic vegetarian cuisine."

The building, which has survived earthquakes and war since the mid-16th century, was restored to its full glory in 2015. The moats, baileys, towers and walled alleyways were ingeniously designed to trick attackers – perhaps so intimidatingly that they were never in fact tested. Explore the castle that was once home to over 10,000 samurai families and look out over the grounds and the city below from the seventh floor.

The dome was just metres from where the bomb detonated so it was able to retain its shape – the fact that it looks almost exactly as it did after the bombing means it serves as a reminder and symbol of peace. The memorial park serves the same purpose, and has museums, memorials and monuments dedicated to the memory of victims, education on what lead to the bomb’s use, as well as advocating world peace. In the afternoon you'll head for the serene, enchanting island of Miyajima, reached after a short ferry ride across the Inland Sea. The island is home to the venerable Shinto shrine of Itsukushima, famous for its huge bright orange gate (torii) that rises majestically out of the sea. At high tide it is considered to be one of the most beautiful sights in Japan. The size and physical landscape of Miyajima makes it an ideal place for walking. There is the lovely Momiji Park (known as Maple Valley), from where it is possible to walk or take a cable car up to the top of Mt Misen.

The highway once connected Tokyo with Kyoto and was immortalised in the famous woodblock prints of Hiroshige. Cars are prohibited in the main street and cables run underground in order to maintain the medieval atmosphere of the town. You’ll have the opportunity to walk along a short section of the old Nakasendo Highway, walking from the post town of Magome along the highway to your accommodation at Tsumago, enjoying some great views across the valley along the way.

This afternoon you'll stroll through the former merchant district of Nakamachi, lined with well preserved old buildings, where you can find local crafts, treasures and great restaurants. You’ll also have the option of visiting the city’s most famous site, the Matsumoto Castle, formerly known as Fukashi Castle. The regal-looking building has an elegant black roof and walls, and is sometimes nicknamed Crow Castle due to its resemblance to the bird spreading its wings. As the oldest original castle in the country (begun in 1592), it’s also one of Japan’s four castles listed as national treasures. You’ll spend the evening here in Matsumoto. Perhaps try the local soba noodles (some of the best in the country) and be sure to get some wasabi-based treats – the pristine waters from the alps make it grow particularly well here."

After lunch you’ll enjoy an alternative view of Tokyo as you relax on a short cruise down the Sumida River. You’ll pass significant buildings like the Sky Tree Tower, Asahi Beer Hall with its distinctive roof-top sculpture, the Sumo Stadium and the former Tsukiji Fish Market complex, gliding under bridges that bisect the river before alighting at the delightful urban oasis of the Hama Rikyu gardens. Here you’ll have time to stroll along paths that were once the sole preserve of the Shogun, who would hunt ducks here in the feudal era. Later you can make your way to the luxurious shopping district of Ginza where, depending on the theatre schedule, you may have the chance to see a short performance of Kabuki, one of Japan’s more spectacular performing arts, or visit the food depachika basement floor of a department store to see the huge range of produce exquisitely displayed."

They will hand you all your transportation tickets including an IC Card with an initial credit of 2000 yen. They will also hand you a pocket internet device and give you an orientation. When you arrive at your hotel they will check you in and show you where you can find some food and the like. The train from Narita Airport to Tokyo Station will take approximately 1 hour. Tokyo is home to approximately 12 million people and can be a bit overwhelming. Beneath this surface lies a city of contradictions: ancient temples and shrines beside high-tech department stores; traditional festivals held in modern neighborhoods; peaceful Japanese gardens below intelligent skyscrapers. For its size and sprawl, Tokyo is an incredibly safe, efficient city with a low crime rate, the trains running on time. Tokyo is a vibrant metropolis overflowing with many fascinating sights, sounds, and experiences for you to enjoy."

This small group tour reveals Japan’s secret delights, revealing a side of the country that few visitors ever see. You’ll travel by public transport, eat at local restaurants and stay at Japanese owned accommodation, to really get to know this beautiful part of Japan.<br/> <br/>The tour focuses on the Tohoku region, which sits north of Tokyo and stretches up to the northernmost tip of Honshu islanda, and contains six prefectures. This remote part of Japan is known for its wonderful scenery, long winters and warm hospitality. Previously little-known to the outside world, Tohoku hit the international headlines in  2011 when it was struck by an earthquake and tsunami. Visiting now is timely. Though most of Tohoku was not affected by the disaster, the region has seen a decline in tourism, so your presence will be greatly appreciated by the hotels, restaurants and museums we visit. For an insight into the devastating earthquake, you will also visit Ishinomaki, one of the towns worst affected by the tsunami, where you can hear first-hand about events from a local volunteer guide.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful itinerary which ventures well of the beaten track into Japan's magical north. You will visit Matsushima Bay, where you can admire one of the top three scenic views in Japan; historic Hiraizumi, with its golden temple; and Naruko Onsen, a charming hot spring town of wood-panelled streets and steamy baths. Outside of the Tohoku region, visit the elaborate temples of Nikko and the abandoned gold mines of Sado Island, known for its taiko drummers.<br/>",

On the 11th of March 2011, Tohoku was hit by the largest earthquake in Japan's history, which in turn triggered a massive tsunami that devastated the region's eastern coast. Kesennuma was one of the towns almost completely washed away by the wave, and in the aftermath several InsideJapan staff members travelled to the town to help with the clean-up and witness the scale of the damage first-hand. Though the detritus has now been cleared, there are still many signs of the tsunami in the area, and it will be many years before the trauma of the disaster has faded. Today you will visit the Kesennuma Memorial Museum, a high school that was almost completely destroyed by the tsunami and has been kept in its ruined state; you will explore the site with an English speaking guide who will recount the events of that day and continuing efforts for recovery. Though it's certainly sobering subject matter, the warmth and generosity of the people of Kesennuma will ensure that your stay here is a highlight of your trip – and you will be left in no doubt that your visit is vastly appreciated. While visiting Kesennuma, you'll also make a stop at the Otokoyama sake brewery for a tour to learn about how rice wine is made, concluding with some sake tasting.

Sado's remote location made it the perfect place for Japanese rulers to send dissenting politicians, artists, and other prominent figures – beginning with a poet in 722 and concluding almost a millennium later in 1700.

On arrival on Sado you will meet your local guide, who will be with you for two full days to help you get beneath the surface of the island. Travelling in a private minibus you'll visit the island's former gold mine, where gold was discovered 400 years ago and briefly made Sado the largest gold producer in the world.

There may not be any real 'tourist' sights but it is just the life on the streets that makes Osaka such a fascinating city to visit. The city aquarium is world class and you cannot stay in Osaka without taking a ride on one of the city's several giant big wheels, perhaps the most dramatic of which is perched on top of the Hep 5 department store in the Umeda district of the city - just don't look down if you are afraid of heights! Osaka Castle is well worth a visit despite being a reconstruction as the original was burnt down during the firebombing at the end of World War Two and you will find a variety of very interesting museums scattered throughout the city. After dark Osaka really comes alive, and a walk through the bright lights of the Nanba district is a great way to take in the atmosphere, with some great people-watching opportunities. With literally thousands of restaurants, bars and entertainment spots to choose from, Osaka is perfect for a big night out, some hearty local food and the chance to let your hair down. Be sure to visit the restaurant and bar district of Dotonbori, down by the canals, where you’ll be able to try local delicacies such as takoyaki (octopus dumplings). Osaka really is one of Japan's truly all action cities and a stay here is a chance to experience what life in modern day urban Japan is really like."

The town is best known for the Snow Light Path festival when the snow-covered streets are decorated with small snow statues adorned with lights, particularly alongside the canal. We normally arrive slightly too early for the festival but a walk around the town is delightful at any time. The town is also famous for fish and seafood and a local dish you may like to try is kaisendon - seafood rice bowl. For those interested we can visit one of Otaru's famous beer halls, returning to Sapporo by train in the late evening."

Hakodate was one of the first ports to open to foreign trade in 1854 and as such has a distinct blend of Japanese and Western architecture. This afternoon we wander through the Motomachi district, a neighbourhood favoured by the new foreign residents located at the base of Mount Hakodate, which gives an insight into how the traders lived and how the cultures merged. In the evening we take a trip to Mount Hakodate for spectacular views down across the city. We include the luggage forwarding service today to ship our main bags to Kyoto which will arrive on day 9, so you will need to pack your day bag for two nights.

        "description": ": Today is a day of travel as we make our way across Japan by train to Kyoto, the old Imperial capital. We will either depart at around 6am or 9am and the journey takes around eight to nine hours with a change of trains in Tokyo. It is a great opportunity to relax and take in the scenery and the high-tech efficiency of Japan's wonderful rail system, complete with an undersea rail tunnel between Hokkaido and the main island. If time allows, you may choose to get up early to see traders in Hakodate's morning market selling fresh seafood that the island is famous for, such as crabs (kani) and sea urchins (uni). Kyoto is the cradle of all things uniquely Japanese and the only large city to escape bombing in WWII. It was the Imperial capital for more than 1,000 years and was at the heart of the events that shaped Japan's destiny. Signs of the past are visible throughout the city in its grand temples and palaces and also the many traditional shops selling wares that have been produced for centuries."

You'll also have the chance to attend a talk given by a A-bomb survivor, no doubt a sobering and powerful talk. If you wish to reflect and explore further, there are some other interesting museums nearby worth visiting. You will have a day pass for the trams in the city, so take the time to explore Nagasaki in your free afternoon. Consider heading over to Dejima – this artificial island was once a Dutch trading post in the 17th to the 19th centuries (and the sole foreign presence in the whole country at one point). The 26 Martyrs Memorial, Oura Catholic Church, and Dutch Slopes also give you a glimpse into the life of the early Christians and European traders in Japan. The Hidden Christian Sites in the Nagasaki Region are also on the UNESCO World Heritage List. This evening, maybe slurp up some champon noodles (ramen, Nagasaki-style)!"

    "generalInfo": "Take the long way round. The interesting cities of Osaka and Maizuru are on close but opposite coasts of Japan’s Honshu Island, but this cruise between the two takes its time. Over nine days you’ll get to visit cities on Shikoku and Kyushu, some of Japan’s other islands, and you’ll even make a stop in South Korea. <br/><br/>Start by exploring Osaka – known as ‘Japan’s kitchen’ for its great delicacies. Once you’ve had your fill of the city, it’s time to set off on the boat, cruising to Tamano in the densely forested Okayama district. The cities en-route are very varied. Kagoshima sits in front of an active volcano, whilst Uwajima keeps traditional customs alive around its 17th century castle. <br/><br/>Hiroshima is a must-see, the city’s Peace Memorial Park a place of peace and hope, and its Miyajima Sanctuary is best known for its photogenic ‘floating’ Torii (gates). The cruise next makes a stop in Busan, South Korea’s second largest city, then head back to Honshu, disembarking in Maizuru. <br/><br/>Whilst on board you can enjoy lectures on Japanese culture and art – which are put into context by the art you’ll see on land in the Taga temple at Uwajima, the ancient sites at Nagasaki, Busan’s art galleries and Sakaiminato, a town that celebrates being the birthplace of one of Japan’s greatest manga artists, Shigeru Mizuki. <br/>",

In the past used as a port where boats would moor while waiting for a favourable wind, the charming and picturesque village now serves to inspire many filmmakers and artists. With good reason, since its craggy landscapes, its cherry trees in blossom, its gentle way of life, its traditional wooden houses and its port, preserved since the Edo era, notably enabled the artist Hayao Miyazaki to make the animated film Ponyo. Anchored on the northern shores of the Seto Inland Sea, in the Hiroshima prefecture, the historical city of Onomichi extends from the main island of Honshu to certain neighbouring islands, linked by the bridges of the Shimanami Kaido motorway. Before becoming this peaceful town with its charming, sloping little streets, Onomichi established itself in the 7th century as a nerve centre of the rice trade for the entire Japanese archipelago. Although its activity is diminished today, the port remains at the centre of the town’s culture. Onomichi now stands out for its exceptional heritage. With good reason, since it can boast over twenty temples and shrines, saved from the bombing of the Second World War. Among them are Senko-ji, offering an outstanding panoramic view over the whole town, Saikoku-ji and its three-storied pagoda, and Jodo-ji and its emblematic eleven-faced statue of the goddess Guanyin."

A trip back in time to the Edo Period, where the hustle and bustle of modern cities is replaced by the gentle sound of fishing boats. Thanks to its 19th century wooden dwellings lining the small, narrow streets, its great causeway, its centuries-old sanctuaries and its gangi stairs, a stone structure giving on to the sea, the old town was classed as a Preservation District by the Japanese state in 1994. The island of Shimokamagari stretches into the heart of the Seto Inland Sea, off the coast of the town of Kure, in the Hiroshima prefecture. A historical city during the feudal period, the island was the theatre of major diplomatic missions for the future and the Empire’s trade relationships, notably with repeated visits from mainly Korean, but also Chinese and Dutch, emissaries. Registered since 2017 on the UNESCO Memory of the World Programme, documentary heritage of these encounters is conserved in the Shotoen Garden, one of the emblems of this lush islet. A magnificent Japanese garden with perfectly kept grounds, interspersed with raked pebbles and surrounded with majestic trees, it is home to a Rantokaku Museum complex, consisting of four exhibition rooms tracing the island’s naval history."

We also visit the volcanic lake of Kussharo for migratory whooper swans on their misty lake home and we have scouted out locations for some very rare and elusive species including the largest owl in the world, Blakiston’s fish owl as well as the tiny but endearing Siberian flying squirrel and the sable (among other species). All of which have locations were their photography is specifically thought about. <br/><br/>But we do not just explore Hokkaido we will also head south to the Japanese Alps west of Tokyo and to the home of the iconic Japanese macaques. Often referred to as snow monkeys, these primates have figured out that the hotsprings here are the perfect place to spend the coldest winter days. <br/>Throughout the trip you will be guided by expert naturalist guides, people with an intimate knowledge of the wildlife and habitats you will be visiting. Whilst the route is well established to visit all of these iconic locations the trip is also tailorable as there are other wildlife locations in Japan during the winter, however they are not necessarily set up for photography (unlike the places we will visit on this itinerary). All you have to do is to get in touch with your budget and your group size and where you would like to go and we will come back to you with an itinerary and quote for your perfect Japanese winter wildlife photography tour.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Tokyo. There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Japan. Your naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, cruises, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the Japanese countryside. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>As the name of the tour suggests this is a winter tour. However the wildlife aggregates from February – early March and we would only recommend booking this tour for this 4-5 week window. <br/>The weather in northern and central Japan during February and March is cold, snowfall is common and the winds from the coastal region (Hokkaido) can be strong. However with the right clothing you shouldn’t notice the cold. <br/>The snows begin to fall in November and they remain over much of the land until mid March.<br/>Whilst in Hokkaido the daytime temperatures can drop to -15oC, however the skies are usually clear and bright, this also increases the glare from the sun as it reflects on the snow and sea ice so sunglasses are highly recommended (as is sun cream). It is also worth remembering that when in Hokkaido in the early morning (pre-dawn excursions for the cranes, swans and also on the ice-breaker boat out of Rausu) the temperatures can be even colder.<br/>Whilst in Tokyo and at Jigodukani Snow Monkey Park the temperatures will feel positively balmy at around -5oC. However warmer temperature are getting more and more common in Japan nowadays and sometimes it doesn’t get under 0oC in Jigodukani in March.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it.<br/>• We will stay in a variety of accommodation when on this tour, from quaint boutique style guest houses, larger hotel chains to hotels and lodges that are the chosen accommodation of the Imperial family. The selection of Japanese food available here is wonderful and it is all presented like works of art.<br/>• Spend all the daylight hours searching for wildlife, either at the specific photography locations or driving / hiking around looking for more wildlife.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our photography tour of Japan’s winter wildlife a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Japan so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the red-crowned cranes, Steller’s sea eagles, Japanese macaques, Siberian flying squirrels, largha seals, Blakiston’s fish owl, sable, whooper swans and many more species. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Japan at other times of year and focusing on other species such as brown and Asiatic black bears and many endemic mammals of Honshu. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour visit various locations in Hokkaido (the most northerly major island in the Japanese archipelago) as well as Tokyo and the Japanese Alps in the largest island, Honshu. All of the locations are specific wildlife watching areas and we will get around with a combination of internal flights, private vehicle and the world famous bullet train.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from a vehicle, boat or whilst standing at a photography station. However there are some hikes we undertake. These are quite easy hikes and last around 1-2 hours with regular breaks in between. When walking on deep snow we will provide snowshoes to make walking very easy.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 Years Old",

Rausu is located on the eastern side of the Shiretoko Peninsula which is the most north-easterly point of the main Japanese islands. It is the largest town of the Shiretoko peninsula and due to the abundance of marine life offshore (thanks to the productive Nemuro Strait current) fishing is a major industry here. However so is tourism; during the summer whale and dolphin watching is very popular and during the winter the frozen sea attracts large num¬bers (the world’s largest aggregation) of huge Steller’s sea eagles and white-tailed eagles. Today we will check into the accommodation and then explore some of the peninsula, including the stunning coastline line here, the sea ice forming intricate and ever changing patterns as far as the eye can see. The Shiretoko Peninsula is famed for its rugged wilderness consisting of high moun¬tains, dense forests and rivers rich in salmon during the summer and autumn. We will try and find many sea eagles and seals on the sea ice and of course deer, foxes, squirrels and other birds and mammals in the forests. Tomorrow we will rise early as we head out at dawn on our first ice-breaker cruise. (breakfast, lunch and dinner)"

This is a very beautiful lake surrounded by snowy mountains and frosted trees as well as steam coming up from the warm lake. It is the geothermal activity deep beneath the lake that is the reason the lake is utilised by whooper swans. This is on their migration route and this lake (free from ice) is home to hundreds of this pure white swans (with yellow and black bills) over the winter. After a morning photographing the swans we will carry on to Abarshiri and check into the hotel. After lunch we will have our second ice-breaker cruise. This part of the Hokkaido coastline also experiences sea ice, however this sea ice does not link directly with the Arctic sea ice (unlike around Rausu) but instead this is a mixture of freshwater and sea water as the ice drifts south from the massive Amur River in Russia and is funnelled (between the east coast of Russia & China and the Kuril Islands). Whilst on the boat we will have the chance to see seals (mostly largha seals, but a number of Arctic species can be found here; including rari¬ties like the ribbon seal that are usually only seen way out in the deep oceans); as well as eagles and from the shoreline foxes and deer. Afterwards you will return to the hotel for your last dinner and night spent in Hokkaido. (breakfast, lunch and dinner)."

Along the trail to and from the hot springs it is possible to see Japanese macaques, they spend the nights in the forest and arrive at the hot springs during the morning; plus there are strict hierarchies in place that dictate which macaques can use the hot springs and which cannot. Also sometimes seen around the hot springs are the endemic and unusual Japanese serow as well as Japanese squir¬rels and various forest birds including species of finches and tits. We will spend the majority of the day surrounded by many macaques as they play, relax and socialise in the warm and steaming hot springs. Their behaviour is incred¬ible to watch and after a couple of hours here you will begin to understand their subtle intricacies and complex language of facial expressions, calls and body language. The macaques are very used to people and they are quite bold, it is a good idea to keep hole of everything in locked bags and zipped pockets, but this boldness does allow for close up photographs."

        "description": "Kyoto is the birthplace of Japanese culture. For over 1,000 years, the city was Japan’s capital. Home to seventeen UNESCO World Heritage Sites, expect your guide to take you to the best, all while avoiding the tourist crowds. For an early morning excursion, there is no better site than Kinkaku-ji, the Temple of the Golden Pavilion. As the soft light of dawn reflects off the temple’s gold leaf surface, you’re transported back centuries past, when only nobility was allowed to gaze upon its beauty. Across Kyoto is Kyomizu-dera, a Buddhist temple with panoramic views of the city and the surrounding mountains. The view is dazzling in the fall, as Japan’s foliage rivals that found in the American Northeast. As you visit Kyomizu-dera and other sites around the city, your guide can show you around, or disappear into the background as you explore with the help of your guidebook. If you wish to dive further into the past, your guide can arrange a day trip to Nara, Japan’s first capital. In the city’s center is Todai-ji, a 1,200-year temple that is also the largest wooden building in the world. Inside is the Daibutsu , a 49-foot high bronze Buddha that has looked out over Nara Park since 753. Standing at its feet, feel the same sense of awe that has come over visitors for the last 20 generations. While in Nara, become friends with the wild deer, considered sacred in Japan’s Shinto religion. For foodies in your group, Kyoto features some of the finest cuisines in Japan. Centuries ago, kaiseki ryori was prepared only for royalty. Kaiseki ryori is defined by its focus on artistic presentation as well as taste. Expect the dinner of a lifetime as waiters bring you a series of small, intricately crafted dishes. During one of your two evenings in Kyoto, experience a traditional tea ceremony led by geisha. Even in the 21st-century, geisha practices are still very much alive, as many young women choose to become apprentices. Though it seems effortless to observers, years of practice are required to perform the geisha’s ancient dances and rituals."

If you wish, your guide can arrange a picnic lunch to enhance your experience. Kanazawa is also home to one of the most well-preserved districts of samurai homes in Japan. Walk in the footsteps of these famous warriors as you explore what were once their homes. Just outside this district is another preserved area featuring shops, cafés, and restaurants. Your day in Kanazawa ends with a sushi feast. As you sit at the bar, you watch your chef prepare a delectable assortment of fine sushi.

It has to, as today you travel deep into the isolated, mountainous areas of central Japan. Though the journey takes a few hours, the time flies by. The nature scenes outside your window turn primordial, and it genuinely feels that you are traveling back in time. Your first stop is Shirakawago, a city where residents live in a combination of past and present. From the outside, Shirakawago has changed little in the last 300 years. The gassho-zukuri thatched roof houses have been built the same way by generations of residents. Arrive on the right day and you may witness one being erected. In many ways, it resembles an Amish barn raising, the whole town chipping in their time and labor. While in Shirakawago, meet the locals and even have lunch in one of their homes. Expect a home cooked meal with rice and vegetables grown right in the valley. After eating, explore the city’s silk museum. Up until the 20th-century, many of Shirakawago’s residents raised silkworms to supplement their incomes from farming. Learn all about the intensive work required to raise these notoriously fussy insects. Takayama is only a short ride away from Shirakawago. Nestled in a valley surrounded by the Japanese Alps, Takayama’s old town is one of the largest in Japan. When you arrive, your guide arranges a rickshaw ride so you can explore the city in style and comfort. During your tour, stop at one of a variety of sites including a sake brewery or furniture factory. No matter which you choose, you witness the care and dedication Japanese craftsmen put into their work. This evening, indulge in Hida beef, known worldwide for its fine marbling. Excellent grilled, it also goes well as part of a sukiyaki or shabu-shabu stew. There is also raw Hida beef sushi that you may sample. No matter how you eat Hida beef, it will amaze your palate.

Checking into your traditional ryokan inn in mid-afternoon, use your free time to relax in one or more or your inn’s many onsen baths.

For fans of Japanese technology or anime , take a private tour of Akihabara, Japan’s anime Mecca featuring classic video games, manga comics, and legions of enthusiastic fans. There is also the Ginza district, where the finest brands have their flagship stores. If you come to Japan at the right time, your guide can arrange an experience that makes Tokyo feel like a second home.

If you wish, take part in one of these festivals, helping to carry the portable mikoshi shrine on your shoulders as you make your way through the city’s back streets. Another option during your time in Tokyo is to take a day trip to Nikko, the burial place of Japan’s shoguns. Once a place where only the samurai could tread, walk on stone paths that reveal some of the most ornate temples and shrines in all of Japan. Though 350 years have passed since they were first constructed, the temples still relay the powerful authority and influence the shoguns once held over Japan. As your time in Tokyo winds down, there is one last treat in store. As Tokyo is home to more Michelin star restaurants than any other city on Earth, have your last dinner in Japan at one of these fine-dining establishments.

For rice lovers, this is an excellent location to pick up a pound or two of Japan’s finest rice, a rare treat to take home, as Japanese rice is not sold abroad. For adults and children of all ages, there is no better way to spend a day in Takayama than visiting Hida no Sato , the Hida Model Village located just outside of Takayama. An open air museum, your family can freely explore the two dozen homes and buildings once occupied by farming families across the region. Immerse yourself in the past by walking barefoot across the centuries-old wooden floor and breathing in the faint scent of burning wood from the homes’ hearths. The museum also offers classes on Japanese weaving, a great chance to make a handmade souvenir."

Even from its highest observatory in the Tokyo Skytree, the metropolis around you stretches on into infinity in every direction. It is still early in the day when your family arrives, and there is no limit to what you can do next. If your family are fans of the films of Hayao Miyazaki, a visit to the Ghibli Museum is a treat like no other. Designed by Miyazaki, the museum resembles a beautiful home that has attractions and exhibits for all ages. Younger children play on a life size cat bus from My Neighbor Totoro , while teenagers and adults explore the interactive displays about how a Studio Ghibli film is made. While there, be sure to stop by the museum’s theater, which shows short Ghibli films found nowhere else in the world. If a passion for art runs in your family’s veins, there are personalized classes in Japanese calligraphy or cloth dying. These classes are led by experts in their fields, and you have the bonus of taking your art with you at the end of your lesson. Tokyo offers a variety of memorable dining experiences, as well. At Zauo, you are invited to catch your own fish from the restaurant’s large tank. After a successful catch, the restaurant’s waiters assist in preparing your fish tableside, or prepare it for you for a small fee. Also, some of the most famous food in Japan isn’t edible at all, but plastic replicas used by restaurants around the country to advertise their meals. Tour the Tokyo street where these replicas are sold. As your time in Tokyo winds down, take the time to reflect on your experiences. Tokyo’s thousands of shrines, temples and gardens provide an oasis of calm within the city’s hectic pace. If you need a little help finding inner peace, let Buddhist monks help you during a class in Zen meditation."

        "description": "Though all the conveniences (along with the hustle and bustle) of modern life exist in Kyoto, you realize right away that this is a city like no other. Untouched during the Second World War, Kyoto represents a wholly unique blend of past and present. How you experience Kyoto during your two days in the city is completely up to you. Depending on your preferences, your first introduction to Kyoto can be any number of unforgettable things. See the morning dawn reflect off Kinkaku-ji, the Temple of the Golden Pavilion. This Zen Temple, dating back to the 14th century, was once the centerpiece of a garden belonging to a powerful statesman. After his death, his son turned the structure into a Zen Buddhist temple to honor his father. Today, the temple and the surrounding strolling garden are some of the most serene places in all of Japan. For the best experience, arrive early in the morning to beat the crowds and see the temple in the soft light of dawn. If you brought your walking shoes, take the Philosopher’s Walk among Kyoto’s cherry trees and ancient canals, where even today the centuries-old stone trenches carry rain water away from the city. Unlike Kyoto’s other popular destinations, the Philosopher’s Walk attracts few foreign visitors despite the many shrines, temples, and scenes of calm nature that line the trail. Kyoto was home to Japan’s emperor until the Meiji Restoration of 1868. Though no longer the emperor’s residence, the Imperial Palace is still maintained by Japan’s Imperial Household Agency, which oversees the royal family’s daily life. While there, the chirping birds and gentle breeze take you back hundreds of years as you follow in the footsteps of generations of royalty. Understanding the life of a Japanese emperor is more than touring his old home. Emperors throughout Japanese history dined on the country’s finest cuisine, kaiseki ryori . Many small dishes featuring the finest ingredients such as marbled beef and fresh vegetables from throughout Japan, each of your senses is engaged to the fullest. And with Kyoto featuring a variety of kaiseki ryori restaurants, you can indulge in this amazing meal no matter your budget. Besides kaiseki ryori , Kyoto’s status as one of Japan’s largest cities gives the traveler a variety of other unique dining options. Have dinner and drinks at one of the city’s many izakaya restaurants, where you can sample some Japanese comfort food paired with ice-cold beer or warm sake. If after an izakaya dinner you feel a little stuffed and just a bit tipsy, that’s okay; that’s what’s supposed to happen. In Kyoto, there are hundreds of personalized, hands-on activities to set apart your tour of the city. Want to get to know the locals? Take a private cooking class in a Kyoto home. With the home’s residents acting as your teachers, prepare a lunch or dinner, and become part of the family as you share in a home cooked meal that you helped make. Need some inner peace? A group of Zen Buddhist monks leads a meditation class every day of the week. While there, learn about the daily life of a monk and the personal stories of the men who choose to continue these traditions while caught in the middle of Japan’s technologically-obsessed culture. At the end of your lesson, you gain a better appreciation for the practices that keep many Japanese grounded in the modern world. Intrigued by Japanese sake? You’re in luck; a major sake brewery and museum are both a quick train ride from Kyoto. There, see how this famous beverage is made from rice grains right from the field to the final bottled product. Enjoy a tasting at the end of your tour, and learn what characteristics set great sake apart from the rest. The tour also gives an in-depth lesson on this iconic beverage and how it has influenced Japanese culture over the centuries. No matter what you choose to do, expect attentive guides and an unforgettable experience. Throughout the tour, rely on your guide to help you with local customs, or answering any questions or concerns you have during your time in Japan."

        "description": "This morning, you are off on Japan’s famous shinkansen towards Hakone. Though it may resemble a jet plane, on the shinkansen, there is no fear of turbulence (or even the slightest shaking) as it travels close to 200 miles-per-hour. Even if you are the lightest of sleepers, it is possible to catch a quick nap to be refreshed for Hakone’s sights and sounds. Hakone is world famous for its natural beauty, breathtaking views of Mt. Fuji, and relaxing onsens , hot spring baths warmed by thermal vents. Upon arrival, you have two choices to immerse yourself in Hakone’s beauty: a cruise on Lake Ashi or a ride on the Hakone Ropeway. Both present Mt. Fuji in the best light. When you gaze upon the mountain for the first time, you finally understand why for centuries the mountain was considered a deity. In the afternoon, take a walking tour of Hakone National Park, where the smell of sulfur is heavy in the air as you weave among hundreds of steaming volcanic rocks. This ‘Hell Valley’ may not be any hotter than the surrounding area, but the pungent smell of sulfur helps you visualize the mythical underworld. While there, be sure to eat a black egg boiled on site in one of the bubbling sulfur ponds. Though somewhat odd looking to westerners, the eggs have a subtle flavor and are said to greatly extend one’s life. Your hotel in Hakone is a ryokan , a traditional Japanese inn with an option for a western style of Japanese style room. Dinner this evening is at the hotel, a multi-course meal similar to your kaiseki ryori experience in Kyoto. After dinner, take a relaxing soak in the hotel’s onsen baths, which feature magnificent views of nature and the surrounding valley. If you wish for a more private onsen experience, it is possible to book a room with its own open-air onsen located on your hotel room’s balcony."

        "description": "New York City may be known as the ‘city that never sleeps,’ but Tokyo is the ‘city that never stops.’ There is always something new to do in the world’s largest metropolis, which you are introduced to on your fifth day in Japan. You arrive in mid-morning, stepping off your express train from Hakone. The morning rush hour is over, but the streets are still teeming with people. As a foreigner in Tokyo, you can’t help but people-watch as the masses swarm around you. To see this from above, there is no better place to do it than from a cafe overlooking the Shibuya Scramble Crossing. From your chair, watch up to 2,500 people cross the street simultaneously. While in Shibuya, check out the iconic Shibuya 109 building, a landmark department store offering the latest in men’s and women’s fashions. Or, if you are interested in a more non-traditional shopping experience, get lost in Don Quijote, a famous wholesaler where goods are packed to the rafters six floors high. You may have a little trouble finding anything you need or want, but what you do discover is guaranteed to surprise you, nonetheless. Whether due to natural disasters or war, Tokyo has rebuilt itself no fewer than six times in the last 400 years. For this reason, you are likely to see shrines butted up against ultra-modern skyscrapers, along with quiet residential areas stuck in the middle of the dense urban setting. This makes Tokyo perfect for curious explorers, historians, or foodies, who find something completely new around every corner. With hundreds of skyscrapers and other landmarks, it is impossible to get truly lost in this great city. Like Kyoto, Tokyo is home to many world-renowned centers of Japanese culture and history. In Ueno Park, the Tokyo National Museum features original woodblock prints by Hokusai, whose work influenced European artists such as Vincent Van Gogh. To make greater comparisons between Western and Japanese art, the National Museum of Western Art is right next door. Its permanent collection features the work of Rubens, Monet, Gaugin, and Renoir. In late March every year, a special event occurs in Tokyo’s Yasukuni Shrine. TV crews from around the city come to televise the blooming of the shrine’s first cherry blossom. One small flower marks the beginning of Tokyo’s hanami , or cherry blossom viewing, season. For the next two weeks, hanami becomes a city pastime as families and groups of friends/coworkers spread out a tarp or picnic blanket under the falling blossoms. Take part in the hanami tradition with a specially prepared picnic lunch that includes a variety of dishes paired with Japanese beer and sake. Speaking of food, Tokyo is also one of the world’s best destinations for fine dining. With its restaurants having won more Michelin stars than those in Paris, it’s easy to satiate your desire for haute cuisine. In fact, the tour’s farewell dinner is at one of Tokyo’s many Michelin star restaurants. Just be sure to state your dining preferences so that we can provide you the dinner of a lifetime. No matter your budget, the hotel for your two nights in Tokyo has western-style rooms, modern amenities, and splendid views of the city skyline."

        "description": "This itinerary has been designed by Allan Mandell, a professional garden photographer and staunch aficionado of Kyoto's wonderful gardens. You'll visit at least 12 different gardens, each emanating the enchantment and originality of the city. Some dance with charismatic enticement and are exquisite spaces that are renowned across Japan and the rest of the world. Yet others are more secretive, hidden gardens firmly away from the tourist trail and awaiting intrepid eyes. Today you start in Keihan-na Park and then move on to the Ikkyu Temple Garden. Tranquility reigns, supplemented by a tailored tea tasting and special shojin ryori lunch. Meditation has always been integral to this city of ancient wonder, how couldn't it be when there are over 1,600 Buddhist temples and 400 Shinto shrines? A meditation instruction session is provided in the temple garden before the afternoon explores the diversity of the city's gardens. Wander past Japan's oldest stone bridge and stand before the 11th century Byodo-in, the bird shaped architecture clearly visible from a distance. Two bronze phoenixes beckon you forward and the graceful lines of its Heian-period architecture transport you back to a distant history. Keep exploring and the gardens continue the escape into a peaceful haven, colors flickering beneath a soft sun and a thousand angles for your camera. Next it's Mimuroto Garden, almost unknown to the international audience but a favorite of local garden devotees. Smells begin to impress; freshness, flickering whiffs of mysterious scents, something exotic yet familiar. In the evening your nose continues its discovery. Enjoy a traditional welcome dinner, followed by a lecture on Kyoto's unique cuisine by Judith Clancy, famed Kyoto guidebook writer and enthusiastic follower of its culinary delights.

You're heading out to the Takagamine neighborhood in the Northern Hills, and like most days on this unique itinerary, you'll be traveling by local transport. This enables a richer submersion in the elegance and diversity of Kyoto, particularly in this time of spring bloom. Endless shades of green mark the journeys, perhaps most memorably found in the lavish new growth on the city's maple trees. Wisteria, iris and azalea are all flourishing, delivering distinct hues to the ever-growing collection of memories. And it's not just natural sights. By taking public transport you're able to explore picturesque, traditional neighborhoods, dazzling city streets, serene garden paths, and a local side to this historic city. So while five unique gardens provide the direction today, there isn't a moment when the charms of Kyoto get diluted. Koetsuji, Genjoan, Joshoji; this morning is a trip through the buoyant flowers of three gardens that receive few foreign visitors. After lunch at a local restaurant you'll visit the large Kurodani Gardens where some of Kyoto's secrets are revealed. An expert garden maintenance demonstration starts to peel away the layers of dedication that keep Kyoto's gardens in such an unblemished state. Pruning pines, controlling maples, effective raking, understanding garden design; it's a lesson exclusive to Kyoto, yet resonant with garden lovers from around the world. And the teacher? None other than Kato-san, president of one of Kyoto's leading garden landscape companies.

Now the verdant landscapes really come alive as the softly spoken instruction of this acclaimed designer accompanies you to the famed Ritsurin Garden and Isama Noguchi Garden Museum. Shikoku epitomizes the graciousness of Japanese culture and the warm exuberance that spring brings to the landscape. While scenic beauty pulls the eyes in multiple directions, the overarching benevolence of both a country and a people add extra doses of enchantment to the itinerary.

Your final guided day continues with the unique garden theme, revealing two gems that are doused in rapturous beauty and absolute tranquility. Again, it's hard to put the camera down in the Rurikoin and Rengeiji Gardens, yet their melodic tones are not purely aesthetic. Sit down. Savor the silence. Listen to whisperings of birdsong that float across the wisteria and azalea. Few places on the planet offer such a break from the modern world. After a yakuzan ryori lunch, it's time to get practical as a local expert teaches you how to make moss balls. Then it's onwards to the Ota-Iris pond, and now the 7th century wonder of Kamigamo-jinga. Wander through the gates of the ancient shrine, then down a long walkway to the ode to Raijin, the God of Thunder. Kamigamo predates Kyoto and the shrine walls seem to emanate secrets and mystery.

You will be out amid rice paddies and gazing across open green fields. This journey will take you by one of Japan’s most iconic mountains, Mount Fuji, a massive volcanic cone of snow and ice. The Shinkansen is the best way to see Japan in a week. A journey like this one is both relaxing and convenient. Plus, you travel from city center to city center, so onward transfers are usually just five or ten minutes. You will arrive in Hiroshima where you will check into your hotel and then head straight to the Peace Memorial Park, which is directly below where the world’s first atomic bomb detonated. The museum is eye-opening, and a visit will open your eyes to what Japan has become. Hiroshima is a beautiful city and the transformation that has taken place is quite remarkable. That essential, yet sometimes sobering visit is followed by something more Japanese and more majestic. As you gaze across the sea, you will see a shrine that seems to levitate on the water. This is Miyajima, an ancient shrine that is cut off at high tide and has also turned into a local miracle. You will admire how it floats, and then you will walk over the bridge to enter a sanctified space with countless legacies. Once inside you will find an unrivaled simplicity, along with a silence that is very persuasive after being in Tokyo. Sunsets will be magical here, so stick around, even if it is just to hear more of the guide’s stories."

You will also have the energy to explore after such a relaxed morning. You will set off by tram with your guide, cruising into charming neighborhoods from yesteryear. The world’s second atomic bomb hit just north of Nagasaki’s center, with most of the blast contained by mountain slopes, so places like 17th-century Dejima have survived. A Portuguese church hides amid the wooden Edo-period buildings. Dutch colonial architecture influences the local style, particularly the rooftops. It is a complete mishmash of styles, especially when you are invited inside period buildings. The architecture contributes to the harmonious feel in Dejima with cultures and histories coming together effortlessly. Other places to visit by tram include the Glover Garden and Catholic basilica, as well as the Nagasaki Peace Statue.

Your Japan vacation begins after your private transfer picks you up at Kyoto International Airport and you check into the Shunkoin Zen Temple Guesthouse, a mystical place with stunning grounds and an effervescent air of authentic Japan. With this tour there's no interrupting the Kyoto spell; this temple guesthouse is the first step in helping you slip into the humble yet exquisite beauty of ancient Kyoto. Behind ancient walls lies the 14th-century Myonshin-ji complex, a network of elegant walking trails and Rinzai school temples. Everything seems to flow and float, dozens of individual sub-temples and pathways blending into an introduction to Kyoto's unique style. Spend the morning at this vast cascading complex, the highlight being a languid wander through the Shunkoin garden. The serenity of a city will already be taking hold, compelling you to slow your steps and ignore time. From Myonshin-ji you enjoy lunch at Kyoto Station. Kyoto's beauty and heritage is not merely an ode to the past. The majority of its gardens and temples continue to be functional and meditative places. At the Toji temple antique flea market there's another sense of history imbued with life: the stalls of trinkets engulfed with a vibrant atmosphere. Today's tour continues with a unique fall opening of Nijo Castle. This iconic early 17th-century castle is one of Kyoto's best-loved attractions although parts of the complex are only opened for a few viewings a year. You'll be among the only eyes that admire veiled areas like the Honmaru Palace, your guided tour pulling together a visual and historic narrative of the first Tokugawa shogun.

As you journey through these gardens there's a wonderful sense of how many contrasting shades of green it's possible to encounter. Arashiyama is an easy area to explore and there will be time to stroll the craft shops and elegant boulevards. Later in the evening, you're treated to a traditional shakuhachi flute recital, resonant yet delicate music delivered from a traditional bamboo instrument. A talk on shakuhachi helps reveal more about this classical music style."

        "description": "Kyoto is a city of countless attractions: home to 17 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, well over 1000 temples, and 400 Shinto shrines. Two free days are included in the itinerary and this allows you to see a very tailored version of the city. Some garden suggestions: the delightful gardens of Ryoanji, Toji-in, and Kinkakuji, are all within walking distance of the temple guesthouse and make for a relaxing day; consider the Philosopher's Path and the delights of Ginkakuji and Honen-in; with advance reservation, it's also possible to explore the imperial gardens of Sento Gosho, Katsura Rikyu, and Shugakuin Rikyu; or maybe this free day can be spent admiring the fall chrysanthemum exhibit that coats Daikakuji temple with an elevated air of mystery. More suggestions on a free day can be seen under day eight below. This evening's talk unveils the history of Buddhism and Shinto in Japan and the profound effect this had on Japanese culture. It's a fascinating insight that further enlightens the temples and gardens experienced during the vacation."

        "description": "Daitoku-ji transports you into an ethereal world, into a utopia of Zen-scapes that soothe the eyes and settle longingly in the memory. These Zen temples and wandering lanes are amongst the absolute highlights of Japan for garden lovers, with your guided tour centered on two timeless classics. Indulge in the repose of the two small gardens of Daisen-in; then wander down a bamboo-lined pathway to maple trees shedding their leaves at Koto-in. Orange and radiant browns settle along the ground and it's hard to think of a more fitting ode to the innovation yet tradition of Kyoto's garden worlds. From Daitoku-ji, today's guided tour continues with Imamiya Shinto shrine, then a lunch at Heian Hotel that's accompanied by stunning views over a garden landscaped by Ogawa Jihei. Like each guided day, all transfers are by private vehicle. Fall is an idyllic time to visit Kyoto, partly for the charming foliage and partly for the fall openings of palaces that are normally closed. Today's afternoon highlight is the Gosho Imperial Palace, open for just a few days a year and reveling in its indulgent visuals and architecture. There are few sights more majestic in the whole of Japan. After being guided through the rooms and courtyards you continue to the Shusui Tei tea garden and relax on the grounds of the Imperial Palace. There's also a chance to visit an authentic incense shop for some unique souvenirs."

        "description": "Kyoto's history can be read in its temples and gardens, the tales of ancient Japan etched into bamboo groves and incense infused shrines. The city's history is also revealed in its traditional townhouses and markets, places that embrace and celebrate what has gone before. After an introductory talk on Kyoto's townhouse architecture, you spend the morning in Nishiki, an old neighborhood that stands proudly amongst the city's modernity. Wander through the food market and feast your senses on the weird and wonderful of Japanese cuisine. Traders' calls beckon you forward to individual stalls with their own eccentric enchantment. And the market's atmosphere also encourages you to experiment and taste something different. Today's lunch is in a traditional townhouse or machiya , offering an ancient feast that's served in a timeless setting. You'll then be guided through the downtown machiya area and break from the architecture in the small Murin-an garden, a treat hidden deep in the heart of the city. Nishiki is a paradigm shift from exploring Kyoto's temples and gardens, something that's reflected in your hands-on afternoon. You'll enjoy an interactive calligraphy lesson and explore the unusual galleries of Kyoto Messe Crafts Museum. This evening is free and a couple of optional night activities continue this vacation's serene ambiance. The gardens of Shoren-in and Kodai-ji are softly illuminated after nightfall, gentle shafts of light offering an elevated sense of design and beauty. Or consider Kyoto's various onsens (public baths), places that idyllically celebrate the city's tradition. You may wish to bathe in local onsens near the temple guesthouse or visit a super-sento to experience their true grandeur."

Its immense maples flicker through graceful tones, lining the narrow streets with archways of soporific splendor. When the branches sweep open the mountain views are equally spectacular, the first notes of winter shimmering far in the distance. Ohara is a tiny town outside Kyoto, a glimpse at Jodo Buddhism and an immersion in ancient rural Japan. You'll spend most of the day here, exploring its famous sights and surrounding yourself with the country charm. Start in Sanzen-in, perhaps the most photogenic of all the gardens on this tour, yet also a place for sitting on a bench and enveloping yourself in the calm. The pathways open onto impressive temples with entrances flanked by the goddess of mercy and the god of wisdom. Stroll and shop your way through the lanes of Ohara, reveling in the uninterrupted impression of history and capitulating to the enticement of antique stores. On the opposite side of Sanzen-in lies Jikko-in, an intimate temple with an evocative history and secluded position amidst country lanes. Ohara showcases a more rustic side to Kyoto and the day's guided tour is complemented by a cafe lunch, visit Rengeiji garden, and Yase Miyakehachiman Jinja."

Marvel at the 1001 statues of Kannon, the Buddhist goddess of mercy, at Sanjusangen-do temple, a 12th-century masterpiece with an unflinching magnetism. Head far from the typical tourist trail at Chishaku-in garden - a place to reflect on how Kyoto is painted with a humble devotion to charismatic design. You'll visit a wagashi sweet-making shop and indulge in their unique creations, then marvel at the intricacy on display at Kawai Kanjiro home and pottery studio. As each day on this vacation, there's always likely to be some unexpected discoveries, spontaneous finds that appear like apparitions amongst falling leaves. While these guided days have a set schedule of sights, the exact timing is flexible and will respond to the group's wishes. Note that this tour has a maximum group size of 12. Enjoy lunch at Shibazaki and spend the post-dining hours admiring the astonishing lacquer-ware collection, thousands of handcrafted pots, and boxes painting patterns of elegance. After a chance for souvenir shopping in the Kiyomizu hill pottery district, the guided part of this vacation comes to an exquisite conclusion at Kiyomize-dera, high above Kyoto. A temple has stood here since the year 798 and the gargantuan veranda continues to hang above the hill. From this world-renowned landmark, there are commanding views over the city you've been discovering. Keep exploring: sampling the healing waters of Otowa-no-taki, admiring delicate temples and captivating shrines, and sensing the spirituality as you enter the symbolic womb of a female bodhisattva at Tainai-meguri. The Kiyomizu-dera complex is one of Kyoto's largest and you enjoy a leisurely few hours here."

The floors still chirp as you tour the inner sanctum, and those with a keen eye may spot some of the acute shogun’s other construction tricks like secret passages, concealed closets for extra bodyguards, and concubine dormitories. In Kinkaku-ji, known as “the Golden Pavilion” you can find the entirety of the top two stories gilded with gold. The villa was built upon the shores of a large pond and on a sunny day, the reflection in the water shimmers. Continue to the temple of Higashi Hongan-ji to find an imposing wooden house of worship split off from the Nishi Honganji temple.

        "description": "This morning, your hotel offers a buffet breakfast. After eating, your guide for the day picks you up at the hotel. Today is a day of sightseeing in this magnificent city, using the efficient train system to zoom between destinations. Your first stop is the Hamarikyu Gardens located on the shore of Tokyo Bay. Over 400 years ago, the gardens were owned by the Tokugawa family, the most powerful family in Japan during the Edo Period (1603-1868). With freshwater ponds, seawater moats, and exquisitely maintained gardens, you feel transported back to the 17th-century. To enhance your experience, a tea house in the park’s center offers matcha green tea and traditional Japanese sweets. From the gardens, you board a Sumida River cruise that takes you into Tokyo Bay. Revel in the skyline as the scenery constantly changes. The cruise disembarks in Asakusa, where you continue on foot to Senso-ji, Tokyo’s oldest Buddhist temple. Guarded by the largest paper lantern in the city, Senso-ji is a testament to Tokyo’s past. Lunch is on your own, but in a city like Tokyo, it is no challenge to find anything from haute cuisine to filling fast food. In fact, some of Tokyo’s best food on the go is sold in the city’s train stations. Don’t be surprised to find selections ranging from Italian pizza to kaiten , conveyer belt sushi restaurants, right next to one another. You go from ancient to modern as you travel west to Omotesando, a high-end shopping district that can be compared to the Avenue des Champ-Elysees in Paris. The tree-lined streets provide excellent shade as you experience the rich life touring the various stores and sights. In the late afternoon, visit Meiji Shrine. One of the largest shrines in the city, it is dedicated to the spirit of Emperor Meiji, Japan’s first modern emperor. Walk down the dirt paths, admiring primordial nature just a few feet away. At the shrine itself, learn the purification rituals required to enter a sacred space before offering your prayers by writing them on a small wooden tablet. With the light filtering through the tree canopy, it is a magical way to end your first full day in Japan."

Marvel at the intricately carved reliefs and the scenes depicted within. Tamozawa Imperial Villa is only a short bus ride away from Toshogu Shrine. Built in the waning days of the Edo Period, the villa became a summer residence for Japan’s imperial family, who visited each year up until the end of the Second World War.

Your first destination of the day is Magome, once a post town that offered travelers rest and relaxation. The town is beautifully restored, and with the majestic Japanese Alps as the backdrop, you feel transported back in time as you explore the variety of small museums, shops, and restaurants. To immerse yourself in the past, your day features a five-mile hike between Magome and Tsumago. Stroll along the restored path in soft afternoon light, stopping periodically to admire blooming flowers or the foliage. Magome offers a luggage transfer service for a small fee. When you arrive in Tsumago, your bags are waiting for you. Tsumago is truly a town worth exploring. You notice right away that the aesthetics are more rustic, and blend in with the surrounding environment.

For the next four hours, you admire beautiful scenery as your train slowly twists and turns through the mountainous terrain. You arrive in the Takayama Valley, home to some of the most well-preserved sights in the entire country. You begin your tour of Takayama with a visit to the city’s shitamachi , or old town. The blocks of Edo Period warehouses are impeccable, and craftsmen inside still use traditional methods to produce everything from sake to furniture. Most craftsmen allow visitors inside, and offer tours. For lunch, you might want to sample a local delicacy: Hida beef sushi. Hida beef, with its fine marbling and texture, rivals the taste of the finest Bluefin Tuna. In the late afternoon, check into a ryokan , a traditional Japanese inn. Featuring many of the same amenities at the minshuku in Tsumago, your ryokan in Takayama includes an onsen bath open to the ryokan’s guests. A great way to rest sore muscles, relax like the Japanese as you soak in hot mineral water. Feeling refreshed, sit down to another kaiseki dinner in either your room or the ryokan ’s banquet hall. Even if you missed out on Hida beef at lunch, it is featured as part of your meal this evening, along with many other regional and seasonal delights grown in the Takayama Valley."

        "description": "Takayama is famous for its morning market. Each day farmers and artisans come from their homes in the Takayama Valley to sell their wares. It is a perfect place to pick up a souvenir or local ingredients you can take back home to share a taste of Japan with family and friends. At noon, you catch a bus to Shirakawago, a UNESCO World Heritage Site famed for its gassho-zukuri thatched roof houses. Arriving after only an hour’s journey, you are struck by the roofs’ unique architecture, designed to hold up the heavy snow that collects there each winter. Your first stop is the Wada house. Once owned by one of the town’s richest families, the house has had many roles in its 300+ year life: home, storehouse, silk factory, and government office. Inside, tour the displays explaining the process of silk worm raising, an industry that for many centuries was the town’s specialty. Wada house owns its long life to the local community, who have maintained the village’s structures for centuries. The construction of a single roof requires the labor of dozens of individuals, and is akin to an Amish barn raising. Even today, when the families in Shirakawago have all the amenities of 21st-century life, traditional building practices persist. This evening, you have the opportunity to stay in a gassho-zukuri minshuku run by a local family. You can expect the same mouthwatering cuisine and comfortable accommodations as your time in Takayama."

The 90-minute ride flies by as you leave the mountains behind and begin to smell the sea air. Kanazawa is known for being home to some of the most talented artisans in Japan. The small shops along the city’s streets offer everything from intricately designed lacquer ware to hand made paper speckled with gold leaf. For dinner, take advantage of one of Kanazawa’s excellent sushi restaurants. You tell your chef how much you are willing to spend for your meal. The chef then creates a delectable platter of fresh sushi. As you eat it, close your eyes to taste the faint hint of the sea, a hallmark of the finest sushi.

After breakfast, we recommend starting with the Nagamachi district, a preserved area where hundreds of years ago samurai lived with their families. Within this district is Nomura house, a renovated samurai home with many historical artifacts on display, items the samurai used in their daily lives. Just a few steps away is the Shinise Kinenkan Museum, a renovated Edo Period pharmacy. Touring the display, learn about how the Japanese merchant class prospered while the samurai class declined. Just outside the Nagamachi district are many outdoor cafes and tea houses where you can enjoy lunch before continuing your self-guided tour of the city. Visit the 21st-Century Museum of Contemporary Art, a stunning contrast to the ancient history in which you were just immersed. One of Japan’s most popular museums, the interactive exhibits rekindle child-like curiosity. One of the most famous displays is Leandro Erlich’s “Swimming Pool.” Looking down into the shimmering water, it appears as if the other museum patrons are walking along the bottom of the pool. Yet they are completely dry, an astonishing optical illusion. In the mid-afternoon, you begin your four-hour train journey to Hiroshima. It is recommended that you purchase a bento box meal your journey, as dinnertime will have already passed when you arrive. Your hotel for your two nights in Hiroshima is western-style."

After a brief train and ferry ride, you arrive on Miyajima island, where friendly deer come to greet you. Nearby is Itsukushima Shine, home to the world-famous ‘floating’ torii gate. For the last 900 years, the shrine has held a deep significance in Japan’s native Shinto religion. If you arrive at low tide, it is possible to walk out into the bay and feel dwarfed by the torii ’s size. Walk further inland and you discover the sweet smells of momiji manju , a maple leaf-shaped pastry stuffed with all sorts of delicious fillings. Around lunchtime, the smell turns to barbequed oysters, a local delicacy harvested from the oyster beds right offshore. For the best view of Miyajima, take the ropeway to the peak of Mount Misen. From there, you find spectacular vistas of the Seto Inland Sea and Miyajima’s rugged terrain. Head back to Hiroshima in the early afternoon to tour the Peace Memorial Park and Museum. This part of the city, the epicenter of the atomic bombing in 1945, has become a permanent memorial to the lives lost and lessons learned from the Second World War. Begin your time there at the Genbaku Dome, one of the few buildings to survive partially intact after the bombing. From every angle, it presents a new view of destruction, but also to the preservation techniques the city has employed to ensure that this reminder of war is never lost. Only steps away is the Cenotaph, a memorial surrounded by water containing the names of those lost in the bombing. From there, you head into the Peace Memorial Museum. The 50 yen (approximately 50 cents) price of admission ensures that all visitors can experience both the story of the bombing and learn how Hiroshima has dedicated itself to the goal of worldwide nuclear disarmament. After spending time reflecting on the past, use your last evening in Hiroshima to enjoy the city’s finest comfort food: okonomiyaki . A savory pancake dish stuffed with cabbage, seafood, and noodles, it is a filling meal best paired with lots of cold beer."

Experiencing its beauty requires good walking shoes, as pilgrims and visitors must walk up over 1,300 steps flanked by dense forests which provide ample shade on sunny days. It is possible to take your time during the climb, as there are stops along the way perfect for taking photographs or rest. You discover that the walk is worth it when you arrive at the main hall. With its combination of Shinto and Buddhist architecture, Kompirasan is a symbol of how these two religions, so different at first glance, blend seamlessly in Japanese culture. Spend your time here exploring the grounds and gardens. After making your way back down the stone steps, check in to your ryokan . Rest your tired feet and legs in the ryokan’s onsen baths, some of the best in Japan, before sitting down to a feast of local seafood caught fresh from the Seto Inland Sea."

In the early afternoon, you meet your guide for the day at Nishiki Market, known throughout the country as ‘Kyoto’s kitchen.’ Your guided tour begins in the market. There are over 100 stalls selling all matter of fresh produce, meat, seafood, and packaged ingredients perfect to take home with you. Your guide assists you in buying specialized ingredients for your Japanese cooking class later in the day, making you part of the market’s 700-year-old history. Before your cooking class, stop by a sake brewery in the city center. Despite modern advances in brewing technology, watch master brewers use traditional methods to make some of the finest Japanese sake. At the end of the tour is a tasting, and an opportunity to buy any sake that you find pleasing. In the late afternoon, you arrive at a renovated Kyoto home, residence of the chef who teaches you the secrets of Japanese cuisine. Over the course of an hour, prepare a variety of dishes from sushi, miso soup, and dessert. This evening, enjoy a dinner that you created.

        "description": "This morning, your guide picks you up at your hotel. Your first stop is Nijo Castle, where in 1603, the shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu built his Kyoto residence. For over 250 years, Japan’s shoguns stayed at this impressive fortification while in Kyoto on business. Now open to the public, explore its grandeur and feel transported back to Japan’s feudal past. While inside, see the area where the shogun would receive guests, and the secret rooms from where his bodyguards would watch over the proceedings. Outside, the tree lined walking paths are at their most beautiful in fall, where the foliage turns brilliant shades of yellow and red. From there, you head to Ryoan-ji Temple, known worldwide for its rock garden. Every day the temple’s monks maintain the 500-year-old design, a representation of the world’s oceans. Situated far away from modern Kyoto, it is a perfect spot for mediation. Kinkaku-ji, the Temple of the Golden Pavilion, is surely Kyoto’s most impressive sight. Completely covered in gold leaf, the temple is a work of art and a Zen Buddhist temple. Walking around the temple moat, you feel enchanted by its beauty. Your final stop of the day is Kyomizu-dera. This Buddhist temple’s location on a mountainside provides visitors with breathtaking views of Kyoto and the surrounding mountains. Like Nijo Castle, the view is best in fall, when the changing colors turn the mountains into a striking landscape. As you leave the temple, walk back down towards Kyoto through the Higashiyama district. The preserved Edo Period buildings offer a variety of restaurants, souvenir shops, and small grocery stores that sell local ingredients. This evening dinner is on your own, but with the wide variety of options in Kyoto, finding a satisfying meal is no trouble."

        "description": "Today you have the option of using your Japan Rail Pass to visit Nara, Japan’s first capital in the 8th-century. Though Nara was only the capital for 74 years, this era was arguably the most important in Japanese history. The emperor had complete control over his country, and Buddhism, a religion imported from China, was officially adopted by the Imperial Court. To honor their new faith, the emperor commissioned the construction of Todai-ji, a Buddhist temple that even today is one of the largest wooden buildings on Earth. Standing in front of Todai-ji, it is impossible not to feel small. Even so, the structure was once more magnificent. Until an earthquake destroyed them in the 12th-century, the temple was flanked by two nine-story pagodas that were taller than the pyramids of Giza. Inside the temple, you discover the Daibutsu , a 49-foot tall bronze Buddha that dates back to the 8th-century. Notice the faint smell of incense as you tour the hall and surrounding gardens. Nara is also home to Nara Park, where hundreds of sacred deer freely roam the grounds. After centuries of interaction with humans, they are very tame, and are even known to bow at visitors in order to receive treats. Nara is also home to many other temples and cultural treasures. In the Nara National Museum, for example, view some of the finest examples of Japanese calligraphy dating back over 1,000 years. No matter how you choose to spend your last day in Japan, take time this evening to reflect on all the places you have seen, things you have done, and wonderful memories you have made. Your final night in Japan is spent at your Kyoto hotel."

        "description": "Arguably the capital of the world, Tokyo presents the first time visitor with a multitude of first impressions, many of them contradictory. Teenagers dressed in the wildest fashion trends ride the metro alongside the most formal businessmen. Just around the corner of any ultra-modern office building might be a centuries-old shrine or temple. Today, explore the present and the past at your own pace. In the early morning, take a leisurely walk through Meiji Park, a peaceful oasis in the middle of Tokyo’s urban chaos. Deep inside the park, you hear only the gentle rustling of birds’ wings and the brooms of Shinto priests sweeping Meiji Shrine. There is no smell of exhaust, just a hint of incense floating on the air. Before entering the shrine, learn how to purify yourself and offer prayers to the gods, traditions that the Japanese have followed since the beginning of their recorded history. Leaving Meiji Park, ride the Tokyo subway to your next destination, the Ginza District. As you climb up the subway steps to street level, you are greeted by the iconic Wako Department Store, one of the few large buildings in Tokyo to survive the Second World War. Ginza’s stores sell everything from robots at the Sony Showroom to the latest fashions at Hermes. The options for lunch are limitless. If money is no issue, Tokyo’s fine dining restaurants have won more Michelin stars than Paris. If food on-the-go is more your style, try the Japanese take on fast food at Freshness Burger, or pack yourself between the throngs of loud salarymen at one of the many conveyor belt sushi restaurants outside Ueno Station. In the afternoon, get a bird’s eye view of the city from the Tokyo Skytree. You can see fifty miles in any direction from the observation deck, including glimpses of the iconic Mount Fuji in the west. For risk takers, stand on the observation deck’s glass floor to catch the view 1,500 feet below you. As afternoon turns into evening, your dinner is at Kaikaya, a cozy restaurant featuring a wide variety of sushi. No matter your particular sushi tastes, each bite carries the faintest hint of the ocean, a hallmark of the finest Japanese sushi. After your meal, step out into the Shibuya nightlife and let the flashing neon, blaring advertisements, and endless crowds bombard your senses. Take part in Shibuya’s famous scramble crossing, where traffic stops in every direction to let thousands of people cross the street at once. While in Shibuya, don’t forget to say hello to Hachiko, a statue commemorating a loyal dog who waited for his deceased owner for years just outside the station’s entrance."

From your seat, watch concrete and asphalt transform into tree-covered mountains, deep ravines, and rushing rivers. Your destination is Obuse, a ‘small’ town of only 11,000 people where ancient traditions are still practiced. Your first stop in Obuse is the Hokusaikan Museum. Hokusai was the master of Ukiyo-e , traditional woodblock printing that has defined Japanese art for over two centuries. In this museum, once home to Hokusai, learn all about this traditional art and view some of Hokusai’s most famous pieces in an intimate setting. Like Ukiyo-e , sake brewing is one of Japan’s oldest traditional arts. At the Masuichi-Ichimura Sake Brewery, the air is heavy with the strong smell of yeast as your guide instructs you on the brewing of Japan’s most famous beverage. At the end of the tour, sample a wide variety of sake during a private tasting. If you prefer to pair your sake with food, your guide can arrange a lunch reservation at the brewery’s award-winning restaurant. After lunch in Obuse, take a scenic walk to the Yudanaka Onsen. Onsens , naturally occurring hot springs, are popular with both Japanese people and the country’s wildlife. At Yudanaka, view the famous snow monkeys enjoying the warm waters. In the evening, check into a minshuku , a renovated travelers’ inn dating back to the 18th century. You room features straw mat floors know as tatami , along with sliding rice paper doors. Along with its historical charm, this and all inns on the tour offer all modern amenities you would expect in a western hotel. In your room, don a yukata , a traditional Japanese robe designed for relaxation and comfort. A hotel attendant delivers dinner to your room: fresh meat and vegetables harvested from across the region."

        "description": "Today offers a remarkably unique experience on your tour of Japan’s past. In the morning, say goodbye to Kyoto and board a local train heading south into some of Japan’s most mountainous terrain, where the dense canopy provides permanent shade on even the sunniest of days. In the 9th-century, the monk Kobo Dashi chose Mount Koya for his temple after many years of wandering. For him, the location was ideal, as the mountain’s eight peaks resemble a blooming lotus flower. From this location, Shingon Buddhism was born. Today you step into the world where at over a hundred temples, monks continue the practices that Kobo Dashi started 1,200 years ago. Your time on Mount Koya is much more than just observing local traditions. Your accommodations this evening are a Buddhist temple that has for centuries offered lodging to pilgrims and travelers. After settling into your room, a monk will take you on a private tour of the temple grounds. As Buddhist monks abstain from meat, your dinner this evening is the same locally-harvested vegetarian cuisine that the monks prepare for themselves. After dinner, take in Mount Koya’s true beauty with a nighttime walk among flickering stone lanterns, temples, and cemeteries."

If hunger should strike during the journey, take advantage of the trolley service. Though prepackaged, these meals’ freshness matches any of the food you’ve had so far in Japan.

Keeping an overnight bag with you, the majority of your luggage is sent on ahead to Takayama for your arrival the following day. Your first stop is Hase-dera Temple. Dedicated to Kannon, the goddess of mercy, your breath is taken away as you first behold the nearly 30-foot-statue. Covered in gold leaf, it is a stunning sight to behold. Next to the Kannon is the Kannon Museum, home to a variety of artifacts from when Kamakura was the center of Japan’s government and religious life. From Hase-dera, you walk to Kamakura’s most famous Buddha, aptly named the Kamakura Daibutsu, or Great Buddha. Dating back to the 13th-century, it has survived multiple earthquakes, tidal waves, and fires, which destroyed surrounding temples and shrines. Looking out over Kamakura and Sagami Bay, it is a near-immortal reminder of the influence of Buddhism in Japanese life. Your last stop in Kamakura is also one of the city’s most serene: Hokoku-ji Temple. Rebuilt after the Great Kanto Earthquake in 1923, the temple is surrounded by more than 2,000 bamboo stalks. The atmosphere is nothing less than magical as you sit in the temple, enjoying a hot cup of fragrant green tea. Look closely through the bamboo and you may notice the small caves carved into the rocky hillsides. These tombs once contained the ashes of Kamakura’s most powerful nobility. In the afternoon, your guide takes you to Hakone by train. For centuries, Hakone has been a destination where the Japanese have come for rest and relaxation. Its naturally occurring hot springs, idyllic lakes, and Mt. Fuji views make for a splendid time. After arriving, check into your hotel, the Hakone Yumoto Hotel and Onsen. In your authentically Japanese room, expect tatami mat floors and futons. The hotel’s onsen baths make for a perfect end to your day. Though dinner is not included on this day, we recommend that you take advantage of the hotel’s multi-course dinner which incorporates meat and fresh vegetables from the Hakone and Fuji Five Lakes Region."

Depending on the weather, your guide provides you with many splendid experiences as possible, ranging from a Lake Ashi cruise to a ropeway ride. The view, the most spectacular in the fall, puts you at ease and leaves you without a care in the world. Around lunchtime, you begin your journey to Takayama, one of the most well-preserved cities in Japan. Traveling by train, time seems to flow in reverse as you see fewer and fewer buildings, telephone lines, and other signs of the 21st-century. During your train ride, indulge in a bento box lunch bought either on board or at the train station. Though pre-packaged, you discover the food is as fresh as anything else you have dined on so far in Japan. In Takayama, you will enjoy your accommodations and the included kaiseki dinner featuring Hida beef, one of the finest cuts of beef in the world. You also discover that your meal is a feast for the senses. Each item is meticulously placed to entice you. Much of the food is new to you, but you find yourself savoring every bite. In the evening, take a relaxing soak in one of the ryokan ’s many onsen baths before turning in for the night."

Your first stop is the morning market, where farmers and artisans from around the city and valley come each morning to sell their wares. It is an ideal place to buy a souvenir or a few culinary ingredients for a meal you make back home. Only a few minutes’ walk away from the market is Takayama-jinya, the city’s government office during the Edo Period. A far cry from your local DMV, the office has the aura of a palatial mansion with its ornate art and gardens. Walking barefoot on the wooden floors, there are many places to simply stop and enjoy your surroundings. After lunch on your own, the rest of the day is a self-guided tour of Takayama’s old town, where many of the buildings date back to the 16th-century. It is possible to tour a sake brewery, where brew masters still use traditional methods to make this fragrant, complex beverage. You can continue your guided tour of Takayama, which includes some lesser known sights and a side trip to the nearby Hida-no-Sato open air museum. In this museum, wander through over 30 Edo Period homes, gaining a deep appreciation for the generations of men and women who walked these same floors centuries ago. If you gained a taste for Hida beef the night before, try one of the city’s many Hida beef restaurants for dinner. Depending on the restaurant, you can have the beef as part of a stir-fry, stew, or even as sushi. The later is particularly flavorful, akin to the finest Bluefin Tuna."

Koya, one of the most sacred sites in Japanese Buddhism. In 805, the monk Kobo Dashi selected Mt. Koya for the site of his temple after many years of wandering. For him, the location was perfect as the mountain’s eight peaks resembled a blooming lotus flower. Over the centuries, over 120 temples were constructed along the mountain ridges. Over their long history, Mt. Koya’s temples have offered to lodge pilgrims and travelers alike. Tonight you join in this tradition as you check into your hotel, a working Buddhist temple. After setting into your room and meeting the monks, take the time to wander the stone pathways that link the temples together. Along the path are stone lanterns lit each evening after dusk, and graveyards containing the remains of thousands of monks who have called Mt. Koya home over the centuries. This evening, you dine on the same vegetarian cuisine as the monks. The meal may look simple, but the food represents the monks’ dedication to their religious beliefs."

Afterward, eat with the monks before venturing to the Okuno-in temple, the final resting place of Kobo Dashi. According to the beliefs held by many of the monks, Kobo Dashi is not dead, but meditating so deeply that he has transcended life and death. The temple is a fitting memorial to the man who gave life to Shingon Buddhism. After lunch at Mt. Koya, your guide joins you for the three-hour train ride to Osaka. Known internationally as ‘Japan’s kitchen,’ Osaka is a sprawling city of millions centered around the bustling Dotonbori District. In the afternoon and evening, take a self-guided tour of this bustling area. You feel as if you are in Times Square as you walk under the bright neon advertisements. Your guide is happy to show you some of the best sights in downtown Osaka. Besides the Dotonbori District, you see the some of the city’s best Shinto Shrines and Buddhist Temples. In the evening, you dine at a popular kaiten , or conveyer belt sushi restaurant. Watch plates of delectable sushi rotate at eye level. You may ‘eat yourself to ruin,’ as the Osaka saying goes, but don’t worry. It’s an Osaka tradition not to be missed. Your hotel this evening is western-style. If you do not elect for an extra tour, dinner this evening is on your own."

Himeji is home to Himeji Castle, which many consider to be Japan’s most magnificent. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it is original to the early 17th-century. As you wander through the gates and winding paths, you are transported back into the past, a time when the castle was used as a military fortification. The grounds are most beautiful in mid-spring when blooming cherry blossoms turn Himeji Castle into a paradise. After lunch near Himeji Castle, you once again board the Shinkansen for Miyajima. Arriving at Miyajima requires more than the Shinkansen, you discover, stepping onto a ferry just outside Hiroshima Station. The 10-minute cruise to Miyajima reveals Itsukushima Shrine, its bright red torii gate ‘floating’ in the water at high tide. As you disembark, friendly deer native to the island come to greet you. At Miyajima, late afternoon and evening are a magical time of day. Most of the tourists have left, and the island’s structures exude a small-town charm lost in so many other parts of Japan. Tonight you stay in a ryokan on Miyajima, and feast on a kaiseki dinner. After your meal, soak in the onsen baths, or walk through the town at night. With very few streetlights, the stars and moon guide your way."

The ropeway takes you to Mt. Misen’s summit, offering panoramic views of the Seto Inland Sea, Hiroshima, and Miyajima’s mountainous terrain. From the summit is only a short walk to Reikado Hall. Here, Kobo Dashi received religious training before venturing to Mt. Koya. The same eternal flame he tended in the 9th century still burns here, and was the source of fire for Hiroshima’s “Flame of Peace.” Back down the mountain, you discover the smell of sweet pastry. It is Momiji Manju, a local delicacy stuffed with different savory fillings. Sample one (or all of them) as you walk among the different confectionary shops. Just steps away are oyster restaurants. Oysters are Miyajima’s seafood specialty. From the shore, the oyster beds stretch out as far as the eye can see. Raw or barbecued, they pair excellently with local beer.

In the Peace Memorial Park, you see moving sights such as the mound containing the ashes of over 70,000 people who were killed by the atomic bomb. In the museum, gaze upon artifacts such as watches forever stopped at 8:15 am. There are also items you can touch, including roof tiles that boiled when the bomb exposed them to temperatures exceeding 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Leaving with many lessons of the past, you depart by shinkansen. Two hours later, you arrive in Kyoto, Japan’s ancient capital. The emperor’s residence for over 1,000 years, the city is steeped in history, which you explore over the next few days. Your accommodations in Kyoto are at a ryokan .

        "description": "After breakfast, your guide picks you up at your hotel for a day of exploration. Your first stop is Ryoan-ji temple. Constructed over 500 years ago, the temple’s main attraction is its signature rock garden. Its design maintained daily by monks, the 15 large stones that make up the garden have a unique feature. No matter which way you look at them, you can only see 14 at one time. This curiosity represents a key tenant of Buddhism. Though the garden itself may be complete, our ability as human beings to perceive is limited. We cannot see (or comprehend) the entirety of existence. Kinkaku-ji is a short bus or taxi ride away from Ryoan-ji. One of the most spectacular temples in Japan, Kinaku-ji’s gold-leaf exterior is nothing less than perfection. In the temple’s moat, a second temple forms in the rippling waters. After a noodle lunch, you head to a Kyoto home to learn about the tea ceremony. When the tea ceremony was first developed over 400 years ago, it was a way to bring order to a chaotic and unpredictable world. Practiced by samurai in order to train their minds, the ceremony’s dozens of steps take months, if not years, to perfect. At the end of the ceremony, enjoy your tea along with a variety of Japanese sweets. Your final stop is Nijo Castle. Though the shogun lived in Tokyo, then called Edo, he used Nijo Castle as his residence when he traveled to Kyoto. Impressive to visitors today as it was to those hundreds of years ago, the castle radiates authority and power from all sides. Touring the inner rooms, your guide points out secret passages and chambers where the shogun’s bodyguards would hide, ready in case anyone should try to bring harm to their master."

        "description": "You’ll need your walking shoes today, as you’re off to see parts of Kyoto best discovered on foot. Your first stop is Fushimi Inari Shrine. In the Shinto religion, Inari is the god of rice. Though thousands of shrines across Japan honor Inari, Fushimi Inari Shrine is the country’s most important. You immediately realize this as you start walking up the gentle slope leading up Mt. Inari. Every two feet or so you pass under another bright red torii gate, signifying that you are entering a sacred space. With more than 2,000 lining the mountain path, you marvel at the reverence given to the god who controls Japan’s main source of nourishment. At the summit, the shrine itself comes into view, along with splendid vistas of Kyoto and the surrounding mountains. Take the time to explore the shrine and its gardens, or simply sit on a park bench and enjoy the sights. After descending Mt. Inari, rest your feet in a taxi or bus that takes you to Ginkaku-ji, the Silver Pavilion. Modeled after Kinkaku-ji, the Silver Pavilion is not coated in precious metal. The name refers to the dark reflective paint, which gave the temple a shiny, silvery appearance. The temple and grounds are inspiring, to say the least. Even after spending just a few minutes there, you realize why Ginkaku-ji was an inspiration to traditional Japanese arts such as the tea ceremony and flower arrangement. Right next to Ginkaku-ji is the Philosopher’s Walk. A stone path flanked by cherry trees and Kyoto’s medieval canals, it was the daily route of philosopher Nishida Kitaro. To Kitaro, the path was a perfect place to ponder the differences between Western and Japanese philosophy. As you enjoy the Philosopher’s Walk, you find yourself stopping periodically to enjoy the calm or one of the many temples that line the path. After a relaxing lunch to regain your energy, you begin your tour of the Higashiyama District. A long street of preserved shops, they continue to sell a variety of Kyoto specialties from cuisine to handmade pottery. Surrounded by so much to explore, you could easily spend half a day on this one street. At the end of the Higashiyama District is Kyomizu-dera, arguably the most famous Buddhist temple in Japan. From the terrace, not only are you greeted by inspiring views, but also a sense of calm that has been felt by visitors for centuries. Your final stop for the day is the Gion District, home to the geiko, more commonly known as geisha. Though much of Japan has changed, the geiko continues to practice traditions and rituals handed down through the generations. It is not uncommon to see geiko walking between appointments. Part hostess, part entertainer, the geiko are a sight to behold. By the end of your time in Gion, you can’t help but feel a deep respect for the women who keep alive the geiko way of life. This evening, you are free to explore Kyoto by yourself. Dinner is on your own."

Though only Japan’s capital for 84 years, the Nara Period (710-794) was defined by Japan’s embrace of Buddhism. Entering Nara Park, you are greeted by sacred deer. Freely living amongst people for over 1,200 years, they are quite tame and are known to bow to visitors in order to receive a treat. Continuing through the park, you see the outline of Todai-ji in the distance. Todai-ji is the largest Buddhist temple in Japan, and one of the largest wooden structures in the world. Within is a greater sight, a 49-foot high bronze Buddha that has been overlooking Nara Park since 753. The scent of incense is heavy in the air as you stand at the base of this magnificent structure. Afterward, explore the temple grounds along with the recently opened museum displaying artifacts and art from the Nara Period. There is also time to visit the Nara National Museum, which features one of the largest collections of calligraphy in Japan. No matter how you choose to spend you last day in Japan, the country has one more surprise for you. Returning to the Gion District, sit down to a kaiseki dinner held in your honor.

        "title": "Kyoto – See the Best of the Ancient Capital",
        "description": "Kyoto is home to 17 UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Today, with the help of an expert guide, you experience only the best. Leaving your hotel, your first stop is Nijo Castle. This imposing structure was built in the early 17th-century and was the shogun’s Kyoto residence. The grandeur inside is well-preserved, including the nightingale floors. One of the first security systems, the floors ‘chirp’ no matter how lightly you step upon them. Another security feature is the hidden passages and rooms where the shogun’s bodyguards would lie in wait. From Nijo Castle, you board Kyoto’s efficient subway system. In only minutes you arrive at Kinkaku-ji, the Temple of the Golden Pavilion. A magnificent temple dating back to the late 14th century, the entire structure is decorated with gold leaf. In the bright Kyoto sun, it takes on a magical quality, especially as a second Kinkaku-ji forms in the still waters of the surrounding moat. Since 1450, Ryoan-ji has contained one of the most impressive rock gardens in Japan. Though small, the 15 large rocks spread throughout the garden contain a deep spiritual significance. No matter at what angle you look upon the garden, you can only see 14 of the rocks at the same time. This signifies mankind’s inability to comprehend the entirety of creation. With the garden far away from modern Kyoto, it is easy to believe that you have stepped into the past. On the top of Mt. Otowa lies Kyomizu-dera, arguably the most famous Buddhist temple in Japan. From its grand veranda, gain a bird’s eye view of the city and the surrounding mountains. You may even see other temples and shrines peaking up from behind the trees. The sight is especially grand in the fall when the splendid foliage rivals anything found in the American Northeast. As you descend Mt. Otowa, you walk through the Higashiyama District. For generations, this quaint shopping street has offered pilgrims and visitors a relaxing shopping experience that includes various cafes and restaurants. Within these stores, you can find everything from handmade pottery to local culinary ingredients. At the end of the day, your guide can return you to your hotel or any site in Kyoto you may wish to explore on your own."

Outside your window, rice fields, homes, and the ocean zoom by at nearly 200 miles per hour. In Okayama, you transfer to a local express train. It is on this train you cross into Shikoku, an island rarely visited by foreign tourists. Your destination is Takamatsu, a former castle town during the Edo Period. A major port throughout its history, Takamatsu is a blend of past and present, where one can find all the conveniences of modern life alongside splendid gardens and shrines. After dropping off your luggage at your western-style hotel, you are free to spend the afternoon getting to know all Takamatsu has to offer. Many people consider Ritsurin Park to be one of the most beautiful in Japan. Throughout its 400-year history, the park has given respite to samurai, nobility, and now travelers from all over the world. With tree covered mountains in the background, you are sure to feel a sense of peace as you look out over the park’s many ponds. While there, treat yourself to tea and treats at the tea house, which offers some of the park’s best views. For dinner, don’t miss out on Takamatsu’s udon noodles. Many restaurants in the city specialize in this dish. Best served with sake or beer, these hearty noodles make for a fine way to end your day in the city."

        "description": "Today you have the opportunity to branch out from Takamatsu and explore the surrounding islands dotting the Seto Inland Sea. For history lovers, we recommend a day trip to Yashima. Known as the ‘roof of Shikoku,’ Yashima was the sight of many samurai battles. The flat summit offers panoramic views of Shikoku and the surrounding islands. Another historical site on Yashima is Shikoku Mura, an open-air museum that features preserved structures from all over Shikoku. Walk through a variety of original homes, storehouses, and even a sugar factory from the late Edo Period. The trip leaves you with a deep appreciation of the common people who lived through this transformational time in Japanese history. If art is your passion, there are three exciting ‘art islands,’ all a short trip away from Takamatsu. In Naoshima, see the Chichu Art Museum, where natural light illuminates the artwork. At Benesse House, view some of the latest sculptures from Japanese and international artists. While there, be sure not to miss the famous pumpkin sculpture that overlooks the Seto Inland Sea. You can argue that Teshima itself is a work of art. An idyllic island home to a small fishing community, undisturbed nature is seamlessly melded with art installations. At Teshima Art Museum, for example, the building is located in the middle of a rice field. Stepping inside, the large opening in the ceiling allows natural light to illuminate the structure. It is especially beautiful on rainy days, as the raindrops splash on the concrete floor. Finally, there is Shodoshima. Covered in olive trees imported from Greece, you may feel transported to the Mediterranean as you first step onto the island. Taking a ropeway carriage across Kankakei Gorge, you gain spectacular views, made more so each fall by the colorful foliage. The island also features the Great Kannon, a 50-meter tall statue of the Buddhist goddess of mercy. Inside, you can take an elevator up into the statue’s chest. There, you can gaze upon a preserved tooth that once belonged to the historical Buddha. No matter how you choose to spend your day exploring the Seto Inland Sea, you are sure to create wonderful and unique memories."

Rest assured, there are many places to pause on your journey, and the heavy canopy provides shade during your walk. When you arrive at the summit, you discover one of the most unique shrines in Japan. Originally founded to protect the lives of sailors, the shrine’s design is a blend of Buddhist and Shinto elements. After you descend the mountain, your hotel this evening has just the remedy for sore feet and leg muscles: an onsen bath. For centuries, onsen baths have been one of Japan’s main sources of rest and relaxation. As you soak in the hot mineral water, you are bound to feel refreshed. After drying off, hotel attendants deliver dinner to your room. Your meal this evening is kaiseki ryori , a series of small, delectable dishes where presentation is just as important as taste."

Without any baggage to weigh you down, you are free to explore this amazing city. For fans of Hayao Miyazaki’s Academy Award-winning film, Spirited Away , you do not want to miss Dogo Onsen Honkan, the inspiration for the bathhouse in the film. The inside is just as grand as the exterior, and for a small fee, you can soak in the same onsen baths that are frequented by the Japanese imperial family. Matsuyama Castle is one of Japan’s 12 remaining feudal castles. On top of a mountain, it can be reached by chairlift or ropeway. When you arrive, over 200 cherry trees greet you, a splendid delight each spring when they bloom. Much of the castle is open to exploration, giving you the chance to see every nook and cranny. In the early evening, you check into your ryokan in Matsuyama. Like in Kotohira, your ryokan this evening has onsen baths and a delicious kaiseki dinner."

After an hour’s journey to Okayama, the historical city of Kurashiki is only another 15 minutes away by train. During the Edo Period, Kurashiki was inhabited by wealthy merchant families. The city’s specialty was rice, as much of the country’s annual harvest came by way of Kurashiki’s stone canals. Today the rice warehouses still stand, and walking through the canal district is a relaxing experience. Instead of sacks of rice, however, you discover a variety of cafés and boutique shops. If you wish to learn more about Kurashiki’s merchants, Ohashi House dates back to the late 18th-century. Inside, see how the city’s ‘better half’ lived.

Just outside Okayama Castle is Korakuen, a landscape garden that is rated as one of Japan’s most beautiful. Dating back to the late 17th century, the garden’s design has not changed since the Edo Period. With Okayama Castle in the background, the garden’s teahouse is a wonderful place to relax. Your journey to Kumamoto takes approximately two-and-a-half hours. You arrive in late afternoon. Kumamoto is an intriguing city. Surrounded by the sea and mountains, the city is known for its ramen.

The first is the region surrounding Mt. Aso. An hour’s bus ride east of Kumamoto, Mt. Aso is an active volcano with striking scenery around its base. Long before arriving, you see Mt. Aso in the distance. It is nearly 16 miles across. Though the caldera is closed due to the threat of volcanic gas, the surrounding area offers a variety of activities. In the planes of Kusasenri-sa-hama, for example, you can take a leisurely horseback ride in the shadow of the mountain. Also in the area is Mt. Daikanbo. The summit accessible by bus, the nearly 3000-foot elevation gives visitors unbeatable views of Mt. Aso. Also, if you arrive at the right time of day, you witness a blanket of clouds rolling over the valley below. It is a mystical experience, one not to be missed. Another way to venture out from Kumamoto is to visit the neighboring town of Beppu, one of the most famous hot spring resort towns in Japan. Besides taking a relaxing soak at one of the city’s many onsen baths, be sure to visit the city’s many ‘hells,’ natural boiling ponds that dot the city. To find them, simply follow the pillars of steam that continuously rise into the air. While there, treat yourself to a snack (or two) cooked in the hot steam."

Historically a major trading port, it was home to Japan’s only trading colony during the Edo Period. At Dejima Island, a small group of Dutch traders exposed Japan to the outside world. Korean and Chinese traders came through Nagasaki, as well. Even today, foreign influence is still evidence in Nagasaki’s architecture and cuisine. After dropping off your bags at your western-style hotel, the afternoon is yours to explore. One of the city’s most unique attractions is Glover Garden. Thomas Glover was one of the first foreign merchants to move to Japan after the country opened itself up at the end of the Edo Period. His home and gardens, built in a mix of European and Japanese styles, reflect one of the greatest periods of transformation in Japanese history. Also, the view is not to be missed, as the gardens overlook the harbor and city. As you walk back down into Nagasaki, go through the Dutch slope, a row of hillside homes once inhabited by Dutch traders in the late 19th-century. Another eclectic mix of Japanese and European design, they are a feast for the senses. If feeling hungry after your walk, a variety of shops sell Castella, a Portuguese pastry treat that the Japanese have made all their own."

Outside the museum is the Nagasaki Peace Park. A memorial constructed over the explosion’s hypocenter includes a preserved section of earth where you can see shards of brick and glass. Nearby is a brick pillar that was once part of Urakami Cathedral. Once the largest Catholic church in Asia, it was obliterated by the atomic blast which occurred just a few hundred feet away. The Prayer Monument for Peace is the park’s most striking feature. Over thirty feet high, it depicts a robed man pointing to the sky (the threat of atomic war) and to the left (the prospect of world peace). It is a humbling display, one that leaves you in deep thought as you tour the garden. In the early afternoon, you board a local train to Fukuoka, the largest city in Kyushu.

Each year in the third week of July, the shrine puts on a lively matsuri festival where competing teams race parade floats, some weighing upwards of one ton, throughout the city streets. Tsukiji may be the most famous fish market in Japan, but Fukuoka is no stranger to the tradition of fisherman selling their daily catch. At Yanagibashi Rengo Market, you can see (and purchase) some of the best seafood treats. The market also has a variety of restaurants offering some of the freshest sushi in Japan. It is a perfect place to stop for lunch. In the afternoon, head to Ohori Park. Dating back to the 1920s, the park’s pond was once the reservoir feeding into the moat surrounding the nearby Fukuoka Castle. With its tranquil design and many nearby attractions, the time flies by as you explore this enchanting area. As day turns to night, visit the observation deck of Fukuoka Tower.

After using the early afternoon to rest up, your guide for the evening meets you at your hotel. Your first stop is Doguyasuji Shopping Street. As Osaka is known where the Japanese ‘eat themselves to ruin,’ the street sells everything a foodie needs to recreate Japan’s most famous dishes at home. Also included are stores that sell plastic sushi for restaurant storefronts. They are inexpensive and make excellent gifts. If seeing all the plastic sushi has made you hungry, your guide takes you to the Dotonbori District. Within the hustle and bustle, electric neon light pours off every building. Within the district are a variety of restaurants for you to enjoy. Osaka’s specialty dish is okonomiyaki , a savory pancake which incorporates cabbage, onion, seafood, and pork right into the batter. Paired with an ice-cold beer, it makes for a delicious snack that starts your culinary journey of Osaka. The Dotonbori is also Osaka’s most photogenic areas. From the running Glico Man to the Kani Doraku, keep your camera ready at all times. Hozenji Yokocho is a restored street, and home to more than 60 traditional restaurants and izakaya , Japanese gastropubs that pair small dishes with local alcohol. They are an ideal place to stop for a drink and a small plate of yakitori , grilled chicken on a stick. Shinsekai, literally ‘new world,’ was originally the site of Osaka’s 1903 Industrial Exhibition. Designed to mirror both Paris and Coney Island in New York, Shinsekai is an amazing mix of designs. Your first stop is the observation deck of the Tsutenkaku, one of the tallest structures in Osaka. Modeled after the Eiffel Tower in Paris, it has a commanding view of the city. Finally, treat yourself to a kushikatsu dinner, local deep-fried food on a stick. Expect everything from pumpkins and ice cream, all rolled in bread crumbs before a bath in hot oil."

You will have zoomed across the country to the coast and to a city that still feels rooted in the Edo period. Cobblestone streets are lined with wooden houses and old calligraphy signs, leading you to a famous little food market. In the 17th-century, Kanazawa was one of the world’s most cultural cities, and a lot of that was due to its food. The market, however, is from this century and it is stuffed with delicacies with everything fresh rather than frozen. This is where you need to try sushi at a small little venue within the market, unknown to the rest of the world. You will probably want to rest in the afternoon, although the town is a perfect place for aimless wandering. While a more modern façade now surrounds the center of town, it is easy to get lost in the old streets and feel disconnected from the 21st century. This evening, you will dine on local Kaga-ryori. Blending seafood and vegetables, local chefs serve up colorful dishes on local Kutani porcelain. Think yellowtail served between turnips and sea bream steamed with seasonal vegetables. Presentation, as so often with Japanese cuisine, is integral to the experience. And as you eat you reveal the full beauty of the ornamental porcelain."

Harvesting these seasonal delicacies has been a part of local culture for centuries, and you can join a plant hunter this morning and scour the mountains to pick up dainty specialties that are yet to be harvested on a commercial scale. Later, in a family home, you can sample home-brewed sake as villagers cook up your finds from the mountains. The dishes go hand in glove with sake as a special rice varietal is used to brew something specifically for this corner of Japan. Continuing a local theme, you will spend the night in a family-fun farmhouse and enjoy the legendary hospitality."

After lunch, you will travel on to Takayama, the region’s capital. Its old town is another that is perfect for wandering with wooden storefronts stocked with yew carvings and Shunkei lacquerware. Your guide will take you around and tell the Samurai stories of Takayama’s past, showing you teahouses where Geisha still entertain their clients. You will be staying in a ryokan, a traditional inn with sliding doors, tatami mats, and a futon that is rolled out after dinner. The hospitality is refined, and while a ryokan initially appears simple, there is a complexity to how the pieces fit together alongside a serenity that you could never find in a modern hotel. Dine in your room for the first of your multi-course kaiseki dinners. This is the ultimate Japanese meal, a series of small seasonal dishes that celebrate the pursuit of perfection. The preparation is exacting, using only seasonal ingredients that have passed stringent quality control. The presentation is colorful and charming, the aesthetics as important as the aromas and tastes, and when one dish is finished, more turn up on the table with each building on the flavor profile of the last."

Enter one of these with your guide, and a grandmother will show you a traditional Okudo-san oven, an earth oven that preserves the true flavors of Hida beef. In the Machiya you will taste premium Hida beef prepared in this traditional way, and then compare it to a more contemporary, global style of grilling. The only way to wash it down is with sake, this time from a local brewery that is celebrated all across Japan. Return to Takayama for the evening and to walk the food off on old town streets."

Many of Kyoto’s temples were once private residences, and even today there is an abundance of heritage buildings and gardens not open to the general public. Tonight you will dine in one of these, an old aristocratic villa that has preserved the 16th-century surroundings. Of course, the food is kaiseki, as what other meal could grace such a timeless venue?

Travel here this morning and hear the stories of Prince Shotoku, while exploring burial mounds that are said to house Japan’s first emperors. Heading out into the fields, you will meet a small-scale farmer to learn about what is being planted in Japan’s lushest region. The idea of farm-to-table is true here with vegetables handpicked and carried to the kitchen with not a single bit of motorized transport in sight. You will join the farmers in handpicking ripe produce, taking their lead on why you should pick this one and not that one. Rather than a blanket harvest, the farmers are exacting about what they pick, which leads to even fresher gastronomy. Relax in an old Japanese farmhouse as community cooks prepare the lunchtime meal, or you might choose to get involved in the kitchen. Dine with the locals as you all look out onto the fields alongside hands that have made it. From Asuka, you will transfer to Osaka, a major city that helps bring a new experience after all the old towns.

According to local mythology, Awaji was the first island to be created by the gods Izanagi and Izanami. For over a millennia, emperors considered it the best place to harvest both vegetables and seafood. That belief continues among many to this day, making the fish auction a premier venue for Japan’s top restaurants to buy their produce. Check out the sounds and smells of the auction this morning while nibbling on Shirasu Boshi , a semi-dried fish that’s iconic to this corner of the country. The rest of the day will be relaxed so that you can kick back on the beach and dip your toes in the sea. Reflect on all the flavors you have enjoyed since arriving in Japan, and luxuriate on a seafood lunch that is as artistic as it is local, created in a foodscape style that takes inspiration from both the ingredients and the natural landscape they came from. As with the style of kaiseki, you will get the feeling that each meal on this tour subtly builds on the next. After lunch, you will have plenty of time to relax on the beach, or you can check out the lively port with fresh seafood on the menu at dinnertime as well."

Aso’s many natural wonders. The central crater is an active volcanic site, so it may be closed to visitors on the day of your visit. Even so, you are bound to have an excellent experience.

        "description": "Today is a day of travel by motor coach, yet the day is full of memorable and inspiring stops. Your first destination is Takachiho Shrine. Nestled in a grove of cedar trees, the shrine seamlessly blends into the surrounding nature. Takachiho Shrine holds an important place in the Shinto religion. It is believed that the sun goddess Amaterasu briefly hid herself away from the world in a local cave. As the crops were dying without her light, the other gods came up with an ingenious plan. They told Amaterasu that they had found a newer and even more beautiful sun goddess. Curious, Amaterasu peeked outside the cave. At that moment, she saw her own reflection in a mirror held up by one of the other gods. Amaterasu then knew she was still loved by the other gods, and continued giving light to the world. Each day, performers at Takachiho Shrine reenact this myth for visitors. Arrive at the right time of day, and you can see it for yourself. From Takachiho, you head to Amano Iwato Shrine, another holy place where it is believed the gods once lived. Yet here, the shrine itself is not the most stunning sight. Walk down to the river and you see hundreds of stacks of small stones. All of these were made by pilgrims and visitors. You, too, are invited to leave your mark in this holy place. Continuing on by foot, you find a sacred cave where it is believed that the gods once gathered for secret meetings. After a stop for lunch, you head to Tsujun Bridge. A stone arch reminiscent of a Roman aqueduct, the bridge dates back to 1854. Even today, it still carries water to surrounding rice fields and farms. Arrive at the right time and you might see a waterfall falling off the stone. No matter the season or circumstance, the bridge is a photographic highlight of the tour. In the late afternoon, you arrive at your hotel in Kagoshima, the Kagoshima Sun Royal Hotel. From your western-style room, soak in stunning ocean views. Dinner this evening is on your own, but the hotel features a variety of western and Japanese restaurants."

        "description": "After breakfast at the hotel, you board a motor coach for a day of sightseeing in Kagoshima. Your first stop is Senganen Garden. As you walk the well-maintained paths, your view is filled with the sight of Kagoshima Bay and Mt. Sakurajima in the distance. The garden itself was once owned by a powerful clan during the Edo Period (1603-1867). In the center of the garden is the clan residence. With three tours of the residence each hour, you are bound to be enthralled by seeing how the Japanese upper class lived in the late 19th century. From the tranquil garden, you head to a unique hands-on experience. Satsuma-age is a fried fish cake that combines many varieties of fish with various herbs and spices. In your class, you learn the recipes native to Kagoshima before making your own cakes. At the end of your lesson, you sample your creations. After building your appetite preparing food, you head to the Satsuma Beer Garden for lunch. With your bayside seats, you may think that you are in the south of France rather than Japan. During this meal, expect local comfort food paired with ice-cold beer. This afternoon offers immersion into Japan’s past and natural beauty. Your first stop is the Chiran Peace Museum. During the Second World War, over 1,000 young kamikaze pilots took off from the airfield that existed close by. Nearly half of these young men were raised in the surrounding villages. Since 1975, the museum has commemorated their sacrifice along with promoting a resolute anti-war message. The museum has a variety of exhibits, including fully restored planes to the personal effects of the pilots who knew they were never coming home. Lake Ikeda is one of the clearest lakes in the world. The lake’s beauty inspired the first human settlers to believe that the lake was the birthplace of all mankind. You immediately understand this belief as you stand at the lakeshore. Enjoy the view from the beach, or rent a paddleboat for a lake cruise. While on the water, you may even catch a glimpse of Issie, Lake Ikeda’s take on the Loch Ness Monster. You return to Kagoshima in the late afternoon. Dinner this evening is on your own."

Your first stop is Kumamoto Castle, one of the few remaining Edo Period castles to survive intact. It is truly an impressive structure, one which radiated the shogun’s power despite the long distance that separates Kumamoto from Tokyo, then called Edo. Inside, it is possible to explore many original rooms, making you feel as if you are stepping back into the past. As Kumamoto Castle suffered severe damage from an earthquake in April 2016, seeing parts of the inside of the castle may not be possible due to restoration work. Suizenji Garden is not only one of the most beautiful gardens in Kumamoto but also a unique map of Japan. You first notice a small Mt. Fuji at the garden’s edge. Near it is a model of the Tokaido Road, a footpath that connected Kyoto and Edo during the Edo Period. From the period teahouse to the ponds full of colorful carp, Suizenji Garden is bound to leave a lasting impression on your mind, body, and spirit. Late this afternoon you check into your luxury hotel. Dinner this evening is on your own, but the hotel and surrounding area have a variety of restaurants suitable to all tastes."

Every room reveals new artifacts and daily items used by the house’s generations of residents. If you’re traveling in the spring or fall, there is no better way to spend a day than admiring nature.

The high elevation and daily fog make traveling to the mountain a mystical experience. As you approach the mountain, your first stop is the Mt. Unzen Memorial Hall. This modern facility not only chronicles the mountain’s eruptions in the early 1990s but also teaches local residents the best ways to stay safe during future eruptions. While in the Hall, you are treated to an immersive film featuring footage from Mt. Unzen’s recent eruptions. Though Japan’s volcanoes occasionally pose a danger, living in a volcanically active zone does have its benefits. Volcanic activity produces soothing onsen baths, something which the Japanese people have enjoyed throughout their history. At Unzen Jigoku, also known as Unzen Hell, see these geologic forces as work. As you walk the path through the park, sulfuric steam continuously rises from the rocks below. Looking at nature at its most extreme, you begin to understand how the Japanese mythology about the underworld came to be. Arriving in Nagasaki, your first glimpse of the city is a bird’s eye view from the top of Mt. Inasa. After descending the mountain by ropeway, you head to dinner at a local restaurant. Cuisine in Nagasaki is some of the most delicious in Japan. With the city’s recipes influenced by interactions with Dutch traders during the Edo Period, you discover that your meal is a blend of Japanese and Western influences. At the end of your dinner, splurge on Castella, a Portuguese treat the Japanese have made all their own. This evening, your premier hotel is western-style and features excellent views of the Nagasaki skyline."

Here, learn the story of how Nagasaki was Japan’s sole opening to the world during Edo Period. Inside are thousands of artifacts relating to this time, from items traded by the Dutch to Korean and Chinese artwork. You are guaranteed to leave with a deeper appreciation for the cultures that influenced Japan during one of the most transformational periods in its history. On August 9th, 1945, nearly half of Nagasaki was destroyed, and 35,000 people killed by the atomic bomb. Today, the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum and Peace Memorial Park are a permanent reminder of the bombing and a call for worldwide nuclear disarmament. Inside, expect to see many moving displays, including clocks stopped at when the bomb detonated and items which melted from the intense heat and pressure. Outside the museum is Nagasaki Peace Memorial Garden, where the Peace Statue points to the sky (the threat of nuclear weapons) and the left (the prospect of eternal peace). As you walk between the ruins of Urakami Cathedral and the stone marker identifying the hypocenter of the explosion, it is a peaceful setting to reflect on all you have seen. After lunch in Nagasaki, you travel by bus to Hakata, a suburb of Fukuoka. This afternoon and evening are free for you to explore. One of the things not to miss are Fukuoka’s yatai or food stands. The small restaurants line the riverbanks; each has its own specialty from ramen noodles to yakitori , grilled chicken on a stick. No matter which one you choose, expect a delicious meal of comfort food on your last night in Japan. When you are ready to turn in for the night, return to your luxury hotel.

Perched on a hill with its pagoda-like layers, it was Japan’s first ever UNESCO World Heritage site, and it remains the best example of Japanese castle architecture. Step beyond the walls and each room has something to see, although the highlight for everyone is the exterior view, especially during cherry blossom season or in the midst of fall. Onwards you will go to Kurashiki, an old merchant town that has managed to keep much of its original architecture. This was once a rice port, and the granaries have been well preserved, lining the canal as if waiting to be used again. The town is a perfect place to slow down and start exploring old-world Japan, the city almost mystical as it rolls beneath your feet. After lunch and some leisurely exploration, you will finish the day in Hiroshima, a city of worldwide fame for mostly the wrong reasons.

But the main reason for being here is your lunch as Kobe is the world-famous home of Wagyu beef, an indulgent slice of meat so soft it virtually evaporates on your tongue. Nearby, Nara is an excellent place to walk off your incredible meal. At its heart stands Todaiji Temple, the world’s largest wooden building. It hides an enormous bronze Buddha and over a thousand wandering deer. It’s a very popular attraction, but when the coach tours leave for the day, you will find Japan’s oldest capital city to hold many more secrets.

Next visit a temple that shimmers in gold, three stories of elegance built in 1397, and hardly altered since. Continue to the sight of Kiyomizu Temple, rising from groves of cherry and maple trees, shrouded in changing seasonal colors. There are many more, and your guide can customize your day to your energy levels and your interests, adding more gardens and temples, or helping you to track how the design changed through the eras. And as the sun sets you will in a private garden, a place of peace to reflect on everything you have encountered."

        "description": "This morning is flexible. There is always more to see in Kyoto; a garden, a temple, a shrine, a place cut off from the world where monks walk barefoot in red robes. This afternoon you will zoom from history to nature, taking the Shinkansen to Hakone, the home of hot springs. One of the country’s finest ryokans awaits, so sink your senses into the tradition and simplicity of the accommodation. Think sliding doors, tatami mats, futon beds that are rolled out, and put away, plus the fine service that Japan has always been known for. Staying in a ryokan is one of the country’s most iconic experiences, overnighting the same way that travelers have done for centuries. And while there are luxury five-star hotels all over the world, there is nothing to compare with the atmosphere at a ryokan. So check-in, relax and step outside into natural hot springs with a view of Mount Fuji. Fully rested, you can dine in your room, seated on the tatami mats, indulging in the many courses of kaiseki cuisine. The food is divine, and it helps to show what ryokans really are – luxurious home-stays with incredible attention to detail."

You will be deep in nature, beneath the cone of Mount Fuji, and far away from the rest of Japan. Sometimes this country is confusing as you can be so deep in history and culture and bustling streets, and then you are between the trees in a wilderness as old as anything in Japan. Take the juxtaposition further this afternoon as you go from Mount Fuji’s fifth station to Tokyo, the most crowded and chaotic of all the cities. Yet there is also such charm here, such detail to the streets when you walk around Shibuya and beyond. Your guide is with you, helping you understand which way to turn in the urban maze, as well as getting you to dinner reservations at a restaurant high above the city."

        "description": "After breakfast at the hotel, your day begins early with a visit to a sumo stable. Sumo wrestling is a 300-year-old tradition in Japan, where wrestlers attempt to push one another out of a ring. It is much more than meets the eye, though, as young men train for years to defeat their opponents. Watching the wrestlers stretch and train, you gain a deep appreciation for the sumo art, and the difficulty involved in what seems at first glance to be a simple task. During your visit it is possible to talk to the wrestlers and their coaches, giving you a rare insight into this popular sport. For lunch, you have the chance to eat like a sumo wrestler. Chankonabe is a hearty stew composed of noodles, meat, and fresh vegetables. Full of nutritious calories, it allows sumo wrestlers to gain weight while remaining some of the healthiest athletes in Japan. As it cooks at your table, the smell is mouthwatering, to say the least. In the afternoon, there are a number of ways to burn off the Chankonabe calories. A walk through Shinjuku Park contains trees and flowers from all over the world, giving the area the feel of a palatial private garden rather than one open to the public. To gain a deeper appreciation for Japanese food, take a class in wagashi , a traditional confection originally imported from China. With the help of your teacher, learn how to combine sugar with seasonal ingredients to create delectable treats. At the end of your lesson, enjoy your creations with a serving of hot green tea. The 2011 documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi introduced the world to the craftsmanship and skill that sushi chefs need to make the most splendid sushi on Earth. Your sushi dinner this evening is set at a three Michelin star restaurant in Tokyo’s Ginza district. Expect an intimate dining experience where you view the chef’s graceful movements as he assembles nearly two dozen pieces of sushi for your enjoyment. After the meal, step out into the Ginza nightlife. Bright neon advertisements shine down on you in this world-famous shopping district. Home to some of the most popular high-end brands, it is a shopper’s paradise. If you do decide to make any purchases, your guide ensures that they arrive at your hotel, or are mailed to your home address."

For decades, the market’s fishmongers have sold the freshest seafood to the best restaurants not only in Japan, but also all over the world. Witness the tuna auction, where the world’s finest Bluefin Tuna are sold each morning. After the excitement, sit down to a sushi breakfast at Sushi Dai. Each piece is exquisite, as the fish were swimming just hours, perhaps minutes, ago. Your education in sushi continues as you arrive in a classroom where Japanese sushi chefs learn their art. For a few hours, become a chef in training as your master teacher instructs you in his profession. At the end of your lesson, enjoy your creations, along with a few prepared for you by the master chef. This afternoon, you are free to explore Tokyo as you wish. If you desire, your guide can arrange a private tour of one of the city’s many neighborhoods or attractions. Your dinner this evening is a completely different experience than the night before. Calling the Robot Restaurant in Shinjuku ‘over the top’ would be an understatement. With its robot waiters, neon lights, lasers, and Taiko drum performances, the experience leaves you dazed in the best way possible. After dinner, walk off your excitement with a tour of the Shinjuku district before turning in for the evening."

        "description": "This morning you board the famous shinkansen to Kyoto. From your seat in the first-class Green Car, watch the Japanese countryside zoom by at nearly 200 miles-per-hour. From Kyoto Station, Kyoto looks like any other modern metropolis. Yet only a short cab or bus ride away are innumerable cultural treasures. Kyoto is home to 17 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, along with some of Japan’s finest dining. Your first stop is a Buddhist temple and Zen garden in the city center. There you meet one of the monks, who explains his faith over a simple lunch. Afterward, he takes you on a tour of his temple, describing how every plant, rock, and structure is a reflection of Buddhist teachings. In the afternoon, take the time to relax in your ryokan , a traditional Japanese inn. No matter which accommodation you choose, expect a bottle of wine, snacks, and a welcome note from the hotel management. Your room features tatami woven mat floors along with peaceful views of nature that suggest a place far away from the big city. The appointments in your room reflect the charm of ancient Japan. Before dinner, relax in one of the ryokan ’s onsen baths. For hundreds of years, onsen baths have provided rest and relaxation for the Japanese. Your ryokan features some of the best in Kyoto. As you soak, close your eyes and listen to the running water, chirping birds, and the sound of the breeze blowing through the trees. Your dinner this evening is a kaiseki feast. Kaiseki, or kaiseki ryori , is Japanese cuisine that has been elevated to high art. Each dish features locally grown produce, meat, and seafood presented in ways that would rival art found in the finest museums. Every bite is a different taste, a different texture. It is a meal where you can indulge your senses, but before you start, remember to take some pictures of the beautiful food. Afterward, hotel stewards lay out your bedding for the night, Japanese futons. If you wish, you can reserve a room with western-style mattresses."

Expect a traditional Japanese breakfast of fish, miso soup, and rice. Of course, if you have any dietary requirements, modifications can be made to the menu. After breakfast, your guide picks you up in a private car, your transportation for the day as you visit some of the city’s best sights. In the early morning, there is no better view than that found at Kinkaku-ji, the famed Temple of the Golden Pavilion. Covered in gold leaf, the temple’s magnificence is highlighted by its reflection in the surrounding moat. You arrive early enough to beat the daily crowds, allowing you to appreciate the calm and serenity that Buddhist temples are meant to inspire. Afterward, your car takes you to the Fushimi Inari-Taisha shrine. Located on the top of Mt. Inari, the slope up the mountain is quite gentle. During your walk, you pass under 2,000 bright red torii gates, each one symbolizing that you are entering a sacred space. During this time, your guide can explain the shrine’s significance, or disappear into the background as you make the journey. Arriving at the shrine, you are greeted by majestic views and stone statues of kitsune , foxes that are regarded as spiritual messengers in Shinto, Japan’s native religion. You have plenty of time to explore the 500-year-old shrine and the surrounding gardens, some of the most photogenic spots in all of Kyoto. In the afternoon, you are free to use your private car to explore Kyoto as you please. Your guidebook has plenty of recommendations, and you can travel by yourself or with your guide. In the early evening, your car takes you to the Gion District, known for centuries as a place where young women come to learn the art of the geisha. There, an apprentice geisha meets you. With your guide translating, she shows you around the district, relaying its history and importance in Japanese culture. As the sun sets, she takes you to her geisha house, a private restaurant and entertainment space. Over the next few hours, as you sit at an elegantly appointed table, expect a tea ceremony, performances, song, and a fine dinner paired with locally produced sake. After dinner, return to your ryokan for a relaxing soak followed by a good night’s sleep."

It’s architecture and designs a blend of western and Japanese, you feel right a home in your suite overlooking the city. There is time set aside in the late morning and early afternoon for you to freshen up and rest before heading out on the town. Osaka is a city where for generations Japanese foodies have come to ‘eat themselves to ruin.’ Your tour of this city begins with the Doguyasuji District, home to some of the best cutlery and cooking utensils produced in Japan. Afterward, your guide takes you to the bustling Dontonbori District, where neon advertisements and the crowds are reminiscent of Times Square. While there, indulge in a late lunch of Takoyaki , fried octopus balls. Osaka’s greatest culinary treat, though, is okonomiyaki . Based off the simple pancake, the batter incorporates cabbage, seafood, green onions, and pork belly to make a succulent dish best paired with an ice-cold beer. In the evening, you have a choice of entertainment. Osaka’s baseball team is the Hanshin Tigers. From your club seats, take in a nighttime game which includes dinner. Or if you desire a more laid back experience, consider a night at one of Osaka’s premier breweries and pubs. Sample a variety of beer paired with small tapas dishes.

Since the 1920s, the distillery has produced whiskey using mineral water harvested from local bamboo forests. During the 90-minute tour, your guide is a master distiller who takes you behind the scenes, where you witness every step involved that turns grain into fine whiskey. From the shining copper stills to the cool barrel cellars, you gain a deep appreciation of the work that goes into this iconic beverage. At the end of the tour is an included tasting, and for an extra fee, it is possible to sample a wider variety of the distillery’s fine whiskeys. The distillery also sells Suntory’s entire product line, so don’t be surprised if you leave with a few bottles under your arm. You return to Osaka just in time for lunch at one of the city’s most unique attractions: The Momofuku Ando Instant Ramen Museum. Instant ramen, the staple of college students around the world, was invented by Momofuku Ando in 1958. The museum is both a shrine to the man who gave the world instant ramen and a hands-on educational experience into what goes into making this famous food. From the theater shaped like a Cup Noodles container to the recreation of Ando’s workshop, expect a joyful experience that ends with you both eating noodles and taking home your own one-of-a-kind Cup Noodles creation. In the afternoon, there is time to rest at the hotel before heading out for dinner. Benihana may have popularized the kappo -style restaurant experience in the United States, but see where this cuisine was born in one of Osaka’s best restaurants. From your seat, watch the chef prepare a variety of cold and hot dishes for your enjoyment. Though entertaining guests has always been a part of kappo restaurants’ history, expect more fine dining and less flaming volcanos made from onion rings."

Nada contains nine major breweries which all use Japan’s famed Yamada Nishiki rice and mineral water which flows down from the surrounding mountains. Even in the 21st-century, you see that modern brewers still use ancient methods to produce the finest sake, which despite its clear color, contains a wide range of flavors and aromas. Kobe is world famous for its beef, cut from steers that are fed a combination of grain and beer to produce fine marbling. For your final dinner in Japan, you dine at one of Kobe’s best steakhouses.

        "description": "In 1600, Tokyo was a sleepy fishing village with a population of only a few thousand. Three years later, Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu chose the city, then called Edo, as his capital. Since then, Tokyo has been Japan’s most important metropolis. Today is about experiencing what city life has to offer to the traveler, historian, and gourmet inside you. After breakfast at the hotel, a variety of activities are at your fingertips. To take in your new surroundings, there is no better place than the observation deck of the Tokyo Tower. Built in 1958 from recycled tanks from the Second World War, the tower dominated the city’s skyline for decades before the skyscraper boom of the 1980s. If culture, peace, and nature are on your agenda, take a stroll through Meiji Park. The trails are wide and level, and just beyond the paths is a type of prehistoric nature that hints at what Tokyo was like long before man first stepped here. At the end of the trail is Meiji Shrine, a complex commemorating the soul of Japan’s first modern emperor. If you arrive in the early morning, you might catch a glimpse of Shinto priests cleaning the shrine, or a young couple posing for their wedding pictures. Your guide is on hand to offer a private lesson on the rights regarding purification and prayer. Before leaving, be sure to write your wishes for the future on a prayer tablet and leave it with the innumerable others hanging from pegs at the shrine. The Imperial Palace, once home to Tokugawa shoguns, has been occupied by Japan’s emperors since 1868. The majority of the palace grounds only open two days a year, the East Gardens offer some of the most well-maintained and beautiful scenes of nature in all of Tokyo. For history buffs, don’t forget to see (and even touch) the remains of Edo Castle, the place from where the shoguns ruled Japan for over 250 years. No matter your tastes, the options for lunch are nearly limitless. With millions of workers going out to eat every day in Tokyo, you can experience a great (and quick) meal at any one of the city’s fine restaurants. After eating, head to Senso-Ji, the oldest Buddhist temple in Tokyo. Instead of the small stone monument monks erected 1400 years ago, visitors today are greeted by the Kaminarimon, the Thunder Gate with its iconic (and massive) paper lantern. As you approach the temple, you hear the dozens of shop owners hawking their wares. These stores sell everything from traditional crafts to toys from the most popular Japanese animes . After dinner in the city center, take a sunset cruise down the Sumida River and into Tokyo harbor. As twilight turns to night, you witness the city transform into an island of artificial light. The cruise’s highlight is the Rainbow Bridge, where the lamps illuminating its surface change color with the seasons. If traveling in late March or early April, the cruise provides the best hanami , or cherry blossom viewing, in all of Tokyo."

Chosen by Tokugawa Ieyasu to be his burial site, Nikko is the final resting place of all the Tokugawa shoguns. During the Edo Period (1618-1868), Nikko was off limits to regular Japanese. Trespassing could end with a death sentence. Now everyone can walk the same paths where once only samurai could tread. The smell of cedar is heavy in the air as you approach Toshogu Shrine, the tomb of Tokugawa Ieyasu. You may miss the actual tomb; your attention grabbed by the ornate carvings on the surrounding gates and structures. Look closely and you might catch the small mistakes made by artisans 400 years ago. These mistakes were intentional, as only the gods themselves could be perfect. Lunch today is in central Nikko at a restaurant offering kaiseki ryori, traditional Japanese cuisine focused on both artistic representation and fine taste. Eat like a shogun as you sample a variety of small dishes of meat and fresh vegetables from across the region. After lunch, you are off by bus to Lake Chuzenji. The highest lake in Japan, the weather is nice even in the most stifling of Japan’s summers. One look at its beauty and you instantly realize why Japan’s richest citizens have their second homes here. Just a short distance away is the Kegon Waterfall, one of the country’s tallest waterfalls. If you are visiting in the early spring, close your eyes and you can hear the sound of winter ice crashing apart as it falls nearly 300 feet. Before returning to Tokyo, there is time in the afternoon for a nature walk. The variety of trails caters to people of all activity levels. Arriving back in Tokyo in the early evening, eat at a city center restaurant before turning in at your hotel."

Your time in Nagoya is brief as you transfer onto an express train to Takayama. Unlike the Shinkansen, with its airplane style windows, the train to Takayama has 360-degree views as the train slowly makes its way into the Japanese mountains. The modern world melts away into deep, tree covered valleys and sleepy towns that have changed little in the last century. You arrive in Takayama just in time for lunch. Your guide takes you to a family run restaurant offering Hida beef. Like Kobe beef, Hida beef is famous for its fine marbling and melt in your mouth texture. Grill the beef to you liking on a personal stove. Just don’t be surprised if you order seconds! In the afternoon, tour Takayama’s old town. Hundreds of years of relative isolation have made Takayama one of the most well-preserved cities in all of Japan. Depending on your tastes, your guide can arrange a private tour of one of the city’s many businesses that produce furniture, crafts, and sake using traditional methods. In the afternoon, check into your hotel overlooking the Takayama valley. After dinner at the hotel, take a relaxing soak in one of the hotel’s many onsen baths.

A UNESCO World Heritage site since 1995, Shirakawa-go’s homes are built in the traditional gassho -style, thickly thatched roofs meant to hold up the weight of heavy winter snow. The building of one of these homes is a community event, much like an Amish barn raising. Upon arrival, your guide introduces you to a family that has lived in the region for generations. They take you on a tour of their home and invite you to stay for lunch as their guest. After eating, your tour of Shirakawa-go continues as you tour an Edo Period silk factory. During the time of the shoguns, Shirakawa-go was the center of Japan’s silk industry. Every family raised silkworms in their attics, where the smoke from the cooking fire below would fumigate the house against insects that could harm the precious silkworms. In the late afternoon, travel back to Takayama by local train. Eat dinner at the hotel."

After lunch, you are off to Kanazawa’s old town, where a special treat awaits you: a private lesson on how to make wagashi , Kanazawa most famous confection. A master confectioner is your teacher as you learn about how the seasons and local flavors influence every bite. Even if you find yourself eating your creations, the long shelf life of wagashi means that your friends and family back home can enjoy this Kanazawa staple. If confections are not your cup of tea, your guide can arrange a class in shamisen playing, gold leaf application, or Japanese tea ceremony. Dinner this evening is at an izakaya , a type of drinking and eating establishment where Japanese of all walks of life go to unwind and socialize after a long day’s work. Try the restaurant’s many small dishes featuring a wide variety of meat and seafood. While there, be sure to pair your food with sake from across the prefecture."

Though not as fast as the Shinkansen, express trains provide a similar level of comfort. You realize, also, that your lunch, though prepackaged, is made with the same care and attention as all of your other meals in Japan. Arriving in Kyoto in the early afternoon, your first stop is Kyoto’s iconic Gion District. Once full of inns catering to travelers walking the historic Tokaido Trail, today Gion is one of Kyoto’s protected districts, a place where not only the architecture is left unchanged, but cultural practices are preserved, as well. Meet geishas as you visit one of the district’s many tea houses. Dinner this evening is your second experience with kaiseki ryori . Though introduced to this cuisine in Nikko, in Kyoto the experience is elevated in a private dining experience with a wider variety of courses similar to those that were served to Japanese emperors centuries ago."

        "description": "After breakfast at your hotel, you are off on a day trip to Nara, Japan's first capital. Arriving after a short journey by train, you take a brief walk through the city before stepping inside Nara Park, where curious deer come to greet you. If you’re carrying any food, you might quickly make quite a few deer friends! Your first destination in Nara is Todai-Ji, the largest wooden building in the world. Dating back 1,200 years, the temple was once the center of religious life in Japan. The temple is also home to the Daibutsu , a 49-foot bronze Buddha that has survived virtually unchanged since 752. Along with your regular guide, a Buddhist monk accompanies you on the tour of the temple grounds and provides expert knowledge of the temple’s history and cultural significance. Depending on the temple’s schedule of events, you might have the chance to see parts of the temple not usually open to travelers. Due to the number of foreign visitors Nara receives each year, the options available for lunch range from stone-fired Italian pizza to mouthwatering okonomiyaki, a savory pancake described as ‘Osaka soul food.’ If you want to try some authentic Nara cuisine, look no further than nyumen , one of the first noodle dishes imported to Japan from China. The thin noodles practically melt in the mouth as you slurp them up a chopstick full at a time. It’s impossible not to have a pleasant afternoon in Nara. Your guide can arrange a private tour of the Nara National Museum, which houses some of the finest examples of Japanese scrolls and calligraphy. Also, if the weather is nice, Nara offers bike rentals at reasonable prices. As you return to Kyoto by train, your guide provides you with a list of options for dinner."

Soak in these sounds of pristine nature as you explore the temple grounds. If you’re looking for a more hands-on experience in Kyoto, take a Japanese cooking class led by a chef, or learn the secrets of Zen meditation from Buddhist monks. Or, if you have your walking shoes, take a private tour of Kyoto’s hidden streets and private spots where you can appreciate the scenery without the tourist crowds. If Japan’s cuisine has taken hold of your palate, be sure to visit Nishiki Market, where the vendors’ stalls sell the special ingredients you need to recreate Japan’s subtle flavors back home."

Head next to Shinjuku and immerse yourself in the heart of Tokyo as locals walk past in all manner of clothes and outfits. Shopfronts entice with bizarre things for sale, and you can go to a restaurant at Takashimaya Times Square Complex where even the toilets provide entertainment, the seat talking to you as well as squirting water. Throughout today, you will travel on the Tokyo subway for the quickest way to get around, and very easy to navigate alongside your guide. You will all marvel at the efficiency as every train arrives at the exact second it is scheduled. For the afternoon, you can visit Tokyo’s two best museums for kids. The Tokyo Fire Museum is always a hit with youngsters, who can jump around all the exhibits, and then there is the Tokyo Toy Museum, a giant playground with areas for kids of all ages. It is not really a museum, and more like a giant space to play for your kids while you rest your legs. End a busy day in Shibuya, surrounded by bright lights and people. The attraction is to stroll without a plan to see which stores grab the attention of your kids.

There will be time for one of these attractions, or you can visit none of them and take it slow in the park before the bullet train zooms off and Japan whizzes past the window. Traveling in Japan is integral to the experience. Are we nearly there yet? The answer is yes from the moment you set off. Soon the megalopolis fades away, replaced by the cone of Mount Fuji and the green slopes of rural Japan. You’re staying in Hakone, where hot springs bubble and the country’s finest ryokans can be found. Enter the ryokan through sliding doors and see your accommodation for the night. But where are the beds and where do we sit? A ryokan provides an authentic Japanese experience, where you sit and dine on tatami mats, and staff rolls out your futon beds after dinner. It feels like you’re in an old Japanese movie and there are costumes you can borrow to fully look the part. Hot springs are connected to the ryokan so take a dip before the ceremonial multi-course dinner. And as you fall asleep, wonder how different the ryokan can be from central Tokyo."

Kiyomizu-dera Temple is a wonderful introduction, a place where monks roam, colors shine, and Tainai-Meguri is like an old Japanese spook tale. Nearby are the old neighborhoods of Sannen-Zaka and Ninen-Zaka, where you will check into your hotel and check out the lanes lined with teahouses, restaurants and souvenir stores. Most of these areas are pedestrianized, and there tends to be something exotic at every store from statues to scents to gaudy antiques. Next up will be a journey on a rickshaw through Kyoto with your driver literally pulling your whole family along. He will take you to Shoren-in Temple, where the imposing gate is quick to silence anyone who thinks they have seen enough temples. Outside the temple, you can go searching for carp, and then disappear into a bamboo forest. That’s likely to be enough history for the day, although your guide can add more temples and gardens should you wish. After lunch, you can explore the shopping arcades where all kinds of mysterious items are up for sale. The alleys are narrow, and the signs are bright, plus the food stalls have just about everything Japan can offer, from slithers of beef to strange fish and peculiar pickles.

At Tenryu-ji Temple, you will marvel at the detail, and then head out to gardens that are ideal for kids wanting to run off some steam. Follow the garden paths to the north gate, and you will exit into an enormous grove of bamboo, a hidden forest of magical proportions, where once again it will seem as though you have stepped into a movie. Wander slowly up the hill, and it may feel as though the bamboo will never end. But then suddenly, you will have left the forest, and you cannot find the bamboo. How did that happen? One moment there is nothing but bamboo, but the next moment it’s disappeared. That is the magic of Kyoto, and it will continue in Okochi-Sanso Villa, where the Zen garden is a maze of secret paths and hidden walkways. After lunch, there will be time for one of two options with either Kyoto’s most beautiful temple or the chance to feed monkeys in another bamboo forest.

Washed in white and flanked by cherry blossoms, the Himeji Castle is a picture worth a thousand words that you will swoon over before transferring to Kobe. The harbor city, fringed by the mountains, is famous for its exceptional marbled wagyu beef which you may savor at one of the many exalted restaurants dotting its modern skyline."

        "description": "Kyoto is home to 17 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, every one a testament to Japan’s religious and cultural roots. Over these two days, your guide ensures that you only see the best, and avoid the tourist crowds as you discover this city and the treasures within. Kyoto’s two most majestic sites are Kinkaku-ji and Kyomizu-dera. The first, located in northern Kyoto, is best observed in the early morning when the soft light of dawn reflects off the temple’s gold leaf surface. A sight like no other, you discover that a second temple stands proudly in the still waters of the temple moat. Kyomizu-dera is completely different but just as stunning. Located on a mountainside in eastern Kyoto, this Buddhist temple’s balcony overlooks both tranquil nature and the city below. At both sites, your guide is on hand to answer questions or give you and your fellow travelers an in-depth, private tour. Kyoto’s heritage is more than its temple and shrines. Throughout the year, many matsuri (Japanese cultural) festivals occur throughout the city. Once deeply tied to Buddhist practices, these festivals have become more community celebration than religious observance. Participating in one is the best way to get to know these revered traditions. Wearing a happi festival coat, learn the dances that have been passed down for generations. At the festival itself, help carry a mikoshi portable shrine as you make your way through the city streets. The experience leaves you feeling like one of the locals. Kyoto, like many Japanese cities, is a haven for foodies. The city’s status as the imperial capital for over 1,000 years meant that the city’s best chefs catered to the ruling class. These culinary traditions have been passed down to the present day through kaiseki ryori, a purely Japanese cuisine that not only features some of the country’s best food, but also puts it on display as a work of art. As you sample this meal during one of your nights in Kyoto, you find yourself savoring each bite’s varying textures and unique flavors."

        "title": "Mount Koya – Japan’s Religious Roots",
        "description": "This morning, you leave Kyoto behind for a day of adventure. Your first stop is Nara, Japan’s first national capital. An hour’s train ride outside of Kyoto, Nara has preserved much of the grandeur that it was known for in the 8th-century. The city’s deer are sacred to Japan’s Shinto religion and are allowed to live freely in Nara Park. They are quite tame and are known to bow to visitors in order to receive a treat. The grandest sight in Nara is Todai-ji, the largest wooden building in the world. Constructed when the emperor’s power was at its peak, a 49-foot bronze Buddha in the temple’s center required an entire year’s worth of Japan’s bronze production to construct. As you wander through the temple complex, the smell of incense fills the air. Though Japan has changed much in the last 1,200 years, religious devotion is still very much alive in this sacred space. At lunchtime, you leave Nara behind and set off to Mt. Koya. Very quickly you realize that your train is taking you far away from the modern world. Buildings and freeways transform into deep valleys and tree covered peaks. In 819, the Buddhist monk Kukai chose Mt. Koya after many years of searching for the ideal location for his monastery. He believed that Mt. Koya was perfect, as the mountain’s eight peaks created the shape of a lotus blossom. Today the mountain is still home to over 100 Buddhist temples dedicated to the Shingon sect, a set of Buddhist beliefs imported from Tibet. Arriving in the late afternoon, the soft light filters through the tree canopy overhead and onto stone paths and ancient cemeteries that are the final resting places of the temples’ monks. Tour these sacred areas before checking into your accommodations, a functioning Buddhist monastery. Travelers lodging at Buddhist monasteries goes back centuries, a tradition of which you are now a part. In the evening, dine on shojin ryori , the vegetarian cuisine eaten by monks, before turning in for the night."

        "description": "This morning, you rise with the monks to witness morning prayers and meditation. After a vegetarian breakfast, you depart Mt. Koya by train and ferry to Miyajima, the ‘shrine island.’ Known worldwide for its ‘floating’ bright red torii gate, the island is home to peaceful nature and delectable food. For over 1400 years, Itsukushima Shine has sat at the tip of Miyajima. Overlooking the bay, the daily low tide allows visitors to walk up to the tall torii gate. Stepping amongst the shellfish and sea stars, get an up-close view of this impressive sight, one of the three most beautiful in all of Japan. Going inland reveals more friendly deer and peaceful scenes of nature. Take the ropeway up to a mountain peak, or wander through the old town, where the smell of momiji (maple pastry) is heavy in the air. A local delicacy, momiji is a small pastry shaped like a maple leaf, hence the name. A variety of fillings is available, from Japanese red bean paste to dark chocolate. Momiji’s long shelf life means that your friends and family can enjoy this treat back home, as well. For seafood lovers, Miyajima is home to Japan’s oyster industry. From the shore, oyster beds stretch as far as the eye can see. At lunchtime, the smell of barbecued oysters drifts through the streets and entices visitors to sample this delicate and complex food. In the evening, you have the option to stay at a Japanese ryokan on Miyajima, or make the short journey into Hiroshima. If you decide the latter, your dinner is a treat: okonomiyaki . Meaning ‘grill what you like,’ okonomiyaki is a savory pancake stuffed with seafood, cabbage, and noodles. Paired with cold Japanese beer, it is a delicious way to end your day."

From there, your guide takes you through the various memorials throughout Peace Memorial Park, including a small mound that is the final resting place of over 70,000 people. While touring the Peace Memorial Museum, expect to be moved as you walk among the displays, learning the story of the city since that fateful day in 1945. In the early afternoon, board the shinkansen for Osaka. During the 90-minute trip, enjoy a bento box lunch and watch the scenery fly by at nearly 200 miles per hour. Osaka’s history as a merchant city still influences daily life in the 21st-century. Home to some of Japan’s largest corporations, Osaka is one of the busiest cities in Japan.

Known as the ‘little Kyoto’ for its springtime cherry blossoms and fall foliage, the city is home to many artisans who keep alive Edo Period (1603-1868) traditions. During your time in Kanazawa, it is possible to take a class in Japanese lacquerware or gold leaf gilding. No matter your choice, you create a hand-made souvenir to treasure forever. Like many large cities in Japan, Kanazawa was once home to the samurai class. Kanazawa has gone the extra step to preserve its samurai heritage, renovating a series of samurai homes. In this district, tour a home (or two) to see what daily life was like for this well-trained group of warriors and government officials. Dinner this evening is at one of the city’s premier sushi restaurants. Your chef creates a platter that is both appetizing to the eyes and mouth. As you eat, be sure to close your eyes and notice the faint hint of the sea in every bite. This taste signifies the freshest sushi."

        "description": "For the next two days, you venture into Japan’s interior. Surrounded by snow-capped mountains known as the Japanese Alps, you arrive in Shirakawago, a city where ancient traditions are still part of the residents’ daily lives. The first thing you notice is the large thatched roofs that cover every building. Meant to hold up under the heavy winter snow, these structures are still handmade and maintained by the city’s residents. While there, tour an Edo Period silk factory. In the past, many of the city’s residents raised silkworms to supplement their income from farming. From Shirakawago, you continue to Takayama. Just like Kyoto, you may have the opportunity to witness a matsuri . As Takayama is a smaller city, the experience is much more intimate. In the evenings, watch portable shrines and lanterns proceed down the streets, the sound of singing floating down the alleyways. It is a magical time not to be missed. The next morning, begin your day at Takayama’s farmers’ market. Farmers and artisans come from all across the region to sell their wares. The market is an excellent place to buy Japanese rice, as it will be at its freshest. Japanese rice is not sold abroad, making it a unique treat to take home with you. After the market, take a private tour of Takayama’s old town, city blocks of Edo Period buildings. Depending on your tastes, it is possible to tour a sake brewery that still uses tradition methods, or view an artisan handcraft Japanese furniture. No matter what experience you choose, you walk away with a keen understanding of the care the Japanese put into their work. Takayama’s culinary specialty is Hida beef. Like Kobe beef, Hida beef is world famous for its fine marbling. Excellent grilled, sautéed, or even raw, the end result is sure to melt in your mouth. Paired with fresh vegetables and locally produced sake, it is a meal you will never forget. Your hotel these two evenings has all the modern comforts of a western hotel, with the inclusion of outdoor onsen baths featuring views of the Takayama valley below."

At last, you arrive at Matsumoto, home to the ‘crow castle.’ During the Warring States Period and later Edo Period, the castle was an imposing symbol of the shogun’s authority. Today, after much preservation, the castle teaches visitors about the lives of commoners, samurai, and the shoguns who ruled over them. Walking through the castle’s hallways and staircases, feel transported back in time. Leaving the castle, you head to Nakamachi street, a long row of old storehouses converted into shops, cafes, and restaurants. Though what’s for sale inside might be modern, the aura of the past is still present on this enchanting boulevard. In the afternoon, you have the choice of train or private car to take you to Yudanaka, where you discover that onsen baths are enjoyed by animals other than human beings. In Yudanaka reside the snow monkeys, peaceful creatures that spend their days soaking in the hot spring waters. Don’t feel jealous of the monkeys, as your accommodations in Yudanaka feature some of the finest onsens in Japan, no monkeys allowed. Take a relaxing soak before your specially prepared dinner, which is served in your room by hotel attendants."

Both have excellent views of Mt. Fuji, which is photogenic no matter the season. For a different kind of experience, the Hakone Open Air Museum has a variety of sculptures set against Hakone’s mountainous backdrop. Expect beautiful art and iconic vistas as you wander between the sculptures and through the gardens. In the evening, your hotel room has Mt. Fuji views.

        "description": "Whether you decide to travel by train or private car, Tokyo is only a short trip away from Hakone. The largest city in the world, Tokyo is seemingly endless, even from the observation deck of the Tokyo Skytree. A city with one foot planted in the future and the other in the past, there are an unlimited number of things to do during your stay here. To experience both sides of Tokyo’s personality, begin with a leisurely walk through Meiji Park. One of the largest parks in Tokyo, the central shrine is dedicated to the spirit of emperor Meiji. The trails are an oasis of peace, and the shrine itself seamlessly blends in with the surrounding nature. Just a few minutes’ journey from Meiji Park is Shibuya, home to arguably the most famous intersection in the world. Every minute, up to 2,500 people cross the Shibuya Scramble Crossing. If you take part or watch from the Starbucks overlooking the crossing, you are amazed by the size of the never-ending crowd. Tokyo’s Ginza district is home to some of the most interesting stores on Earth. At the Sony Showroom, for example, see the world’s thinnest televisions and newest high-tech consumer electronics. If you should arrive on the right day, the street is closed to all cars and given over to pedestrians, giving the Ginza the feel of Paris’ Aux Champ Elysees. During your time in Tokyo, there is the option to take a day trip to Nikko. Once the burial site of Japan’s shoguns, Nikko has some of the most ornate shrines and temples in all of Japan. Following in the footsteps of samurai underneath the cedar trees, you feel that you are a part of the past. Your final dinner in Tokyo is a treat. Your guide arranges a farewell dinner at one of the city’s many Michelin star restaurants. Though haute cuisine, the meal is casual, letting you reflect on the last two weeks and all the memories you have made. For your three nights in Tokyo, enjoy a western hotel with luxurious modern amenities and spectacular city views."

        "description": "Aboard the Shinkansen bullet train, you catapult towards Kyoto at speeds of up to 200 mph, crossing a third of the Japanese mainland in a single morning. Nearby cities and landscapes may look like a blur, but when Mount Fuji makes its mid-trip appearance, it stands stalwart on the horizon long enough for photographers to have their fill. Fuji’s snow-crested mountain peaks are the highest in Japan and the first active volcano of the tour. (For the best view, snag a window seat on the right-hand side of the carriage.) Stepping out the polished white doors of the Shinkansen into the relic city of Kyoto is a bit like stepping into a time machine. Past the train station, modernity soon dissipates into living history. Women in elegant kimonos and clog-like sandals shuffle to the side of stone streets, avoiding rickshaws as they race over arched bridges and through neighborhoods of wooden abodes, complete with classic curving eaves and sliding doors. The vermillion archways and rock gardens of Kyoto’s shrines and temples appear at every turn. Indeed, there are over 2,000 in total. Some are massive sites with lines of pilgrims and tourists while others—hardly larger than a child’s playhouse—remain hidden away down quiet neighborhood streets. (Remember: Temples are Buddhist and shrines are Shinto. The Japanese see no conflict between the two philosophies and their religious customs are largely an amalgamation of both.) After lunch, you’ll visit the Silver Pavilion, known in Japanese as Ginkaku-ji . The embattled shogun Ashikaga Yoshimasa built the pavilion for personal use in 1482, intending to coat its entirety in silver. Before any silver could be laid, however, Yoshimasa died, and monks who sought to maintain its restrained beauty converted his residence and the grounds into a temple. This example of the sublimation of grandiosity into austerity is emblematic of the Japanese story and is a theme that will be revisited again during your journey. From here, follow the quiet Philosopher's Path as it meanders alongside a city canal to the Kiyomizu-dera Temple. Founded in 778, this Heian-era temple seems to have as many legends as years. Peak over the edge of its infamous wooden veranda, from which hundreds of faithful have thrown themselves in hopes of earning a blessing, which according to folklore, is granted to survivors. For safer fortune, drink from one of the temple's three wish-granting fountains: Longevity, Success, or Love. Beware not to drink from all three; it's believed such an act of greed would nullify the benefits of anyone. That said, the line is regularly held up by pilgrims filling bottles with the magic water. As the sun sets behind the verdant hills enclosing Kyoto, owners of izakaya bars light red paper lanterns above their quaint establishments, casting a welcome glow down the narrow stone alleyways. Upon returning to your luxury accommodation, enjoy a Japanese dinner and retire to your choice of a Western room or a traditional ryokan room, complete with tatami mat floors and a roll-up futon."

Locals claim it impossible to view all 15 boulders at once, as at least one boulder will obscure another from any given view. Some visitors stalk the grounds, straining their necks trying to disprove the claim. Those with calmer dispositions may find the garden to be a peaceful place to focus on mindfulness. Your tour of the forested temple district of Arashiyama begins in Tenryu-ji, a UNESCO World Heritage site and one of the head temples of the rigorous Rinzai school of Buddhism. (In autumn, fall foliage from surrounding hillside decorates the temple complex with crimson plumage.) A footpath beckons you past the temple grounds into a wild forest. As you follow it, you soon find yourself buried in a bamboo grove so tall and so thick that the sun itself only breaks through on the distant horizon, like light through a curtain. After lunch, the afternoon is yours. Should you desire dessert, follow the smell of sweet dough across the picturesque Togetsukyo Bridge to any number of the mochi stands selling the rice cakes and soft-serve green tea ice cream. Wildlife enthusiasts won’t be able to pass up the Iwatayama Monkey Park. It's a steady 12-minute climb to the hill peak home of the 100-plus Japanese macaques, but along the way you expect to hear their howls as they swing above you through the coniferous canopy. Their proto-human society will fascinate those with an anthropological eye and feeding them monkey snacks—sold on the premises—will delight animal lovers. Those wishing to return to central Kyoto with the tour guide can step back into the present with a shopping spree through the chic department stores of Shijo street. For the adventurous foodie, the historic Nishiki Market is a bazaar of novel sights, sounds, and tastes. Whale bacon, egg-stuffed octopus, and cod testicles are but a few of the unique foods to be discovered. In the evening, reconvene for a dinner that contains none of these ingredients."

On the other side of this modern wonder, transfer to an automobile and begin your drive toward the Kuju Highlands. This system of active volcanoes rises from the heart of the island and marks the start of your geological journey into Japan’s past. Follow up the scenic drive with a leg-stretching afternoon hike over Kuju’s stony slopes. The destination itself is your reward, a bath in an onsen —a Japanese hot spring.

The route also passes through the onsen mecca of Kurokawa. The natural springs here offer you an intimate bathing experience in outdoor baths tucked away behind restful lodges, sheltered in the rocks and forests. Prepare yourself for your arrival at the Mount Aso region. The mountain is actually a ring of five separate peaks, huddled in the center of the titanic Aso Caldera. The caldera is the result of a series of catastrophic eruptions dating back 300,000 years and at 75 miles in circumference, it nearly tops the list of world’s largest. The vast depression is almost Martian with its dusty umber hue and cover of basalt rubble. Head to the nearby mountainside village for the first of two nights in a former temple.

At Taka-dake, a breathtaking panorama 5,223 feet above sea level awaits you. Craggy spires linked by steep, spine-like ridges wind down the mountain, like gnarled tree roots burrowing into the green valley below. In the distance, vast swaths of forest canopy course through the flat plains of the countryside, its fields and neighborhoods mere geometric shapes."

        "title": "Takachiho – The Yokagura Dance of Creation",
        "description": "A morning drive along the Yamanami Highway traces the ridges of the Aso Caldera and gives you one last chance to capture its magnitude with your mind or camera. After descending Aso, sojourn into the farming villages that have sustained Kyushu since the introduction of rice several thousand years ago. Walk the fields in which generations of farmers labored under Aso’s shadow, determined to bend the volatile land to their needs. To the south lies Takachihiro, a much-mythologized town and the stage for the most important events of Shinto lore, including the site in which the ancestor of the Imperial Family first descended to Earth. The Takachiho Gorge beckons you as an ideal picnic spot. It’s known for its iconic stone colonnades, which rise above the coursing river on both sides. Though these walls were the natural result of the flow of volcanic basalt from Mount Aso eons ago, one can understand how the ancients might have believed their flawless definition to be the work of gods. Relish in local flavors with a picnic lunch of fresh rainbow trout and chicken, grilled to taste, paired with a medley of mountain vegetables. Sip on shochu , an original Kyushu spirit cherished for its pristine clearness, mellow flavors, and, not least of all, its high proof. It comes served in the old style, heated at a local teahouse and poured in a bamboo cup to enhance its grassy aroma. Your steps fall lighter on the walk back to Takachiho, and you’re free to relax or sleep off your “hike” at the local ryokan . Come evening, proceed to Takachiho Shrine to witness the yokagura —the dance of the gods. Masked and costumed dancers become the Shinto deities, quite literally according to believers. Their pantomime reveals an origin story full of tenderness and force, and the accompaniment of flute and drum mirror these qualities. Though the yokagura may not tell the story of Japan’s creation as it’s understood in the modern era, it does reveal the story of the people who have lived here, passing their beliefs forward."

        "description": "Cycle to the outskirts of Takachiho. Herein lies Amano Iwato, the cave in which the sun goddess Amaterasu once hid her light from the world. If you travel along the stream bank between the cave and the commemorative shrine, be sure to step carefully around the stone piles consecrating the path. After one last meal in this peaceable land of gods, it’s time for a change of pace in Aya—once a strategic battleground in the feudal conflicts between the rapacious Ito and Shimazu clans. This valley village is cupped by evergreen hills and split down the middle by the Aya River. Take in a bird’s eye view from the Aya Teruha Suspension Bridge, a mind-boggling pedestrian bridge hung like a hammock 466 feet above the Aya River. Return to steady ground on the other side of the bridge, where wonderful hiking trails abound, hidden under a thick canopy. You’ve probably never heard anywhere in Japan described as “wine country,” but that’s what exactly what Aya happens to be. Many of the locals are involved in winemaking and can offer some wine-buying tips based on the town’s peculiar terroir."

        "title": "Obi – Obi Castle and Traditional Craftwork",
        "description": "Take a morning tour of the Aya Castle, which looks authentically medieval, but in truth, is a 1985 reconstruction. The original was destroyed in 1615 by the shogun’s decree that there could be but one castle per domain—an order that dramatically altered the landscape and power structure of Japan. Inside the mountaintop citadel sits a scale model display that shows how the castle’s three-story frame was assembled. The interior museum features the history of Aya and an assortment of the swords, armor, and documents that were so critical to the samurais’ management of the territory. From the castle peak, you can look down on the rural valley below, imagining yourself like a daimyo lord looking upon his realm in the days of old. The neighboring crafts center offers visitors a hands-on experience. See how well you can pick up the dying and weaving techniques—developed in Kyushu over centuries—in just one morning. Continue in the local artisanal spirit with an organic, farm-to-table lunch at an Aya cafe. The drive to your next location—historic Obi town—follows the scenic route along Kyushu’s rough eastern coastline. Stop at Udo-jingu, a Shinto shrine carved in the side of a sea cliff. Udo-jingu was erected in homage to Jimmu, the first deified emperor of Japan. Cast a stone at the beach rocks below and see if you can hit the rock with an engraved target symbol. Accuracy in this endeavor is said to bring good luck. The walls of Obi Castle, which managed to survive both the Shimazu-Ito conflict and the castle-demolishing decree of 1615, are built on foundations of immense stone; immaculately carved and stacked by the masons of the day. The feeling of enclosure is visceral, and one can see how the Ito clan remained well guarded within. The residence of the clan nobility stands in stark contrast. Tea rooms, decorated paper doors, floral arrangements, and open windows reveal the refined side of this warlord dynasty. Dinner and lodging are at a ryokan —so try not to spoil your appetite beforehand with the green tea and assorted sweets you find in the backstreets of Obi."

        "description": "As you stroll the streets of Obi, now in the gentle morning light, notice its historic Edo-era architecture: charming culverts teeming with koi, carefully groomed gardens of both the plant and rock variety. It’s no wonder this city has been named “Little Kyoto.” Return to the volcanic landscape, this time to the Kirishima collection of volcanic peaks. As you hike to the summit of Takachiho-no-mine, you will likely find yourself ascending through thick layers of ghostly fog—for which the region is famous. The mountain’s mistiness might lead one to believe the volcano is actively steaming. Indeed, this is an understandable assumption given that Kirishima is home to active fumarole pits. In Kirishima’s mountainous town of Ebino Kogen, you continue your hike through highland plains coated with a shimmering sheet of Pampas grass. (In the summer, the tufts of grass turn pink, giving the area its local nickname: “the shrimp plateau.”) End your day in a hot outdoor bath under the gaze of Mount Shiratori before retiring to your hotel for dinner and bed."

        "description": "Today you visit the famous bayside beauty Kagoshima. This urban city has been called “the Naples of the East” for its history and relationship with the notorious Sakurajima volcano, which sits just across the sparkling, sapphire Kagoshima Bay. Though the Shimazu clan’s 700-year hold on Kagoshima evaporated with the end of the feudal age, their opulent villa and gardens—called Sengen-en—remain. In addition to curated natural features—pools, rivulets, cherry blossom trees, a bamboo grove—the site is curiously home to the Shuseikan Industrial Complex, the exact kind of facility which pushed the Japanese military towards modernization and the samurai class into obsolescence. In the afternoon, there will be free time. You can choose whether to ferry to Sakurajima to inspect the former island—its 1914 eruption formed an isthmus to the mainland—or stay in Kagoshima and explore the city in whatever manner you see fit. Foodies in the group will delight in Kagoshima’s unique ramen, made with dried mushrooms and dried sardines, and any of the myriad sweets made by the local Seika Foods Company. Shopaholics can get lost for hours in sprawling Tenmonkan street, which features a range of venues, from department store shopping to local artwork. There is no shortage of parks, plaques, and statues for those interested in the Kagoshima’s civic history."

        "description": "On the south end of Kyushu, you come to Chiran. Its historical samurai district has been left devoid of telephone wires and parking lots, giving it the feel of a still frame from the past. In the place of defensive rock walls—like in Obi—Chiran features walls of groomed hedgerows enclosing the village homes. But under the town’s quiet peace lies a darker past; Chiran housed a major Kamikaze air base that catered to the doomed pilots in their final days. The Chiran Peace Museum for Kamikaze Pilots, which holds many of these pilots’ letters, reveals a frightening mindset of all-consuming obedience and unsettling attitudes towards death. Though the museum focuses on the violence of the Kamikaze, its message is one of peace through remembrance, and the museum offers excellent insight into how the events surrounding WW2 shaped Japanese attitudes and culture. Lunch is an old-fashioned treat of soba and udon noodles—made of buckwheat and flour respectively—prepared and served to you in a thatched-roof restaurant. At the very tip of this peninsula, you reach Yamagawa beach—the southernmost point of your journey. Slip into a robe and allow yourself to be buried in the beach’s hot sands, warmed from the geothermal furnace far below. The feeling is remarkable as you feel the earth’s energy flow through the sand and into you; a meditative calm is inevitable. Take this time to relax and reflect on your deepened connection to this land, its mythos and history, and its people. It’s time to return to the metropolis. Fly from Kagoshima to Tokyo and spend the night in a luxury hotel at the heart of the Japan."

This garden, a magnificent example of Edo Period (1603-1868) design, is a wonderful way to introduce yourself to Japan’s beauty. Afterward, head to Meiji Park, where the shrine within is dedicated to Japan’s first modern emperor. Leading up the shrine, you pass displays of sake casks marked with the names of breweries all over Japan. These were made in tribute to the late emperor’s spirit. Even on its busiest days, Meiji Shrine remains a quiet place for prayers and reflection. Purify your hands before entering to find Shinto priests cleaning and performing ceremonies. Visitors are encouraged to offer their own prayers at the main alter, or write them down on a small wooden tablet and hang it with the thousands of others on display. Tokyo is on the move 24/7, and lunch on the go is common for the city’s millions of workers. Though you may not expect it, some of Tokyo’s finest food can be found inside the metro and JR stations. Everything from conveyor belt sushi to Italian pasta is only steps away. In the afternoon, board a metro train to Ginza, Japan’s shopping Mecca. Within just a few city blocks, you can peruse everything from consumer robotics to exquisite stationary. On certain days of the week, Ginza’s main boulevard becomes a ‘pedestrian heaven.’ The road is closed to traffic, and local cafés use the free space to put out tables and chairs. If touring Ginza on one of these days, you might feel that your trip has taken you to Paris rather than Japan’s capital. As afternoon turns to evening, enjoy the energy of people moving in and out of Shibuya Station. You may wish to cross the famous Scramble Crossing with 2,500 other people. From every angle, advertisements and neon surround you in an exhilarating experience."

During the Edo period, Kakunodate was home to a daimyo clan that ruled over the prefecture. Even though the castle where generations of daimyo lived no longer remains, the town’s samurai heritage is still a large part of city life. During the Edo Period, Japan was at peace. The samurai, once fierce warriors, were Japan’s bureaucrats, administering the government decrees handed down by the shogun. In Kakunodate, your first stop is a tour of the city’s samurai district, a collection of preserved homes where eighty samurai families once lived. Two of these homes, Aoyagi House and Ishiguro House, transport you back into the past when samurai officials walked these same hallways. For these two evenings in Kakunodate, your accommodation has an option of a Japanese or Western room. Japanese rooms offer futons and tatami mat floors. No matter which room type you choose, you have access to the hotel onsen , a type of public hot spring bath enjoyed by the Japanese for centuries.

As you walk in the merchant district, your eye catches the Ando Jozo Miso store, the largest and most impressive structure on the street. For over 150 years, the store has sold a variety of cooking sauces to both samurai, commoners, and travelers like yourself. Throughout the year, Kakunodate’s cherry trees provide excellent shade, and for a few weeks in late April and early May, the blossoms turn the city into a ‘little Kyoto.’ Beyond the beautiful sights produced by these lovely trees, Kakunodate’s craftsman have made an industry out of turning cherry tree bark into a variety of products from jewelry to furniture. The merchant district is also home to a local museum which teaches visitors about the town’s history during the Edo Period. An adjacent restaurant serves authentic cuisine from across Akita prefecture. While in Kakunodate, be sure to try Akitakomachi rice, some of the most flavorful in all of Japan."

Spared the destruction, the town continues to protect its cultural heritage for future generations. To see Matsushima’s islands up close, take a scenic cruise around the bay. The sight may put you at a loss for words, much like what happened to poet Matsuo Basho when he first saw the islands in the mid-17th-century. Coming back from your cruise, there is much to see and do on shore. A brief walk inland reveals Zuigan-ji, a 1200-year-old Zen Buddhist temple. Stepping onto the grounds, tall redwood trees flank your path. Near the temple’s entrance are man-made caves, tombs for the ashes of monks from centuries past. The moss covered caves, along with the Buddhist statues and iconography, transport you back in time when people lived in greater harmony with nature. This evening, your accommodation is in a local ryokan , a Japanese inn with a view of Matsushima Bay. In your room, don a yukata to feel more at home.

        "description": "As you arrive in Matsumoto this morning by train, your first stop is Matsumoto Castle. Before the Edo Period, Japan experienced a 150-year civil war between dozens of rival clans. Each clan had its own capital, which was marked by an impressive castle that was both a defensive fortification and a symbol of clan power. Dating back to the tumultuous period, Matsumoto Castle’s imposing, wide black roof gave it the nickname ‘crow castle.’ It is possible to spend your entire day wandering around this impressive structure and the surrounding moats and gardens. Within the castle are displays of samurai armor, weapons, and daily items used by the castle’s inhabitants and defenders. No matter the season or time of day, the castle is a photographic highlight of the tour. You are certain to capture your best pictures here. Just a few minutes’ walk from Matsumoto Castle is Nakamachi Shopping Street. Once a series of warehouses during the Edo Period, the city has restored these buildings to their full glory. Today they are a series of shops where the city’s artisans sell their wares. Besides souvenirs, the stores sell a variety of food items and locally produced alcohol such as wine from local vineyards. Your accommodations for these two evenings are at a western hotel in central Matsumoto."

In the last 50 years, Tsumago’s residents have led a campaign to preserve their city, forbidding such things as visible power lines or television antennas. Walking through the city, the only sights you see are those witnesses by travelers from centuries ago. Though one can walk across Tsumago in a half hour, you find that multiple things catch your eye at once. The Nagisomachi Museum gives visitors the chance to explore an Edo Period mansion where government officials stayed during their journey. The adjoining museum tells the story of how this historical city rebounded after decades of decay in the early 20th-century. Though the Japanese are known for their love of rice, in past eras rice was a luxury for most of the population. In Tsumago, buckwheat soba noodles were the city’s staple dish. If traveling during the warm summer months, there is nothing more refreshing than a dish of cold soba noodles and tsuyu dipping sauce. Make sure to slurp to show your respect to the chef! In the late afternoon, catch a bus back to your Matsumoto hotel."

Many of these stores invite guests to see how their products are made, so make sure to take advantage of their hospitality. Your accommodation for your two nights in Takayama is a ryokan featuring many indoor and outdoor onsen baths. On your first night, a kaiseki dinner is provided.

For decades, farmers and merchants have gathered here to sell their wares, ranging from fresh rice to handmade pottery. It is a wonderful place to explore and pick up a unique souvenir or ingredient for a meal you make back home. Takayama is famous for its matsuri festivals in April and October. Yet if you come to Takayama in any other month, it is still possible to appreciate this amazing tradition. In the Takayama Festival Floats Exhibition Hall, the city’s collection of floats is always on display for visitors. Each float is hundreds of years old. They are a testament to how ancient traditions and practices still have a place in modern Japan."

Though at first glance Takayama-jinya appears to be a palatial estate, it was actually the city’s government office during the Edo Period. Within, you discover dozens of immaculate rooms where the shogun’s officials would receive guests and conduct business. Also inside is the old jail, where criminals or enemies of the shogun would meet their fate. After lunch, you take an hour bus ride to Shirakawa-go. Since 1995, Shirakawa-go has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its gassho-zukuri houses. Some of the most unique architecture in Japan, gassho-zukuri refers to the thick thatched roofs that crown each house. Many of the village’s structures are open to visitors, including Wada house, home to a preserved silk factory. For hundreds of years, silkworm farming was an important part of Shirakawa-go’s local economy. In the museum, see the tools of the trade and learn how residents harvested the precious silk. This evening your hotel is a minshuku , a family run guesthouse, in Shirakawa-go. Dinner is provided this evening and features a variety of local produce harvested by Shirakawa-go’s farmers."

But they are not your destination today. Your train continues on into a new set of mountains which reveal greater natural wonders. Your destination, Mount Koya, is considered to be one of the holiest sites in Japan. 1,200 years ago, the Buddhist monk Kukai chose Mount Koya as the site for his monastery. To Kukai, the location was perfect, as the mountain’s eight peaks resemble the shape of a blooming lotus flower. Throughout the centuries, over 100 temples were founded on the mountain slopes. Each follows Shingon Buddhism, a Buddhist sect imported from Tibet. For hundreds of years, these temples have offered to lodge pilgrims and travelers alike. Tonight, you become part of this tradition as you arrive at your accommodation, a functioning Buddhist temple. Expect your room to be modest, but comfortable. Before dinner, get to know your surroundings by taking a walk on one of the many stone paths that link the temples together. At sunset, monks light the stone lanterns that line the path. The flickering lights turn your walk into a mystical experience. For dinner, dine on shojin-ryori , a vegetarian cuisine that respects the monks’ abstention from meat."

At first glance, Nara seems like any other modern Japanese city. Yet just after a few minute’s walk, you discover Nara Park. From its edge, you can see Todai-ji, the largest Buddhist temple in Japan and one of the largest wooden buildings in the world. Before venturing there, though, you meet Nara’s wild deer. Considered sacred, they have been allowed to live without fear of hunters. Therefore, they are quite tame and are known to bow to visitors to receive a treat. Even before you enter Todai-ji, you are taken aback by its sheer size. Inside is a greater wonder, the Daibutsu . This 49-foot tall bronze Buddha dates back to 752 when the original temple was founded. Though fire and earthquakes throughout the centuries have caused much of the temple to need restoration, the Daibutsu has withstood the test of time. It is a sight to behold and is as breathtaking today as it was when it was first unveiled over 1,200 years ago. In the early evening, you return to Kyoto by train."

In the Edo Period (1603-1868), Kurashiki was known as the “town of storehouses,” referring to the town’s vital role as a city of commerce. Hundreds of years ago, merchants used the city’s canal system to transfer goods to and from other Japanese ports. Kurashiki has kept its history intact through preserving the canals and hundreds of Edo Period buildings. The canal area is one of Kurashiki’s most striking features. Completely man-made, these canals no longer transport rice, but make for a scenic route between many of the area’s attractions. Featured is the Archaeological Museum, which has hundreds of artifacts on display. A walkthrough gives you invaluable insight to how people first settled this area of Japan. For more introduction to Japanese history and culture, the Museum of Folkcraft displays items from all throughout the country, things Japanese used on a daily basis before the introduction of modern technology. Kurashiki has not forgotten about its merchant roots. The storehouses that once protected rice are now home to a variety of boutiques, restaurants and cafés, the latter an excellent spot from which to people watch or simply enjoy the town’s slow pace of life. In the late afternoon, check into your Ryokan, a traditional Japanese inn that feature woven tatami mat floors and futons. If you prefer, a room with a western style mattress can be arranged. Before dinner, take a soak in the ryokan’s onsen bath. Unlike the bathing facilities in your room, the onsen bath is open to the hotel’s guests. You find that the warms waters relieve sore muscles and melt your cares away. Dinner this evening is in one of the Ryokan’s private dining rooms. Featured is the kaiseki ryori menu. Kaiseki ryori refers to authentic Japanese cuisine where stunning presentation matches the exquisite taste. A series of small dishes, this meal is bound to be one of your most memorable in Japan."

        "description": "After breakfast, a private car picks you up from your ryokan , taking you to a ferry leaving for Naoshima Island. Once a sleepy fishing village, Naoshima has transformed itself into an art lover’s paradise. With museums and art installations spread across the island, you find yourself with plenty to do during your two days here. Your first stop is the Chichu Art Museum. Here you won’t find many paintings on the walls, as the museum itself is a work of art. Wander through what seems to be an endless concrete labyrinth, where natural light surrounds you in its warm glow. Just outside, walk through the well-manicured gardens to end your experience. One cannot forget that Naoshima itself is art. If you prefer, rent a bike and travel around the island at your own pace. Don’t forget your camera, as you’ll never know when you’ll find another piece of public art or scenic vista. Your last museum stop of the day is also your accommodation for the night. Like the Chichu Art Museum, the accommodation was designed by Japanese architect Tadao Ando. Wandering through the displays, you see art from all around the world presented in a wholly unique way. Upon checking into the hotel, you discover that your room’s design flawlessly matches that of the museum. With a panoramic view of the Seto Inland Sea, you know immediately that this hotel is like no other, one of the most serene scenes of the trip. Dinner this evening is served at the hotel’s premier restaurant, which features delectable French cuisine paired with wine. The next morning, enjoy a buffet style breakfast before heading out for a day trip to Inujima, a neighboring island. Once home to a granite mine and then copper refinery, Inujima has embraced Naoshima’s focus on art. In fact, the copper refinery, left to ruin over a century ago, is an art piece itself, giving visitors a first-hand view of nature reclaiming this once busy factory. In fact, since 2008, an art museum has existed beneath the ruins, its construction having used many of the refinery’s discarded bricks. Venturing further inland, you discover the Inujima Art House Project, homes that have been converted into art galleries. Not only is the art on display, but the homes themselves are a testament to how the island’s residents lived in an earlier age. Return to Naoshima in the late afternoon. If you wish, there is time to visit an onsen that is also an art museum in its own right. Designed with flashy and surreal art, including an elephant suspended above the baths, the visit relaxes the body and stimulates the mind. If you feel like an after dinner walk, a stroll through the hotel’s gardens just after sunset is a perfect way to end the day."

        "description": "The next two days, you continue island hopping across the Seto Inland Sea. After one last breakfast, you depart Naoshima for Teshima. Though fishermen still leave Teshima’s ports every morning, the island is home to artworks embedded within the rural landscape. The most notable is Teshima Art Museum. Nestled within a rice field, it displays a single piece of art: a concrete shell shaped like a bead of water. The museum is at its most beautiful immediately after rain when the pooled water on the concrete floor reflects scenes of nature right outside. Teshima’s restaurants are also works of art. At one particular restaurant, the terrace roof rests just above your head, making the experience cozy but not cramped. There, local cooks make you a specially prepared meal. In the afternoon, you are off to Shodoshima, one of the few places in Japan to grow olives. For this accomplishment, Shodoshima sister’s island, Milos, Greece, sent Shodoshima a Greek windmill which currently sits in the center of Shodoshima Olive Park. Over the next day and a half, you have an amazing opportunity to explore this island. Your guide arranges a rental car for you to use during this time. Though driving on the opposite side of the road may seem like a challenge, Shodoshima’s small population ensures that traffic is not a problem as you explore this island with a map provided by your guide. With the Mediterranean climate and atmosphere, you may simply want to picnic and relax on one of the island’s many beaches. For nature lovers, the Kankakei Gorge has amazing views from its ropeways: steep rock cliffs and dense forests are just beneath your feet. At the top of the ropeway is a café with a panoramic vista. If you have your walking shoes, you can elect to walk down the hiking trail back to your car. For those interested in Japanese religion, the Great Kannon is an impressive sight with a rare artifact. Entering from the base of the 150-foot statue, you ride an elevator high up into the statue’s chest. On display is a holy relic, a tooth of the historical Buddha. Whether you follow the tenants of Buddhism or not, the visit gives you a rare insight into the role ancient religion plays in modern Japan."

        "description": "For the next two days, you venture to one of Japan’s main islands, Shikoku. Your first stop and base of operations is Takamatsu, a large port city on the Seto Inland Sea. During the Edo Period, Takamatsu Castle was the seat from which daimyo , the shogun’s governor, ruled over the region. Though the castle was lost over 100 years ago, the castle’s foundation and grounds have been restored to their former glory. At the center of the castle garden is the Hiunkaku building. Once a government office, the building now offers visitors lessons in the arts of traditional tea ceremony and Japanese flower arranging. Just outside Takamatsu Castle is the city’s famous shopping arcade. Over a mile long, the arcade’s stores range from groceries to high-end fashion. While there, be sure to have lunch at a restaurant featuring Sanuki udon. Sanuki was once the name of the prefecture containing Takamatsu, and its udon is known nationwide for being wonderfully firm and chewy. Delicious in many applications, the udon best served cold on a hot summer day with a refreshing dipping sauce. In the afternoon, continue your specially prepared tour of Takamatsu before checking into your hotel for the evening. Like in Shodoshima, a variety of hotel options are available, with breakfasts and dinners included. The next morning, you leave Takamatsu for a day trip the surrounding islands. Ogijima is only 40 minutes by ferry and is known as one of Japan’s ‘cat islands,’ where cats outnumber the human residents. As you wander the narrow, stone streets, don’t be surprised if you have a few new friends following you, especially if you happen to be carrying any food. After getting lost in Ogijima’s maze of alleys and roads, take another ferry to Megijima, known to locals and visitors as Ogre Island. Legend has it that Megijima’s caves were once a fortress for ogres. Though visitors have nothing to fear from monsters real or otherwise, the island is a peaceful spot for walks or bike rides. In the late afternoon, take the last ferry back to Takamatsu for dinner and rest."

        "description": "For the next three days, you undertake the journey at your own pace. Arriving at Imabari by train, you begin a 43-mile scenic bike along the Shimanami Kaido, a road that crosses the Seto Inland Sea and features stops at six separate islands, each featuring their own unique beauty and wonder. Though possible to make the entire journey in a day, three days are set aside to make this part of your tour as special as possible. With your luggage sent ahead, not much weighs you down as you begin your bicycle journey. Traffic safety is no issue, either, as much of the journey has a dedicated bike and pedestrian path that is well maintained. Though your pace is completely up to you, many attractions on the way are sure to grab your attention. On Ikuchijima, for example, the Hirayama Ikuo Museum is one of the best art museums in the region. Featuring Ikuo’s art, the pieces express the artist’s emotions on issues ranging from the atomic bombing (which he witnessed as a teenager) to the influence of Buddhism in Japan. If you decide to spend time on the islands, enjoy accommodations and dining in one of the many minshuku inns which dot the road. Expect kaiseki ryori for your dinners, featuring some of the freshly caught seafood from around the area. And, of course, your hotels have onsen baths to soothe sore muscles after a full day of cycling. If interested in a deeper immersion into nature, consider a visit to Yusuhara, a small town located in the Kochi prefecture, which has one of the highest forest coverage densities within Japan. As such, it is an ideal location for shinrin-yoku , otherwise known as \"forest bathing\" or \"forest therapy.\" This restorative movement began in Japan in the 1980s and focuses on rediscovering the intrinsic relationship between forests and mankind, to improve mental and physical health, and to promote a healthier and more sustainable society. Visit a forest therapy specialty clinic, where the staff will assist you in maximizing the power of the forest to improve your health. No matter how long your journey across the Seto Inland Sea requires, your final night is in Onomichi. If you’re still feeling adventurous after your long bike ride, Onomichi features walking paths up and down the city’s hills which reveal 25 spectacular temples. The city’s various museums and attractions make it an excellent reason to extend your journey by a day or two."

Though the legacy of the bombing still influences the city, life here has not only persisted, but thrived. With your guide, tour the Peace Memorial Museum, which has preserved thousands of artifacts from the bombing. Learn the personal stories of the survivors, along with how Hiroshima has become the forefront of the anti-nuclear movement. The first city on your tour, Osaka, also happens to be your last. After an hour ride on the Shinkansen, step back into the fast-paced, neon-soaked world of 21st century Japan as you get lost in the city’s many shops and attractions. One store of note is Don Quijote, where shopping is certainly a quixotic experience. As you squeeze through the tight isles, it seems as if merchandise might fall on you from all sides. With the store’s theme song playing on repeat, it becomes nearly hypnotic as you walk through the store. For the best view of the city, take a ride on the Tempozan Ferris Wheel, the largest in the city. From 369-feet, get a bird’s eye view of Osaka and the surrounding bay. Your final meal in Japan is an izakaya , a Japanese-style gastropub focusing on small, comfort food dishes and a variety of alcohol. ‘Eat yourself to ruin,’ the Osaka saying goes, as you stuff yourself with different food and drink.

        "description": "The marvels of Fukuoka emanate from the massive complex of Maizuru Castle. The emblematic architecture of 17th-century Japan embodies lavish design preferred by the ruling elite believed to have once covered 505,904 square feet. The impressive structure perches atop the stone foundation of the rising summit looming over the Naka River, which acted as a natural moat. The impressive gates and turrets lead to the numerous towers guarding the former royal grounds while guesthouses once offered luxurious accommodations to visiting diplomats and displayed the importance of the castle and of the surrounding town. The shrines and temples were built on strategic points that could double as barracks if needed, while courtyards could act as places of assembly during a siege. After exploring the history of the city with your guide, you can continue into the remarkable aisles of Yanagibashi Market, also lovingly referred to as Hakata’s Kitchen for due to the number of vendors selling fresh produce and offering a stunning array of freshly cooked food. Chefs from around the city arrive early in the morning to choose from the variety of fish on display or wind through the 47 shops ranging from greengrocers to butchers. The vendors are also known for making the popular Hakata-style ramen, which features the barest possible toppings in a broth known as tonkotsu . Hakata is the name of Fukuoka’s business district with the stylized ramen taking its name from the location of its origin. The cloudy broth is made from steeping pork bones in water until it reaches a smooth, nearly milky consistency. The noodles are thin and can range in firmness absorbing the liquid quickly, and the many traditional toppings include pickled leaf mustard greens, red peppers, and pickled ginger root."

The streets act as an open-air museum with approximately 60 buildings preserved from the Meiji and Taisho periods dating between the 1860s and 1920s. The village is divided into four separate sections containing the main town, fishing village, farm village, and mountain village. The Hokkaido Museum galleries offer fascinating exhibits on the layers of history in the region from the woolly mammoths up to the introduction of the steam train. The shrine was erected in the 19th century and remains one of the most important Shinto religious sites in Japan. The massive complex contains a large garden with gorgeous cherry blossoms blooming each spring and hosts celebrations including the Sapporo Festival each June. Parades of men and women dressed in traditional garments fill the complex while paying homage to their ancestors and the spirits of popular religious leaders. The famous alley of Yokocho in Sapporo is known as Ramen Alley due to the large number of ramen restaurants including the original creator of miso ramen, one of the four branches of traditional ramen in Japan. The collection of restaurants in the alley dates back to 1951 when seven ramen shops opened in the same lane, and the number nearly tripled by 2018. The scent of simmering broth emanates from the restaurants making your mouth water, and a number of shops also specialize in the Hokkaido ramen, which uses seafood as a common mixture with the miso broth due to the prevalence of crab, scallops, sea urchin, and different types of fish. You will soon reach the legendary Sapporo Beer Museum located inside a brick building draped in dangling ivy. The brewery represents Japan’s oldest beer company, which was founded in 1876. The galleries overtake three floors following the history of the beer industry in Japan and the evolution of the bottling, signs, and marketing promotions over more than a century of business. A bar on the second floor pours samples of the different styles of beers including the dark and light lagers, hoppy beer, ale, and signature Black Label."

The Old Public Hall was erected in 1910 and acts as the city’s most notable landmark due to its elements that blend Japanese style with American and colonial design. The structure crowns Motomachi Park with a commanding view over the city and of the stoic waters of the port. The flourish of color catches the light with near golden adornments along the trim. The Carl Raymon Residence has the half-timber aesthetic of a traditional German home including a pitched roof contrasting the traditional design of the Higashi Honganji Temple. The 20th-century warehouses along the waterfront glow with red brick preserving the legacy of the city’s place in Japan as a historical trading port. The recent restoration has turned many of the empty structures into a tourist mall lighting up in the evening with a gorgeous glow bouncing off the water. In the evening, you can visit a restaurant renowned for making the iconic salt ramen broth for over 80 years using the kelp supplies to fortify the flavor of the soup. Chicken and pork bones lend a rich quality amid the clear broth containing less fat than its southern cousin.

Take a look around with your local guide this morning, including the spiritual atmosphere in Kasuga Taisha and the superb Buddhist art collection in Nara National Museum. With all the deer that run free, it is easy to spend the whole day in Nara, but you may choose to head back to Kyoto to spend another afternoon with the city’s temples and Zen gardens."

        "description": "Climbing higher up the mountain, you can feel the air change as a misty veil starts to hang through the valley. Through the trees, you will see robes as monks wander to their place of worship. The trees begin to part, and then a temple appears. Up close, the details of the temple are incredible as art is intertwined with spirituality across all the walls and windows. You will be standing in the place where Shingon Buddhism has its roots, at a temple that’s been used by monks for many centuries, and you can also stay for the night. Your accommodations will be relatively simple, but they will be spotlessly clean, comfortable, and you will have privacy. The experience allows you to walk in the footsteps of these monks. Listen to the rhythmic chanting and feel yourself become slowly hypnotized, and then eat with the monks and discover their daily routine. Be guided by three nuns to a cemetery, where many of the significant figures in Shingon Buddhism history are buried. This oasis also provides space to reflect on what you have experienced in Japan, helping you to separate the threads, and then piece together your own impression of the country’s heritage and tradition. And when the bells chime this evening, you will drift into the deep kind of sleep most only find possible in mountain temples."

If you have time, you can visit the iconic five-story castle, steeped in feudal history and supporting the nearly 138-foot-tall tower. The traditional Nishinomaru Garden is located in the castle park offering a peaceful and colorful space to explore among the rippling pond and aromatic tea house. The castle is a feature in the \"Shogun\" series, including the opening credits. You can also freshen up in the contemporary day accommodation and spend some time exploring the very modern city before transferring to Osaka’s international airport for your flight home."

        "description": "Japan is a paradoxical country, where the old and the new sit comfortably side by side, and the sense of tradition mingles with the exuberance of fast-paced 21st-century life. After landing in Tokyo and an airport transfer, two contrasting experiences will put the paradox to the test. Begin with the glass and the lights of the skyscrapers and the sights. Zoom up Tokyo Skytree, the world’s tallest freestanding tower. From the observation deck, you can watch how the city unfolds with clusters of towers interspersed with more low-cut neighborhoods. A spiral glass-enclosed skywalk takes you to the highest viewpoint as a complete city stretches out before you. High up in the 634-meter tower, you can sit down for lunch with the fine French-Japanese fusion cuisine far from traditional, but an excellent introduction to the variety of flavors you will encounter in the country. Come down to earth again, and you will explore a neighborhood where very little is higher than four stories. Shitamachi literally means “downtown” and it provides a great taste of how Tokyo was before the economic boom. Wander to a temple guarded by giant red lanterns, find wooden houses and surreal calligraphy, and feel how the pace of life remains slow here. To complete your first-day experience, you can get an omikuji fortune at the temple to explore how Buddhism and Shinto are different."

It is in a series of small dishes that focus on exacting choice ingredients and aesthetics, where the chef’s skill is to present a particular time and place. The experience is highly seasonal and aromatic, taking your palate on a journey into what is fresh, here and now. Inside a Michelin-starred restaurant kitchen, you will learn with one of Tokyo’s finest kaiseki chefs, an interpreter also at the table so you can understand each other, as this is far from a typical tourist experience. Prepare the special stock and the essential soybean paste, slice and steam with the best, and present the meal in the beautiful kaiseki way. Of course, you will get to taste as well. Sit down to enjoy what has been created, a little sake the natural accompaniment. Kiriko is the focus this afternoon, a form of artisanal glassware developed during the Edo period. Delicate and celebratory, the glassware continues the theme of perfection. You visit the workshop of a master craftsman, learning how the techniques have been passed down here through four family generations. You will be introduced to the basics of the technique and have the chance to create your own kiriko, as well as appreciate how a simple bowl or sake cup can also be fine art. Your evening will be free, and your guide can give you plenty of recommendations on places to see and eat."

You will sit cross-legged and observe the wrestlers as they train, admiring the obsession it takes to become king of Japan’s national sport. There are almost 50 sumo studios across Tokyo, and it is rare for travelers to be invited. You can only observe silently, and as the morning session continues, the wrestlers will battle it out, great forces crashing together. There is such power here, but by visiting a sumo studio, you will also get an idea of the sport’s ritualistic element. In the afternoon, you can try something completely different with a Taiko drumming lesson that layers together different basic rhythms, along with chanting and aesthetic arm swings."

Along the way, there will be time to reflect on Tokyo, both the experiences and the neighborhoods you were able to explore. While each day in the capital was focused on two exclusive experiences, you will have also traveled to different parts of the city, from famous places like Shinjuku to backstreets tucked away. Arriving in Kanazawa, the experience is three-pronged, but the day also allows you to stroll around one of Japan’s best-preserved old towns, one full of wooden houses plus Geisha and Samurai folklore. Whitewashed and imperious, Kanazawa Castle is the finest of all the fortresses in Japan. Mysterious and mazy, Kenrokuen is among the country’s best gardens. Your local guide will take you to meet the head gardener, and through translation, you will come to understand the religious symbolism behind the garden’s design. After that, you can explore the Omicho Market, which is still going strong after 400 years with some 200 stalls squeezed into a narrow Edo Period building. With all manner of seafood and fresh vegetables abounding, you will enjoy both the colors and the aromas. This is the place to eat local, and your guide will show you the stalls that have been revered across Japan for many centuries."

Wander through a forest of cedar to the wood-carved corridors of this 13th-century temple precinct. Priests wander between the 70 doyo halls. Although at first it seems simple, the temple has an abundance of small artistic details, often missed by the naked eye but integral to the feeling of peace and spirituality. First, you will observe the monks as they go about their strict practice, and then you will meet with a priest, conversing cross-legged at the headquarters of Soto Buddhism. There are 15,000 Soto temples across Japan, and this one is the most important. You will experience daily life as well and can discuss what it means to be a priest in this hidden corner of the world. This will be an experience that you will likely need time to reflect on, so where better to rest than a private onsen hot spring in Kaga? Spend the evening in a ryokan, where sliding doors open onto your private, therapeutic bath. You will have time to slow down and take check of everything that has happened over these first five days.

For example, you might wish to make a sunrise visit to Korin-in to experience Zen Buddhism just beneath the Higashiyama Mountains. Or, you could participate in a tea ceremony with your drink served by a master brewer in a small teashop, or by a Kyoto geisha in the Gion neighborhood. Kyoto was Japan’s capital of culture, and ceramics provide some time to understand the city’s innovative art. Meet with some working potters before a private tour of galleries and stores in the Kiyomizu part of the city. Then, take a quick train to Nara, where hundreds of wild deer mark the route to the world’s largest wooden building. A giant bronze Buddha awaits when you head inside, shimmering softly amid the surreal structure. Nara was Japan’s earliest capital, and there are plenty of other things to see with streets of cobbled stone for a lovely afternoon."

Arashiyama is the most unmissable of Kyoto’s temple neighborhoods, and a rickshaw provides an authentic means of exploring it all. There are two additional garden stops, both generally closed to the public. Many of Kyoto’s Zen gardens are private, so you need to know someone with a key.

If there is something or somewhere you do not want to miss, then your local guides can build it into your schedule. You might enjoy a food tour through Kyoto’s market, or perhaps there is a particular temple or shrine you have seen photos of, or maybe you just want to take in a simple izakaya for some evening beers and dining. Although Japan does run to a tight schedule and everything is on time, each day on your tour has enough spare hours for you to add and amend once your day progresses. Kyoto is more than just a city, and you will end your tour in Miyama. In a monzeki temple, you can meet the head priest, a distant member of an old imperial family. Besides antique fusuma screens and Buddha statues, you can discuss life in the mountains. Beneath kayabuki thatched-roof farmhouses you can make a connection with people who continue with very traditional ways of life. In an ancient forest, you can search for bears and monkeys in another place that is normally closed to the public. Over a dinner of ayu, or sweetfish, you can experience life without television or Wi-Fi, something that does not even seem possible when you think of Japan. Miyama is not known to the Western world, and it provides a wonderful final day in the country."

Take the Miyagikyo Distillery, enclosed by mountains and nestled between two rivers in Sendai. Legendary tales talk of Masataka Taketsuru starting whisky production after one sample of the unsullied mountain water - A fanciful tale? Maybe. Fast-forward to 2015, Miyagikyo Distillery was voted Distiller of the Year by the International Spirits Challenge, so perhaps there's a little more than mythology here. Arrive at Miyagikyo and the mystical reverie is immediately apparent, the distillery dominating a postcard setting, nobly standing on a landscape dappled with the elegant search for perfection. In the morning you'll land at Narita Airport, where you will be greeted and transferred directly to the five-star Palace Hotel and a deluxe room with balcony overlooking the city. Relax and settle in, the Tokyo skyline rising and falling away towards the horizon. Your expert Tokyo guide meets you at Sendai station and guides you on a tour of the Miyagikyo Distillery, a place that happily opens its doors to those seeking to pursue the impeccability of its production. You're pulled into the natural setting, the distillery tucked away amongst a setting of diaphanous beauty. Then you're swept away by the complex fruit-noted tones of Nikka Whisky. Return to Tokyo and a dinner at Takazawa is recommended, the exclusive 10-seat restaurant expertly fusing French and Japanese cuisine. Voted one of Asia's 50 Best restaurants by the World's 50 Best, the intimate dining room is effervescently brightened by signature dishes like snapping turtle soup and purple asparagus, or a rock pool-like assembly of seafood served on a gentle dusting of powdered shrimp sand. Subtle notes prosper and mingle while there's always a visual surprise emerging from the kitchen."

Travel by rail, hurtling from cityscape to these natural aquatic counterpoints, first dipping into the Picasso's and Henry Moore's of Hakone Open Air Museum. From Odawara Station you're escorted by private car around Hakone, the mysterious peak of Fuji a constant compass point in the journey. Snuggled into the mountain's forested slopes, elegantly illuminated by Fuji's cone, you'll find Fuji Gotemba Distillery. One single malt and three grain whiskies are produced here, each sampled with the spellbinding backdrop of Fuji and her subtly green slopes. Slip into the natural reverie and sample their unique setting, each whisky emerging from the waters of Fujisan that trickle down from above. A traditional Japanese Onsen, or spa, can also be visited during your time in Hakone. You'll be dropped at the train station for the return journey to Tokyo, where tonight's recommended drinks and dinner also delights in its authenticity. Like Mount Fuji, kobe beef has come to symbolize the bashful majesty of Japan and its culture. While kobe very much epitomizes the pursuit of perfection, it's not in the Japanese spirit to over-celebrate. This iconic meal is bold and confident yet it's not over-embellished. Ascend to the 52nd floor of the Park Hyatt, where you can relive Lost in Translation at the New York Bar. Then move across to the dining tables of New York Grill, where the kobe beef comes with the soft multiplicity of tender tones."

Wooden roofs slant with timeless grace, hanging over serene untrammeled lanes. This is a place of tradition, of sleeping on tatami mats in an elegant ryokan. Honjinhiranoya Kachoan is one of the finest ryokans in Japan, a luxuriously tranquil overnight stop that symbolizes the bucolic splendor of Takayama and its history. With your JR Rail Pass you leave Tokyo and meander through the countryside to Takayama, a five hour journey that's dominated by softly-changing landscapes. Your luggage is transferred directly to Kyoto with Japan's luggage porter system, so you just need to pack a small bag for the next three nights in Takayama and Kanazawa. In Takayama's quaint downtown you can walk from sake brewery to sake brewery, a local guide tailoring the visits to your exacting tastes. Be transported back to the Edo period as Hirase is Takayama's oldest sake brewery - almost 400 years of brewery history that continues its specialization in Hido and Hyogo rice. Kawashiri's search for the perfect spirit utilizes only local Hidahomare rice, the sake stored and fermented for up to four years. Walk slowly, past the wooden frames of history to Harada Sake Brewery, sampling their Sansya sake that dates to 1855, and their modern jingo sake refined by nectar extract. Each sip of sake adds further enchantment to Takayama, historic Japan manifested in a compact old town sprinkled with blossoms. Sample a range of unique flavors at Hirata Sake Brewery, including the ten year old Suiou, multiple winner at the national sake brewery contest. Keep walking, stepping across the hues of history to Oita Sake Brewery. Distinctly dry tastes have made this a local favorite for over three centuries, making it perhaps the ideal souvenir to reflect Takayama. Then there's Niki Sake Brewery, with its highly polished rice and colder temperature fermentation, and the ancient rice that's used at Funasaka Sake Brewery. Each of the seven blends tradition with proactive experimentation; always innovating in their pursuit of perfection. Completing today's elaborate celebration of Japan's tastes is a kaiseki ryori dinner at your ryokan. These social celebratory dinners now revere sake as much as they do tea, serving a continual array of small dishes that journey through the culinary essence of Japanese food. Each dish is defined by delicacy and subtlety, a myriad of textures and flavors working their way across the palate, opulently accompanied by the best of Takayama's sake. It's a timeless meal in a timeless setting, imbued with an aristocratic ode and preference for the delightful."

Sample your way through history, sipping on the sumptuous hues that cascade across the town. When a foreigner thinks of sake they think of Japan. When a Japanese person thinks of sake they think of Takayama. Peek further into the town's past by exploring the Hida Folk Museum and wandering a final journey through these antiquated alleys and streets. From here it's a two-hour train journey to Kanazawa, another town that revels in its presentation of historic Japan. You're staying in a Machiya, a traditional townhouse that's been carefully converted into accommodation for those seeking to sleep amidst the beauty of Japan's past. It's in places like Takayama and Kanazawa that the idiosyncrasy of Japan's spirits really reigns. This search for perfection is not an art form; it's an inherent part of culture, continually evolving yet always respecting the ancestral pioneers. Arrive in Kanazawa and spend the day on a privately guided tour of the town's sights, including the hypnotic foundations of Kanazawa Castle and the blissful atmosphere of Kenroku-en, considered to be amongst the three most beautiful gardens in the country. Meander along the paths that blossom with the seasons, footsteps the only break in an atmosphere of silence. If there is time there's the option of also visiting Kanazawa Art Museum, one of Japan's best for modern art. A second kaiseki ryori is recommended for tonight's dinner, locally famous chef Shinichiro Takagi welcoming you to an evening of multi-course delicacies as seductive on the eyes as they are on the tongue. Inspired by the bounty of the Sea of Japan and fresh seasonal ingredients, the assemblage of small dishes is served in a humble setting, allowing the flamboyance of taste to shine even brighter. Alain Ducasse was once welcomed here at Zeniya and this gastronomic haunt is well regarded to be amongst Japan's finest kaiseki ryori experiences. The succession of dishes connect the categories of Japanese cuisine, blending the tea ceremony tradition into vegetarian temple food of Buddhist monks, then the rich imperial flavors of samurai gastronomy and the modest yet tasteful samples of local life."

Fearsome surprises are discovered on this very rare opportunity to discover the complete inner workings of an ancient temple. With no photography allowed inside, few Japanese temples are loaded with such an enigma as Myoruji, the walls alive with the trappings of legend. Nearby, the Omi – Cho Market introduces you to some of the finest sashimi in Japan, delicate offerings carved across tables of raucous ambiance. Kanazawa is full of hidden and modern sides, each explored on a one-day tailored private tour with a local guide. Central to Kanazawa's rich evocation of history is the Yachiya Sake Brewery, some 400 years old and widely considered to be the best in the region; you'll see this sake served at all of the town's best restaurants. A brew master reveals some of the secrets, guiding you through the production as you sense the essential spirit to Kanazawa. This sake epitomizes the town, exuding a rare almost elusive feel, much like the Higashi District where geishas wander past the relics of teahouses, or Kazue-Machi Chaya District, where Edo era houses are layered in the gentle creeping of moss. Today's tour-dots are connected with a tourist bus pass and all entrance tickets are included. For tonight's dinner, the Otomezushi restaurant is recommended. Hidden down an alley, this tiny restaurant leaves you in the skilled hands of Kazuhiko Tsurumi, the third master, or Taisho , in the restaurant's 50-year history. It's generally considered that it takes a sushi chef ten years just to perfect the basics. Tsurumi has been doing it much longer than that. He blends high-grade koshihikari rice with the best from Kanazawa's coastline, controlling the freshness of the seafood to produce a long series of enchanting mouthfuls; another treat of rare and almost elusive feel. This is lauded as one of Japan's very best sushi restaurants and featured in The Wall Street Journal's Scene Asia. Consider the omakase menu, similar to a degustation menu yet with each of the many dishes consisting of just a single exceptional mouthful."

Kyoto is ancient Japan, one of the world's great cultural cities and home to 17 World Heritage Sites, 1600 temples, and over 400 Shinto shrines. After the 3.5-hour Shinkansen train ride you'll be given a three-day Kansai thru pass for your time here. Check in to the Ritz Carlton and explore during the afternoon, wandering lanes dappled with the unmissable scents of history. Head to Gekkeikan Okua and Kinshi Masamume, two museums dedicated to the craft of brewing sake and the history of Japan's iconic spirit. Kyoto dances to an historic beat, the streets softly resonant of yesteryear's rhythm. Continue to step backwards in time with the sake breweries that lace the Kyoto ward of Fushimi, their white walls juxtaposed with elegant rows of willow trees and the Horikawa River. Many can be visited although the following are recommended for their timeless role in the production of Japan's spirit. Yamamoto Honke Brewery dates to 1667, their sweet sake a pioneer in Kyoto's history. Matsui Shuzo Sake Brewery is modern by Kyoto's standards, dating to the early 18th century. For almost 300 years they've only brewed small batches and sold locally in Kyoto, perfecting their taste to the palate of the ancient city's population. Legend and life mixes easily in Kyoto, the two intermingling until spirit and spirits are equally challenging to separate. Continue the Kyoto journey, winding past the streets of antiquity to the spiritual Tori gates of Fushimi Inari Shrine, a transcendental slice of history perched above Fushimi. Now a Kyoto Maiko experience, where tea-pouring rituals are accompanied by songs and music, the verses concocting tales of the Maiko , an apprentice to the Kyoto Geisha. Finally, tonight's recommended dinner offers a quintessential local experience, the Kyoto udon noodles soft yet still chewy at legendary local haunt Omen."

        "description": "Gold leaf glistens, juxtaposed against dreamy forests and the quaint pond of a temple garden. The colors collide, so much from nature's spell mixed with the excess of Kyoto's 14th century Shogun. Today you tour Kyoto's historic architecture and temples with a private guide, starting here, at the Golden Pavilion, well before the other tourists arrive. Ascend above the city to Kizomizu Deru , a Zen temple with dramatic panoramas over Kyoto. Across this elevated suburb are hundreds of temples and shrines, each its own distinct jigsaw piece in the city's chronicles. Today is relatively flexible and can be tailored to include many important temples or gardens in the city. Tonight's included dinner is also a chronicle, a Japanese modern kaiseki meal that tells a story of the seasons with the timelessly elegant style of Kyoto. Giro Giro is among Japan's best restaurants, the culinary story mixing Kyoto's tradition with innovative modern influences; think dishes like diakon rolls filled with sweet potatoes and fois gras, or raw caramel infused with roasted green tea, then an equally delectable dish to continue the journey through the seasons. Completing the day, you may wish to visit craft beer bar Bungalow for a sample of the country's best microbrews."

        "description": "In Jim Murray 's 2015 Whisky Bible it's not a Scottish single malt that takes away the gong. To the surprise of the Scots, a Japanese distillery produced the world's number one whisky. That's not a surprise to anyone in Japan: the Suntory Yamazaki Distillery has won the International Spirits Challenge prestigious Distiller of the Year title in four of the last six years. The Yamazaki products are awarded some of the top honors of whisky on a yearly basis. Murray labelled it a drink of “near incredible genius” going on to exude the exquisite boldness and lingering teasing spice of the Yamazaki Single Malt Sherry Cask 2013. Today you enjoy a tour of this unique distillery, sampling the rounded notes of the world's best whisky and comparing it with a wide range of the distillery's other single malts. Tucked into the foothills of the Tenno Mountain, Yamazaki reflects the continual strive for flawlessness, as well as the unnerved marrying of tradition and innovation. It's the spirit highlight on a whole itinerary of spirits. With the afternoon dedicated to the Suntory Yamazaki Distillery, the morning is spent in the bamboo forests of Arashiyama. Javelins of light flicker through the trees, casting a waltz of light and shadows between the reeds. Wander along the path, immersed in the harmonious show, before the bamboo rescinds and the serenity continues with Tenryu-Ji Temple, the largest Zen monastery in Western Japan. After the world's number one whisky, for a recommended dinner, korugewagyu beef offers another rounded taste and texture. Sampling it with a sukiyaki meal at Moritaya Kiyamichi is the evening's recommended dinner. Seared with brown sugar, soy sauce, and sake, the beef slices come with a pungent aroma yet remain almost-impossibly tender and succulent. This beef is raised on site and has been for some 140 years."

A change of flavors as well as you tour the Minoh Brewery, a local favorite that jumped to international claim when their stout won Best Stout at the 2009 World Beer Awards. Sample their rare Double IPA and journey through a succession of quirky brews, each a fitting continuation of the continued search for perfection. While the taste switches from sake and whisky to beer, the spirit of Japan lives on in this brewery. Dinner tastes also change now you're in the city, the reverberant edge of Osaka epitomized by the showy presentation of teppanyaki . Teppanyaki Kiryu is recommended as a showcase of this flamboyant style, their wagyu beef and fresh seafood amongst Japan's finest. It's the best rated teppanyaki restaurant in a city known for its teppanyaki. As night falls Osaka is ablaze with lights, dazzling storefronts and gleaming streets a wonderful journey into Japan's modernity."

Continue the tour in Suita, where you explore the original Asahi brewery and the production behind Asahi Super Dry, the country's best selling beer. It's another symbol of Japan, the crisp taste complementing the modern blue-collar feel of Suita and Osaka. There's a number of options for evening entertainment and your guide can drop you at an Osaka Haishin Tigers baseball game, or Beer Belly, an atmospheric pub that specializes in the best of Japanese microbrews.

From Osaka you use the JR Rail pass to return to Tokyo, the country's blur of valleys and cities flying past the window. Your luggage is transferred separately, so just sit back and watch the country unfurl. Tonight you have a reserved table at Sukiyabashi Jiro, immortalized in the Jiro Dreams of Sush i documentary, a restaurant of intimacy and authenticity with three Michelin stars. The restaurant has become a delicate snapshot of Japanese cuisine, chef Jiro Ono offering a varied continuation of dishes and mouthfuls that melt across the palate. It's so good that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe chose Sushi Jiro as the place to entertain Barack Obama. After the sushi as a recommended way to end the evening, slip next door to Bar High Five for an evening of cocktails with a panorama across Tokyo, a fitting end to a journey of indulgence and opulence."

Wandering through the district’s back alleys, you can find hundreds of stores selling everything from manga comics to electrical components for obsolete computers. In the late afternoon, you arrive in the Ginza, Tokyo’s premier shopping district. From high-class bags at Hermes to all manner of stationary supplies at Ito-Ya, just about anything can be found along the Ginza’s main boulevard. For technology lovers, visit the Sony Showroom, where the company displays its latest inventions not yet released in the West. Every day, over 3,640,000 commuters travel through Shinjuku Station, making it the busiest in the world. Get caught up in the energy as you explore Japan’s urban core. Depending on your budget, your guide can arrange a fine dining experience at a Michelin star restaurant, or a laid back meal at an izakaya , a traditional Japanese restaurant that offers a variety of small comfort food dishes paired with alcohol. If you’re not feeling too tired after dinner, soak in Shinjuku’s neon glory with a stroll through the district. Or perhaps stop at a pachinko parlor, where the loud sound and flashing lights rival any casino in Las Vegas. When you decide to turn in, your guide sees you to your hotel."

        "description": "Today, you experience another one of Tokyo’s many faces. In the early morning, even before millions of commuters pour into Tokyo’s metro system, your guide takes you to Asakusa for a private tour of Senso-ji Temple. Once a modest shrine erected by fishermen over 1,000 years ago, Senso-ji is now one of Tokyo’s most magnificent temples. Arriving early in the day means avoiding the crowds, and the ability to soak in the peace and serenity that Buddhist temples are meant to inspire. Along with Buddhism, Shinto is Japan’s other primary religion. In Tokyo, no Shinto shrine is greater than Meiji Shrine, dedicated to the spirit of Japan’s first modern emperor. Situated in the middle of Meiji Park, the shrine is dutifully attended by Shinto priests, whose ceremonies still provide worship to Emperor Meiji. Even if the crowds are a bit heavier here, you notice that the shrine retains its peaceful tranquility. Besides chirping birds, it is likely that the only other thing you hear is the sound of visitors clapping their hands as they give prayers at the main altar. Around lunchtime, you board an express train at Tokyo Station heading to Nikko, the burial place of the shoguns during the Edo Period (1603-1868). During the train ride, enjoy a bento box lunch as Tokyo’s concrete metropolis melts away into tree covered valleys and hills. There is much to see from your window as the two-hour journey flies by. From the train station, it is a short walk to the Toshogu , the main shrine which marks the burial place of Tokugawa Ieyasu, the first shogun who led a united Japan in the early 17th-century. It is easy to miss the actual burial site, your eyes glued to the ornate carvings and lavish decoration all around you. In the late afternoon, board your train back to Tokyo for a sushi feast. Your guide arranges a dinner at one of Tokyo’s finest sushi restaurants. While eating, you discover that each piece carries the faintest taste of the sea, a hallmark of fine Japanese sushi."

        "description": "This morning, your guide picks you up from your hotel. Boarding a private minivan, you leave Tokyo behind to travel to Hakone, a 90-minute journey. Before the trip is half over, though, you begin to see Mt. Fuji in the distance, its snow covered peak serving as your beacon throughout the day. Arriving in Hakone, what to do and where to go is completely up to you. If you are an art lover, the Hakone Open Air Museum has one of Japan’s largest collections of Picassos in the country. If you’re looking for a little rest and relaxation, the city’s various onsen baths are an excellent way to relieve sore muscles. After lunch in Hakone, your van takes you to Mt. Fuji. Your first stop is Yamamiya Sengen Shrine; a Shinto shrine erected at the foot of Mt. Fuji. Providing excellent views of the mountain, the shrine is still home to Shinto priests who use the shrine as a way to offer prayers to the mountain’s spirit. From the shrine, your bus winds up the curvy road leading to Mt. Fuji’s 5th Station. A little more than halfway up the mountain, the 5th Station is the starting point for the majority of men, women, and even children who make the eight-hour climb to the summit every summer. The 5th Station is an excellent place to learn more about Mt. Fuji, buy a souvenir, or take a nature walk that reveals stunning views of the Fuji Five Lakes region. In the late afternoon, your van takes you back to Tokyo. Dinner this evening is ramen, Japan’s famous hearty noodle dish that makes for a delicious way to end your day of adventure."

The smell of the sea hangs in the air as your guide takes you through many stalls that sell seafood to Tokyo’s finest restaurants. Watch expert fishmongers expertly prepare fish for sale, and witness the morning tuna auction. At the end of your visit, have a sushi breakfast at one of the city’s best sushi restaurants. Full of sushi, relax on the shinkansen towards Kyoto, Japan’s capital until 1868. The Shinkansen is one of the fastest trains in the world and delivers you to Kyoto’s city center in just over two hours. You arrive in Kyoto in the late morning. Going to your hotel or ryokan, there is time to relax before visiting a Zen Buddhist garden. There you have lunch with a monk who will teach you about Zen Buddhism and the deeper meaning behind the rock garden’s arrangement. Your first evening in Kyoto is a treat like no other. For hundreds of years, the women who choose to become geisha commit themselves to an ancient set of cultural practices. A superb craft, you have the opportunity to witness these rituals first hand at a geisha house in the Gion District. Watch geisha perform the tea ceremony and music, traditions that have been handed down for generations. At the end of the performance, the geisha serve you a traditional Japanese dinner."

The temple is most beautiful right after dawn when the morning’s soft light reflects off its gold leaf surface. Arriving early also ensures that you miss the crowds that flock daily to this amazing attraction. Kinkaku-ji may be Kyoto’s most spectacular shrine, but Kyomizu-dera provides Kyoto’s most stunning vista. Atop Otowa Mountain, Kyomizu-dera overlooks Kyoto and the surrounding valley. After soaking in the balcony’s views, your guide takes you on a tour of the temple complex, explaining how the tenants of Buddhism are expressed throughout this stunning structure. This evening has what is likely the most memorable meal on the trip. Kaiseki ryori is a traditional Japanese cuisine perfected in Kyoto. Once served to the emperors who inhabited Kyoto’s Imperial Palace, kaiseki ryori is defined by a series of small, artistic dishes that highlight the region’s freshest meats and vegetables. This is definitely a meal where you will want to have your camera ready to take pictures."

You arrive before the other visitors and walk the 200-meter bamboo path towards Tenryu-ji, the greatest of Kyoto’s five Zen Buddhist temples. Though rebuilt many times in its 700-year history, the surrounding gardens have been maintained in their original form. Looking out over the still waters and rustling plants, it is easy to take your mind back into the past. In late morning board an express train to Nara, Japan’s first capital in the 8th-century. You arrive in Nara to see a modern looking town, but just a few steps away from Nara Station, you discover the city’s grandeur. In Nara Park, sacred deer freely roam the grounds. Having lived around people for generations, they are quite tame. Your guide takes you to Todai-ji, the largest wooden building in the world. Stepping up to the temple complex, you begin to see the dark figure within. Inside the temple sits a 49-foot bronze Buddha, the largest in Japan. When built 1,200 years ago, the Buddha consumed an entire year’s worth of Japan’s bronze production. Even 1,200 years later, this feat is still an architectural marvel able to humble all visitors who stand before it. Beyond the Buddha, there is still much to see at Todai-ji. Your guide leads you through a series of passageways into the temple museum, where artifacts spanning the temple’s history are on display. The rest of your time in Nara is up to you. Admire 1,000-year-old scrolls in the Nara National Museum, or pick up a souvenir at Nara’s famed shopping street. During your trip back to Kyoto, your guide presents you a variety of options for dinner."

During this walk, you pass under 2,000 bright red torii gates, a Shinto symbol that signifies one is entering a sacred space. During the walk, simply enjoy the peaceful tranquility. Your guide, however, is happy to spend the time teaching you about the shrine’s history and spiritual significance. Arriving at the shrine, you are greeted by many statues of kitsune , foxes, and more stunning view of Kyoto. There is ample time to walk around the lush gardens. Perfect for taking pictures, the shrine is a peaceful oasis in the middle of modern Kyoto. In late morning, board a private van for the short ride to Osaka. After arriving, take an hour’s rest in your hotel room before heading out for an amazing afternoon and a night on the town. Your first stop is the Tempozan Ferris Wheel. Boarding your private compartment, the wheel slowly raises you to nearly 370 feet. With every surface made of glass, nothing stands between you and a perfect view of the city. Osaka is world famous for its okonomiyaki , a savory pancake dish which incorporates cabbage, seafood, and thinly sliced pork belly. A rich treat, it goes down best with a pint (or two) of ice-cold Japanese beer."

At Osaka Castle, you can learn about the city’s samurai history. No trip to Osaka would be complete, though, without a walking tour of Dotonbori, the chaotic shopping street where at night you are bathed in neon light from every angle. Wander the endless stores before ‘eating oneself to ruin’ at one of the district’s many restaurants. For a unique dining experience, try puffer fish at Zuboraya.

        "description": "Today you cross Hokkaido by local train. The six-hour trip flies by as the snow-covered wilderness grabs your attention and doesn’t let go. Arriving in Sapporo in mid-afternoon, there is still plenty of time to enjoy the Sapporo Snow Festival. Started over 50 years ago by high school students, the festival has grown to the level of a world-famous art exhibition. Snow artists and admirers from all around the world come to Sapporo each February for the week-long celebration. Walking through an exhibit with more than 400 sculptures, it is easy to get wonderfully lost among all the beauty. This evening, you dine at the Sapporo Beer Garden on a local dish known as Genghis Khan. Made from grilled lamb and vegetables, it pairs excellently with the city’s namesake beer. For your two nights in Sapporo, your premier hotel is western-style."

        "description": "Today is a self-guided day. Feel free to continue exploring the Sapporo Snow Festival in Odori Park. Or, if you wish, get a birds’ eye view of the festival from the observation deck of the Sapporo TV Tower. For a more hands-on experience, visit the Satoland site. Not only are there snow sculptures, but multiple ice slides and an ice maze. Satoland is particularly impressive at night, when specially placed lights illuminate the snow in many dazzling ways. Besides Genghis Khan, ramen is Sapporo’s signature winter dish. The Sapporo Ramen Alley may be a narrow passage, but it is home to some of the best ramen in the city. As the winter wind blows down the alley, there is no better feeling in the world than taking shelter in a ramen shop. Inside, the savory smells of broth and cooking pork enveloping you like a cozy blanket."

During the winter, these red-faced macaque monkeys relax in the naturally occurring hot springs. Though it is unwise to disturb the monkeys, photography is fine. If you should bring any equipment like a tripod, don’t be surprised if a few of the babies attempt to climb it. In the afternoon, return to your ryokan for rest and relaxation. Dinner is on your own this evening, but Yudanaka Onsen has many excellent dining opportunities from which you can choose."

        "description": "Today you travel to Takayama, a city that was isolated for much of Japan’s history. Your train winds through the snowy mountains, finally entering the Takayama Valley. In the distance, the snow-capped Japanese Alps are reminiscent of the alps in Switzerland, and the city itself seems frozen in time. After dropping off your bags at your ryokan , there is plenty of time to explore Takayama’s old city on your own. Within these buildings, some of which date back to the 16th century, craftsmen still make a variety of goods such as sake and furniture, all while still using traditional methods. Dinner this evening is on your own. We recommend that you try one of Takayama’s restaurants featuring the region’s signature dish: Hida beef. Regarded as one of the world’s finest cuts of beef, Hida beef is excellent as a steak, part of a stir-fry, or even as sushi."

        "description": "This morning, you begin your time in Takayama with a tour through the morning market. Snow or shine, farmers and artisans from around the Takayama Valley come to the market every day to sell their products. The market is an excellent place to buy a souvenir or culinary ingredient for a meal you make back home. The second stop on your tour of Takayama is Takayama-jinya. Though it may look like a palatial estate, the structure was actually Takayama’s government office during the Edo Period (1603-1868). The many covered walkways mean you have ample opportunity to stop and reflect on the winter scenery and well-maintained grounds. In the afternoon, you continue your exploration of Takayama with a self-guided tour. One of the many possibilities is to visit Hida-no-Sato , also known as the Hida Model Village. Located just ten minutes away by bus, this open-air museum is a collection of over 30 preserved homes. As you are able to freely enter the buildings and touch the contents inside, it is an experience not to be missed, especially on a day when light snow falls from the sky."

        "description": "Day 11: Shirakawa-go to Kanazawa – Stunning Homes & Delectable Sushi In the early morning, you board a bus heading to Shirakawa-go. Just an hour’s ride from Takayama, Shirakawa-go is a UNESCO World Heritage Site known for its world-renowned gassho-zukuri homes. Gassho-zukuri refers to the buildings’ thick thatched roofs. Originally designed to hold up under heavy winter snow, these buildings represent some of the most unique architecture in all of Japan. When you arrive, you are immersed in a way of life that has changed little in 300 years. The village is open to exploration, and as you are visiting in the winter, expect few other visitors. One attraction in Shirakawa-go is the Silk Worm Museum. For centuries, silk worm farming allowed the village’s residents to supplement their incomes. Nearly every household raised silkworms in their attics, where the smoke from cooking fires below fumigated the area against harmful insects. Late this afternoon, you board a bus for Kanazawa, a seafood and sushi jewel situated on the Sea of Japan. This evening dinner is included at a local seafood restaurant."

        "description": "To see winter in all her glory, you begin your day with a morning visit to Kenrokuen Garden. One of the three most beautiful gardens in Japan, this garden was once owned by one of the country’s most powerful families. Today the garden’s beauty is available to anyone who wishes to experience it. Around lunchtime, you board an express train heading south. The journey takes you through a variety of cities and villages, including Osaka. Yet your final destination is not the big city, but Mt. Koya. Over 1,200 years ago, the Buddhist monk Kukai chose Mt. Koya for his temple. To him, the mountain was an ideal location because its eight peaks resemble a blooming lotus flower. Over the centuries, over a hundred temples were established around the mountain. Each temple follows Shingon Buddhism, a Buddhist sect originally imported from Tibet. For hundreds of years, the monks on Mt. Koya have offered lodging to travelers and pilgrims. This evening, you take part in this tradition as your accommodations are a functioning Buddhist temple. After checking in and meeting the monks, tour the stone pathways that connect the temples. The stone lanterns that line the paths are capped in snow. You may witness monks cleaning the cemeteries, as they hold the ashes of generations of Mt. Koya’s monks. This evening your dinner is shojin ryori , a vegetarian cuisine that respects the monks’ abstention from meat. You find that the meal is quite delicious, a result of centuries of refinement."

Kyoto was Japan’s capital for over 1,000 years. Hosting over 2,000 temple and shrines, they are perfectly preserved, making Kyoto a city that is a blend of both past and present. After arriving in the late afternoon, you are free to spend the rest of the day exploring. Dinner this evening is on your own. Your luxury hotel for your two nights in Kyoto is western-style."

        "description": "No matter the season, Kyoto is a gem for first time or return visitors. On today’s guided tour of the city, you begin your day at Fushimi Inari Shrine. Dedicated to Inari, the god of rice, Fushimi Inari Shrine is one of the most revered shrines in Japan. Walking up the gentle slope leading to the mountain top, you pass under more than 2,000 bright red torii gates. A traditional Japanese religious symbol , walking under a single torii signifies entering a sacred space. After only a few minutes of walking, you completely forget that you are in one of Japan’s largest cities, as all you can hear is the chirping of birds. At the shrine itself, you discover many large statues of kitsune , sacred foxes known to be the messengers of the gods. You are also treated to stunning vistas of Kyoto and the surrounding mountains. There is plenty of time to take pictures, enjoy the scenery, and meditate. Your next stop is Kiyomizu-dera , one of the most well-known Buddhist temples in Japan. From its balcony, gain another panoramic view of Kyoto, along with the sight of other temples and shrines peeking out from the forests miles away. Just steps from Kiyomizu-dera is the Higashiyama District. A street full of preserved shops, the stores still sell many of the items that made Kyoto a famous destination for travelers during the Edo Period. As you wander in and out of the stores, you find a variety of treasures ranging from pottery to confectionary treats. Your last stop is the Gion District. Gion is home to Kyoto’s geisha, known locally as geiko. Gion is a step into the past, free of the distractions of modern life. Your guide takes you into a teahouse, where you meet a maiko, a geisha in training. She performs for you, including a Japanese tea ceremony. She is happy to answer your questions about her profession and even pose for photographs. Dinner this evening is at a restaurant in the Gion District. The delicious food makes you reflect on all the warm memories you have made in the last two weeks."
