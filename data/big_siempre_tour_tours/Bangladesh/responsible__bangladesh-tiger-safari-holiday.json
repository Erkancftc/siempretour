  "generalInfo": "This tailor made tour will take you deep into Sundarbans National Park, the world’s largest mangrove forest, home to the largest continuous population of tigers on the planet. This harsh and almost impenetrable forest features an estimated 500 tigers and due to the inhospitable conditions it has remained untouched by human settlements - an amazing feat when you think India and Bangladesh are two of the world’s most densely populated countries. <br/><br/>Whilst here we'll be searching not just for tigers but also other rare and elusive mammals, including: Ganges river dolphins, huge saltwater crocodiles, masked finfoot, chital, langurs, finless porpoises and freshwater turtles. Most of the tiger and wildlife watching will take place from small boats which we use to get deep into the narrow and well covered waterways or on the larger boat where we can spotlight well into the night from the safety of the deck. <br/><br/>We will also walk into the mangroves, meadows and beaches and track tigers on foot. We are able to run this unique and pioneering tour because our background is from a scientific and zoological perspective and so we have a great network of colleagues and contacts in Bangladesh, and beyond.<br/><br/>Why choose this Bangladesh tiger safari holiday:<br/><br/>All of our tiger safaris are guided by local naturalists as well as local guides, drivers and, where possible, scientists or researchers. This not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also provides a unique opportunity to learn more about animal behaviour and habitats.<br/>We are the first operator to offer nocturnal spotlighting tours in Bangladesh, which aim to see tigers when they are most active at night. We can also bring thermal imaging and night vision equipment (on request).<br/>We use camera traps (where available) which increase chances of getting close up pictures and footage of tigers and other rare nocturnal animals.<br/>In Bangladesh we offer the rare chance to track tigers on foot, this is an exhilarating experience and one that you will never ever forget.<br/>By joining this tour you will visit a truly wild part of the world and one that very few foreign people have ever heard about. This means you'll get to enjoy some incredible tiger encounters without the crowds often associated with national park safaris in India.<br/>We have explored all the areas we visit in depth and found the best and most conveniently located accommodation. This includes staying on your own chartered boat during the cruise of the Sunderbans with your own fully trained and experienced crew.<br/>Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for individuals (on request).<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>Anyone capable of walking for around 2-3 hours will find this tour easy. The temperatures can be hot but there is lots of shade and the walks are never very long. Most of the wildlife watching is done from the small wooden boats or from the deck of the main vessel.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 years",
