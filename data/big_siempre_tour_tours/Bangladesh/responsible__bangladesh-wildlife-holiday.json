  "generalInfo": "The draw of tracking tigers on foot and having one of the world's rarest apes swing through the trees above your head will get any wildlife enthusiast excited at the prospect.<br/><br/>This wildlife watching tour explores the wonderfully wild and untouched world of Bangladesh from within the rainforests of: Lawacherri, Satchari and Rema Kalenga. These protected areas, on the border with India, are home to some of the rarest primates on the planet, including the western hoolock gibbon (only 300-500 remain in the wild). It is this impressive ape which we aim to find with the expert help of local trackers and research assistants around the tea growing region of Srimangal. <br/><br/>We'll then head south to the Bay of Bengal where we set sail on a live aboard boat and journey into the world's largest mangrove forest, Sunderbans National Park, in search of tigers, crocodiles, deer, langurs, dolphins, porpoises and hundreds of species of bird.<br/><br/>Why choose this Bangladesh wildlife holiday?<br/><br/>You'll be accompanied by a primate expert and local guides with years of experience tracking gibbons and other primates in the Bangladeshi rainforests.<br/>If requested we can bring extra equipment such as camera traps and night vision equipment to further increase our chances of seeing elusive nocturnal animals.<br/>You will be able to track wild tigers on foot. <br/>You can relax in the comfort of your own chartered boat as we cruise down the waterways of the Sunderbans mangrove forest.<br/>We offer spotlighting trips after dark (if local conditions allow) to try and find fishing cats, drinking tigers, slow loris and other rare nocturnal mammals which live in the rainforests around Srimangal. <br/>We have a very high success rating when it comes to spotlighting tigers due to the expert guidance of our local guides.<br/>We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides all over Bangladesh that are able to find and observe animals like golden langurs, Asiatic elephants, water buffalo, Asian short-clawed otters, Great Indian hornbills, sunda slow loris, fishing cats, Russel’s viper, Irrawaddy dolphins, gharials, leopards and hundreds other endangered, rare or endemic species. <br/>Please inform us if you wish to add a Bangladesh extension to the mammal watching itinerary below and we can provide an excellent wildlife watching itinerary and quote for you.<br/>Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for individuals (on request).<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/>As there is some jungle walking involved we require all participants to be fairly fit and prepared to go off the beaten track and into the jungle in search of gibbons. The animals do not follow the pathways, unfortunately, so we will often head deep into the forest to find them. The exact amount of walking is dependent on what guests decide, we can tailor activities to suit your requirements. <br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 years old.",

      "description": "Lawacherra, Satchari & Rema Kalenga National Parks – Primate Watching – The next three days will be spent in the heart of rural and wild Bangladesh. We are in the east of the country and close to the border with the Indian state of Tripura. This region is full of wildlife hidden in its deep rainforests; however due to deforestation, poaching and a growing human population most, if not all, of these animals are in serious danger. We will aim to find some of the most impressive and rarest species over the next three days and try to highlight their plight. Depending on the local conditions, the order we visit the different parks here is changeable; but we will aim to visit Lowacherra National Park where we will have guided walks into the forest to try and find the very rare western hoolock gibbon, which are more regularly seen here than anywhere else (an estimate of 49 individuals living in the park was made in 2006). As well as the gibbons, orange-bellied Himalayan squirrels, Indian muntjac, northern pig-tailed macaques and rhesus macaques are commonly seen. If the local authorities permit us we will come back after dark for a short spotlighting walk to see if there are any fishing cats, sunda slow loris, masked civets or other nocturnal animals around. We also visit Satchari National Park, the format of the visit is similar to Lowacherra National Park but we will focus on finding Phayre’s leaf monkeys and capped langurs here. The capped langur is a beautiful golden monkey and they are a treat to find whilst Phayre’s leaf monkeys are incredibly rare and difficult to find. There are also northern pig-tailed macaques, rhesus macaques, Indian muntjacs, wild boar, fishing cats and many more species of birds (pygmy woodpeckers, red-headed tragoons, red jungle fowl, puff-throated babblers and oriental pied hornbills), reptiles and amphibians. The third primate watching location we visit is Rema Kalenga Wildlife Sanctuary and once again have guided walks around to find the park's rare and endangered primates such as Phayre’s leaf monkey, capped langur, rhesus macaques, western hoolock gibbons and sunda slow loris as well as fishing cats, wild boar, Indian muntjac and crab-eating mongooses. Here there is also an impressive 167 species of birds which we will have a go at finding as well. For the transfers to and from the parks here we will use local vehicles, as the condition of the roads can be bad after rain, it is best to use the local vehicles and drivers from Srimangal who know the roads well and the cars are used to dealing with the bad conditions. We cannot guarantee that the vehicles will have air conditioning but none of these journeys are very long ones. (Breakfast only)"

      "description": "Sunderbans – Wildlife Watching Cruise - Today we embark on our adventure into the heart of the largest mangrove forest in the world and a national park home to the largest population of wild tigers left in the world! Over 200-450 have been estimated to live in the park and we will try and track one down… on foot! But first we have to get there and this means a transfer in our vehicle from Dhaka to Mongla or Khulna (depending on where the boat is moored). If our boat is moored at Khulna we will have the added experience of crossing the Padma River (the life blood of this burgeoning country) at one of its busiest points. Once on the boat we will unpack and start our journey towards the Bay of Bengal. Along the way we will see the hustle and bustle of Bangladesh begin to fade away as the towns turn to villages, which in turn become shacks and then nothing but trees as far as the eye can see. There is a wealth of people who use the water ways here and it’s brilliant to see the local people using fishing and harvesting techniques many hundreds of years old. As well as the people and boats, we will keep an eye out for brahminy kites and grey-headed fish eagles soaring above and, best of all, the highly endangered Gangetic river dolphins which briefly break the surface to blow. We will stop at the Dhangmari forest office to gain permission to enter and meet our armed escorts (which are mandatory for visiting the park). Our evening meal will be onboard and we will spend the night onboard as well. After dark we will try and spotlight a tiger or some of the large saltwater crocodiles which live in the forest as they are more active at night. (Breakfast, Lunch & Dinner included)"

      "description": "Sunderbans – Wildlife Watching Cruise - Today we will continue our journey from Dhangmari to Kachikhali forest station. Here we will spend the night surrounded by mangrove forests, virgin sea beaches and a view out into the Bay of Bengal. Tigers are regularly spotted here and it’s not uncommon to see them prowling the beach at night or early morning as well as herds of spotted deer and family groups of wild boar. We will spend an hour to two in the evening with a spotlight to try and find some tigers. (Breakfast, Lunch & Dinner included)"

      "description": "Sunderbans – Wildlife Watching Cruise - Early morning before sunrise there will be the option to have an hour or so spotlighting to see if there is a tiger having a drink at the river's edge or even swimming across the river; after this we will use small country boats to travel into the smaller creeks and streams of the mangrove forest and look for drinking animals like chital, tigers, wild boar, rhesus macaques as well as the local bird life such as white-throated kingfishers, black-capped kingfishers, green bee-eaters, little herons and the very rare masked fin-foot. We then set off to Katka Game Sanctuary and, on arrival, will leave the boat and have a hike through the jungle where we usually find fresh tiger prints and hope to see one walking through the dense vegetation. Lunch will be served on the boat and, in the afternoon, we will explore some of the area around the local forest station and see if we can find more evidence of tigers here. We usually have a BBQ tonight for our evening meal with locally caught fish as the main treat. As yesterday there will be spotlighting after dark. (Breakfast, Lunch & Dinner included)"

Then, after breakfast, we will begin our cruise back to Mongla or Khulna where we have a good chance of spotting large estuarine crocodiles basking if the sun is out. Along with the crocs we will look for dolphins, monkeys, birds and monitor lizards all the way back to civilisation. Our lunch will be served onboard before we disembark and head back to Dhaka for our last night in Bangladesh. (Breakfast only)"
