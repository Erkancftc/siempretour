  "generalInfo": "This varied, exciting trip combines Nicaragua's beautiful colonial cities, wildlife rich nature reserves, volcanic islands, impressive scenery and culture and traditions with an adventurous twist.<br/><br/>Your trip starts in Nicaragua’s capital, Managua, from where you travel onto Léon, the intellectual heart of the country via the ruins of Léon Viejo, a UNESCO world heritage site. You explore the Juan Venado nature reserve by boat hoping to spot caiman, iguanas and turtles (between May – November). Next travel on to Ometepe – an island of two volcanic peaks rising dramatically from Lake Nicaragua, the largest lake in Central America. Kayak through its wetlands, hike to a waterfall and visit its villages and sacred lake. Visit the Montibello nature reserve for a hike through tropical dry-forest, before continuing on to the splendid colonial town of Granada from where you visit the craft market of Masaya, tour the Las Isletas freshwater archipelago by boat, hike on the slopes of the Mombacho volcano and visit the Masaya volcano by night to see a colony of bats and molten magma glowing deep down inside the volcano crater.<br/>You end with some beach time on the low-key Corn Islands , 70km off Nicaragua’s Caribbean coast, where you can relax, snorkel or dive.<br/><br/>This two week itinerary is ideal for adventurous couples, friends and families. It is a tailormade itinerary and can be modified in any way you wish.<br/><br/>When to visit: <br/><br/>A short dry season: December - to mid-May. The Pacific basin in Western Nicaragua, where the historic towns are situated, has a more pronounced dry season, at its height it can be too hot for some.<br/><br/>Rainy or 'green season': mid-May - mid-November. In the green season the mornings are almost always clear and warm, and in the afternoon you may get a short, strong burst of rain, with clouds usually clearing in time for a magnificent sunset. The rains tend to be heaviest in September and October",

      "description": "Managua City tour, onwards to Leon. In the morning you will be taken on a private guided city tour of Managua, visiting notable sights such as the hilltop memorial to Sandino, the central market, the ultra modern cathedral and the 6,000-year old stone-age footprints of a family moving across ancient mud flats at Acahualinca. In the afternoon you will be taken to visit to Leon Vijeo, Nicaragua’s first capital. It was founded by the Spanish in 1524 on the site of an indigenous village in a rich, fertile valley at the end of Lake Managua, just across the water from looming Momotombo and Momotombito volcanoes. In 1610 the entire city was evacuated to its current location. Six months later the volcano erupted and León Viejo was covered with ash and lava. It took until 1967 to find the ruins of the original city. The site is a UNESCO world heritage site and excavations are underway. Already the foundations of homes, the country’s first mint, a church, a convent, a brothel, and the cathedral where the conquistador Cordoba is buried have been uncovered. There will be time to try the local delicacy, quesillo (a soft tortilla wrap filled with the local mozzarella-like cheese, chopped onion and tomato in a cream sauce) and sample tiste a chocolate-flavoured corn drink served in a gourd, before continuing to León where you stay for 2 nights."

Simply relax at the beach or perhaps explore the island independently e.g. you can fix up locally for a Creole English speaking taxi driver to take you on a tour of the island, or to transfer you up to the north of the island where there are good snorkelling opportunities. or if seas are calm make a short visit to Little Corn Island - catching the morning boat to buzz over for a couple of hours prior to the daily return around lunchtime (avoid in Jan and Feb when its windiest and therefore the sea quite choppy unless you have good sea legs). Those with a PADI licence may wish to add a day's diving."
