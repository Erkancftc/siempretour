  "generalInfo": "Discover Estonia - an under-the-radar gem for nature photographers. On this immersive seven-day tour designed to capture the country’s rich biodiversity and serene landscapes at the height of spring activity. From ancient forests and misty bogs to quiet coastlines and medieval towns, this experience offers a rare blend of wildlife encounters, scenic beauty, and cultural texture.<br/><br/>The journey begins in western Estonia, where you’ll settle into the Haapsalu area and enjoy a relaxed welcome dinner before heading out for a sunset shoot or a chance to spot the elusive Ural owl. <br/><br/>Early the next morning, you’ll photograph lekking birds such as black grouse and capercaillie, followed by a full day exploring Matsalu National Park - one of Europe’s top wetland birding destinations. Expect godwits, cranes, woodpeckers, and more, with a picnic dinner during a boat safari along the Kasari River, where elk and beavers often make an appearance.<br/><br/>Midweek, the focus shifts to raised bogs and intimate hide sessions. You’ll explore Kõveri’s landscapes and rotate through small hides targeting cranes, waders, and ruffs. These hides are designed for two people, allowing for quiet, focused shooting and close-range wildlife photography. The following day is dedicated to the Krootuse bird hide, where you’ll spend uninterrupted hours capturing forest birds in natural light. That evening, you’ll settle into Käbliku Farm - a peaceful countryside retreat with simple comforts and a warm local feel.<br/><br/>One of the tour’s highlights is the overnight stay in the Alutaguse bear hide, located in one of Europe’s most reliable regions for photographing brown bears. Here, you’ll also have the chance to capture raccoon dogs, red squirrels, and possibly wild boar or elk. The hide offers a rare opportunity for close encounters in a controlled, ethical setting.<br/><br/>As the tour winds down, you’ll head north to Lahemaa National Park, known for its waterfalls, coastal forests, and Baltic seascapes. A boat trip offers the chance to photograph seals and seabirds, or, if weather prevents, the focus will shift to dramatic landscapes and forest textures. <br/><br/>The final day is spent in Tallinn, where a guided photography walk through the medieval old town provides architectural contrast and cultural depth to round out your portfolio.<br/><br/>Throughout the tour, meals are arranged to suit the rhythm of photography -early breakfasts, field lunches, and relaxed dinners. Accommodations are clean and comfortable, chosen for their proximity to nature and quiet charm. With small group sizes and professional photographic guidance, this tour is ideal for photographers who appreciate variety, intimacy, and the chance to explore Estonia’s wilderness at its most vibrant.",
