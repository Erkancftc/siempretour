    "generalInfo": "Discover Estonia - an under-the-radar gem for nature photographers. On this immersive seven-day tour designed to capture the country’s rich biodiversity and serene landscapes at the height of spring activity. From ancient forests and misty bogs to quiet coastlines and medieval towns, this experience offers a rare blend of wildlife encounters, scenic beauty, and cultural texture.<br/><br/>The journey begins in western Estonia, where you’ll settle into the Haapsalu area and enjoy a relaxed welcome dinner before heading out for a sunset shoot or a chance to spot the elusive Ural owl. <br/><br/>Early the next morning, you’ll photograph lekking birds such as black grouse and capercaillie, followed by a full day exploring Matsalu National Park - one of Europe’s top wetland birding destinations. Expect godwits, cranes, woodpeckers, and more, with a picnic dinner during a boat safari along the Kasari River, where elk and beavers often make an appearance.<br/><br/>Midweek, the focus shifts to raised bogs and intimate hide sessions. You’ll explore Kõveri’s landscapes and rotate through small hides targeting cranes, waders, and ruffs. These hides are designed for two people, allowing for quiet, focused shooting and close-range wildlife photography. The following day is dedicated to the Krootuse bird hide, where you’ll spend uninterrupted hours capturing forest birds in natural light. That evening, you’ll settle into Käbliku Farm - a peaceful countryside retreat with simple comforts and a warm local feel.<br/><br/>One of the tour’s highlights is the overnight stay in the Alutaguse bear hide, located in one of Europe’s most reliable regions for photographing brown bears. Here, you’ll also have the chance to capture raccoon dogs, red squirrels, and possibly wild boar or elk. The hide offers a rare opportunity for close encounters in a controlled, ethical setting.<br/><br/>As the tour winds down, you’ll head north to Lahemaa National Park, known for its waterfalls, coastal forests, and Baltic seascapes. A boat trip offers the chance to photograph seals and seabirds, or, if weather prevents, the focus will shift to dramatic landscapes and forest textures. <br/><br/>The final day is spent in Tallinn, where a guided photography walk through the medieval old town provides architectural contrast and cultural depth to round out your portfolio.<br/><br/>Throughout the tour, meals are arranged to suit the rhythm of photography -early breakfasts, field lunches, and relaxed dinners. Accommodations are clean and comfortable, chosen for their proximity to nature and quiet charm. With small group sizes and professional photographic guidance, this tour is ideal for photographers who appreciate variety, intimacy, and the chance to explore Estonia’s wilderness at its most vibrant.",

    "generalInfo": "Estonia is one of the most wildlife-rich countries in Europe, with around a fifth of its land given over to protected areas where animals like bears, moose, beavers and cranes flourish. Still, not everyone has a great deal of time on their hands, and so this Estonia wildlife short break focuses on just one, key, destination – Lahemaa National Park, a 50km drive east of the capital, Tallinn. <br/><br/>To save time, your small group will be met at the airport for a private transfer into Tallinn. Enjoy a walking tour of the old town’s beautiful medieval architecture before you head onwards the following morning to Lahemaa. Here you can follow wooden boardwalks through mist-shrouded wetlands, wander boulder-strewn beaches and soak in the spa of the historic manor house where you’ll stay.<br/><br/>The centrepiece of this short small group tour is a night in a specialist bear hide built from logs. With outdoor microphones to pick up the sound of any wildlife approaching, you and your fellow travellers can relax in comfort, enjoying dinner and looking out through the panoramic windows. Quiet is vital, as bears have such sensitive hearing, but the sightings rate here is excellent, up to 80 percent in summer.<br/><br/>Heading back to Tallinn via Lake Peipsi, where the bold can take a refreshing dip, you’ll stop at a local restaurant to share another meal with your group and guide before taking your leave of each other. Hopefully you got lucky with the bears. Even if you didn’t, take solace from the fact that through donating a slice of the profit, your holiday helps protect Estonia’s wildlife and wild spaces so that future visitors can continue to enjoy them.<br/>",

Tucked inside the city’s ancient walls, this historic gem offers the perfect blend of Old World soul and quiet luxury. Take a gentle walking tour through UNESCO-listed Tallinn Old Town with English-speaking private guide, exploring hidden courtyards, Gothic spires, artisan studios, and centuries-old alleyways carved by time and trade.

        "description": "?In the morning it’s time to leave the cobblestones of Tallinn behind and journey into the wild beauty of Lahemaa National Park — one of Europe’s oldest and most captivating nature reserves. Here, ancient forests, vast bog landscapes, and untouched coastlines stretch endlessly into the horizon. At the mystical Viru Bog, wooden boardwalks gently guide you over serene wetlands. The trail is accessible and easy to walk — no strenuous hiking required — yet it offers an unforgettable immersion into Estonia’s primeval landscapes. Step back in time at Palmse Manor, a meticulously restored 17th-century estate that seems frozen in another era. Its golden halls and manicured gardens evoke the elegance of Estonia’s noble past and tell stories of Baltic-German aristocracy. You’ll enjoy a traditional Estonian lunch at Altja Tavern (Shared group dinner at a local restaurant — choose freely from the menu, pay locall), located in a charming old fishing village where locals still cast their nets into the sea. The tavern is surrounded by weathered wooden fishermen’s cottages, offering a glimpse into coastal life as it once was — and in many ways, still is. By late afternoon, you’ll arrive at your countryside sanctuary: Heritage Manor Hotel — a beautifully restored estate embraced by rivers, forests, and timeless serenity. Spa offers a range of experiences, including various saunas, massages, and cooling ponds — all designed to reconnect you with nature and yourself. Dinner is served in the Manor House Restaurant, where heritage meets modern elegance. The menu celebrates local Estonian cuisine, with a blend of hearty countryside fare and refined manor-style dishes. Some recipes have even been resurrected from historical manor cookbooks and carefully reimagined by the executive chef. A key part of Manor’s philosophy is sustainability: many ingredients come from the estate’s own organic Manor Garden, Eco-Farm, and surrounding local producers. Food is not only rich in flavor, but also as fresh and pesticide-free as nature allows. (Choose freely from the menu, pay locally). ?Recognized as the Historic Hotel of Europe 2020, the manor offers an unforgettable stay surrounded by stunning architecture, tranquil gardens, and the peaceful rhythm of the Estonian countryside."

        "description": "Today’s journey takes us along the winding roads of Lahemaa, through dense forests and far from the noise of city life. As we travel deeper into the countryside, we pass charming woodland routes and sites rich in local culture and history. For lunch, we stop at a stylish, seaside restaurant nestled by a pristine sandy beach — highly regarded for its fresh, seasonal cuisine. If the fishermen have been lucky, we may even enjoy local catch straight from the Baltic. (Shared group dinner at a local restaurant — choose freely from the menu, pay locally. ) Should the weather be kind, there’s time for a refreshing swim in the Baltic Sea or a gentle walk along the shore, where waves meet wilderness. After lunch, the road leads us deeper into the forest. The land grows quieter. The trees seem older. The excitement rises. Tucked at the edge of a forest clearing awaits your private Bear Hide — a log cabin, built for quiet observation, comfort, and immersion. ? Inside, you’ll find: Private viewing windows overlooking the forest. Cozy rooms for sleeping and for observing. Toilet, electricity, and soundproof walls for both comfort and quiet. Dinner comes with us and is enjoyed inside the hide — a satisfying meal, accompanied by local herbal tea."

        "description": "We begin the morning with a short drive to a nearby local tavern, where a warm breakfast and strong coffee await — the perfect setting to reflect and share stories from the night in the hide. After breakfast, we continue our journey, with stops along the way to explore a series of scenic forest trails — winding through boglands, mixed woodlands, and along a dramatic stream. This region is also home to one of Estonia’s most elusive creatures — the Siberian flying squirrel. While the chance of actually spotting one is close to zero (they’re nocturnal, tiny, and very shy), we’ll still take a moment to share their story — and why this rare animal holds such a special place in Estonia’s natural heritage. Fun fact: Despite being able to glide up to 50 meters between trees, the flying squirrel is so light (around 150 grams) that it barely makes a sound — making it more like a whisper in the forest than a visible animal. As one local conservationist puts it: “The flying squirrel is like Estonia itself — small, quiet, and often overlooked, but full of surprises once you get close.” ? By lunchtime, we reach the shores of Lake Peipsi — one of Europe’s largest inland lakes, stretching farther than the eye can see. We'll enjoy a peaceful lunch at a lakeside restaurant (Shared group dinner at a local restaurant — choose freely from the menu, pay locally) with breathtaking views. If the weather is kind, there’s time for a swim in the calm, sandy waters — a refreshing pause between forest and city. Peipsi is more than just a lake; it’s a cultural borderland, where Estonian and Russian traditions blend — a landscape of deep-rooted heritage. By evening, we arrive back in the capital and settle once again into the elegant acommodation— the same charming boutique residence where our journey began."

Your private transfer awaits to bring you to the airport at your preferred time. Though the tour ends today, Estonia leaves a mark: the stillness of the bogs, the rustling forest where the bear appeared, the golden light over manor rooftops, and the feeling that time — at least for a little while — slowed just for you."
