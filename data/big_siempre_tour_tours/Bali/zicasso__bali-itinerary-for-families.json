Two men play a large lion figure known as Rangda who embodies demons with long fingernails and a drooping chest. The hero, Barong, is depicted by men wrapped in banana leaves wearing masks. In the different regions of Bali, Barong can take the shape of a wild pig, tiger, snake, dragon, or lion depending on which animal is more sacred to local lore.

      "title": "Sanur – Visit Famous Rice Terraces, the Besakih Temple, and a Volcano",
      "description": "In the morning, the family travels with your private guide to the iconic image of Balinese postcards, the Bukit Jambul Rice Terrace. As one of the most popular destinations in Bali, the terraces embody cultural history in the way locals have utilized the landscape and the weather to grow thriving crops. A refreshing breeze rushes through the open terraces and rustles the surrounding coconut trees accentuating the peaceful ambiance. From the top of the terraces, you have a remarkable view of the rice fields, valleys, and panorama sweeping out to the sea. The Besakih Temple is one of the most popular destinations for visitors to Bali and is often referred to as the island’s Mother Temple. It is over 1,000 years old, built on foundations dating back more than two millennia, and sits atop the western slopes of Mount Agung. The extensive complex contains 23 related but separate temples connected thematically to the main stupa of Pura Penataran Agung. The interior temples are dedicated to the Hindu trinity known as Shiva, Brahma, and Vishnu. You reach the top of the central mountains staring down into the caldera of Kintamani Volcano, which encompasses five square miles. The aroma of moon orchids emanates from the surrounding forest.

      "title": "Sanur – Enjoy a Dolphin Watching, Visit Buddha Temple and Hot Springs",
      "description": "Before dawn, you travel to the quiet shores of Lovina Beach to board a traditional outrigger boat. The excitement outweighs the tired as the engine revs and the boat carries you over the quiet wake out to sea. The sunlight washes over the eastern horizon bringing layers of stunning orange, red, and pink across the sky. The boat’s engine stops. The captain points into the water where a pod of bottlenose dolphins arches out of the water. The dolphin can grow over 13 feet long and leap up to 20 feet in the air. Their elegance and gracefulness in the water match their playfulness in the open sea. The kids marvel at viewing the wild dolphin pod up close. You return back to land making your way to Buddha Temple. The brilliant orange roof-tiles dangle over the entrance contrasting the surrounding lush greenery. The children are eager to gaze upon the two Naga guarding the gate. The images depict the semi-divine mythological figures known as part human and part cobra. The walls host the scripture of Buddhist wisdom leading to the lower temple’s centerpiece of a stunning gold Buddha figure. The temple is the largest Buddhist complex in Bali drawing pilgrims from around the island and neighboring islets on the archipelago."

      "title": "Sanur – Relish a Half-Day Surf Lesson with the Remaining Day at Leisure",
      "description": "Bali is one of the world’s premier surf destinations. At breakfast, you peel the fuzzy rind off a rambutan and bite into the semi-sweet interior before setting out on a private family surf lesson at Kuta Beach. The instructor is a local well-versed in the ways the waves roll against the shoreline. The water is warm and the cool morning breeze carries the scent of salts to the promenade cafes. The shoreline stretches for more than two miles with soft, cream-colored sand. Your guide has the family lay on your individual boards placed on the sand before ever touching the water. You learn to pop up from the prone position, lying on your stomach and bouncing to your feet. Once you feel comfortable with the transition, you enter the water to catch your first wave. The board feels less stable in the water as you realize the balance required for surfing. The tropical sun warms your neck as you paddle your arms, accept the force of the wave before it breaks, and push yourself to the standing position."

Today, the family has a full adventure to the stunning island of Nusa Lembongan celebrated for its slower pace of life than mainland Bali. The water shimmers an iridescent aquamarine around the three-square miles of coastline. Your snorkeling guide offers the family insight into the best practices for breathing along with the surface of the water without disturbing the fascinating schools of bright fish below. The warm sea surrounds you as you search for turtles amid the sprawling coral gardens or spot moray eels peeking their heads out of porous rocks. The kids point to an emperor angelfish noticeable for its fantastical, colorful patterns across its surface. They can grow to nearly 16 inches long and glow with stunning electric blue hues amid white wrings. They eat small invertebrates and plants like sponges and algae. Life beneath the water reveals a stunning world previously unknown to the family but now captivates you and the children alike."

They point to a statue of children showing their teeth revealing vampiric fangs. After exiting the forest, you reach the vibrant colors of Ubud Art Market. The traditional art village embodies the diversity of handmade crafts ranging from bags to paintings, textiles to statues. The woodcarvings are impressive and depict the culture of Bali through representations of Hindu deities, epics, Buddhist lore, or local life.

      "description": "The scent of coffee drifts through the doors of the popular coffeehouse Simply Brew celebrated for a semi-open venue offering fresh air and a scenic view, as well as the rich Vietnam Drip espresso. After a relaxing morning along the Sanur shoreline, the family visits the Garuda Wisnu Kencana Culture Park perched on a limestone cliff. The site offers views of Kuta to the west, Sanur in the east, and Mount Agung in the north. The fascinating park hosts a series of statues embodying the culture of the island. The nearby Uluwatu Temple is one of the most popular places in Bali to watch the sunset due to its position overlooking the Indian Ocean on a plateau 250 feet above the lapping waves. The temple was erected 1,000 years ago. Statues of Ganesh flank the entrance arch. Carvings depicting mythological creatures and an episode of Hindu epics adorn the coral brick walls. As the sun fades, the bright light of the Balinese Kecak and Fire Dance begins. Performers tell part of the Ramayana epic when then demon king Ravana abducts the goddess, Sita. The goddess retains her purity and proves herself but undergoing a trial by fire. Music fills the air overpowering the rhythmic waves crashing below the cliff. The chorus hums, sways, and claps for emphasis drawing the entire family into the powerful epic."
