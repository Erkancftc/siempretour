      "title": "Ubud – Arrive in Bali and Indulge in the Romantic Atmosphere of Ubud",
      "description": "The beauty of Bali emanates from the white sand beaches, and sapphire waters as lush jungle terrain blankets the steep mountain slopes, and colorful flowers blossom against a backdrop of stoic villages. The thatched spires of sacred temples reflect in quiet lakes and soar above hidden walkways. Your private transfer will meet you upon arrival at Ngurah Rai International Airport and escort you both to your luxurious resort that overlooks the lush rice fields that border Ubud. The secluded ambiance provides a private view of palm trees and ferns that frame the emerald fields. The tranquil landscape will provide the perfect introduction to Ubud and the island of Bali. The remainder of the day is yours to enjoy the cultural heart of the island. The scent of coconut lingers in the streets, blending with the aroma of fresh coffee brewed in the local cafes. The art market harnesses the flourishing crafts of local artists that bring paintings, sculptures, and textiles that capture the splendors of the island’s natural beauty. The two of you will make your way to the Seti Darma House of Masks and Puppets, which displays more than 5,000 artifacts from around the world with a special focus on the Indonesian archipelago. The museum encompasses more than three and a half acres with different pavilions and traditional houses that display various categories of art. The manicured gardens shine with blossoming orchids and hyacinths, and you will stroll through the lavish landscape together and enter into a unique world adorned with portraits of the culture through images of dragons and Garuda, demons and traditional Balinese warriors."

      "title": "Ubud – Discover the Tegalalang Rice Paddies and Cultural Tour of Ubud",
      "description": "In the morning, the sunlight will spread across the jade forest canopy and over the emerald hues of the rice fields. Farmers venture to the fields, walking barefoot through the wet soil to tend to their crops with bamboo posts resting on their shoulders as they balance woven baskets at each end of the pole. At breakfast, you will find exuberant fruits shimmering with intoxicating colors. Rambutans have rosy outer layers and mangos glow with yellow and orange rinds. Your guide will meet you in your hotel lobby after breakfast to escort you into the countryside to view the iconic rice terraces at Tegalalang as structured tiers overtake the slopes, winding their way down to the valley floor. Coconut palms tower above the terraces to offer sporadic shade to the textured landscape. Villagers tend to the terraces, holding baskets filled with rice. The tropical climate provides a pristine radiance emanating from the terraces and valley floor, accentuated by the golden hues of the thatched-roof houses. Farmers use a traditional irrigation technique known as subak , which is a cooperative system first utilized in the 8th century. It is easy to see how the tiered slopes have captured the imaginations of artists, both local and international. In the evening, you will enjoy a cultural performance at the Puri Saren Royal Palace at the heart of Ubud, for a stunning view of the movements and music that help tell of legends and the island’s history."

      "description": "The morning light will stretch across the blossoming marigold fields in the highlands near Kintamani. The herbaceous aroma drifts upwards into the air, reminiscent of burning incense reaching across the golden petals. On the beaches of Kuta, a French patisserie will open its doors to the scent of freshly roasted coffee blending with the aroma of macaroons and buttery croissants garnished with guava jam. At breakfast, the fragrance of fresh banana pancakes will fill the dining room as you both indulge in the view of the rice fields and the pleasure of the company you keep. After your meal, the day is yours to explore the splendors of Ubud and the surrounding region of Bali at your leisure, taking to the secluded northern shores of Lake Batur or taking a private acro yoga class for couples. For a unique insight into Balinese culture, along with the chance to craft a special gift for your partner, you can also make your way to a jewelry showroom in the nearby village of Celuk. As you arrive at the jeweler, you will find that the family traditionally worked as silversmiths to the royal family and nearby villages to craft both ceremonial and household goods. The showroom displays elements of Balinese heritage, with silver orbs and delicate talismans. Your guide will lead you behind the showroom to the workshop to learn the basics in soldering tiny silver granules onto a metal base as you hone your concentration and patience. The rare technique provides an opportunity to craft a cultural piece that will always remind you both of your Balinese romance."

      "title": "Amed – Relish a Drive to Traditional Villages, Lake Batur, and Hot Springs",
      "description": "It is the purple rind of mangosteen that colors your tables at breakfast as the sweet and seductive aroma drifts into the refreshing morning breeze. After a leisurely breakfast, your private transfer will meet you in your hotel lobby to escort you to the eastern tip of Bali at Amed. Along the scenic ride, you will pass villages decorated with oleanders and frangipanis as orchids blossom along the branches of the surrounding forest. The tropical temperatures of the central highlands recede beneath the cooler air of the mountain slopes as the summit of Kintamani stands at an altitude of more than 5,575 feet above sea level. You will have a fabulous view of the nearby volcanic peaks of Mount Agung, Mount Batur, and the composite volcano edging Mount Batur’s zenith. The reflective turquoise shores of Lake Batur shine in the caldera below, and you can stand on the lake’s jagged edges for a view of the rippling waters set against the steep slopes of the caldera. A small, sloped-roof home rises out of the clear turquoise water and away from the emerald tufts of grass. Before arriving in the town of Amed, you will stop to visit the hot springs at Toya Devasya where the tranquil crystal-clear waters offer a pristine view of the lake and the edging caldera as you both soak in the refreshing heat that surrounds your body."

      "title": "Amed – Relax on Amed Beaches for a Leisurely Day on the Coast",
      "description": "In the morning, fishers in traditional canoes venture between the scalloped islands and reefs that edge the eastern seaboard. The fishers cast their nets over the crystal clear indigo water in search of a fresh haul to market. The sunlight reaches the lush hills and semiarid coastline first, returning with the scent of coconut and the sweet, briny aroma of the sea. The day is yours to enjoy the pleasures of Amed and the secluded ambiance of the shoreline at your leisure, taking to the water on sea kayaks or lounging by the pool at your luxury hotel. After breakfast, you could make your way to Jemeluk Bay where the black sand on the beach absorbs the tropical sunlight, warming the bottoms of your feet. Cool down as you dip your toes into the refreshing waters that splash against the shore as you look across the beautiful Indian Ocean. Sporadic paddleboarders take to the wakes to propel themselves across the water, and the two of you may opt to don your snorkels and fins to view the coral. The current will move you gently over the reef as hard coral reaches out like trees and tabletops from the seafloor. Sea fans wave at you like rustling leaves in the breeze as ribboned sweetlips shine with iridescent stripes and grow up to nearly two feet long."

      "description": "In the morning, you will relish the fresh aromas of boni , the small round berries with a reddish and black tint to their skin with a sweet and sour flavor that provide a candy-like enticement. After breakfast, the two of you will explore the eastern shores en route to the charming town of Candidasa, with a stop first at the Tirta Gangga to visit the Water Palace. The complex was erected in the 1940s and emanates a regal air as gardens encircle mazes of pools and fountain embellishments. The sound of trickling water echoes across the gently swelling waters that encompass nearly two and a half acres. You will step into a romantic garden in which you can hold hands for a passionate, scenic stroll. Ornate statues decorate the walkways that depict traditional Balinese characters. Fish swim in the larger pools beneath the rustling palm fronds and fern leaves as golden carp nibble at the surface water in search of food. Enjoy the spectacular view of the 32-foot tall fountain in the central tower that features 11 tiers with a lotus-shaped tip. Continue to Lempuyang Luhur Temple, one of nine structures connected to the island’s spiritual balance that stands atop a plateau at more than 3,850 feet above sea level, with a stairway of more than 1,700 steps. Long-tailed macaques linger by the stairs, and lounge in the cooling trees as the staggering spires of the temple resembles the ridges and peaks of the surrounding mountains decorated by the dragon-adorned staircases."

      "title": "Seminyak – Delight in Besakih and Uluwatu Temples en route to Seminyak",
      "description": "In the morning, you can hear the ocean brush against the soft sand of the Candidasa beaches. The fishers will take to their boats, leaving trails that lead from the shoreline and disappear at the water’s edge. After breakfast, your private transfer will meet you both in the lobby and escort you to Besakih Temple, also referred to as Mother Temple. The complex stands at the base of Mount Agung, Bali’s largest volcano, and the peak soars above the temple grounds at the height of nearly 9,950 feet above sea level. The grounds have prehistoric origins that date back more than 2,000 years. Your guide will point to the megalithic stepped pyramids erected before the first Javanese conquerors arrived in the 13th century. By the 15th century, Besakih was the state temple of the reigning Gelgel dynasty, proudly represented through 23 temples, stepped terraces, and elegant stairways. Brick gateways lead to the main spire on the Meru structure, named for its embodiment of Mount Meru. A mystic ambiance drifts across the stone walkways that overtake the symbolic center of the sanctuary that encircles the lotus throne. You will make your way south to the temple of Uluwatu, located on a cliff nearly 230 feet above the crashing waves. As the sun sets over the west, the golden glow of the sky turns the Balinese spiritual pillar into an unforgettable silhouette in which the two of you will share."

      "description": "In the morning, the two of you will lounge in the comforts of your suite and listen to the water splash at the coastline as the morning breeze rustles the dangling palm fronds. At breakfast, the citrus aroma of pomelos blends with the fragrant sea, and the remainder of the day is yours to indulge in the pleasures of the beach ambiance or enjoy a day exploring the southern peninsula at your leisure. Linger in the relaxing ambiance of a couple’s massage or enter into the realm of Bali’s contemporary art scene at Biasa ArtSpace. Couples traipse down Seminyak Beach on horseback as others make their way to the secluded sands of Nusa Lembongan. A ferry will take you both across the calm waters on a scenic ride to the nearby island shores. Locals gather seaweed from the water and cut up coconuts along the sand and then build fires along the edges of the forest to cook their freshly caught fish. The white sand has a soft powdery texture beneath your feet as rows of traditional fishing canoes wade in the water off of the coastline and thatched-roof huts hide beneath the palm trees. Discover the gorgeous crystal clear turquoise waters that juxtapose with the craggy mountain peaks as white sands curve along the coastline and lead to rock shelters and precipitous cliffs. After enjoying it all, you will catch the return ferry to Seminyak to enjoy a romantic sunset dinner by the sea."

Fishers take to the water beside eager surfers as the sunlight spreads across the impressive 470-foot tall statue of the Hindu god Vishnu and His Garuda in the Garuda Wisnu Kencana sculpture park. The cafes open to the seaside panoramas as hyacinths and frangipanis blossom against the villages on the outskirts of Seminyak.
