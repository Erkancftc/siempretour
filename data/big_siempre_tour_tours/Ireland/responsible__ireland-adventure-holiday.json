  "generalInfo": "Your Irish Island Adventure Tour Begins Here! Feel like whizzing around Killarney National Park by bike or tackling the 618 steps on the Skellig Michael Experience? We will make it happen. Hike the Cliffs of Moher, or just pose for a few jealousy-inducing photos at the Rock of Cashel. Our 7-day Ireland to Island tour has it all for the keen adventurer coming to discover Ireland. <br/><br/>So long Dublin! We are off to kiss the Blarney Stone on our first staff and receive the ‘gift of the gab’ (the ability to talk the legs off a stool!) before heading to Cobh, the last port of call for the Titanic. We’ll take a hike across the spectacular Cliffs of Moher on the Wild Atlantic Way. Experience your first island hop as you go in search of puffins, grey seals and Jedis at Skellig Michael, an other-wordly, jagged pinnacle crag, off the Inveragh Peninsula. May the force be with you as you step onto the film set of the most recent Star Wars movies. Killarney National Park is calling with stunning mountain and lake views on your bike ride around its many trails. Cross Galway Bay to see your second and most famous island – Inishmore – The largest of the Aran Islands. Explore the island by bike and make your way to the cliff-top fort at Dún Aonghusa. From castles, culture, stately homes and fairy forts, it’s time to soak up the lively atmosphere of Bohemian Galway – a medieval city renowned for culture and the arts. <br/><br/>This is the REAL Ireland – an experience you won’t find in the guide books or movies. Meet the locals, eat our local delicacies and experience many wonders as you embark on a tour that packs in everything from biking and hiking to island hopping and city shopping.",

      "description": "Our Irish adventure begins as you leave Dublin and heads south to Cobh, in County Cork – one of the world’s finest natural harbours and where the last 123 passengers boarded the doomed Titanic on her maiden voyage. As we journey through County Cork with its wild beaches and jagged peninsulas, we’ll take in the 1000, year old Medieval Rock of Cashel. Your expert local guide will bring you on a tour of the well-preserved round tower, Cormac’s chapel, and the breath-taking cathedral and castle! Take the first of many jealousy inducing photos of this historical masterpiece! After building up a thirst, we’ll make our way to the world-famous Midleton Distillery, dating from the 17th century and home to some of the best whiskies in the world. There is so much to taste and learn at this oldest distillery whiskey museum and visitor centre, and we’ll enjoy lunch and a tour with a few cheeky samples! The night will be spent in Cobh, soaking up the beautiful harbour views, colourful houses and bustling nightlife."

      "description": "Start your day with the Cobh Titanic Experience. This tour will take you on an emotional journey of the last passengers who boarded the Titanic. Find out their fate when you complete the tour! Before embarking on our tour of Kerry, you can tick off a very important item on your Ireland bucket list – kissing the Blarney Stone! Here, you’ll receive the “gift of the gab” and will soon be talking like the loquacious locals. We’ll then explore Blarney with its beautiful grounds, gardens and castle and rock- up close. After lunch, we’ll enter the panoramic Kingdom of Kerry, where your guide will give you some time off to wander the streets, shops and delights of picturesque Kenmare. This is your gateway to the Ring of Kerry experience – Ireland’s most scenic and celebrated drive. Tonight, we travel towards the little fishing village of Portmagee with its twinkling harbour lights to get ready for our first island trip to Skellig Michael. For those who prefer ‘terra firma’, we’ve another excellent option up our sleeves."

      "description": "It’s time to get excited. There are only a very select few places on this planet that can be described as “out of this world” and Skellig Michael is unquestionably one of these. Today we will embark on this hypnotic journey to the islands, and you’ll feel like you have journeyed to a “galaxy far, far away”. A designated World Heritage Site, this rocky crag boasts one of the oldest preserved monasteries in Europe. The 618 steps take you up 700ft to its peak and the rewards are plentiful. In addition to its stone beehive huts used by the monks for prayer and quiet contemplation, you’ll see a wild array of gannets, razorbills, grey seals and all types of wildlife and fauna, in its untouched natural habitat. A sublime sanctuary, it’s a place of peace and power where the presence of the monks, (and a certain Jedi knight) can still be felt. After you disembark from your epic journey to the past, your afternoon is yours to enjoy in Killarney – The capital of Kerry."

      "description": "Our day begins in the spectacular Killarney National Park, as we take on one of its numerous trails by bike, red deer spotting as we go. Discover the 18th century Muckross House and gardens, Torc Waterfall and many other beauty spots along the way. There is always an option to take a jaunting cart round the park, if you feel like chillaxing today! From Killarney, we will make a short drive to Inch Beach to stretch our legs and refresh for an afternoon on the stunning Dingle Peninsula. Tonight, we stay in the celebrated, cozy coastal town of Dingle where the evening is yours to absorb the atmosphere of Dingle’s famous quirky pubs, fantastic restaurants and impromptu traditional music sessions. This just might be the location for that perfect pint of Guinness or two!"

      "description": "Today, before we leave the Kingdom of Kerry, we will watch man’s best friend show off his finely-honed skills, during a sheepdog demonstration. Next, we take the short ferry ride to County Clare, home of the spectacular Cliffs of Moher and experience the Burren National Park. From Caherdaniel to the Cliffs, we are spoiled for natural beauty. The cliffs, in their wonder, need to be seen to be appreciated and a guided hike with the roaring Wild Atlantic providing the soundtrack is the best way to do this. Your guide will take you off the beaten track and point out secret passages that you won’t find on the typical tourist route. Friends back at home will be very envious when you show them your snaps at this stunning landmark. Tonight, get your dancing shoes on and tap out a few steps in the hometown of traditional music. You are in for a treat in the lively bars nestled throughout the most welcoming little village in Ireland."

      "description": "It’s only a short trip from Ireland to the Island on the Doolin ferry to Inishmore – the largest of the Aran Islands. The magnificent Aran Islands are romantically remote and have inspired many a poet and playwright! Sharpen your pencil before hopping aboard! We’ll traverse the island by bike, taking in the many ancient sites as they unfold. Landmarks include the medieval Christian ruins of the Seven Churches and Clochán na Carraige, and we’ll bike to the famous ring fort of Dún Aonghasa, which lies 100 m over Galway Bay. Learn a few words of Gaelic from the locals and treat yourself to a feast of seafood before making our way back to Rossaveal Pier in County Galway. From here we will take a short drive to the picturesque market town of Clifden which is nestled between the Twelve Bens mountain range and the Atlantic Ocean."
