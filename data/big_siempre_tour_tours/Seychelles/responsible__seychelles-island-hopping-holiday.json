Spend two blissful weeks exploring the islands of Praslin, La Digue, and Mahe, with a car and personal driver at your disposal, meeting up with local guides who will show you new sides to this beautiful East African archipelago.<br/><br/>The Seychelles are rightly famed for their stunning beaches, but there is much more to a holiday here than simply feeling the sand between your toes. You can spend a day cycling leisurely around La Digue, admiring not only the famous granite boulders on the west coast, but also its old Creole architecture, the coconut factory, and sleepy fishing villages. <br/><br/>Spend a morning on Mahe wandering the markets of Victoria, the capital. You might pick up some fresh fruit for a picnic lunch, ready for your afternoon drive along the coast.<br/><br/>At the heart of this holiday is the opportunity to explore Seychelles culture. You’re not just spending two weeks in a resort, but really getting to know the islands, the people, and their ways of life. One of the best ways to do that is to eat in local restaurants, and of course your guides will have plenty of useful recommendations!<br/>",

The island of Mahe's jungle clad mountains rise from the Indian Ocean. With over 60 beautiful beaches and coves fringing the island, ranging from sweeping bays of white sand to hidden corners you can make your own, a densely forested interior and small towns with a unique Creole culture, there is much to explore. The joy of Mahe is the variety the island offers: yes, more beach hopping than you could possibly squeeze into a two week holiday, but also waterfalls, jungle, mountain walks and stunning viewpoints, with a whole host of activities from rock climbing to sea kayaking and scuba diving. The beaches are wonderful and many are on a par with those found on Praslin and La Digue, but if you like to mix your beach break with exploration and adventure Mahe is a delight to drive around and find your own corner.
