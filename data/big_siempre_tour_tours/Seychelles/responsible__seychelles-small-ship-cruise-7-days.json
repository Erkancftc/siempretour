  "generalInfo": "Join us on a small-ship sailing eco-cruise across the Seychelles, weaving your way through islands such as Praslin, La Digue, Curieuse, Cousin and St Anne, with just 44 fellow travellers aboard. This island-hopping adventure offers you the chance to experience the Seychelles in a truly authentic way — its wildlife, marine life, culture and remote protected landscapes — without the hurry and noise of mass tourism.<br/><br/>The rhythm of the holiday is leisurely yet full of discovery. Cruising by sea means we can access hidden coves, untouched beaches and wildlife sanctuaries that larger ships skip over. Many days allow you to swim or snorkel in crystal-clear turquoise water, stroll through lush forest trails, or share a relaxed BBQ on a deserted sandbank. It’s slow travel in its most compelling form, giving you time to absorb the palette of blue seas and green islands, and feel the calm of the Indian Ocean all around.<br/><br/>The core of the experience is rooted in conservation and sustainable travel. Numerous islands on our route are managed by local environmental organisations, so your visit helps support vital habitat restoration and species-protection work. On Cousin Island Nature Reserve you may encounter rare birds such as the Seychelles sunbird or Seychelles blue pigeon, and learn how nest-sites for seabirds and turtles are being preserved. On Curieuse Island you’ll come across giant tortoises meandering under the mangroves, and trace the history of its former leper colony — all woven into the island’s nature-conservation story.<br/><br/>Our island-hopping itinerary also offers iconic must-sees. On Praslin you’ll find Vallée de Mai — a UNESCO-listed palm forest where the legendary coco de mer grows — while La Digue is perfect for slowing down: bicycles instead of cars, snow-white beaches and the extraordinary granite scenery of Anse Source d’Argent, often described as one of the world’s most photogenic shores.<br/><br/>Wildlife encounters are frequent and unforgettable. Hawksbill turtles may come ashore to nest in broad daylight. Dolphins often surface alongside our boat as we sail. And under the waves, coral reefs teem with fish in vivid colours — making this a genuine highlight for snorkellers, swimmers and nature-lovers alike.<br/><br/>On board you’ll find comfort in a relaxed, friendly environment: fresh local ingredients used in meals, plenty of deck space for sunbathing or watching the stars, and a small group size that makes the holiday feel personal without ever being crowded. The crew know the islands intimately and are committed to making the journey feel like one of discovery, not just a stop-and-go.<br/><br/>This small-ship eco-cruise is perfect for travellers seeking a meaningful way to explore the Seychelles — combining responsible tourism, island-hopping, wildlife, marine life and the joy of travelling by sea. It’s more than a holiday: it’s a chance to form a deeper connection with these remarkable islands and carry home memories that last long after the journey ends.",
