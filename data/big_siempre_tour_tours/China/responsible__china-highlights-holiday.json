Beijing’s past spans three millennia and the scale of Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City never fail to amaze. Leaving the grandeur behind, explore the narrow hutongs of the old town. Head out of the city and step foot on one of the best-preserved sections of the Great Wall; here, we begin to comprehend the magnitude of this construction as it snakes across the mountains to the horizon and beyond. In Xi’an, we explore the vibrant Muslim Quarter and see the Terracotta Warriors of Emperor Qin. A trip to China would not be complete without visiting Chengdu to see giant pandas. End in cosmopolitan Shanghai, with its unmistakable skyline illuminated at night.<br/><br/><br/><br/>",

      "description": "Our adventure begins in Beijing, the capital of China and home to world-renowned landmarks such as the Forbidden City. Free arrival transfers are available for everyone arriving into either Beijing Capital Airport (PEK) or Daxing Airport (PKX). Around 6pm, say ni hao to your tour leader and fellow travellers, when we gather as a group for the first time to get to know each other and learn more about the adventures ahead. Your tour leader then ensures a big welcome by arranging a group dinner at a local restaurant. Want more time in Beijing? Secure pre-tour hotel nights through your sales representative.

      "description": "We head straight to Tiananmen Square (approximately 30 minutes by public bus/metro), one of the largest squares in the world, able to hold more than a million people. The square is named after the Tiananmen (meaning Gate of Heavenly Peace) at its north, which leads to the Forbidden City. Continuing on foot, we spend a few hours exploring the innumerable courtyards and temples of the Forbidden City. Exiting via the north gate of the complex, we walk directly to Jingshan Park and climb to the top of the hill for a different vantage point. After lunch, we have a walking tour around traditional hutongs (narrow alleys of the old town), before meandering back to the hotel. Note: Following the Covid-19 pandemic, maximum numbers of daily visitors to the Forbidden City have been significantly reduced, impacting availability of tickets. Our local team aim to secure tickets for the Forbidden City, but if unable to do so, we visit the Ancestral Temple (used during the Ming and Qing Dynasties to offer sacrifices to ancestors, and architecturally quite similar to the Forbidden City) and the Temple of Heaven instead. You will be advised at the start of the trip if this change needs to be made. Accommodation: Dong Fang Hotel (or similar)"

      "description": "We leave the capital and head into the countryside (approximately two hours’ drive) to visit one of the best-preserved sections of the Great Wall, at Mutianyu. It is an impressive sight, snaking across mountains and valleys into the distance. We take the shuttle bus to the ticket office; from there, it’s about a 40-minute uphill walk to the top of the Great Wall (anyone not wanting to walk can pay to take the cable car, which takes about eight minutes). We spend the next couple of hours or so walking along the top of the wall. There are some steep steps to navigate and anyone who suffers from vertigo may find it difficult. This section of the Great Wall used to serve as the northern barrier, defending the capital and the imperial tombs. The wall here stands up to 28ft (8.5m) high and 16ft (5m) wide, and there are 22 watchtowers along its 7,380ft (2,250m) stretch. Accommodation: Dong Fang Hotel (or similar)"

      "description": "We take a bullet train to Xi’an this morning, which takes about 4hr 30min. Considered by many to be the final stop on the ancient Silk Road, Xi’an is one of the few cities in China to have retained its city walls, probably because they are so massive that no revolutionary was willing to tackle the huge task of removing them. This afternoon, we embark on a walking tour, passing the Bell and Drum Plaza and exploring the spice markets of the vibrant Muslim Quarter. Optionally, we may be able to visit Gao’s family mansion and enjoy a shadow puppetry show (approximately 30 yuan/US$4.15 per person). We return to the hotel to check in at about 2pm, and the rest of afternoon is free. Accommodation: Bell Tower Hotel (or similar)"

      "description": "Today we visit the Terracotta Warriors of Emperor Qin (the transfer is approximately two hours each way). Originally four armies were planned, at each point of the compass, life-size and lifelike. Three have been found and it is assumed the emperor’s successors decided enough was enough before the fourth was begun. The first pit excavated had an estimated 6,000 figures in its one army. The third pit has been opened to the public, which contains the ‘command post’ for the entire operation. This is one of the great tourist attractions in China and some people may find the sheer numbers of visitors overpowering. After our visit, we have lunch at a nearby farmer’s restaurant before driving back to Xi’an. Accommodation: Bell Tower Hotel (or similar)"

      "description": "Take a short transfer to the train station and board a late morning bullet train to Chengdu (approximately four hours), the capital of Sichuan province, arriving in the early afternoon. This region is recognised throughout China as being ‘the spicy province’ and major flavour combinations include garlic, star anise, chili peppers, and the ever-present Sichuanese peppercorn (hua jiao). We recommend having a hotpot dinner during your stay here (spicy or mild broths are available). In the late afternoon, we set off for a walking tour, passing through the city centre square (Tianfu Square) and visiting the People’s Park where, weather permitting, we can see and have a go at Chinese water calligraphy. Accommodation: Chengdu Tianfu Sunshine Hotel (or similar)"

      "description": "We leave early today to spend the morning at the Giant Panda Breeding & Research Base, which is 6mi (10km) outside the city. These furry animals once roamed large expanses of Asia, but the last survey estimated the world’s population of wild giant pandas at only 1,864. Giant pandas eat for up to 14 hours a day and so hopefully we will witness these highly endangered animals feeding, as this is when they’re most active. Otherwise, we can watch the pandas indulge in their next favourite past time – sleeping! Afterwards, we drive back to Chengdu and the afternoon is free to explore at your own pace. Accommodation: Chengdu Tianfu Sunshine Hotel (or similar)"

      "description": "We catch an early flight to Shanghai, so we take a simple box breakfast with us from the hotel. The flight is approximately 2hr 30min; we should land by late morning and arrive at our hotel by lunchtime. With a population of around 12m, Shanghai is a cosmopolitan coastal hub with a futuristic skyline. This afternoon, we take the public bus (metro) to visit the Yu Yuan Garden. Dating to the Ming Dynasty, the intricate, colourful garden covers about 2ha (five acres), and is divided into sections. There are numerous water features and small paths connecting the different corners of the garden. Accommodation: Golden Tulip Bund New Asia Hotel (or similar)"
