  "generalInfo": "A unique opportunity to travel in comfort and style flight free from Shanghai to Bangkok, taking is some of China’s and Laos’ major sights along the way.<br/><br/>Fully escorted by our tour leader, enjoy a thoroughly well-planned journey which includes all trains and hotels, together with sightseeing excursions provided by experienced locally based guides.<br/><br/>Our adventure makes the most of China’s truly impressive network of high-speed trains, with many services reaching a top speed of 300 km/h (186 mph) and slashing previous journey times. Our journey starts in Shanghai where we will stay at the iconic Peace Hotel, located on the city’s famous Bund. Then we head inland to Xian to join a local guide to see the Terracotta Warriors – the most famous site in the city – only discovered in 1976 by farmers digging a well.<br/><br/>From Xian another high-speed train will whiz us south to the city of Chengdu where we join the locals to have tea in the People's Park, with its refreshing bonsai gardens, artificial lakes, and rockeries. The next day promises to be one of the highlights of our tour as we watch rolly polly baby pandas playing, munching bamboo, and generally doing their thing at the Panda Breeding Centre. We continue from Chengdu by high-speed train to Kunming, capital of China’s southern Yunnan Province, where we will visit the Stone Forest which consists of thousands of narrow, fantastically shaped pillars of rock <br/><br/>We leave China via the China-Laos Railway which opened in 2023. Our first of two stops in Laos will be the enchanting city of Luang Prabang, the quintessential image of Laos. At its core, lush greenery, golden temples, and vivid-robed monks come together to create a colourful, rich heritage and an enduring French-colonial legacy. Back on the train, our last stop is the Laos’ capital. Nestled in a languid bend in the Mekong, Vientiane is a delightfully quaint city, more friendly backwater than chaotic capital. After time to explore the city by tuk tuk, we will continue with our final train of the trip, the overnight sleeper service from the Thai/Laos border down to Bangkok, where our adventure ends. Alternatively, there is the option to extend your stay in one of Southeast Asia’s most captivating destinations. With its promise of astonishing diversity, stunning scenery and beautiful beaches on idyllic tropical islands, there is much to discover beyond Bangkok.",

      "description": "Xian - Secrets of the Terracotta Warriors - Today we will visit Xian’s must-see sight, the Terracotta Warriors on a full day tour including lunch. Emperor Qinshihuang’s craftsmen made more than 8,000 life-sized warriors in the 11 years between about 220 and 209BC. This is nearly unbelievable, because even in modern times, a warrior factory could only make about 500 warriors of that size in a year. How could craftsmen of 2,200 years ago make them so quickly? Xian is cold in winter but hot in summer. How could they keep so many clay warriors from cracking? Originally warriors were painted with different colours. Most colours were natural, but the purple was very special, because it came from a chemical reaction. How did craftsmen have such skills at that time? Our guide will explain such secrets and then accompany us to a local cave dwelling where a craftsman makes warriors in the traditional way. We will have an opportunity to learn how to make warriors, and to try and make a small one ourselves. Overnight Wyndham Grand Xian South or similar. (BL)"

The first of two stops will be the Jiuxiang Caves, located about 70km from Kunming. Inside the caves we can see are many well-developed and wonderful stalactites and stalagmites, which look like pretty fairies welcoming their guests. Names have been given to them such as \"Fairies Welcoming Guests\", \"Woman Weaver\", and \"The Fairy is coming out of bathing\". Note: The final stage is to climb up Bat Cave. This is the most challenging part as there are about 336 steps. Sometimes there are labourers who offer a sedan chair service, with payment to be made locally in cash. From Jiuxiang we will continue to the Ancient Stone Forest. Covering over 300 kilometres, the towering karst pinnacles of the Stone Forest (or Shilin) create a mysterious illusion of woodland. Made up of many smaller stone forests, some of which are UNESCO World Heritage listed as part of the South China Karst area, the formations we see here today were formed over 270 million years by erosion and seismic activity. As you wander through the maze of giant pseudo-stalagmites, stumbling across caves, waterfalls, and lakes. The visit involves around two hours on foot, walking along cobblestone paths.

At the time of writing, it is necessary to take a transfer from our hotel in Vientiane across the Laos/Thai border to the town on Nong Khai – a distance of about 25km. However, it is anticipated that the Bangkok train will eventually start in Vientiane, thus there will be no need for a transfer. In either case we will join the overnight sleeper service operated by Thai Railways. We will be allocated private air-conditioned two berth (lower and upper bunk beds) compartments, with shared toilet facilities available at the end of the corridor. We recommend taking dinner (payable locally) in the train’s restaurant car, as it is a great way to meet your fellow passengers. Alternatively, a restaurant car attendant usually walks through the train with a menu card showing pictures and English captions. They will take orders and bring the meal to your compartment.
