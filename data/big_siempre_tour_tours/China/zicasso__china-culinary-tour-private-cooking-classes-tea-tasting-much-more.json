Home to emperors during the Ming and Qing Dynasty, this incredible area is formed of almost 1,000 buildings and over 8,000 rooms. Its name derives from the belief that only those who had permission from the emperors were allowed to enter the hallowed grounds. Spend the late afternoon and evening exploring the world-famous Beijing markets, where food, silk, jewelry and pearl-selling stands will catch your eyes. Locals will be negotiating costs with you, and our guides will be there to help get you the best price if you’re not accustomed to the unique price-haggling traditions of the Chinese.

      "title": "Xi’an – Tour of Terracotta Army and Dumpling Feast",
      "description": "Head to the airport and fly south to Xi’an, a wonderfully historic city. Drop your bags off at the luxury hotel and visit one of China’s most famous attractions: the Terracotta Army. These incredible life-size sculptures that are over 2000-years-old and were discovered by farmers in 1974 portray the warriors of an emperor named Qin Shihuang. They are regarded by many as one of the greatest archaeological findings ever to be recorded –and you will be able to witness the huge number of ceramic statues with your own eyes in this incredible museum. Continue feasting your eyes on Xi’an’s historic sights as the tour makes its way further into the heart of the city. See the incredible wall that forms a square around the old section of the city. Originally built as a safeguard during the Ming Dynasty, the unmissable structure stands 12 meters high, 15 meters wide and 14 kilometers long – placing itself among an elite group as one of the biggest, oldest and finest preserved walls in China. Astonishing, then, that to this very day it protects the city from invasion of another kind: construction of modern buildings. Skyscrapers are not allowed to be built inside the wall – maintaining the authenticity of this ancient part of the city – separating it from modern Xi’an. Within the city, there are many fascinating examples of ancient architecture – one of them is Xian’s most famous landmark: the Big Goose Pagoda. The stunning structure towers above its surrounding buildings and is representative of the Tang Dynasty era with its square design. Built in 652 AD, this holy construction is encircled by water squares that beautifully capture the reflection of the pagoda and its nearby gardens. As the sun goes down, the structure lights up and looks over the city like an emperor standing proudly over his soldiers - creating a magical scene. Less famous, yet possessing more tranquility than its bigger brother, is the Small Wild Goose Pagoda. Also built in the Tang Dynasty era, this structure is also called the Jianfu Temple Pagoda; the ‘Small Wild Goose Pagoda’ name derives from the concept that it looks similar to the Big Wild Goose Pagoda but is reduced in size. Xi’an Museum adjoins to the temple, and it’s here where you can learn more about the city’s history and witness many fascinating ancient relics. Time for a food-filled evening, beginning with a dumpling feast fit for an emperor. Tuck into an enormous assortment of stuffed and steamed dumplings, full of flavors, both sweet and savory, that will have your taste buds jumping for joy. Then sample hybrid flavors amid a vibrant atmosphere in the Muslim quarter of the city. Sizzling BBQs and bubbling pots of ingredients appear in every nook and cranny along the streets, producing Middle Eastern tastes, complemented by traditional Chinese cooking techniques. It really does make for unique and delicious flavors, taking your palate to places it has perhaps never been before. Explore the city’s other wide selection of night food markets – where you will get a more traditional taste of Xi’an’s customary cuisine. And if your stomach is a little full of the evening’s previous encounters, perhaps purchase some snacks for the following day."
