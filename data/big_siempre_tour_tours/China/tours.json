Wander the narrow winding lanes (nongtangs) of Old Shanghai, where you can get a glimpse of local life. Explore the European-influenced French Concession, then pound the pavement along Luwan's Huaihai Road – a busy shopping street. The area's tree-lined avenues and many Tudor mansions earned it the nickname 'Paris of the East'. When night falls, why not get together with a few of your travel pals for a taste of Shanghai’s eclectic food scene."

The 72 sharp peaks of Huangshan provide some of China's most breathtaking scenery, as well as a respite from the bustle of the city. Spend the next two days in a guesthouse with free time to explore the area as you wish. Two popular trails are the Eastern Steps (7.5 kilometres, approximately 3–4 hours) and the Western Steps (15 kilometres). It’s recommended to take the cable car to the summit, explore the area and then descend via the Western Steps. Whatever you choose, the dramatic limestone peaks framing this region make for some breathtaking vistas. After taking in the natural beauty of Huangshan during the day, return to the guesthouse for a well-earned evening rest."

The square is named after the Tiananmen (meaning Gate of Heavenly Peace) at its north, which leads to the Forbidden City. Continuing on foot, we spend a few hours exploring the innumerable courtyards and temples of the Forbidden City. Exiting via the north gate of the complex, we walk directly to Jingshan Park and climb to the top of the hill for a different vantage point. After lunch, we have a walking tour around traditional hutongs (narrow alleys of the old town), before meandering back to the hotel. Note: Following the Covid-19 pandemic, maximum numbers of daily visitors to the Forbidden City have been significantly reduced, impacting availability of tickets. Our local team aim to secure tickets for the Forbidden City, but if unable to do so, we visit the Ancestral Temple (used during the Ming and Qing Dynasties to offer sacrifices to ancestors, and architecturally quite similar to the Forbidden City) and the Temple of Heaven instead. You will be advised at the start of the trip if this change needs to be made. Accommodation: Dong Fang Hotel (or similar)"

It is an impressive sight, snaking across mountains and valleys into the distance. We take the shuttle bus to the ticket office; from there, it’s about a 40-minute uphill walk to the top of the Great Wall (anyone not wanting to walk can pay to take the cable car, which takes about eight minutes). We spend the next couple of hours or so walking along the top of the wall. There are some steep steps to navigate and anyone who suffers from vertigo may find it difficult. This section of the Great Wall used to serve as the northern barrier, defending the capital and the imperial tombs. The wall here stands up to 28ft (8.5m) high and 16ft (5m) wide, and there are 22 watchtowers along its 7,380ft (2,250m) stretch. Accommodation: Dong Fang Hotel (or similar)"

The third pit has been opened to the public, which contains the ‘command post’ for the entire operation.

Popularly known as the Forbidden City, it was built in the Ming Dynasty between the 4th and the 18th years of the Yongle period (1406 - 1420 AD). Many of the buildings of the Palace have been repaired and rebuilt, but their basic form and layout remain in their original state.

Next, glide by high-speed train to Guilin, the jewel of southern China, and cruise down the Li River past karst peaks reflected in mirror-like waters—the very scene immortalized on the 20 RMB note. Explore Reed Flute Cave’s illuminated stalactites, wander the cobbled lanes of Daxu Ancient Town, and unwind in Yangshuo’s idyllic countryside by bike or bamboo raft.

Wander through labyrinthine stalls beneath Ming Dynasty brickwork, inhaling the aroma of Yangrou Paomo—crumbled lamb soup bread steeped in rich broth—as vendors knead Biang Biang noodles with rhythmic precision. Begin with Zhen Gao, a century-old glutinous rice cake layered with red bean paste, its golden crust oozing molten sweetness. Next, savor Roujiamo—crispy sesame flatbread stuffed with cumin-scented lamb, a \"Chinese hamburger\" beloved by locals. For a savory twist, plunge wheat gluten cakes into You Cha, a nutty oil-tea broth topped with peanuts and fried shallots. Indulge in Mi Feng Tang Yuan, glutinous rice balls filled with sweet red bean paste, crafted by a family-run stall since the 1980s.

As sunlight climbs the wall, the market’s cacophony fades into memory—a flavor-packed immersion into Xi’an’s edible soul. Then, we will have a full day time tour to visit the magnificent Qin Terra-cotta Army with an extension to Mausoleum of Emperor Qin Shi Huang, one of the greatest archaeological discoveries in the world: a life-size clay soldier poised for battle.

UNESCO listed it in 1987 as one of the world cultural heritages. After visit, we’ll take a high speed train from Xi’an to Lanzhou where we’ll stay at a lovely hotel. Breakfast and lunch included."

    "generalInfo": "China is home to some of the world's most incredible and unique wildlife. It is also a place that not everyone associates with wildlife. But there are some pockets of wilderness and some passionate guides willing to showcase some of China's hidden wildlife secrets.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>When people think of China they rarely think of wildlife and if they do think of Chinese animals that inevitably think of giant pandas. This one species is so iconic and so famous around the world that it is hard to imagine them as wild animals that live a life completely removed from people, but in recent years more and more giant pandas are living wild lives away from the disturbance of people. This is testament to fantastic conservation work and we will be hopefully benefiting from this conservation work as we enter a huge bamboo ecosystem in the mountains of one of the last remaining wild giant panda habitats. By hiking around in this forest we will be in prime panda habitat and will hopefully be rewarded with one of the rarest sights in nature.<br/>However this is only the first of three very different habitats we will be exploring, from the bamboo we will travel to the edge of the Tibetan plateau and to the rocky and rugged wilderness of Ruoergai where typical high altitude species such as Pallas’s cat and Chinese mountain cat live and then down into the forested mountains of Tangjiahe where musk deer, serow, gorals, badgers and bears live. We will spend a considerable amount of time exploring these habitats for wildlife and trying to see as many of these species as possible and hopefully get some rare species too.<br/>You will be experiencing rural China at the end of winter, this is a time of year and locations which are not often visited by tourists. Everything from the food, culture, architecture you will encounter will differ from the typical Chinese imagery that most people have when they thing of the superpower that China is nowadays and the ultra modern cities.<br/>This is a unique tour that explores part of China that are rarely visited and despite the below itinerary being detailed due to weather conditions the route and activities may vary once we get there, although we will endeavour to stick to the stated itinerary as much as possible. The most obvious deviation from the itinerary will come if a targeted species is been spotted in a location we are not in, but can get to.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Chengdu. There will be bottled or purified water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Sichuan. Your naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, guided walks, park entrance fees and spotlighting fees where mentioned on the itinerary. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around (including spotlighting every night we are allowed and there is the possibility of nocturnal wildlife); only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the Chinese forests, hillsides and grasslands. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>This tour can be booked in two different times of year (1) anytime between the middle of March and the middle of April (this is the breeding season of giant pandas and when they are more active) and (2) November, which is when the pandas move lower down the mountainsides to avoid the heavy snowfall, (subject to availability). <br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it.<br/>• We will stay in a variety of accommodation when on this tour, from well established wildlife eco lodges to guest houses and hotels deep inside national parks. <br/>• We will split our focus and activity depending on where we are and what we are looking for. For example we have great flexibility in changing the itinerary to take advantage of recently spotted wildlife.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our specialist tour for China's wildlife including Pallas' Cat, Giant Panda and other mammal species a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Sichuan and then rest of China so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the Golden Snub-nosed monkeys, Black-crested Gibbon, Siberian Crane, Pere-David's Deer and Black Snub-nosed monkeys and many more species. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of China at other times of year and focusing on other species such as Przewalski's horse and the Red Pandas and many other rare mammals of China. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour is centred around the province of Sichuan. It is here and only here there are areas of mountainous bamboo where which pandas inhabit. We also travel to the Tibetan Plateau which gives a remarkable contrast to the densely vegetated mountains of Tangjiahe.<br/><br/>Fitness levels required:<br/><br/>For the first half of the trip all of the wildlife watching activities in this itinerary will be on foot (particularly when looking for pandas); the terrain is hilly and the vegetation very thick. Getting around can be difficult and requires a good level of fitness and being used to hiking in hilly environments. When in the Tibetan Plateau the temperature needs to be taken into consideration, even in April there are still occasional snowstorms and so be prepared for cold temperatures. <br/><br/>Equipment list:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; but as a rule of thumb we recommend you bring along your own binoculars or spotting scope (spotting scopes are highly recommended) as well as appropriate clothing; which should be hard wearing clothing which is suitable for cold (sub-zero) temperatures. Comfortable and broken in waterproof walking boots with ankle supports are a must. Any medication, books or other items of a personal nature is of course up to you to bring along. Oh and please bring plenty of memory cards or film for your camera. Also do not forget sun cream, sun hat and sun glasses as the sun can be very strong here during the day.<br/><br/>Minimum age: 18 years old<br/><br/>Some images on this page are by:<br/>By Sepht - Own work, https://commons.wikimedia.org<br/>By Manyman, from Wikimedia Commons<br/>By Karin st, https://commons.wikimedia.org<br/>By Ksuryawanshi - Own work, https://commons.wikimedia.org",

    "generalInfo": "From the sprawling urban settlements, sophisticated enough to compete with any modern metropolis, to morning tai chi and farming methods which have remained unchanged for thousands of years, China is a vast country made up of infinite variety and wild contradictions. This 15 night tour will take you to the highlights of this fascinating country as well as some of the quieter and less explored areas. <br/><br/>From the historical city of Beijing where you visit Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City, you will travel to probably the most famous site in China, the Great Wall of China. Here you will enjoy a trek along a quieter stretch of the Wall and a night in a fabulous eco-retreat overlooking the Wall itself. From here you head to visit the famous Ming Tombs before taking your comfortable overnight sleeper train to Xi’an, the home of the famous Terracotta Army. <br/><br/>The warriors, numbering in the thousands, were discovered in 1974 and it is thought they were created to accompany Emperor Qin into the afterlife. You will of course enjoy a visit to the Army of soldiers, chariots and horses in the Terracotta Museum and also in Xi’an city itself you will enjoy a gentle cycle ride around the elevated city walls for a different perspective. From Xi’an you will fly to Guilin and enjoy a trip to see the Longsheng rice terraces and also to visit the local minority villages followed by a cruise to the small, laid back town of Yangshuo. Here you will spend time in a quiet eco-retreat called the Yangshuo Mountain Retreat from which you will enjoy a spot of cooking with a local family and spare time in the low key town of Yangshuo itself with its bars, restaurants and shopping. <br/><br/>After time in rural China, you will fly to Shanghai for a few days in this modern metropolis. It’s thought that during the building boom of the early 90’s a third of the worlds construction cranes were at work in Shanghai. Here you will visit the pretty and lavish Yuyuan Garden, the Jade Buddha Temple and Long Hua Park before spending a final day exploring at your own pace, maybe doing a spot of shopping or simply relaxing after your busy trip. <br/><br/>Best time to go:<br/>The climate in China varies a lot as the region covers a range of latitudes. Generally the most comfortable time of year to travel is in the Autumn or Spring between September and October or April to May when you can expect reasonable temperatures and limited amounts of rainfall. Summers between June and August can be very hot and the winters can be very cold indeed, especially in the north.",

Our journey will take around two hours and we can expect some lovely scenery along the way with stunning views of Laos' lush countryside. Upon arrival in Vientiane and following check-in at our hotel, we will meet our local guide for an afternoon city tour taking in the main sights. Visits include the Siamese-style Wat Sisaket, distinguished by its surrounding terrace and ornate five-tiered roof. Inside, the temple boasts a cloister wall adorned with over 2000 ceramic and silver Buddha images. Following this, we will explore Wat Phra Keo, which was constructed between 1565 and 1556 and once housed the Emerald Buddha, now situated in Wat Phra Keaw in Bangkok. The temple has faced destruction multiple times, and the current structure was rebuilt by the French in the 1920s. Our next stop is the illustrious That Luang Stupa, an opulent gold-covered Buddhist stupa originating from the 3rd century. Regarded as the most significant national monument in Laos and a symbol of the nation, That Luang holds great reverence. Finally, we will proceed to the imposing Phatuxay Monument, also known as the \"Victory Gate\" or \"Gate of Triumph,\" which pays homage to those who participated in the struggle for independence from France.

        "description": ": Our tour starts today in Ashgabat, the capital of Turkmenistan. Once a prosperous frontier town along the Trans-Caspian railway, Ashgabat was destroyed by a massive earthquake in 1948, only to rise from the ashes and become the capital of an independent Turkmenistan in 1991. The city was the personal project of President Niyazov, who set about forming it in his own unique image, renaming the streets and changing the face of the city on an almost daily basis as he approved the destruction of its suburbs to make way for several controversial planning projects. For those arriving on time today, our tour leader plans to meet you in the hotel reception at 12pm for a welcome meeting, followed by a tour of the city. We'll head out to take in the highlights of both the Soviet and Niyazov reigns, visiting Independence Park where we'll see the Independence Monument, a large structure designed to resemble traditional Turkmen hats. We'll also pay a visit to the Turkmenistan National Museum of History, a rich cache of 150,000 objects and artefacts that date back to Neolithic times and the Bronze Age era of the Margiana civilisation. If you'd like an airport transfer today, you'll need to arrive into Ashgabat International Airport (ASB), which is a 20-minute drive from the hotel. For those arriving on flights in the early hours of this morning, we'll arrange for your hotel room to be available immediately upon your arrival. If you'd like to add additional days to your holiday pre-tour, please get in touch with us to book your accommodation. Please note, if you'd like to join the afternoon city tour today, you need to arrive at the hotel by 12pm. If you're booking your own flights, we recommend giving yourself at least one to two hours to clear the airport. From the airport to the hotel is around a 15-minute drive, therefore the latest your flight can arrive is 9am. If you miss the welcome meeting, our tour leader will inform you of any essential information at 6pm."

Lying along the great trading routes of the Silk Road, the city prospered under the Sassanians and the Seljuq Turks, becoming a cultural mecca for Christian, Buddhist, Zoroastrian and finally Muslim cultures. At its peak, during the 11th and 12th centuries, the city was known as Marv-i-shah-jahan (Merv, Queen of the World) and, after Baghdad, was considered the finest city in all of Islam. In 1221 its greatness came crashing to earth with the arrival of the Mongol armies of Genghis Khan when, after refusing to pay tribute to the great Mongol warlord, the city and its entire population of nearly 1 million people was put to the sword (it was believed that the Mongol soldiers were ordered to personally behead between 300- 400 people each). Returning to Mary for lunch, we'll then spend the afternoon exploring the Mary Museum of History, a rich repository of some of the finest relics rescued from Merv itself, along with an excellent collection of Turkmen carpets and household objects that span 5,000 years."

Border crossing procedures complete, we'll drive on to the fabled city of Bukhara, once home to the famed poets Firdausa and Rudaki and still considered by many to be the 'Bastion of Islam'. For generations, Bukhara lay at the centre of the great trade routes, its scholarship and architecture revered far and wide as one of the central bastions of Central Asian art and culture, a factor that saw its ancient heart accredited by UNESCO as an important World Heritage Site in 1993. Over 2,000 years old, its historic centre is one of the most complete examples of a medieval city anywhere in Central Asia, filled with majestic architecture, beautiful madrassas and fabulous tombs.

The early history of the area is still relatively unknown, but by the time the Arabs arrived in the 8th century, there were three important cities in the region, of which Khiva was one, largely on account of its strategic location along the Volga branch of the Silk Route. Conquered by the Persians, Khiva then became a pawn in the great game between the Russian and British Empires, finally succumbing to Russian forces in 1873 (following the fate of both Samarkand and Bokhara before it). Its ancient heart has remained largely intact behind towering brick walls, some 40 bastions enclosing an incredible collection of historic monuments and 18th and 19th-century houses and exploring the old citadel is like stepping back in time into a scene straight out of the stories of the Arabian nights. Originally the 12th-century fortress dominated the city, but later additions of palaces, harems, barracks and mosques encroached on the old fortress, compelling the Khan to build a second outer wall to make his citadel even more secure. Please note, today's drive to Khiva will take around nine hours. This is due to the bad road conditions in this area. We'll break up the journey as much as possible with stops along the way."

We'll also visit the Bibi-Khanym Mosque, constructed by Tamerlane's Chinese wife and once one of the grandest mosques in the entire Islamic world, with a gateway that measured an impressive 35 metres/114 feet in height.

Amazingly nothing was known of the existence of the life-size soldiers of the Terracotta Army until a peasant digging a well in 1974 stumbled upon them. The Emperor Qin Shi Huang Di spent most of his life until his death in 210BC constructing his burial place, conscripting thousands of people to build his tomb and the terracotta army that would guard him in the afterlife. The underground battle formations of life-sized pottery warriors, archers, horses and chariots have been left in situ in three large excavated pits. Pit number one contains over 6000 soldiers, each with its own individual facial features, and pit number two contains almost a thousand warriors and half the number of horses (also life-size). Later in the day we’ll return to Xi'an to board an early evening bullet train heading west and arriving in Lanzhou where we’ll overnight."

It was from here that the Silk Road divided into its northern and southern routes. Dunhuang's fame, however, is largely due to the Mogao Grottoes, which are one of the world's richest treasure troves of Buddhist manuscripts, wall paintings and statues known as the Thousand Buddha Caves. The site was first carved out of the cliffs in 366 AD, with more caves being hewn out of the rock up until the 14th century. The honeycomb of caves runs along the cliff face and contains some 2,415 coloured clay sculptures and more than 45,000 square metres of mural paintings. Many of these were paid for by pious travellers facing the perilous journey across the vast desert, or as thanks upon their safe return to Dunhuang. The colours have remained lively due to the extremely dry climate, but natural and electric light and the humidity caused by the breath of thousands of visitors is slowly fading the precious art, and some of the caves are periodically closed. About 25-40 caves are open to the public at any one time and although guides carry a torch, it is also a good idea to take your own."

With its grand marble clad buildings stretching along wide boulevards and its many fountains, Ashgabat is a wonderfully bizarre city. The Turkmen capital began life as a frontier settlement along the Trans-Caspian railway. Following its destruction by an earthquake in 1948, the city has been completely rebuilt and became the country’s capital following its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. An intriguing mix of architectural styles, the city owes much of its unique character to the influence of its late president Saparmurat Atayevich Niyazov, known as Turkmenbashy, who during his tenure implemented an increasingly bizarre set of policies that included approving a series of controversial building projects, renaming the months after members of his own family and even changing the word for bread to that of his mother! On the topic of food, lunch today will consist of a cookery demonstration in a local restaurant before taking a tour of the city to view some of the more fascinating reminders of the city’s rich and eclectic past - including the Arch of Neutrality."

    "generalInfo": "A perfect two week introduction to a fascinating country, this tailor made holiday in China takes in celebrated sights and iconic locations. The tour begins in Beijing, a city packed with history, where you can visit the beautiful Forbidden City, its imperial architecture a bold contrast to the communist built Tiananmen Square just adjacent. Cycle through the hutongs, the old housing area of the city, too, for a sense of stepping back into time to a traditional China. <br/><br/>No trip to China is complete without seeing the Great Wall, but we steer you to the section at Jinshanling, which is beautifully preserved and yet far less frequently visited by tour groups. In Chengdu, visit the Panda Research Centre where this now endangered bear is being nurtured and then relax in this pleasant city, trying some tasty regional cuisine in one of the many local restaurants.<br/><br/>In Guilin, you’ll see one of China’s most beautiful and magical landscapes, which has inspired poets and painters for centuries. Take a river raft ride, admiring the limestone peaks that rear up from the banks. This China adventure winds up in Shanghai, a thriving modern city, where you can take a cruise on the Huangpu River or enjoy some shopping before flying home.<br/><br/>To transport you between the highlights efficiently and make the most of your time, a high speed train ride and internal flights are included. Spring or autumn is the best time to go in terms of weather, although you can visit China at any time of year. <br/>",

Today’s walk is mostly on the restored section of the wall, but this still means walking on steep, uneven terrain with lots of steps, so a reasonable level of fitness and comfortable shoes are necessary. Survey the spectacular surrounding countryside from your vantage point as you surmount the best-preserved stretch of the Wall.

Join your leader on a short walking tour to uncover what was the start of the ancient trading route, the Silk Road. In the city’s Muslim Quarter, you’ll wander through the narrow streets, passing shops, lively markets and endless stalls of street food. For the rest of the day, maybe visit the City Wall, which extends more than 13 km (8 mi) around the city – cycling is a great way to explore it. Or, visit the Bell and Drum Towers – according to legend, the former was built to restrain the dragons that were causing earthquakes. The latter is (unsurprisingly) full of drums that were once used to mark time and warn of emergencies. Xi’an’s history as a major hub on the Silk Road means it has an exciting mixture of cultures – this is exemplified by its food options. This evening, perhaps visit the night markets and try the tantalising local specialties such as pao mo (lamb broth that you break flatbread into), hand-pulled noodles, hot pot and grilled skewers."

These clay statues of soldiers, horses and chariots were commissioned by the Emperor Qin Shi Huangdi as part of his mausoleum after he became emperor in 221 BC.

You’ll join your leader on a walking tour where you’ll check out Tianfu Square and People's Park – this is arguably the liveliest park in China, full of locals singing, dancing, doing tai chi or even modelling! Chengdu has preserved plenty of its traditional flavour, and you'll get a taste of it during this tour and in your free time this evening – maybe sample a Sichuan hotpot for dinner.

Watch them play, eat bamboo and climb the trees. If you’re lucky enough (and travelling between July and September) you might get to see newborns taking their first steps in the nursery. After, return to downtown Chengdu for some free time. Perhaps take in a performance of traditional Sichuan opera, visit the Wenshu Temple or take a cooking class.

    "generalInfo": "This 8-day expedition is a masterclass in \"off-the-beaten-path\" exploration, designed for travelers who crave a harmonious blend of UNESCO-listed natural grandeur and deep cultural authenticity. We begin by ascending the mist-shrouded Ailao Mountains to encounter the Huayao Dai (Flower Waist Dai) people, whose vibrant traditions remain anchored in a landscape of primary forests and thunderous waterfalls. You will walk sections of the ancient Tea Horse Road, a perilous trade route that once linked the far reaches of Asia, feeling the weight of history in every stone-paved step.<br/><br/>The journey transitions from the wild ridges of the Ailao range to the architectural elegance of Jianshui, a Tang Dynasty gem where 600-year-old towers and labyrinthine courtyards tell stories of a scholarly past. A highlight of the trip is the immersion into the Yuanyang Rice Terraces, a 1,300-year-old agricultural masterpiece of the Hani people. Here, the \"stairways to heaven\" create a geometric wonder that shifts from golden reflections at sunrise to deep emeralds at dusk. Beyond the landscapes, we explore Yunnan’s unique historical legacy along the Centennial Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. From the French-influenced nostalgia of Bisezhai Station to the surreal red-brick artistry of Dongfengyun in Mile, this trip is a sensory feast. Whether you are navigating Asia’s largest floral hub in Kunming or gazing into the sapphire depths of Fuxian Lake, you will experience a Yunnan that most tourists never see—a kingdom of untamed beauty and enduring spirit.",

        "description": "Head to the airport and fly south to Xi’an, a wonderfully historic city. Drop your bags off at the luxury hotel and visit one of China’s most famous attractions: the Terracotta Army. These incredible life-size sculptures that are over 2000-years-old and were discovered by farmers in 1974 portray the warriors of an emperor named Qin Shihuang. They are regarded by many as one of the greatest archaeological findings ever to be recorded –and you will be able to witness the huge number of ceramic statues with your own eyes in this incredible museum. Continue feasting your eyes on Xi’an’s historic sights as the tour makes its way further into the heart of the city. See the incredible wall that forms a square around the old section of the city. Originally built as a safeguard during the Ming Dynasty, the unmissable structure stands 12 meters high, 15 meters wide and 14 kilometers long – placing itself among an elite group as one of the biggest, oldest and finest preserved walls in China. Astonishing, then, that to this very day it protects the city from invasion of another kind: construction of modern buildings. Skyscrapers are not allowed to be built inside the wall – maintaining the authenticity of this ancient part of the city – separating it from modern Xi’an. Within the city, there are many fascinating examples of ancient architecture – one of them is Xian’s most famous landmark: the Big Goose Pagoda. The stunning structure towers above its surrounding buildings and is representative of the Tang Dynasty era with its square design. Built in 652 AD, this holy construction is encircled by water squares that beautifully capture the reflection of the pagoda and its nearby gardens. As the sun goes down, the structure lights up and looks over the city like an emperor standing proudly over his soldiers - creating a magical scene. Less famous, yet possessing more tranquility than its bigger brother, is the Small Wild Goose Pagoda. Also built in the Tang Dynasty era, this structure is also called the Jianfu Temple Pagoda; the ‘Small Wild Goose Pagoda’ name derives from the concept that it looks similar to the Big Wild Goose Pagoda but is reduced in size. Xi’an Museum adjoins to the temple, and it’s here where you can learn more about the city’s history and witness many fascinating ancient relics. Time for a food-filled evening, beginning with a dumpling feast fit for an emperor. Tuck into an enormous assortment of stuffed and steamed dumplings, full of flavors, both sweet and savory, that will have your taste buds jumping for joy. Then sample hybrid flavors amid a vibrant atmosphere in the Muslim quarter of the city. Sizzling BBQs and bubbling pots of ingredients appear in every nook and cranny along the streets, producing Middle Eastern tastes, complemented by traditional Chinese cooking techniques.

        "description": "Morning tea, anybody? Today you will begin with a visit to the tranquil Longjing Mountains of Hangzhou, where China’s most highly regarded green tea is produced. As you explore the wonderful Longjing Village, you will witness local workers collecting tea along the near 800 acres of flawless grassy terraces that look truly breathtaking in their mountainous surroundings. The mazy walk through the village will charm you as you pass picturesque teahouses and slender staircases into the plantations. You will even get the chance, if you wish, to stand alongside the locals and pick your own tea. After sipping your hot beverage, you will make your way to the spectacular Peak Flown From Afar. This gigantic limestone structure is made up of caves and outstanding carvings featuring hundreds of statues of Buddha, incredibly dating back to 907 AD. The sheer history and beauty of the Peak Flown From Afar will leave you in awe long after you have finished this stage of the tour. Continuing with the theme of history, but with an utterly contrasting experience, you will visit the Song Dynasty Town. This spectacular theme park fantastically recreates the culture of the Song Dynasty era with theatrical performances (acrobatics and dancing), traditional customs (including matchmaking proposals where women would throw a ball into a crowd of men, who fought to capture it and therefore wed the lady!), ancient activities (torch and water-splashing festivals) and much, much more. To perfectly conclude the day, you will take a boat cruise down the quaint West Lake. As you venture along, the stunningly beautiful gardens, pagodas, and temples will absorb your eyes, while your ears will be massaged by the peaceful sound of water gently splashing the side of the boat. Shadows of the willow trees along the waterside become stretched, and the glow of the fish dim as the night sky descends before the enchanting Impression West Lake Show begins. Witnessing the West Lake Show is the perfect parting gift from Hangzhou. The beauty of the lake and its magical surroundings, combined with the setting of the stage on the fringes of the crisp water, creates a magical experience. Dancers appear as if they are gliding and jumping on the lake as the delightful music and lights are in tandem with their every move. The beautiful love story unfolds as perfectly as the flowers that grace the backdrop of its setting; making a memorable end to your stay in this serene city."

As you stroll through Yu Garden, you can look across the Huangpu River, which is considered to be the mother river of Shanghai because it feeds many other rivers. The curved rooftops of the traditional side and the straight lines from the modern side are the perfect contrast between Eastern and Western styles.

This palace was once the home to 24 Ming and Qing dynasty emperors during their reign, and today, it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is also the largest palace in the world with its grandiose buildings and curved rooftops. Though a feast for the eyes, the distinguishing feature of the Forbidden City lies in its defensive structure. It was built with angular walls to prevent intrusive offenders and white lime, glutinous rice, and egg whites to create materials that were too strong for weapons of the time to break. With many imperial families living in the Forbidden City, it was important for them to have a place where emperors could worship heaven and be rewarded with good harvests. The Temple of Heaven is a three-tiered, circular building that was made from wooden halls and painted in a glorious sweep of colors. It is the perfect representation of China’s tradition around architecture as numerology, which symbolizes both Chinese religion and beliefs that are blended seamlessly into the design. Though Beijing is known for its Peking duck, it has many other flavors for you to experience. The interplay of spicy, sweet, sour, bitter, and salty are the keys to Beijing cuisine and help create the soul of Chinese food, giving it a very unique flavor. After lunch, your guide will take you to Beihai Park, which is the oldest, living imperial garden in Beijing. At over 1,000 years old, this ancient garden was built around a Chinese legend regarding three magic mountains on which the gods lived and possessed herbal medicine for immortality."

With its vast fields of emerald grass and clusters of trees, it is a haven for any who enter. Temples are abundant in China, but the Jade Buddha temple, which houses rare cultural relics alongside porcelain artworks, is definitely a sight that you will not want to miss. Built in 1882, the temple was constructed to house two jade Buddhas: one was made from a sparking and crystal-clear, white jade and the other was sheathed in agate and emeralds, symbolizing the time of enlightenment of the Buddha. Though Shanghai has many wonderful traits to offer its visitors, its cuisine is an orchestral masterpiece that harmonizes aroma, color, and taste into each dish. Once you taste food from Shanghai, it is hard to imagine any other combination of flavor to pass by your lips. The food in Shanghai is sweeter than the rest of the country, and they also use fewer spices, so the dishes are not as spicy or hot. After lunch, your guide will escort you to Yu Garden, which is a five-acre garden that was built in 1577 during the Ming dynasty.

When you walk through the old city of Shanghai, you will be able to inhale whiffs of delectable treats of Shanghai, which will be able to fulfill any craving you may have. The historical streets of Xintiandi are part of the old French quarter in Shanghai. With the external appearance of tiles and antique walls having been retained from the Shikumen architecture, which is a blending of both Eastern and Western elements, you will be transported back to Shanghai in the 1920s in some respects while remaining firmly grounded in the 21st century. Due to the unique, European-styled architecture, you will most likely feel as if you are in Europe as opposed to China."

        "description": "Today, you will transfer back to Shanghai after a hearty breakfast. Once you are here, the world-famous site of the Terracotta Warriors will beckon for your presence. As you and your guide descend into the mausoleum of the first emperor of China, the Terracotta Army will expand in front of you and just about as far as your eye can see. In the three pits, there are 8,000 life-sized soldiers, 130 chariots with 520 horses, and 150 cavalry horses that have been forever frozen in battle formations. It is absolutely breathtaking to see, but even more so when you know that each soldier was carved with original facial expressions, features, clothing, hairstyles, and gestures. That is, you will have a very difficult time trying to find two identical warriors. These warriors stood on guard to protect the first emperor to the afterlife and is a form of funerary art, much like the Egyptian Pyramids. To be in the presence of such extraordinary statues is mind-blowing, and you will come to realize that this site may never have been discovered had it not been for two farmers who were digging a well. The thundering of drums from Tang Paradise will pull you deeper into Xi’an. Here resides the first garden-like park giving visitors a glimpse into the Tang dynasty. As you walk through the park where pavilions stand tall above the serene water, you can fill your belly with the flavors of delicious Tang dynasty food. As you stroll the grounds, the Tang dynasty’s lyrical poems and art will caress your eyes as their music fills your ears. Afterward, you will travel with your guide from the Tang dynasty to the Ming dynasty so you can view the Drum Tower. Built in 1380 during the Ming dynasty, the most remarkable aspect of the Drum Tower is that it was made without any iron nails. It sits on a concrete block in the heart of Xi’an with 24 drums that stand for the 24 solar terms because it was used as a weather calendar to help guide agricultural production in addition to keeping time at night."

        "description": "Today, you will travel to the remote villages of China to view some of the most spectacular landscapes. As you fly into Guilin, you can look out the window at the infamous terraces that make up the Longsheng Rice Terrace, which is also referred to as the curving Dragon Backbone. When the mist of the morning rises to let the sun through, the light hits the grassy leaves of the rice terraces, forcing them to glimmer and evoking a mysterious and ethereal feeling. You can walk along the terraces and meet the Zhuang and Yao nationalities who helped to create the rice terraces. China has many legends that are based on animals, and one that stands out is located at Elephant Trunk Hill in Guilin. As you and your guide stroll toward this famous rock, from a distance, you will be able to see the shape of an elephant that is drinking from the water, which is how the name came about. What the legend says is that the rock is the embodiment of a god elephant who used to be the mount for the Emperor of Heaven. Unfortunately, it was separated from the emperor and stranded in Guilin with severe wounds before it fell in love with the stunning beauty of the city and refused to leave. As you stand at the base of the rock, you can feel the love, infusing you through the city of Guilin. After a hearty lunch, your guide will lead you to one of the best landscapes in the world: the Solitary Beauty Peak, which is where the prince used to reside. The luscious greenery blankets the sharp precipice where the best view of Guilin lies. The large-scale, architectural complex was home to the longest-reigning Ming dynasty prince with its red walls and yellow tiles. As you reach the top of the peak, you can take a deep breath of fresh air and look out over the land of Guilin, which will provide a feeling of serenity that has lasted throughout the ages."

From the seven beltways that encircle the city to the countless skyscrapers under construction, Beijing is a city continuously undergoing transformation and growth. You arrive at your luxury accommodation. Located less than a mile from the Imperial Palace, the hotel is situated among the city’s historic hutongs . The hutongs are narrow alleys linking multiple traditional homes, some dating back 400 years. The hutongs are known for their magnificent private courtyards, something your own luxury accommodation spares no expense to emulate for your enjoyment. Your room features modern amenities while staying true to the hotel’s Qing dynasty design. After some time to freshen up, your guide picks you up for dinner. Your first taste of China is at the famous restaurant specializing in duck dishes. The outside gardens feature modern art, and inside a chef cuts duck right at your table.

Each morning thousands of Beijing’s retirees gather at the lake’s shores to practice tai-chi, dancing, and even badminton. Here you meet a local tai-chi master. After stretching, she teaches you many tai-chi and kung-fu movements designed to bring inner harmony and relaxation. With the peaceful lake and centuries-old hutongs surrounding you, it is easy to find a sense of calm and balance. After saying goodbye to your teacher, you take a rickshaw tour of the hutong district. Each turn brings new surprises, such as homes where trees appear to be growing out of the buildings. It is easy to imagine a time when Beijing looked much the same way. Your next stop is Dong Hua Men, a street of food stalls that sells familiar (and not so familiar) fried snacks on a stick. Expect to see everything from scorpions to lizards as you explore the stalls. Even if you don’t sample the food, you discover that the street is an exciting congregation of activity. Dinner this evening is a treat, an all-you-can-eat buffet at an esteemed restaurant.

After checking out of your hotel, a private car takes you an hour north of Beijing to Mutianyu, a rustic village at the foot of the Great Wall. You check into your own private villa. The outside is adorned with original Ming dynasty brickwork. Inside, the interior has been completely renovated for discerning travelers. Before heading to the wall, hotel stewards serve you lunch in your villa’s courtyard. Expect a variety of delectable dishes and a million-dollar view of the Great Wall. After lunch, your car takes you to the Great Wall. The wall stretches over the hills and valleys as far as the eye can see, you are spellbound by its grandeur. In this distance, you spot five Chinese characters carved into the hillside. A leftover from China’s tumultuous Cultural Revolution in the 1960s, they read ‘Loyal to Chairman Mao.’ China has left behind much of Mao’s ideology, but some reverence for the ‘Great Helmsman’ continues. During your time on the wall, it is possible to explore the unrestored Jiankou section. With trees, bushes, and flowers blossoming between the ancient stones, you may begin to feel that this is how the wall was meant to be experienced. Pausing at a crumbling watchtower, there are no other travelers, no other signs of people for miles. Reflecting on the serenity of nature, it is a perfect time to try out your kite. Returning to your villa in the late afternoon, a local chef prepares you a special barbecue dinner featuring regional meat and produce. With the sun setting behind the Great Wall, you have a perfect view to end your day."

Historically known as Chang’an, Xi’an was China’s first capital and held this honor for over 1,000 years. The city’s past still very much affects its present. You land in Xi’an after a two-hour flight. A private car takes you to your luxury hotel in the city center. Each of the hotel’s rooms features floor to ceiling windows, giving you an unparalleled view of Xi’an’s magnificent ancient and modern architecture. After using the late afternoon to freshen up at the hotel, your guide for the evening picks you up in the hotel lobby. As the sun sets over Xi’an, your guide leads you on a bicycle tour of the city. The Xi’an City Wall is a stunning fortification. Enclosing 14 square miles of the city, it dates back to the 14th-century. It has survived wars, rebellions, and the neglect of time. Standing in its presence, you understand the power Imperial China once commanded. Your tour of the city ends in Xi’an’s Muslim Quarter. Less than 100 years after the founding of Islam on the Arabian Peninsula, the religion had spread to Chang’an through the historical Silk Road. In 742, the faithful founded the Great Mosque of Xi’an. You observe the Arabic writing on the mosque’s structures, but traditional Chinese architecture defines this mosque. It is a wholly tranquil setting, a peaceful contrast to Xi’an’s modern metropolis. After building up an appetite from your bike ride, expect a filling and delicious dim sum dinner. Though dim sum is available at Chinese restaurants all over the world, the dish is a Xi’an specialty. Throughout your meal, you sample many steamed dumplings filled with vegetables, pork, beef, and seafood. Just when you think you are done, your waiter brings yet another bamboo basket filled with more delectable food."

        "description": "After a buffet breakfast at your hotel, you are off by private car to see arguably the most famous archeological discovery of all time: the terracotta warriors and horses. The history of this UNESCO World Heritage Site goes back to 246 BCE when the first emperor of China was a young man. Throughout his 36-year reign, 700,000 workers constructed the massive mausoleum. The crypt lies undisturbed a mile away from the famed warriors. Historical records indicate that the emperor’s tomb is surrounded by a handmade model of the Earth with mercury seas. The ceiling is encrusted with diamonds and jewels representing the constellations. Until archeological techniques improve, it will remain hidden from the world. What you see today was first discovered in 1974, when two young farmers found the first terracotta shards while digging a well. Archeologists from China and around the world have worked at the site every since, restoring the terracotta warriors and horses to their former glory. Your first stop is pit one. Twice as long as a football field, the pit contains over 6,000 uncovered sculptures. Walking the perimeter for the first time, you may feel as if you are an ancient Chinese general inspecting his army. Returning to Xi’an, you board a flight to Guilin, a city far to the south. In many ways, Guilin reflects how many American perceive China: terraced rice fields, rocky slopes, and wide rivers. Leaving the airport by private car, you may feel that you have traveled to a completely different country, one that more closely reflects the China you have seen in movies and television shows. Your premier hotel this evening includes modern amenities, with your room featuring a balcony with views of the Li River and surrounding countryside. After time to freshen up, your guide takes you to a rooftop dinner featuring Yangshuo Duck. Like Peking Duck, Yangshuo Duck is cooked to crispy perfection. Throughout the meal, the duck appears in a variety of savory dishes. Your after-dinner entertainment is the Sanjie Liu musical show. Set on the Li River, the live show features over 600 performers and acrobats performing to traditional folk songs and elaborate lighting. The music reverberates off the surrounding hillsides, making it seem as if the Earth itself is singing. It is also an experience where you want to you have your camera ready, as many moments throughout the performance rival the gravity-defying choreography in the film Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon ."

You take your ingredients to a nearby farmhouse, where a Yangshuo family teaches you many of their recipes. Together you make a delicious lunch and get to know one another over the meal. In the afternoon, you trade your bicycle for a bamboo raft. The river’s current is gentle, meaning even first-time rafters have little trouble navigating the river. After a while, all signs of the modern world melt away. Every bend in the river revealing new wonders, it is easy to focus solely on the scenery. Leaving your raft behind, you once again ride a bike to Moon Hill. A magnificent sight, its name refers to the rock formation’s wide arch. Standing at its base, it is impossible not to feel insignificant in its presence. In the afternoon, you return to Yangshuo.

Today you are off to see these terraces up close, leaving Guilin by private car. When you arrive, you start your day of exploration by taking a short hike to Pingan Village. As Pingan does not allow cars, none of the village’s historical charm has been sacrificed to modern progress. For lunch, you eat with a local family and learn about village life and the great tradition and care that rice farming requires. After lunch, you tour the rice terraces. No matter the season, you pass farmers tending their crops or maintaining the earthen structures. During the tour, your guide points out many of the terrace’s features, from the complicated irrigation system to the engineering that went into creating the terraces more than 600 years ago.

The addition of artificial lighting gives the cave an otherworldly quality and makes you feel as if you are exploring an alien landscape. Your final stop in Guilin is Elephant Trunk Hill. Like the Reed Flute Cave, it has attracted visitors for over a millennium. The large hill plays a major role in Guilin’s folklore. It is said that the hill is a God Elephant that protects the town. Standing at its wide base, it is easy to understand why people once believed Elephant Trunk Hill was a deity. Your afternoon flight from Guilin to Shanghai takes approximately a little over two hours. You arrive in late afternoon and are met at the airport by your Shanghai guide.

These ‘concessions’ operated under European laws and used their own currency when conducting business with the Chinese. Your tour this morning begins in the French Concession, where for nearly 100 years the French left their mark on Shanghai. With each member of your party touring the district in a separate motorcycle sidecar, you drive through city streets that could easily be part of Paris. From the past, you head into the future: Shanghai’s Pudong district. From your table high up in the Shanghai World Financial Center, you leisurely dine on a lunch of modern Shanghai dishes. After lunch, you leave the Pudong by the Bund Sightseeing Tunnel. Traveling under the Pudong river by private train car, you are treated to a spectacular light and sound show. The five-minute ride is a feast for the senses, making you feel as if you are traveling at the speed of light. When you emerge above ground, you are in the Bund. These European-style buildings were once a symbol of vexation for China. Like the French Concession, European laws prevailed here, and European corporations once housed in these buildings controlled much of China’s foreign trade. Today these buildings are a source of local pride, home to some of the finest hotels and restaurants in Shanghai.

Traveling 19 miles in only eight minutes, the trip seems to end all too soon. Your flight to Hong Kong departs at lunchtime and arrives in mid-afternoon. You briefly stop at your hotel, Langham Place. From your Deluxe Plus room, expect panoramic views of Victoria Harbour, along with all modern amenities, including a rain shower. The Mong Kok district, one of the liveliest neighborhoods in the city, is only steps from your hotel. From its roadside kiosks to department stores, it seems as if the whole city is on sale around you. Look up and you spot the lingering architectural style of the British, who ruled Hong Kong from 1841 to 1997. For the best view of Hong Kong, your guide takes you to Victoria Peak. All of the city seems to lay before you as you step out on the peak. You notice, too, that the weather is different, as the peak has its own temperate climate. It is an ideal place to linger as the sun sets, when Hong Kong’s innumerable artificial lights come to life. Descending Victoria Peak, your day ends with a harbor cruise on a restored fishing boat. As the sails catch the gentle wind, you make your way into Victoria Harbour. The skyline in front of you, it is a perfect place to make your final memories of Hong Kong and China.

Stroll the momentous Tiananmen Square, where frost-covered Chinese flags ripple in the wind and the area’s possession of substantial political history consumes you. In 1949, communist revolutionary Mao Zadong announced the beginning of the People’s Republic of China on these very grounds. But before, and since that year, significant moments that have shaped the country’s dynamics were to play out here. Learn about these bygone times in the Chinese National Museum and Great Hall of People, while an ever-present portrait of Chairman Mao overlooks the square and hundreds of soldiers line the perimeter, dusting their uniforms of falling snow. Head to the enchanting Forbidden City – sitting opposite the square. This truly stunning imperial palace dates back to the Ming Dynasty era and spans an astounding 74 hectares. Within that area are 980 captivating buildings encompassing almost 9,000 magically decorated rooms, enclosed by a towering wall and 52-meter-wide moat. You will witness snow delightfully paint the palace and its stunning surroundings a picturesque shade of winter white – adding to the already fascinating beauty this area possesses. The name ‘Forbidden City’ lends itself to the notion that only emperors and those whom they gave permission could enter the gates of the palace. Next, explore the incredible Beijing Hutongs (old alleyways) – where you will get a fascinating insight into the city’s traditional way of life. Walk amid a range of narrow, wide, short and long lanes with uneven cobbled pathways and leaning tiled roofs into open courtyards surrounded by buildings. Small shops and restaurants sporadically appear as you weave your way around the mazy walkways; witness the older generation laughing and joking among one another while playing Mahjong; engage with the friendly residents as they offer you astonishing insight into their lives. You can even partake in traditional dumpling making, calligraphy and Chinese paper cutting classes amid your unique surroundings. That evening enjoy one of Beijing’s most renowned dishes as you are treated to a Peking Duck dinner at an esteemed local restaurant."

Begin in the quaint Central Street: a former hub for residents from countries all over the world, it boasts a variety of stunning age-old European architecture. Cobblestone walkways are decorated in snow while a predominant Russian theme fills its shops, restaurants and bars. Indulge in Russian, French, British and German-made goods including traditional dolls, perfumes, wools, medicines and much more. Dating back to 1898, this area is a corridor of architectural magic and is a must-visit attraction of Harbin. As early evening approaches, make your way to the unforgettably wondrous St. Sophia Cathedral and city square. This stunning Russian-style construction displays magical snow-drizzled domes and spires with enchanting Roman features. Night falls and upward lights create a magical bronze glow across the architectural masterpiece – forming a spectacular scene against the coats of winter white. Harbin’s open city square encircles the cathedral, and on its perimeter lay a range of beautiful backlit buildings. Next, head to the Jile Temple, otherwise known as the Temple of Bliss. Consisting of 10 different structures, including halls, towers and cells, it is the largest Buddhist complex in Heilongjiang Province. Its focal point is a glorious seven-story pagoda standing over 30 meters tall, decorated with detailed Buddhist pictures. You will witness stunning colored brickwork and golden Buddha statues amid the winter’s white delights as you walk among peaceful courtyards where burning incense gently set sail strings of smoke into the air. Admire the wonderfully traditional stone and bronze architecture both in and outside of the halls. Later that evening enjoy another customary local taste of cuisine as you tickle your taste buds with a delicious Dongbei Hotpot dinner."

        "description": "It’s morning, and time to prepare for a day featuring a wide range of wonders, beginning with a trip to the beautiful Sun Island - sitting amid the serene Songhua River. It is a winter haven: witness the astounding works of art on display at the International Snow Sculpture Expo – stunningly detailed and equally as impressive in size, these snow and ice sculptures are simply awe-inspiring and will leave you with a longing sense of disbelief. Sledding, skating and skiing activities play out around the park as you walk amid this winter wonderland, and you can get involved in these activities if you wish. See spotted deer stroll among the thick powders of snow; beautiful pavilions; picturesque Russian architecture and so much more in this unique and spectacular area. Journey toward the nearby Siberian Tiger Park, and witness one of the world’s endangered species. This huge area displays stunning young, matured and king tigers living a free, natural life amid beautiful snow-filled fields. A heavily protected vehicle will take you to within meters of these spectacular creatures, and there will also be opportunity to see panoramic views from the walking zone and observing platform. For those who are at one with wildlife and nature: pay a small fee to witness fascinating action as the tigers hunt down their pray. After a spot of lunch head to the Heilongjiang Provincial Museum – the largest museum in Heilongjiang. Another building representing Russian-style architecture, it displays relics that offer a fascinating insight into past disputes over who ruled the region. The museum is separated by three halls: in the first you’ll see insightful artifacts from tribes and countries that conquered and ruled the northern part of China. The second displays information and fossils of animals that resided/reside in the area; and the third exhibits extinct animals - including captivating dinosaur fossils. Take a trip back to the hotel and spend the evening however you wish. After recharging your batteries you may want to head out and partake in some extra exploring!"

This beautiful area is another winter haven; its focal point is the Flood Control Monument - commemorating the residents of Harbin whom miraculously controlled a colossal flood of the city back in 1957. The statue is of traditional European-style design, and looks glorious amid its floral surroundings. But it’s during the winter months, when the lake is thickly glazed with ice, that the park comes to life. Winter sports and games take place: skilled skaters jump and twist their way around, stunning Husky dogs run freely and tow sleds in their wintery wake, all while local musicians treat you to some delightful tunes. Experience extraordinary views over the city this afternoon as you head to the peak of the Dragon Tower. Aside from its practical significance as a key TV pylon of Heilongjiang Province, it is the tallest steel tower in Asia and possesses structural beauty. A thick base smoothly narrows to a circular viewing platform, before its slim peak that sits high in the sky. You’ll enjoy the wondrous winter views of the city’s architecture and natural splendor from the observation deck – a fitting way to spend some of your final hours of the trip. Your stomach will be longing for some food, so head back to the hotel for a bite to eat before spending the night in spectacular fashion as you enjoy the unforgettable Ice Lantern Show at Zhaolin Park. The serene snow-topped peaks of Huageo Mountain and Meigui Mountain beautifully peer over the park as you admire colorful lights bringing to life snow and ice sculptures that replicate famous buildings, ancient legends, and famed icons. You’ll gaze in wonder at these works of art, which depict detail and size that defies logic. Shades of red, green, blue, purple and pink reflect all around, igniting a sense of serenity and cultural insight – leaving there no better place to conclude your stay in Harbin."

It is a starting point to understanding the rest, like the Temple of Heaven, an icon so sublime that even the emperors would come to bow their heads before it. From here, you will dive down into the hutongs, the mazy little alleys where tea sellers roam and the clinking of glasses meets the hum of chatter. Very few hutongs remain, yet the atmosphere remains timeless, especially as you stop for a tea and watch the world roll by. From here, you can visit two markets. Panjiayuan is a place of antiques with forgotten trinkets gathering dust and occasionally catching the eye. More items get sold in Hongqiao, the hustle and bustle of traditional trade leaving an impression on the ears as well as the eyes. As you tour Beijing alongside your private guide, there is also a stop in Tiananmen Square, another major symbol from world history.

From your helicopter, you can loop above the wall and watch how it stretches through the thick forest and just keeps moving onwards. Touch down in a relatively remote place, where the silence means you hear your own footsteps along the wall, and then fly back to the best-preserved section, which is incredibly busy with tourists and makes you feel glad of the earlier off-the-track experience. Return to Beijing and your afternoon can be customized, perhaps heading into a modern city, or maybe focusing on a blossoming art scene."

Explore this Middle Kingdom city and then find an army fit for an emperor as the life-sized terracotta warriors are each with their own expressions and details. You will see the archaeological site before gaining exclusive access to the Tang dynasty murals, art pieces that shed light on why these figures were buried beneath the ground.

When you order a bowl of noodles, you will be treated to a chef with lightning fast hands that can pull and stretch dough multiple times to create artwork that will become your noodles. It is definitely a sight to remember. The Drum and Bell Tower were built during the Ming dynasty and used to signify the starting or ending of important events. The Bell Tower is located in the center of the old city and surrounded by a circle of traffic. As you and your guide make your way through the underground walkway to the tower, you will be able to climb to the top of the wooden tower to have a panoramic view of the city. The Drum Tower was built earlier than its sister tower and has many large drums and various instruments that are often featured in performances. Their sound could be heard echoing throughout the city."

The Summer Palace is the ultimate in exquisite gardening. It encompasses lakes, gardens, and palaces and is still influential in today’s gardening as it was seen as a masterpiece in Chinese landscape design. Everything that was planted or built in the garden perfectly harmonizes with one another, from the plants and the paths to the architecture and horticulture. The palace epitomizes the philosophy and practice of Chinese garden design."

There are many aspects to Beijing cuisine that make it so tasty but the most famous dish of all is the Peking duck. This dish was only served to the imperial family and high-ranking officials so when you have the chance to bite into this savory morsel, you will feel as if you have reached another state of being. The Peking duck has a golden brown crispy skin that shelters tender meat and is wrapped in a paper-thin flour pancake, then topped with a dollop of hoisin sauce and a green onion."

Walking over elaborate bridges, you can explore Takayama with a local guide, uncovering the what, when and why of Edo, then finishing at Sanmachi Suji. Your evening meal also comes from history.

Unlike Takayama, it feels like a museum village with not a strand out of place in this remote mountain valley. The setting is sublime, and your guide can show you a couple of mountain trails should you wish to walk. Returning back to Takayama, you will watch as the town ambiance changes at dusk with the feeling of a lived-in old city best displayed through soft lights and evening chatter."

Touch down and take a helicopter out to the Great Wall of China, propellers whirling as you gasp at the structure’s scale. From the air, it makes sense, this twisting mass of stone that cuts through mountain and valley. Its scale is revealed, even if you see but a tiny fraction of the almost 10,000 miles of wall built to repel Mongol invaders. Stepping out onto a relatively less visited part of the wall, you can wander along the enormous slabs to appreciate just how high they built this defense. Head into Beijing, and check into your hotel with its contemporary glass-fronted accommodation similar to what you had in Tokyo. While Beijing now rises high, it is still very historical at heart, and just as imposing. Step inside the Forbidden City and stand in awe at its details. Sculpted lions, flowing temples, cobbled stone and a sense of history all abound, and there is nothing on this scale anywhere else in the world. Nearby is the Temple of Heaven, a place popular with Chinese couples seeking good luck for the future. Embrace its sanctified atmosphere, join hands beneath painted facades, and then take a rest as dusk draws near. It will be one of the busiest days of the tour, but the trilogy of famous sights are worth the rushing around."

Lijiang harks back to medieval times, with grand gates leading into an expertly restored city where not a stone is out of place. Stroll across the tiny bridges and down narrow lanes, twisting through a piece of China where vehicles cannot go. Hear the historical tales from your guide, learning when Lijiang came to prominence and also its mostly unknown influence on the Western world. Soak up the slow pace of life and spend two nights in a boutique hotel, where you sleep amid the history. Day 12 is guided and takes you around all the important sights, as well as ensuring you have your bearings. Day 13 is at your leisure, and you may wish to take it easy in Lijiang, simply taking more hand in hand walks down 13th-century lanes. The town is flanked by dramatic mountains, which cast their shadow from mid-afternoon onwards. Here you can go hiking or horseback riding, an adventure that brings up images of the Great Silk Road and arriving in Lijiang from a forested slope.

Your final day in China will begin with a cooking class, a fun and informal experience that begins with sourcing ingredients from a local market. Throw food around, create classic Chinese dishes, and settle into the kitchen exoticism. This afternoon you can choose between a private cycle trip above the karst or another boat cruise on the Yulong River. Both provide tranquility in nature and a final slice of rural China to take home in your memories.

        "description": "This morning you will wake upon the great waters of the Yangtze River. This monstrous river stretches almost 4,000 miles and possesses impressive features on each of its twists and turns. Pulling back the curtains will treat your eyes to surroundings very different to what you have previously experienced in hotel rooms as the morning sun kisses serenely tree-topped mountains amid the sound of water gliding the outer edges of the vessel you vacate. Watch on as local fishermen and women use fascinatingly traditional methods to source the fish that swim beneath the river’s surface. Amidst the beautiful greenery of the riverside mountains appears a stunning 12-story pavilion atop a standout peak, known as Shibaozhai. Dating back to the Ming Dynasty, the pavilion stands at an incredible 184 feet and possesses ancient architectural beauty with its wooden structure. Traditional Chinese eaves add to the pavilions’ enchanting aura, while the interior is decorated with inscriptions and art. But it’s after you’ve reached the peak of the structure that you can admire the true beauty of the Yangtze River. The viewing point at the top of the pavilion offers captivatingly stunning outlooks for miles into the distance of this beautiful area.

        "title": "Yangtze River Cruise – Three Gorges and Shennong Stream",
        "description": "Continue your exploration of the Yangtze River today beginning with two of the stunning renowned Three Gorges. Be taken aback by the Qutang Gorge which is widely regarded as the most beautiful out of the three areas. Head down river as mountains on either side of you begin to get closer to the clouds, an enchanting mist swirls, and the narrow waters of the Yangtze move faster to create a perfect balance of tranquility and thrill. Admire a number of mesmerizing scenic spots including the Chalk Wall, a wall inscribed with words from a range of periods in ancient time that date back to the Song Dynasty. Stretching almost 2,000 yards and featuring thousands of words from different periods in Chinese history it is a sight to behold in its pleasant surroundings. Making your way toward the Wu Gorge ignites a feeling of pure enchantment as peaks of different shapes and sizes are eclipsed by a profusion of hovering mist, like a watchful emperor overlooking his hallowed territory. This part of the Yangtze paints a picture befitting that of a magical book cover or film poster and nowhere else possesses that magic as much as the Twelve Peaks. These peaks are each named after the myth that twelve evil dragons inflicted destructive weather upon the Wu Gorge, and so goes the story that after a young girl had killed the dragons, they transformed into mountains. Over the years, the elements have created the aforementioned unique shapes and sizes that this area of the Yangtze holds to make up its fairytale presence. This afternoon you will step off of your luxury ship and step aboard a small wooden boat as you embrace the pure tranquility of the Shennong Stream. You will be entranced by the power of nature as locals steer and guide you down river. The slow repetitions of the ores breaching the surface of the water take you toward serrated cliffs and peaks, where local wildlife thrives. You will be taken aback by coffins suspended over the edges of the cliff that date back over 2,000 years. Ancient locals placed the dead in these hanging coffins and they are a truly wondrous sight to see as you take in the sights of the Shennong Stream. Disembark from your small wooden boat and step aboard ship once again, to enjoy the brilliant onboard entertainment and services."

        "description": "From yesterday’s tranquility of the Shennong Stream to the human-made force that is the Three Gorges Dam, it is more than likely that you have heard of this dam, if not for its humanitarian, environmental and economic controversy, then for its status as the largest dam in the world. The Three Gorges Dam consists of the dam itself, a navigation facility, and a number of hydropower stations. It stands at a whopping 607 feet while stretching almost 3,500 yards wide. Despite the controversy of the structure, its efficiency in flood control is unparalleled, while its power generation and navigation capabilities are astounding. Witnessing the Three Gorges Dam is an overwhelming experience due to its sheer size, but as you explore more of this human-made structure, you will begin to appreciate the architectural masterpiece that it is before transferring to your final leg of your tour, Shanghai."
