In the surroundings of the temple, you will see the older generation partaking in their relaxing and gentle tai chi early-morning exercises - adding to the wonderful bliss this unique area possesses. It’s afternoon, and time to visit the strikingly beautiful and historical Forbidden Palace – which was the home of many emperors during the Ming and Qing dynasties. Its name derives from the notion that individuals were not allowed to enter the palace without authorization from the emperors. This imperial palace is now known as the Palace Museum – and is one of the world’s most admired attractions. After taking a break, you will make your way to the hilltop of the nearby Jingshan Park: one of the most beautiful yet little-known scenic spots of the city. It offers astounding panoramic views of the Forbidden City and the surrounding areas – and will truly take your breath away as the sun sets majestically over the imperial palace."

      "title": "Hangzhou – Tea Plantation, Buddha Caves, and Cruise on West Lake",
      "description": "Morning tea, anybody? Today you will begin with a visit to the tranquil Longjing Mountains of Hangzhou, where China’s most highly regarded green tea is produced. As you explore the wonderful Longjing Village, you will witness local workers collecting tea along the near 800 acres of flawless grassy terraces that look truly breathtaking in their mountainous surroundings. The mazy walk through the village will charm you as you pass picturesque teahouses and slender staircases into the plantations. You will even get the chance, if you wish, to stand alongside the locals and pick your own tea. After sipping your hot beverage, you will make your way to the spectacular Peak Flown From Afar. This gigantic limestone structure is made up of caves and outstanding carvings featuring hundreds of statues of Buddha, incredibly dating back to 907 AD. The sheer history and beauty of the Peak Flown From Afar will leave you in awe long after you have finished this stage of the tour. Continuing with the theme of history, but with an utterly contrasting experience, you will visit the Song Dynasty Town. This spectacular theme park fantastically recreates the culture of the Song Dynasty era with theatrical performances (acrobatics and dancing), traditional customs (including matchmaking proposals where women would throw a ball into a crowd of men, who fought to capture it and therefore wed the lady!), ancient activities (torch and water-splashing festivals) and much, much more. To perfectly conclude the day, you will take a boat cruise down the quaint West Lake. As you venture along, the stunningly beautiful gardens, pagodas, and temples will absorb your eyes, while your ears will be massaged by the peaceful sound of water gently splashing the side of the boat. Shadows of the willow trees along the waterside become stretched, and the glow of the fish dim as the night sky descends before the enchanting Impression West Lake Show begins. Witnessing the West Lake Show is the perfect parting gift from Hangzhou. The beauty of the lake and its magical surroundings, combined with the setting of the stage on the fringes of the crisp water, creates a magical experience. Dancers appear as if they are gliding and jumping on the lake as the delightful music and lights are in tandem with their every move. The beautiful love story unfolds as perfectly as the flowers that grace the backdrop of its setting; making a memorable end to your stay in this serene city."
