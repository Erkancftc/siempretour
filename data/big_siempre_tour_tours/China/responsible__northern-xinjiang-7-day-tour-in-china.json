  "generalInfo": "This 7-day compact expedition offers a stunning introduction to Northern Xinjiang’s \"Sky Road.\" Starting from Urumqi, you will venture deep into the Tianshan Mountains, witnessing the geological miracle of the Duku Highway—a road that traverses four seasons in a single day.<br/><br/>Why choose this holiday?<br/><br/>The Highway of Legends: We prioritize your safety and experience on the Duku Highway. Unlike standard bus tours, our small-group format allows for flexible stops at hidden viewpoints like the \"Dragon’s Back\" of the Tianshan, ensuring you capture the landscape's raw beauty without the crowds.<br/><br/>Nomadic Encounters: You won't just see yurts from a distance; you will be welcomed into the summer pastures of local Kazakh families near Narat Grassland. Share a bowl of fresh milk tea, learn about their eagle-hunting heritage, and understand how they have coexisted with these mountains for centuries.<br/><br/>Glacial Serenity: From the sapphire waters of Heavenly Lake to the \"Atlantic's Last Tear\"—Sayram Lake, we allocate ample time for lakeside introspection, moving beyond the touch-and-go style of mass tourism.<br/><br/>Inclusive Dining: Whether you are vegan, vegetarian, or require Halal options, our local guides are experts in navigating Xinjiang’s meat-heavy cuisine to provide diverse, plant-based delights using fresh, locally sourced ingredients.",
