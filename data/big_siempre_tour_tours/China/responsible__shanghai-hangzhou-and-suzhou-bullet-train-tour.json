  "generalInfo": "Discover the timeless elegance of eastern China on this immersive 7-day private cultural journey through Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Suzhou—three cities that embody the perfect harmony of tradition and modernity. Begin in cosmopolitan Shanghai, where colonial-era grandeur along the Bund meets futuristic skylines at the Shanghai Tower. Wander through the classical Yu Garden, explore the leafy lanes of the Former French Concession, and uncover local life in the labyrinthine alleys of Tianzifang. Then, glide effortlessly to Hangzhou aboard a high-speed train to experience the poetic beauty of West Lake, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that has inspired artists for centuries. In Meijiawu Tea Village, meet local farmers, pick your own Dragon Well tea leaves, and learn the art of traditional stir-frying and brewing. The next day, witness Hangzhou’s innovative spirit at the Alibaba Creative Park and a vibrant local market before heading to Suzhou—the “Venice of the East.” Here, stroll through the exquisite Master of the Nets Garden, a masterpiece of classical Chinese landscape design, and wander Pingjiang Road’s ancient canals lined with teahouses and silk shops. Cap off your journey with a serene boat ride through Tongli Water Town, where stone bridges and whitewashed houses reflect centuries of Jiangnan charm. Designed with thoughtful pacing and authentic encounters, this tour blends luxury, culture, and sustainability: stay in handpicked boutique hotels, enjoy meals at local favorites (including Michelin-recommended spots), and travel with knowledgeable local guides who bring each destination to life. More than a sightseeing trip, this is an invitation to experience the soul of China’s most refined cultural corridor—where every garden, canal, and cup of tea tells a story of grace, resilience, and enduring beauty.",
