  "generalInfo": "China is home to some of the world's most incredible and unique wildlife. It is also a place that not everyone associates with wildlife. But there are some pockets of wilderness and some passionate guides willing to showcase some of China's hidden wildlife secrets.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>When people think of China they rarely think of wildlife and if they do think of Chinese animals that inevitably think of giant pandas. This one species is so iconic and so famous around the world that it is hard to imagine them as wild animals that live a life completely removed from people, but in recent years more and more giant pandas are living wild lives away from the disturbance of people. This is testament to fantastic conservation work and we will be hopefully benefiting from this conservation work as we enter a huge bamboo ecosystem in the mountains of one of the last remaining wild giant panda habitats. By hiking around in this forest we will be in prime panda habitat and will hopefully be rewarded with one of the rarest sights in nature.<br/>However this is only the first of three very different habitats we will be exploring, from the bamboo we will travel to the edge of the Tibetan plateau and to the rocky and rugged wilderness of Ruoergai where typical high altitude species such as Pallas’s cat and Chinese mountain cat live and then down into the forested mountains of Tangjiahe where musk deer, serow, gorals, badgers and bears live. We will spend a considerable amount of time exploring these habitats for wildlife and trying to see as many of these species as possible and hopefully get some rare species too.<br/>You will be experiencing rural China at the end of winter, this is a time of year and locations which are not often visited by tourists. Everything from the food, culture, architecture you will encounter will differ from the typical Chinese imagery that most people have when they thing of the superpower that China is nowadays and the ultra modern cities.<br/>This is a unique tour that explores part of China that are rarely visited and despite the below itinerary being detailed due to weather conditions the route and activities may vary once we get there, although we will endeavour to stick to the stated itinerary as much as possible. The most obvious deviation from the itinerary will come if a targeted species is been spotted in a location we are not in, but can get to.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Chengdu. There will be bottled or purified water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Sichuan. Your naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, guided walks, park entrance fees and spotlighting fees where mentioned on the itinerary. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around (including spotlighting every night we are allowed and there is the possibility of nocturnal wildlife); only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the Chinese forests, hillsides and grasslands. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>This tour can be booked in two different times of year (1) anytime between the middle of March and the middle of April (this is the breeding season of giant pandas and when they are more active) and (2) November, which is when the pandas move lower down the mountainsides to avoid the heavy snowfall, (subject to availability). <br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it.<br/>• We will stay in a variety of accommodation when on this tour, from well established wildlife eco lodges to guest houses and hotels deep inside national parks. <br/>• We will split our focus and activity depending on where we are and what we are looking for. For example we have great flexibility in changing the itinerary to take advantage of recently spotted wildlife.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our specialist tour for China's wildlife including Pallas' Cat, Giant Panda and other mammal species a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Sichuan and then rest of China so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the Golden Snub-nosed monkeys, Black-crested Gibbon, Siberian Crane, Pere-David's Deer and Black Snub-nosed monkeys and many more species. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of China at other times of year and focusing on other species such as Przewalski's horse and the Red Pandas and many other rare mammals of China. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour is centred around the province of Sichuan. It is here and only here there are areas of mountainous bamboo where which pandas inhabit. We also travel to the Tibetan Plateau which gives a remarkable contrast to the densely vegetated mountains of Tangjiahe.<br/><br/>Fitness levels required:<br/><br/>For the first half of the trip all of the wildlife watching activities in this itinerary will be on foot (particularly when looking for pandas); the terrain is hilly and the vegetation very thick. Getting around can be difficult and requires a good level of fitness and being used to hiking in hilly environments. When in the Tibetan Plateau the temperature needs to be taken into consideration, even in April there are still occasional snowstorms and so be prepared for cold temperatures. <br/><br/>Equipment list:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; but as a rule of thumb we recommend you bring along your own binoculars or spotting scope (spotting scopes are highly recommended) as well as appropriate clothing; which should be hard wearing clothing which is suitable for cold (sub-zero) temperatures. Comfortable and broken in waterproof walking boots with ankle supports are a must. Any medication, books or other items of a personal nature is of course up to you to bring along. Oh and please bring plenty of memory cards or film for your camera. Also do not forget sun cream, sun hat and sun glasses as the sun can be very strong here during the day.<br/><br/>Minimum age: 18 years old<br/><br/>Some images on this page are by:<br/>By Sepht - Own work, https://commons.wikimedia.org<br/>By Manyman, from Wikimedia Commons<br/>By Karin st, https://commons.wikimedia.org<br/>By Ksuryawanshi - Own work, https://commons.wikimedia.org",

Tangjiahe is a forested reserve and we will likely arrive there in the late afternoon and after dark we will have some spotlighting, there are many species that can be seen here including Chinese hog badger, Sichaun takin, Reeve’s muntjac, Himalayan palm civet, wild boar and northern leopard cat which can be seen at night. We will likely to get our hotel in the night and have a dinner before going back out into the park for spotlighting. (Breakfast, lunch and dinner)"

      "description": "Tangjiahe: Today is our last full day of wildlife watching and our only full day to explore the hillsides and forests of Tangjiahe. During the day we will be looking for wildlife such as squirrels, wild boar, Sichuan takins, Tibetan macaques and many species of birds, such as little forktails, brown dippers, crested kingfishers, black-throated tits and crested goshawks. One of our key targets here is the golden snub-nosed monkey. They used to be seen fairly regularly here, however last year they were only sighted on 25% of the trips here, but we will do what we can and March is a fairly good time for them. We will also head our after dark and spotlight for other nocturnal species. (Breakfast, lunch and dinner included)."
