  "generalInfo": "Ideal for families with teenagers, this adventurous holiday has plenty to keep everyone occupied.<br/>Start off at a lodge in the UNESCO World Heritage Drakensberg Mountains, for outdoor activities in stunning surroundings: hike to waterfalls, take a picnic on a mountain bike trail, zip line through the forest, or go horse riding.  <br/><br/>Move on to a lovely family-run lodge for rhino tracking on foot, nature trails, scoo-tours, battlefield tours and sundowners in stunning settings.  This is a very special place to be.<br/><br/>Then spend 3 nights on safari at an owner-run lodge on a private concession.  This is Big 5 territory, so game drives will provide the thrill of potentially seeing lion, elephant, rhino, buffalo and leopard - learn about the bush with your trained guide on day and evening safaris.  As well as game drives, the lodge offers the opportunity to become involved in conservation experience, including Priority Species Tracking and Rhino Horn Trimming.  (Subject to availability).<br/><br/>End your trip at a remote beach lodge: activities include kayaking, beach fat-biking, snorkelling - and at certain times of year, you may see turtles hatching and whales breaching off the coast.  The food at all lodges is superb - here the focus is on seafood - and the hospitality at a level you might expect from small, owner managed and run lodges.",

      "description": "Spend 3 nights at a remote beach lodge, tucked away on the furthest coast of Kwazulu-Natal, in iSimangaliso Nature Reserve. Getting there is not for the faint hearted, but it's all part of the adventure:, as it includes a 1-hour jeep transfer along sandy tracks to the lodge, which is set deep in dune forests above the endless sands of the beach. There are two pools, a dive centre, a blissful spa, and a superb al fresco restaurant and bar. Activities include spectacular snorkelling in the 'home reef' a short walk away, with prolific angelfish as well as turtles, shrimps, anemones and tiger cowries; kayaking (including guided kayaking excursions on Lake Sibaya), guided walks through the forest and turtle tours, with turtles laying their eggs on the beach and hatching between November and March, beach volleyball, cricket - and of course, relaxation."
