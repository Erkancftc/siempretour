Klaserie provides a sedate bush atmosphere, with personal and friendly service. Here you’ll go on safari in search of the big five, and there will be further opportunity to track leopards with our research team. <br/><br/>We know that it’s important to be able to plan your safari costs and avoid any hidden extras.

Eastgate Airport is the established gateway to the heartland of South Africas wildlife game viewing reserves and has three daytime flights arriving each day from Johannesburg, that are scheduled to assist international visitors to easily connect with Hoedspruit.. Many of our guests prefer us to arrange for their internal flight from Johannesburg to Hoedspruit (50 mins), or alternately for a scenic road transfer (approx 5 hours) which takes the hassle out of arranging the final leg of your journey and is a service that we offer our guests at cost price. Whether you choose to transfer by air or road the price is the same for singles or couples, however a road transfer is more cost effective for a small group or family travelling together. Whichever transfer you prefer you will arrive at Rukiya Safari Camp in time to settle in and rest and relax. Rukiya is a small luxury tented camp within the Wild Rivers Reserve and is a key area for our leopard research team. The camp nestles along the banks of the Blyde River among age old tress, a truly stunning location. Later in thew day, before the sun sets we’ll take a short stroll along the river bank and enjoy a sundowner, returning to the lodge for dinner."

This is an activity that we have developed over many years and has proven to be very popular with our safari guests. In a fun way it encourages you to use all of your senses when in the bush. Not just sight, but also smell, hearing and touch. Some of our senses are dulled by modern living, but this simple and fun exercise quickly hones one’s bush senses, ideal preparation for any safari."

We'd strongly recommend dining in house tonight at the Peech's very own restaurant before falling into your luxurious bed for a good night's sleep. The Peech has two restaurants: one for guests-only breakfast, lunch and dinner dining, and a brand-new fine-dining option: Basalt. The Peech is located in a 1950s, Art Deco-style building, built by the same family that still owns it now. James Peech (yes, that’s his real name and no, he wasn’t the inspiration for the Roald Dahl novel…) is still involved in daily operations. It’s since extended into a sixteen-room hotel, but still retains a lot of the character of a large family home. It’s in the Melrose North, one of the upmarket areas of Joburg’s northern suburbs and a very pleasant part of town to relax in. It also happens to be opposite one of Joburg’s most pleasant parks, the James and Ethel Grey Park, which has its own bird sanctuary. The Peech offers a bistro, a large outdoor pool, one acre of lush gardens, a library and nearby gym access. After many years of informally flying the flag of responsible business practice, both from a social and an environmental standpoint, The Peech was finally awarded the coveted Fair Trade in Tourism accreditation in 2010, making it one of the first hotels of its size in the country to get the award. This award acknowledges the efforts The Peech has made to make its operation sustainable both in terms of waste and water management, procurement and particularly in the way staff are paid and supported in their work. This will be your home away from home whilst in Johannesburg. Meal Inclusions: Breakfast Only"

A garden that is filled with natural and cultural highlights, wildlife and wild coasts, wine and a wonderful South African welcome, staying in charming and small, locally owned guesthouses along the way. <br/><br/>After settling in to Port Elizabeth, our first trip to Addo Elephant National Park is one of the finest introductions to South Africa’s incredible wildlife. Just a stone’s throw from the city you can take a game drive to see not only elephants but all of the Big Five. Another great national park exists further west, this time the coastal Tsitsikamma NP where the rugged bays, forests that line them and waterfalls that tumble down through them are worthy of national protection. <br/><br/>As well as the spectacular sandstone cliffs at Knysna Heads, other coastal crowning glories on this Garden Route holiday include Mossel Bay and Hermanus, both famously beautiful beach bliss but also for great for wildlife watching, with whales visible from land here during the migratory season August until November, and sometimes earlier if you are lucky. It is also one of South Africa’s most famous regions for wineries, and tastings of the Garden Route’s most famous produce are a must on this itinerary. <br/><br/>Cape Town is the last port of call on this holiday, with two full days to explore its culture, history and contemporary cool spots too. Sometimes referred to as the Mother City, she proffers an eclectic mix of places to see from the brightly coloured Cape Malay houses to the much more grim reality of Robben Island, now a fascinating museum. There is plenty of beach life too of course where you can watch the sun set over the ocean. And you can take your pick of those, with Cape Point being the end of the peninsula that separates the Indian Ocean from the Atlantic. <br/>",

Our activities in Cape Town will, to some extent, be dictated by the weather as visits to the top of Table Mountain, which has its own micro-climate, are determined by cloud cover and wind. Because of this often-temperamental weather, it is best not to prebook the cable car but to buy tickets on the spot (not included). Those staying in Cape Town post-tour may opt to visit Table Mountain later if the weather looks as though it may improve. There is also the option of visiting Robben Island on one of the days; however, we recommend you prebook Robben Island with us before the trip (but pay the tour leader locally). On one of the days, we head down the Cape Peninsula. We follow the Atlantic Seaboard past the areas of Camps Bay, Llandudno and Hout Bay to the Cape Point via Chapman’s Peak drive, if it is open. The highlight is our visit to the Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve, home to elands, bonteboks, springboks, wildebeest, baboons and ostriches. Rugged cliffs, unspoiled beaches, shipwrecks and beautiful flora are the main features of the reserve. We walk through the reserve for approximately two hours. We first head to the new lighthouse for the panoramic views, before following the pathway to the old lighthouse, which offers spectacular cliff views.

After visiting the Cape, we follow the coastline on to our next stop.

The seas around Cape Agulhas are very treacherous and have caused numerous shipwrecks, to help reduce fatalities the Cape Agulhas Lighthouse was built in 1848 and is the 2nd oldest working lighthouse in South Africa. From August to December Southern Right and Humpback Whales may be spotted along the coast - as they feed in the nutrient rich waters off the southern coast.

The Tugela River plunges spectacularly over the edge of the Amphitheatre wall, dropping around 800m through a series of five falls. There are over 130km of walking trails around the park-many of which are easy, half day strolls, through beautiful countryside of grassland dotted with patches of yellowwood forest and proteas set against the stunning backdrop of the Amphitheatre. Heading north we pass through small towns and villages, through Afrikaaner heartland, making our way to South Africa’s largest city, Johannesburg. Built because of the gold rush, the city has grown into one of the wealthiest cities in the world. We will be staying at a laid-back backpacker in a suburb of Johannesburg, where you can relax by the pool"

The animals know there is a structure, but as you are inside, and hidden from their view this is one of the most natural settings to watch them come to drink. Another option for a more adventurous exploration of the bush is to go out on foot with the camp’s guides and learn about tracks, spotting smaller animals like birds, insects and rodents. See the different prints and scat left behind by visitors of the bush and feel the heat, dust and sand while walking through this landscape. Bushwalking is always done in single file, guided by 2 armed rangers and only when they deem the situation safe. If you are an experienced horseback rider, this is also a way to see the bush up close and away from the usual open cars. Lastly, dirt bikes are an option in the dry season to cover some ground: again this will be guided by expert rangers and only when safe. Whatever you do: your lunch can again be either a picnic in the park or enjoyed in the shade of the camp while you rest during the heat of midday."

    "generalInfo": "This is a great opportunity to join up with resident naturalists in South Africa and track down some of the Northern Cape's most elusive species including: aardvarks, aardwolves, bat-eared foxes, pangolins and black-footed cats.<br/><br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching and especially mammal watching safari holidays all over the world. To develop our range of fantastic mammal watching holidays we have spent years searching the world’s best wildlife watching locations as well as visiting some seldom visited areas. As a result we have created some great itineraries with the combined help of our guides, local experts and scientists (who have helped develop the itineraries) studying various rare mammals. <br/><br/>When it comes to wildlife watching there are very few better destinations than South Africa with the lesser-visited Kalahari region, in the northwest, being absolutely no exception.<br/><br/>The Kalahari Desert is one of the largest semi-arid regions in the world and home to a variety of birds and mammals including many of the continent’s rarest species. The region is sectioned into national parks, private reserves and working game ranches. The low density of humans allows for a greater abundance of wildlife and because the land is so arid there is little vegetation to support the huge numbers of large herbivores that dominate South Africa's better known national parks. Without the large herds of antelope, zebra and gazelles there are less large predators which has led to bigger numbers of bizarre and unique species such as: aardvarks, aardwolves, brown hyenas and elephant shrews. <br/><br/>The suggested tour below will be guided by our professional local guides. We also have a great network of local guides in South Africa who have developed a great range of wildlife watching locations where the rarest species are commonly seen. To make the most of our time away we will spend many hours during the early morning and late afternoon on jeep safaris and guided walks. We will also explore after dark with high powered spotlights in order to catch a glimpse of animals that only come out at night. <br/><br/>Best time to visit:<br/><br/>Early August to late October, which is the dry season in the Kalahari, is the best time to go for wildlife watching. Temperatures can get hot however, you will have the best chance of watching wildlife congregating around watering holes as well as less vegetation blocking the view. <br/><br/>Accommodation:<br/><br/>Most of the accommodation that we use are privately owned bed and breakfasts and working ranches that are seldom visited by tourists. Many of these ranches have resident animals which are very hard to see elsewhere. For example we know of a location where a family of aardvarks have been living for some years now and offer an exceptional opportunity to watch this elusive animal in the least intrusive way possible.<br/><br/>Fitness level required:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from 4x4 safari vehicle. We can also include guided walks which can be for as long or as short as you wish; it's entirely up to you.<br/><br/>Minimum age: 18",

    "generalInfo": "Most people travel to South Africa for safaris only visit Kruger National Park, but South Africa has so much more to offer wildlife enthusiasts. This tour explores two of the little known gems of South African wildlife watching. Firstly we will visit the massive Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, being twice the size of Kruger (about the size of Switzerland) it is one of the largest protected areas in the world and home to some of Africa's best wildlife. After the lions, leopards, cheetah, eland and other large mammals of Kgalagadi we will explore some of the Kalahari. <br/><br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching and especially mammal watching safari holidays all over the world. To develop our range of fantastic mammal watching holidays we have spent years searching the world’s best wildlife watching locations as well as visiting some seldom visited areas. As a result we have created some great itineraries with the combined help of our guides, local experts and scientists studying various rare mammals.<br/><br/>When it comes to wildlife watching there are very few better destinations than South Africa with the lesser-visited Kalahari region, in the northwest, being absolutely no exception.<br/><br/>The Kgalagadi Transfrontier National Park is one of the largest wilderness national parks in the world and is home to a variety of birds and mammals including many of the continent’s rarest species. As well as safaris through the park you will also be taken to private reserves in the Kalahari. One of the best reasons the wildlife watching is great here is due to the low density of humans in the whole Kalahari. <br/><br/>The suggested tour below will be guided by our professional zoologist (zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) or expert local guide. We also have a great network of local guides in South Africa who have developed a great range of wildlife watching locations where the rarest species are commonly seen. To make the most of our time away we will spend many hours during the early morning and late afternoon on jeep safaris and guided walks. We will also explore after dark with high powered spotlights in order to catch a glimpse of animals that only come out at night.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary). We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers and game drives. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through South Africa (and elsewhere in Southern Africa). Your naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. Whilst the trip involves a lot of camps, these are not pitch your own tent camping camps, instead these are luxury tented camps where the tents are permanent and you do not need to bring any camping equipment or sleeping bags with you. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the Kalahari wilderness, night safaris are available in some locations (subject to the local conditions on that day). You will have to speak to your guide on arrival there and book places on these (this is not included). A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist guides as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it. We do our best to include as many wildlife activities as possible in all of our itineraries.<br/>• Depending on budget and interest we have a range of different accommodation packages to offer, from luxury top end lodges, national park safari lodges and mobile-camps which often offer unbelievable wildlife watching deep inside national parks as well as camping. We can also arrange mobile camping safaris of Botswana is very popular and all of your camping gear will be provided.<br/>• Spend all the daylight hours searching for wildlife and visiting various natural wonders and stunning landscapes.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our South Africa wildlife safaris a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Southern Africa so that we can try and find and observe some of the rarer and more elusive species. We have great itineraries and expertise in all Southern African countries (Namibia, South Africa, Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Mozambique) and can arrange trips to find some of the rarer species such as aardvarks, aardwolves, brown hyenas and black-footed cats among other species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Best time to visit:<br/><br/>Early August to late October, which is the dry season in the Kalahari, is the best time to go for wildlife watching.

    "generalInfo": "Sample the very best of South Africa and Swaziland on this fully escorted small group tour, as you travel from Johannesburg to Durban through Kruger National Park, Hlane Royal National Park and the wildlife-rich Saint Lucia Estuary. Your itinerary includes a couple of very special experiences: camping with the famous Black Mambas - the world's first all-female anti-poaching unit, and a boat safari with the chance to see hippos and crocodiles, a thrilling alternative to the traditional game drive. <br/><br/>Your first stop is a few days in the legendary Kruger National Park, home to some 150 species of mammal including the Big Five, 100 species of reptile and over 500 species of bird. But your first night here won’t be spent in a lodge or bush camp. Instead, you’ll stay at the HQ of the Black Mambas. This team of 36 young African women helps patrol the Balule Nature Reserve, part of Greater Kruger National Park, and as part of your introduction to their work, they’ll take you on a nighttime bush walk to help remove snares, and perhaps see some nocturnal wildlife. <br/><br/>After a day of game drives in Kruger, you’ll cross into Swaziland, and Hlane Royal National Park. Here you’ll be taken on a game walk with a brilliant Swazi guide to see huge herds of elephants and giraffes, with lions, leopards and hippos also present. After a night camping in the park you have the opportunity to visit a local village, unusual in that it has a female chief, to learn about Swazi culture and perhaps even lend a hand with some of the everyday farming activities.<br/><br/>Cross the border, then, back into South Africa, as your group makes for the Saint Lucia Estuary, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that provides habitat for hundreds of hippos and crocodiles. Two nights of camping here include a thrilling boat safari that offers a very different experience to traditional game drives, and a day trip to Cape Vidal. Depending on the time of year, you might spot migrating humpback whales off the coast, or see loggerhead turtles making the way up the beach to lay their eggs. <br/><br/>Finally reaching Durban, South Africa’s second city, bid farewell to your fellow travellers at this glamorous coastal destination.<br/>",

    "generalInfo": "Travel to Africa's safari heaven in the company of expert local guides as you track down the Big Five on foot and by 4x4 vehicle. This 11 day tailor made tour offers a chance to immerse yourself within the landscapes and animals of Kruger National Park.<br/><br/>There is nowhere else better in South Africa for safaris than Kruger National Park. This park was one of the world's first national parks (established in 1898) and is still currently one of the largest, covering over 20,000 km2. <br/><br/>The number of species present in Kruger is mind blowing: 336 trees, 49 fish, 34 amphibians, 114 reptiles, 507 birds and 147 mammals. During this tour we will try and see as many species as possible, concentrating, in the main, on mammals, such as: lions, leopards, cheetahs, elephants, rhinos and hippos, as well as ostriches and Nile crocodiles. Our escort for this tour has experience working in South Africa as well as other national parks around the world. We also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Kruger National Park. We also make the most of the expert guides that work for the park and head out on guided sunrise and sunset walks and spotlighting after dark. Coupled with full days spent driving in a 4x4 safari vehicle, this is the best way to experience Kruger in all its natural glory. <br/><br/>Even though Kruger is open all year there are some seasons that prove better for wildlife watching than others. Summer (Nov – Jan) is the rainy season where water fills the rivers and watering holes, resulting in the bushveld looking lush. Game viewing is sometimes a bit more difficult at this time because the vegetation is dense, making it bit harder to locate and observe wildlife. Towards the end of November and early December, Kruger National Park is filled with newborns, and spotting wildlife with their young is an incredibly rewarding experience. Birding is excellent during this time as the summer migrant birds arrive. However, it can get very hot during the day. The best time for wildlife watching is during the winter and spring (Jul – Oct). The bushveld is more open, allowing for better visibility. The grass is low, the bushes and trees are sparsely leaved and because it is so dry - with no rain - the wildlife migrate towards the water. Water holes, dams and rivers become a hive of activity and you are more likely to spot wildlife in the morning and evening as animals come to drink. The day temperatures in winter are pleasant but it can get quite chilly during the night-time so make sure you pack something warm when going on your afternoon/night game drives.<br/><br/>This tour only visits Kruger National Park but we stay in three very different sections. We will travel in and out of the nearest airport town of Nelspruit.<br/><br/>Recommended Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from the 4x4 safari vehicle so any fitness level can participate. Where guided walks are offered they will be taken at a slow pace and last no longer than an hour or so.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 years old",

        "description": ": Our full-day trip to Cape Peninsula begins with a scenic drive via the white-sand beaches of Fish Hoek, stopping to explore the small but important naval base of Simon's Town. Later, we'll arrive at Cape of Good Hope, allegedly named due to the optimism once felt by arriving colonial sailors having successfully navigated the Cape and discovering a sea route to the East. We'll take an hour-long walk within the national park to Cape Point and the lighthouse, keeping an eye out for resident baboons, tortoises, otters, and seabirds along the way. The trail is well marked, slightly rocky in places, and boasts diverse flora with many colourful flowers. We'll return to Cape Town via Hout Bay, an attractive fishing port once bordered by dense forest, hence its name, which translates as 'Wood Bay'. Here, we'll have the option of taking a short boat trip out to Seal Island - home to 1,000 Cape fur seals and guarded by the impressive, towering Sentinel Mountain. Alternatively, explore on dry land to see Hout Bay's active tuna, snoek and crayfish industry and find out why the town prides itself on offering some of the best fish and chips in the world."

        "description": ": This morning is free for you to explore Cape Town more at your own pace, and there are plenty of options for you to pick from. If you want to visit Robben Island, the former prison where Nelson Mandela was incarcerated, this morning is the best time to go. Please note, you'll need to book in advance (please see the optional activities section of visit www.robben-island.org.za). There are three departures per day, and the 9am departure is the best option to fit with our itinerary. Alternatively, the morning is also the best time to hike up Table Mountain. The favourable morning weather and temperatures make it a more enjoyable experience and you'll get breathtaking views over the Apostles, the Atlantic and the city below. The walk up to the viewpoint takes between three to four hours. There is also the option to take the aerial cable car to the top, which runs frequently to and from the summit, where a network of trails criss-crosses the plateau and provides a variety of vantage points. While it's possible to visit Robben Island and take the cable car to Table Mountain in the same day, you won't have time to visit Robben Island and hike up Table Mountain. If you'd like to do both, you can book a pre-trip stay to give yourself more time. Please also note that both of these activities are weather-dependent and windy weather may change things. Another option is to take a trip to the Kirstenbosch National Botanical Gardens, which claims to be the most beautiful garden in Africa and is devoted to the conservation of the Cape's indigenous species. Your Tour Leader will be able to give further local advice and recommendations on how to spend your time in Cape Town. Late this afternoon, we'll leave Cape Town and head to the scenic winelands of Stellenbosch where you can relax with a local Chenin Blanc Please note, both Robben Island and Table Mountain are weather-dependent. Table Mountain's cableway is closed for two weeks at the end of July for maintenance."

Consider visiting the University Botanical Gardens to learn about native plants, going curio shopping, or browsing the various galleries scattered throughout the town. Stellenbosch is world-famous for its wine, and there's no better way to experience this than by visiting one of the many vineyards in the area, which is exactly what we will do in the afternoon. Depending on the season, your Tour Leader will select a suitable vineyard where we can sample several local wines while immersing ourselves in the unique South African wine culture. Many of the estates feature spectacular gardens and farmland, providing opportunities for lunch and a leisurely stroll. There is also the option to take a guided tour of Stellenbosch Town, a great way to learn about the diverse cultures that have contributed to making Stellenbosch what it is today. As one of the oldest colonial settlements, this charming town boasts wide, oak-lined streets and beautiful whitewashed Cape Dutch architecture. You'll find many cafes, bars, and delis for lunch, most of which pride themselves on using local produce."

A 90-minute drive takes us to the Betty's Bay area where we'll have an included visit to Stony Point Nature Reserve. This reserve sits on the site of a historic whaling station and has a quiet, undiscovered feel, offering excellent penguin viewing without the crowds. The path can be followed over the craggy outcrops to see the resident seabirds up close without disturbing them. We then continue to our accommodation in central Hermanus. This afternoon is free to explore the coastal town. From June to November, Hermanus offers some of the world's best shore-based whale watching, with good opportunities to spot southern right, Bryde's and humpback whales. Although there is a good chance of seeing the whales from the water's edge in town, you may prefer to follow the coastal path to a better vantage point or join a boat trip excursion for a closer view. At other times of the year, you might like to spend the day exploring the galleries and museums in Hermanus, which are easy to discover on foot, or enjoying the coastal views from the 8km walking path that runs right along the cliff edge. This evening will be at your leisure, with a variety of excellent restaurants and wine bars to discover."

Now marked by a stone plaque, the 'Cape of Needles' was once the site of various shipwrecks and a grave point of danger for European travellers. We'll have a little free time to explore the magnificent monument. This afternoon, we continue towards Barrydale on the renowned Route 62 (one of the longest wine routes in the world). The Tradouw Pass (which means Women's Pass in the old Khoi language) is a 16 kilometre/10 mile-long drive, offering some of the most beautiful and rugged scenery in this region of South Africa. Barrydale is a scenic little place with the air of a Wild West frontier town about it. We'll stop here to break up our long drive to Oudtshoorn. If you have any time this evening or tomorrow morning, a walk around the backstreets reveals a couple of small art shops and some beautiful scenery. We have an included dinner tonight - local restaurants here have a big lunch trade but close around 5pm, so we'll enjoy some local food at our small hotel.

This seemingly empty plain is in fact home to vast numbers of ostrich, and we'll likely spot them in the farms that run alongside Route 62 as we drive. Oudtshoorn is the principal town in the Klein Karoo, which grew in the early 1900s thanks to its rich trade in ostrich feathers. We may have time to have a quick explore of the shops and the small curio museum before driving onto the huge limestone caverns of the Cango Caves. These caves are an underground network of extraordinary structures, millions of years old. The combination of dripping rainwater and limestone has led to the creation of ancient stalactites, stalagmites, and mighty rock columns. Allegedly, a local European farmer first discovered the caves late in the 18th century; however, there is research that proves the caves have been used by man as far back as the early Stone Age. After a visit to the caves, we drive on to our countryside lodgings for the evening."

At the small town of Sedgefield we'll stop at Swartvlei Beach where we'll have about an hour's walk along the wild and scenic coast with a guide from the Strandloper Project. This small project began in 2018 when a group of locals decided to organise a reef clean up to tackle the threats posed to the reef and native marine wildlife, from discarded fishing tackle. The project has expanded onto the land, and the volunteers now use microplastic collection data from the beach to lobby regional councils about their plastic waste. The walk on the beach is spectacular, and we'll learn not just about the project but also about the surrounding environment. After our visit here we continue our drive to Knysna Heads Viewpoint, where two limestone cliffs emerge from the Indian Ocean, side by side, protecting a lagoon that runs inland from the turbulent sea. We'll end the day in Plettenberg Bay, on the Indian Ocean. Today's total drive time is approximately three hours."

The hiking here is moderately graded, and good stability and fitness are both essential. Rewards for tackling the rocky terrain, sand dunes and occasional steep steps are great - sweeping coastal views, beautiful golden sands, and the possibility to spot dolphins and seals playing in the waters below. From July to December there's also the chance to spot the southern right whales that come into the calmer and warmer waters to calve and nurse their young. For those who don't want to undertake the 5.5km loop with the Tour Leader, there is a shorter 2km loop, or you could simply enjoy the fantastic views from the clifftops. After working up an appetite, we'll stop for a well-deserved lunch in Plettenberg Bay. Seafood is a favourite on the menu here - hake, meaty prawns or calamari washed down with a crisp white wine. Afterwards, the afternoon is free with the option to relax on the beach, shop for souvenirs or join a whale-watching excursion (in season)."

We'll be staying in the Storms River region. Timings today may vary depending on a number of factors, but there is the opportunity here to take a short but steeply-stepped walk to a series of three suspension bridges that overlook the mouth of Storms River as it reaches the sea. You may also like to try your hand at zip wiring (a short drive out of the national park), or an adventurous river kayaking trip up the Storms River (this involves a walk of approximately 20 minutes carrying your paddle, jacket and helmet - it's a stunning river paddle but not a leisurely activity!)

KwaZulu-Natal is an extraordinary region and abundant in tribal heritage and opportunities to watch wildlife in their natural habitat. <br/><br/>Exploring on two feet or two wheels is a great way to stretch your legs outside of your hire car with hiking and mountain biking in the Drakensberg just as immersive as snorkelling or deep sea fishing in the Indian Ocean.<br/><br/>The added incentive for families is that the KwaZulu-Natal region is malaria-free as well as allowing kids, and parents, to explore a less-visited province of South Africa away from the crowds along the coast.<br/><br/>Pick your points of interest and design a self drive holiday to suit you as this is an area of Africa that really does require closer inspection from a wide range of perspectives.<br/>",

The Drakensberg Mountains (a UNESCO World Heritage site), South Africa’s highest and most dramatic range, offer staggering scenery of basalt cliffs, grasslands, forests, and crystal-clear streams. The region is a paradise for outdoor enthusiasts—hiking trails lead to waterfalls, wildlife, and ancient San rock art sites that reveal the cultural history of the area. This itinerary uses an owner-run lodge that is situated in a truly romantic setting surrounded by mountains, creating a magical atmosphere. They look forward to welcoming guests with gourmet food, roaring log fires and luxurious farmhouse hospitality. Their emphasis on providing gastronomic standard cuisine is demonstrated in the hours they spend hunting down the highest quality ingredients. Dinner is a sumptuous 5-course affair with no effort or expense spared to give guests a memorable dining experience. A host talks you through every mouthful from pan to plate before you sit down to enjoy the culinary team's creations. Fresh ingredients are essential, and being able to pick from the gardens minutes before serving is a real pleasure. To work up an appetite, take a scenic drive in an open game viewer to explore the magnificent view from on top of the mountain, while horse rides are available for the more energetic. In the locality, explore the Rock Art at Kamberg, or superb hiking can be done on the Reserve."

    "generalInfo": "This Kwa Zulu Natal self drive holiday takes you through one of South Africa’s most fascinating regions, historically and culturally but also one of its most beautiful. With a combination of the Drakensberg Mountains and Elephant Coast, with its empty beaches and subtropical forests, you will have the most stunning journey. <br/><br/>Following our carefully crafted itinerary, but travelling independently in your own hire car, we will book all the accommodation you need to fit in with your schedule, staying at quality hotels and guesthouses with which we have years of experience.  We can, of course, tweak the itinerary to suit your interests and time frame. <br/><br/>Kwa Zulu Natal is South Africa’s secret gem, with first timers often heading for The Garden Route. Which is stunning of course, however this holiday is perfect for those coming back to South Africa for a second time and wanting to explore a new region. Or for those who are first timers, but with more of a penchant for off the beaten path adventure. <br/><br/>The trip starts in The Midlands, the rolling hills at the base of the Drakensberg Mountains which are home to a fine array of artists, artisan producers and, of course, wineries. You will have plenty of opportunities to sample the fine local fare at your accommodation , Hartford House and later at Montusi Mountain Lodge, also nestled in the in the ‘Berg’. The Drakensberg Mountains, and foothills, are of course a great location for hitting the hiking trails. <br/>Moving on to The Battlefields of the Anglo-Zulu Wars, you can take a memorable guided tour around this area where, in 1879, the British army invaded Zululand and found themselves face to face with thousands of Zulu warriors.  <br/><br/>Your next stop is all about nature, however, although not without its battles, with South Africa’s wildlife having had a history of endangerment, and Phinda Private Game Reserve is one of many examples of organisations that have contributed massively towards wildlife conservation. Spend several days here, staying in a safari lodge, enjoying game drives and safaris under the guidance of an expert ranger.<br/><br/>From Phinda’s elephants to the Elephant Coast, where most people go in search of the Indian Ocean and idyllic beaches rather than elephants these days.  And the beaches certainly are colossal, particularly at Thonga Beach Resort where you will stay for three nights revelling in coastal bliss but also taking in some of the marine wildlife wonders. These include the endangered leatherhead turtle which nest here between November and March.  In general, however, the best time to visit Kwa Zulu Natal is between April and August. <br/>",

This program takes you on an educational journey around the impact that photography can have on the nonprofit sector. It’s a unique and immersive way to visit South Africa, and a great way to challenge yourself as a photographer and greatly enrich your portfolio. Applications are now open! <br/><br/>This program will take you to the South African town of Stellenbosch, just outside of Cape Town; a stunning area and a great base for our photography work.

We'll be working with impactful projects working in education, skill development, female empowerment, food security, animal welfare, and more. <br/><br/>As a nonprofit photographer, your images are important to the nonprofit organizations you’ll be working with, as they usually don't have strong visual media to tell their stories. By providing them with a database of strong images, we help them raise awareness for their cause, and reach potential donors. Visual storytelling can be key in an organisation's success.  <br/><br/>You'll receive constant tutoring by Anna Lusty, a professional photographer specialised in humanitarian photography. She'll provide both theoretical and practical workshops that cover all the elements of nonprofit photography, so that you'll be well prepared and fully supported. <br/><br/>To join this nonprofit photography workshop, you'll need to have a good camera and intermediate photography skills.

        "description": "Arrival at Hoedspruit & Welcome to Rukiya Hoedspruit (Eastgate) Airport is the gateway to South Africa’s premier wildlife viewing reserves, with daily flights arriving from Johannesburg and Cape Town. We can arrange your internal flight to Hoedspruit (approximately 50 minutes). Upon landing, you'll be greeted by your On Track Safaris (OTS) representative and transferred to Rukiya Safari Camp. Keep an eye out as you drive past game fences—your first wildlife sightings may happen before you even unpack! No matter how you arrive, you'll reach Rukiya Safari Camp in time to settle in, unwind, and enjoy the tranquil surroundings. You’ll also receive a reusable On Track Safaris metal water bottle to help reduce plastic use during your stay, along with a spoor card to help identify animal tracks during game drives and bush walks—be sure to keep it handy! Rukiya is a small, luxury eco-tented camp nestled along the banks of the year-round Blyde River, shaded by towering trees. It’s also an important location for our leopard research, making your visit part of a meaningful conservation effort. Depending on your arrival time, lunch will be served, followed by an optional afternoon drive through the Wild Rivers Reserve. Don’t forget to order your sundowner drinks for the perfect end to your first day. At Rukiya, you’ll receive a complimentary camera trap (one per couple or single guest) as a gift from On Track Safaris. On your first day, with guidance from our expert team, you’ll choose a location on the reserve where you believe leopards and other wildlife may pass. These motion-sensitive devices capture photos or short videos of animals—day or night—offering a thrilling glimpse into their natural behaviour. Camera Trap Challenge Capturing Africa’s wildlife with a camera trap is both exciting and deeply rewarding. Begin by selecting a location frequented by animals—such as watering holes, game trails, or mineral licks—where wildlife naturally congregates. While our guides are there to assist, the final choice is yours. Your camera will be securely mounted to a tree or post at animal height and angled slightly downward for optimal shots. Equipped with infrared technology, it operates silently to avoid disturbing nocturnal creatures. The camera will run continuously throughout your stay, capturing candid moments of Africa’s untamed beauty. These will be checked before departing Rukiya. After dinner at the lodge, you’ll likely retire early to your tent, ready for your first early morning rise and the adventures ahead."

You'll then set off on a morning game drive through the Wild Rivers Reserve and into the adjacent Balule Reserve, part of the Greater Kruger National Park. This marks your first adventure in a 'Big5' Reserve. These drives may extend longer than usual, often including a bush breakfast served in the wild, before returning to the lodge in the late morning. Lunch is served at the lodge, followed by time to unwind and take in the tranquil views from your private deck. Bush Senses Experience During your stay, you'll have the chance to participate in our unique Bush Senses activity—a short guided walk paired with a sensory exercise developed over many years. This popular experience encourages you to engage all your senses in the bush: not just sight, but also smell, hearing, and touch. In a world where modern living dulls our natural instincts, this simple and fun activity helps sharpen your awareness—perfect preparation for any safari. Conservation & Camera Trap Check You’ll also be invited to attend a fascinating presentation by the Ingwe Leopard Research Team, offering insight into the vital conservation work happening right on the reserve. In the afternoon, your PM drive will explore the Wild Rivers Reserve, possibly passing by your camera trap to ensure it’s still in place. Curious hyenas and baboons are known to tamper with these devices—sometimes even taking selfies before abandoning them in the bush. The resulting photos are often hilarious and a highlight of the trip. Evening at the Lodge After your afternoon adventure, dinner will be served at the lodge, offering a chance to reflect on the day’s sightings and stories under the African sky."

After a peaceful breakfast, a short transfer brings you to African Shark Eco-Charters, where an unforgettable experience awaits: shark cage diving in the heart of Cape Town’s wild waters. Choose from the early 07:30 thrill or the more relaxed 11:30 departure. After a warm welcome and expert briefing, you’ll set off on a 3.5-hour adventure guided by an enthusiastic and highly experienced crew. Muffins, fresh fruit, snacks, and hot drinks keep you fueled while you suit up with top-tier scuba gear for a safe, awe-inspiring face-to-face with the ocean’s apex predators. After your return, wind down with a transfer back to your boathouse. The rest of the day is yours. Meander through the quaint charm of Simon’s Town, perhaps dining at local gems like The Lighthouse Café or Bertha’s. As evening falls, take a slow stroll along the shoreline, where the sunset paints the sea in fire and gold."

This tour is a great combination of all three – with a chance to visit eSwatini, too. It starts in Johannesburg and ends in the Kruger.<br/><br/>South Africa has some of the largest and most wildlife-heavy safari destinations in the world. The highlight of this tour is the unmatchable Kruger National Park, where animal lovers will be in heaven. You’ll also visit Africa’s largest rhino population in Hluhluwe iMfolozi.

This is one of the world’s last absolute monarchies ruled by a king who has bene in power since 1986. In eSwatini you’ll get a change to visit Mlilwane, where an absence of dangerous animals means that you can do walking safaris.

        "description": "After breakfast you'll be saying goodbye to the beautiful Northern Cape. Chris will meet you for your 4 hour guided drive to the coast, south of Nieuwoudtville, to the beachfront town of Paternoster just in time for lunch at The Sandstone. After enjoying the spectacular views at The Sandstone, Chris will transfer you to Saldanha Bay Yacht club to meet, Edwin (your guide for the afternoon). From here you will embark on a 3 hour guided tour of Saldanha Reserve. Edwin is an environmentalist and nature conservationist and was the manager of SAS Saldanha Provincial Nature Reserve for 16 years before his retirement in 2016. He is a qualified facilitator and moderator as well as a photographer being involved with nature and fynbos the past 24 years and is also a registered professional guide. He also belongs to a wing of SANBI (South African National Botanical Institute) CREW (Custodians for Rare and Endangered Wildflowers). During flower season each year he organises groups to search, monitor and keep record en collect seeds of these plants in order to try to stop them going extinct. Edwin's also written an e-book on the Fynbos species flowers, and is currently busy with an e-book on the West Coast National Park flowers. After the tour, Chris will transfer you to the Strandloper Ocean Boutique Hotel, where you can check-in and get settled before dinner. The following day, you'll take a driven and walking tour of the West Coast National Park and hopefully the Postberg section (permits permitting). Overnights for this section will be at the Strandloper Ocean Boutique Hotel. Meal Inclusions: Breakfast Strandloper Ocean Boutique Hotel (3 Nights) Strandloper Ocean Boutique Hotel is a retreat, a place of calm that is completely private and secluded. It is so much more than a hotel. Strandloper is a philosophy of being in harmony with nature and blending in with the delicate beauty of the surroundings. Fall in love with this Boutique Hotel where shoes are optional and relaxation is unavoidable. Barefoot Luxury at its absolute finest! Here, heaven meets earth on the shores of the Atlantic. It is not just another place, it is another world. The 16 exquisite rooms and suites are a fusion of beach style and contemporary luxury. Organic lines, hues and textures create an overall feeling of simplicity. Each room or suite has its own courtyard or terrace with wide doors that open out onto breathtaking views of sky, sand, sea and space. Dinner this evening is booked at Wolfgat Restaurant. Wolfgat Restaurant Wolfgat offers a unique dining experience showcasing a selection of indigenous ingredients specific to this coastal location. Drawing inspiration from the surrounding landscape and its dramatic seasonal transformation, Kobus van der Merwe’s signature Strandveld food menu* comprises a series of tasting dishes presented in seven courses. Sustainable seafood, local lamb and venison, and seasonal veldkos is featured, enhanced by wild herbs, seaweeds from the local rock pools, and pickings from the garden. Some of the elements on the tasting menu take weeks of preparation, while other ingredients are handpicked on the day for the exact number of bookings received. Today, Chris will pick you up for the 1 hour drive to !Khwa ttu. You''ll be spending the day at the fascinating and beautifully designed 'embassy of the San people', !Khwa ttu. You'll go on two morning and one informative afternoon tour, exploring the botanical knowledge of the ancient San people and their traditional lifestyles while enjoying the beautiful surroundings of the veld and it’s fauna and flora. The first tour starts at 10:00 am. Enjoy wholesome, freshly prepared and locally sourced food, inspired by the San’s way of foraging, in their restaurant at lunch time. The meal is included as part of the tour. Top it all off with a drink and enjoy the breathtaking view of the West Coast... At !Khwa ttu we tell the story of human kind: The Story of the San, told in their own words... !Khwa ttu's story begins with Irene Staehelin. In 1998, the Working Group for Indigenous Minorities in Southern Africa (WIMSA) decided that the San needed assistance in unlocking potential tourism opportunities and showcasing San culture to the world. They turned to Swiss anthropologist Irene Staehelin, who agreed to help. In 1999, guided by her own vision, and inspired by heritage centres in the USA and Canada, Irene bought an 850 hectare wheat farm, on the West Coast of South Africa for the !Khwa ttu project. Irene later set up the Ubuntu Foundation in Switzerland, to help guide and support the project. !Khwa ttu opened to the public in 2006. In the following decade, inside the now restored farm buildings, it steadily developed its tourism offering and San development capabilities. Outside, the land was carefully rehabilitated and wildlife reintroduced. In September 2016 Ubuntu committed a substantial portion of the funding needed to build !Khwa ttu’s San Heritage Centre. This paved the way to fulfilling the dreams of many, and launched the next exciting stage of !Khwa ttu’s development. Meal Inclusions: Breakfast & Lunch Dinner this evening is booked at The Noisy Oyster. Again, the reception team at your hotel can arrange a transfer for you to and from the restaurant. Noisy Oyster Restaurant The Noisy Oyster is a well-loved restaurant located in the charming coastal village of Paternoster. Known for its quirky, laid-back vibe, the restaurant offers a unique and colorful dining experience with a focus on fresh, locally sourced seafood. The Noisy Oyster Restaurant: +27 (0) 22 752 2196 This morning you will embark on a full day tour of West Coast National Park. Chris will pick you up for the 40-minute drive, where you will meet your guide, Edwin, at the West Coast National Park Gate. The park is particularly well known for its bird life and for the spring flowers which occur in the months from August to September, especially in the Postberg flower reserve section of the park. Tonight, enjoy refined and contemporary West Coast Cuisine at Die Strandloper Ocean Boutique Hotel for dinner. Today, Chris will collect you at 9:00 am and drive you south to the Cape Peninsula. You'll have a chance to visit the Tienie Versfeld Nature Reserve on the way and then drive along the stunning coastal drive of Chapman's Peak and visit the villages of Llandudno, Hout Bay and Muizenberg on the way to your lodging for two nights, A Boat House in Simonstown. Meal Inclusions: Breakfast A perfectly positioned triple story guest house nested high up on the side of the mountain in the heart of the exclusive Simonkloof community of Simonstown. The guest house overlooks the yacht basin, harbour & the beautiful False Bay coastline All the rooms, which are decorated in a fresh coastal blend of blues and whites, open up onto a sheltered but sun-bleached and private deck, large enough for two sun loungers and a coffee table in most cases. You’ll love the attention to detail: really cleverly positioned reading lamps, proper coffee making equipment and a real fridge all set off with top-notch bed linen and upholstery throughout. Unlike some of the Simonstown mansions, A Boat House has it all: the views and tranquillity of the mountainside but genuinely walking distance from the town’s largely intact Victorian main street and ample parking. A Boat House is almost entirely off grid for electricity with a solar array. Today, Dominic Chadbon will meet you again and take you on a hike through the Cape Point Nature Reserve, the ragged dagger of rock at the south western-most tip of Africa where you can expect to share the beaches with penguins, ostriches, zebra and gemsbok as well as see a whole different collection of flowers from the Cape Floral Kingdom. Dinner at The Lighthouse Café After your busy day you've got a table at The Lighthouse Cafe booked. The Café has a beautiful ambience; it is an inviting space, light & airy with a French Provençal and Coastal feel which makes one feel right at home. The Café style menu is refreshingly short, although providing ample choice and variety for everyone’s taste buds, including some specials of the day. Dishes are freshly prepared by well trained staff who have a passion for food and servers are selected for both their ability to interact with customers and understanding the value of excellent service. The wine list, although small, has a very good range of wines, customers can bring their own, corkage charged. Excellent service, high standard of fresh food in a lovely setting is what The Lighthouse Café is all about! The Lighthouse Café +27 (0)21 786 9000 Cape Winelands This morning, you'll be taken on a guided drive inland from Simonstown, heading north east into the Cape Winelands. Despite the name, the Winelands are about far more than just wine: the region pours (pun intended) with creativity and history, particularly in the realm of food. The scenery is also stunningly beautiful and the range of olives, chocolate, port, brandy, cheese, fruit are world-class and form a major part of the country’s exports. There are over eight winelands towns (all very pretty and different from one another), numerous villages and in excess of 1800 wine estates. We have never met anyone who has been to all of them! You''ll start the day in Stellenbosch which is a large town with a quaint historic centre, hosting as it does one of the country's most prestigious universities. For lunch, head to Man'oushe which is situated on the effervescent Andringa Street in central Stellies, Manouche is part theatre, part restaurant - Lebanese people have been part and parcel of the South African make-up for decades, first arriving into Johannesburg in the 1940s and 50s and their cuisine and culture has had no small influence on food across the country.? Combine this with the amazingly fresh ingredients that the winelands soil can produce and you realy have a winning formula. We think that one of the best examples of the noise, fun and joie de vivre of Beirut is this place, so if you’re up for a Middle Eastern cultural taste experience, then Man’oushe is the place to visit. We would recommend asking your waiter which speciality dishes are on the menu and then go for one of them - our personal favourite is Kibbeh Nayyeh. Consider spending your afternoon exploring Stellenbosch Botanical Garden, located in the heart of Stellenbosch. (Where for us, at least, the highlights are the tree ferns and succulent collection). It's the oldest university botanical garden in South Africa, established in 1922, and is renowned for its diversity of plant species, beautiful layout, and tranquil atmosphere. You'll end the day at the historic, Oude Werf (B&B), your dinner venue for tonight (table booked for 6:00 pm) and accommodation for the next two nights. Meal Inclusions: Breakfast Oude Werf Hotel | 2 Nights Oud Werf Hotel (B&B) Situated on arguably one of the most elegant streets in the old part of Stellenbosch, the Oude Werf’s frontage displays a refined and subdued 18th century frontage to its visitors. Incredibly, this building was originally thatched and burned down twice in its history, before starting its life as a hotel in 1973 under the ownership of Gerhard Lubbe (who now owns the Montagu Country Hotel, also featured in this guide). Once inside, you’ll discover that there’s a lot more to this building than meets the eye: the current owners, the Petousis family who also own The Vineyard and The Townhouse, featured in this guide, have made a big show of the double volume reception area: resplendent with all its original carved wood accoutrements, it has been completely opened up at the rear to showcase the modern wing of the hotel – so often these extensions to beautiful old buildings simply don’t work but not so in this case. Set around a courtyard that is also home to a small pool, the hotel offers several different types of room, all totally different to each other but still in keeping with one another. You can choose from rooms in the oldest part of the building (wonderfully high ceilings, big casement windows but close to the street) or more modern rooms in the new wing (facebrick walls, big sliding windows onto decked verandas and balconies). The location of the Oude Werf is really what sets it apart – staying on a wine estate in the Winelands is fine, but being able to walk from your front door to art galleries, restaurants, coffee shops and the university just adds a whole other level of enjoyment and intrigue. Today you'll hike in the Jonkershoek Nature Reserve (Full Day) with Dominic Chadbon a.k.a. The Fynbos Guy. Chris will arrange a pick up time with you. Located just outside Stellenbosch, the reserve is known for its rugged mountains, lush fynbos, and diverse wildlife. Jonkershoek offers a variety of trails that cater to different levels of fitness and experience. Lunch is part of the hike. Meal Inclusions: Breakfast & Lunch Dinner at Delaire Graff Savour impeccably plated, creative bistro favourites with a South African touch paired with peerless wines in a breathtakingly beautiful setting. Dinner at Delaire Graff +27 (0)21 885 8160 Today sees you a short drive away in Franschhoek, perhaps the most touristy village of the Cape Winelands, but exceptionally beautiful and well kept. Here the focus is all about gastronomy at an exceptional standard and during your time here you'll sample some of the best food and wine to be found in the country. Franschhoek is packed full of things to see and do, meaning you’d need years to do them all (and that’s why many visitors come back year after year): of course the main attraction is the fact that this is gourmet capital of South Africa and so one can literally walk/stagger up and down the main street eating, drinking and then eating some more from dawn to dusk. Chris will pick you up from Oude Werf Hotel in the morning. You'll also have time to soak up the amazing scenery by going on another guided hike with Dominic through the Mont Rochelle reserve. (Full Day) Lunch is included as part of the hike. After the hike, take some time to relax and freshen up before heading out for dinner. Accommodation is at Avondrood, a guesthouse created from a historic building in this tranquil village. Meal Inclusions: Breakfast & Lunch Avondrood Guesthouse (B&B) Avondrood is a guesthouse located in one of Franschhoek’s many colonial-era farmsteads. You’ll love the huge wooden planks of the floors, the heavy beams in the ceilings and the size of the rooms behind their double sash windows. Extensively (but sensitively) renovated over the years, Justin (manager) and staff have turned the building into an eight bedroom B&B, which is four-star graded. You can make use of the pool, the jacuzzi and the lovely gardens which are sizeable for a town. It’s a delightfully tongue-in-cheek place: you’ll feel the owners’ sense of humour coming through in all sorts of ways, such as the bright red baby elephant at the poolside (who matches the sunlounger cushions!) Dinner at Le Bon Vivant Food at Le Bon Vivant is an experience. A table is booked for you. Passionate about palate perfection and impeccable presentation, chef-patron Pierre Hendricks and his team invite you on a journey of bold flavours and combinations. Pierre's profound understanding of the art of French cuisine forms the basis for Le Bon Vivant's modern interpretations of classic dishes. Dinner at Le Bon Vivant +27 (0)21 876 2717 Kogelberg Today you're going on a beautiful scenic drive for the first half of today: once you leave the Winelands, you'll travel south along the coast of False Bay, to Gordon's Bay and along Clarence Drive where if you're lucky, you'll get to see whales and their calves frolicking in the Indian Ocean waters below. You'll enter the Kogelberg Biosphere, an internationally recognised area of huge botanical and biological importance to the planet's biodiversity. Dominic will meet you to take you on a guided hike in Kogelberg Nature Reserve for the afternoon. Lunch will be part of the hike. Kogelberg is part of the Cape Floral Region, a UNESCO Work Heritage Site, and is home to over 1,880 plant species, many of which are endemic. The fynbos vegetation here is particularly diverse and includes iconic plants like proteas, ericas, and restios. Wildlife in the reserve includes various small mammals, reptiles, and birds. You might encounter animals such as klipspringers, dassies (rock hyrax), and even elusive Cape leopard. Birdwatchers will enjoy spotting species like the Cape sugarbird and orange-breasted sunbird. Meal Inclusions: Self-Catering Hamper Oudebosch Eco Cabins | 2 Nights You're staying right inside the Kogelberg Nature Reserve where Cape Nature, the organisation that manages the reserve, hosts its collection of eco-cabins. These wonderful buildings called the Oudebosch Eco Cabins have been specially designed to fit unobtrusively inside the splendidly verdent valley and additionally, are entirely constructed from sustainable materials and emitting as few emissions as possible in their design. Today you are free to hike the Oudebosch Harold Porter Trail. For breakfast, lunch and dinner you will enjoy the selection of delicious home-made foods from the self-catering basket that we have arranged for you. Meal Inclusions: Self-Catering Hamper Overberg This morning you're in for a treat: Chris will pick you up at Oudebosch and drop you at the diminutive but exceptionally diverse Fernkloof Nature Reserve in Hermanus. Here you'll be met by one of the volunteers and shown around the reserve for the morning. Lunch will be at The Wine Glass in Hermanus. The rest of the afternoon is yours to enjoy Hermanus at your leisure. Hermanus is a large coastal town, most famous for its cliff face sea frontage and the fact that the annual whale migration of Southern Right whales ends here every year. The whales (so called because in the days of whaling they were considered the ‘right’ whale to catch due to their good meat, skin and fat) normally get to our shores around August to November every year to calf. If you have the energy, we'd suggest a walk through the Walker Bay Nature Reserve on the other side of town. It's miles and miles of totally untouched beach and coastal dune forest, giving you the impression of being the last human on earth. Dinner is tonight at The Thatch House Restaurant. Accommodation for this evening is at lagoon-side The Thatch House (B&B). Meal Inclusions: Breakfast The Thatch House | 1 Night The Thatch House (B&B) Offering a refined sense of home, The Thatch House Boutique Hotel has seven large luxurious suites, in - and outdoor living areas, and lovingly-manicured sprawling gardens that are coupled with our renowned service and facilities. With relaxation a priority for guests, their team is on-hand to assist with even the smallest of arrangements. Today you'll be taken further east into the outer reaches of the Overberg, staying in the splendid De Hoop Nature Reserve. On the way, you'll be able to call in at the historic villages of Stanford and Elim and if there's time, Cape Agulhas. Or maybe even visit Grootbos Florilegium. We would recommend the De Hoop Potberg trail in the afternoon For dinner we have made a booking at The Fig Tree at De Hoop Collection for every night of your stay. Dinner is included. You've three nights staying at De Hoop Collection. Meal inclusions: Breakfast & Dinner De Hoop Collection | 3 Nights De Hoop Collection De Hoop Nature Reserve is one of the largest (340km2) natural areas managed by Cape Nature. It boasts a wealth of marine, bird, animal and rare plant species and is particularly unusual in being able to offer a large variety of endemic marine, fresh water and terrestrial animals and birds, all in one park. On top of this, it is packed with exciting adventures and activities to do inside the park. The river holds a great deal of significance in the area, starting 400km north of the coast in the mountain town of Ceres, winding its way through the Karoo until the coast and irrigating the many farms and vineyards on the way – it’s the lifeblood of the region in so many ways and is navigable by boat over 150km inland. The river teams with fish and surrounding bird life but meanders slowly through the countryside. There is hiking, bike trails, game watching, eco quad biking, whale watching among other activities all to be enjoyed in this one of a kind nature reserve. When en it’s time for lunch then we recommend you try the newly renovated offering, the Shed, also known as the Fig Tree Restaurant. Next to the main Opstal in the reserve. Enjoy a chilled glass of wine underneath the shaded terrace overlooking the De Hoop Nature Reserve. You’re staying in the Opstal Manor whilst you’re here. The Fig Tree Restaurant offers a full a la carte menu for breakfast, lunch and dinner. This remote eatery will surprise you with a sophisticated menu and flavours: the head chef is Marcia Tyobeka who brings a broad set of South African cuisines to her food, having trained across the country for many years. The staff are all locally sourced and trained from scratch in keeping with the De Hoop Reserve’s ethical HR policy. Meal Inclusions: Breakfast & Dinner This morning you'll have the opportunity to go on a guided interpretative marine walk along the pristine coastline. A walking trail exploring coastal rock pools and sandy beaches while a qualified guide points out interesting marine life forms. Also a great way to experience the Southern Right Whales in the bay between June and December. Depart an hour before low tide from the meeting tree. Times of daily low tide should be confirmed with the guides the day before. Please book at reception. In the afternoon, adventure out to the cliffs of Potberg Mountain to view endangered Cape Vultures – the Western Cape’s last surviving colony of these amazing birds. Depart from the Opstal Area in the morning (times vary according to seasons) with your guide for a scenic drive through endangered fynbos. Once at Potberg, you''ll hike (+-1 hour) up to the Vulture Deck to watch the vultures swoop and soar above. Please note that an amount of R295 per person for the interpretive marine walk and R595 per person for the vulture experience will be added to your room account and to be settled on departure. Meal Inclusions: Breakfast & Dinner Today you'll have a free day at De Hoop Collection. Enjoy your own walks along the well-marked trails through the reserve. Meal Inclusions: Breakfast & Dinner Swellendam Today you've a short drive of less than an hour from De Hoop to Swellendam, a beautiful Victorian-era town, where the streets are broad and lined with flowering jacarandas. Chris will pick you up from De Hoop. For the morning, you can either just stroll through the town, enjoying the many ateliers, plant nurseries, cafes, shops and heritage buildings. Or you might like to take a walk in the local Marloth Nature Reserve, an oasis of waterfalls, ponds and streams set in verdant, virgin forest just outside the town. It offers four main hiking trails (none too strenuous). Named after the pioneer South African botanist Rudolf Marloth who, in 1928 together with a group of Swellendam residents, petitioned the Minister of Lands and Forestry to set aside part of the mountain as a nature reserve. Over the years the reserve has been enlarged to include the remainder of the State Forest and subsequently the Swellendam hiking trail was opened. Most of the trails lead into the depths of the indigenous forest where you can explore the many rock pools and waterfalls along the way. For lunch at 12:30, enjoy excellent cuisine at Tredici. From quick bites prepared with love and attention, to a delicatessen stocked with baked goods that took as long as 36 hours to prepare. Chris will take you on a guided one and a half hour drive from Swellendam to Worcester. On the way there you'll be spending a few hours at the Karoo Desert National Botanical Garden just outside Worcester where you'll be shown round by a knowledgeable local guide, Maria Van Der Westhuizen. She is a qualified horticulturist and completed the tour guide training a few years ago. It cultivates and displays a wide variety of arid and semi-arid plants. The 154 hectare Garden lies at the foot of the Hex River Mountain range, 120 km north of Cape Town. The price for the guided tour is R120 per person which includes the garden admissions. You can pay this amount upon arrival. Please take note that they do not accept cash, only card payments. After the tour Chris will take you to your accommodation in Worcester.

Here you will embark on a thrilling Elands River trail hike, led by your guide, Justin Hawthorne. You'll enjoy a selection of delicious sandwiches for lunch that we have arranged for you. Justin is a professional mountain & nature guide. He began guiding professionally in 2014, focusing on the Fynbos, Forest as well as Succulent Karoo biomes. His primary area of guiding is within the Table Mountain National Park and areas within a day trip from Cape Town. He is currently completing his National Diploma in Nature Conservation through UNISA. He grew up in the Silvermine section of Table Mountain National Park and was exposed to the wonders of our natural environment from a young age by his parents. His father worked as a conservationist for SANParks. Justin started by becoming a volunteer guide for youth groups, before venturing into guiding as a career. After the hike, Chris will transfer you to your accommodation for the evening, Dunstone Country Estate (B&B) A table is booked at 6:30 pm for dinner at The Stone Kitchen on Dunstone Country Estate Dunstone Country Estate | 1 Night Dunstone Country Estate Dunstone Country Estate is a picturesque, guest house and boutique winery in Wellington. Situated at the foot of the Bainskloof pass, just an hour’s drive from Cape Town. Darling Today you're en route to Darling, the wonderfully named town that's become colonised in the best possible way by Pieter Dirk-Uys (a national living legend) and Darling Brew, the exceptional beer company located here. After a delicious breakfast at Dunstone Country Estate, Chris will pick you up at 10:00 am for a one hour drive to Darling. At 12:00 pm, get a revised history lesson from South Africa's most famous white woman, Evita Bezuidenhout, as she presents her sidesplitting, satirical stand-up Tannie Evita Praat Kaktus (Auntie Evita Talks Cactus) at her famed and beloved theatre, Evita se Perron, in Darling. For over 20 years, author, actor and activist Pieter-Dirk Uys has been enduring high-heels and extra long lashes to bring his most famous character to life. As a matron of political incorrectness, an honorary member of the ANC and a self-declared former ambassadress of a fictitious Bantustan called Bapetikosweti, Evita Bezuidenhout spends her time in the little town of Darling, 85km from Cape Town, performing at Evita se Perron throughout the year. Bezuidenhout made her debut in 1982, and has since gained international acclaim for performances that poked fun, first, at the ridiculous laws under Apartheid, and then, at the leaders of the new, democratic South Africa. She has dined with Nelson Mandela, been kissed on the cheek by Archbishop Desmond Tutu and even received the Women’s International Centre’s 2000 Living Legacy Award in San Diego – an honour received by the likes of Hillary Clinton and Mother Theresa. She is, indeed, a national treasure, giving us reason to laugh at our typically sobering politics and history. After this spectacular one hour show, a table is booked for you 1:30 pm for lunch at Ciao Darling, a family restaurant, trattoria and pizzeria situated in the heart of Darling. Enjoy their freshly home-made pasta and array of wood fired pizzas before the two hour scenic journey back to Cape Town in the afternoon. Upon arrival in Cape Town, Chis will take you to Parker Cottage again, your accommodation for the next three nights. You'll have the rest of the afternoon to settle in, rest and recuperate. Take a Taxi to the V&A Waterfront later. For dinner, you have the freedom to choose from the myriad of restaurants at the V&A Waterfront. Whether you're in the mood for local delicacies, international cuisine, or something in between, the staff at Parker Cottage will be delighted to recommend the perfect dining spot to suit your preferences. Meal Inclusions: Breakfast Cape Town: 16th to 17th September, 2024 16 September 2024 Today you'll be hiking Disa Gorge with Table Mountain hiking guide, Nick Ashby. Chris will meet you at Parker Cottage at 9am to take you to the meeting point. Your guide, Nick Ashby Nick is a fully qualified and registered guide. It wasn't his first job, though. He worked as an actor for ten years, having studied drama at UCT in Cape Town. When both him and his wife decided to take a year off acting to travel, it turned into seven. During that time they became English teachers. They've taught in Egypt, Russia, and then Taiwan. They became parents in the USA, and studied Mandarin. They hiked and trekked wherever they went. Since back in South Africa in 2005, Nick has published a novel, taught some more, as well as kept guiding on his old favorite, Table Mountain, first explored as a boy scout, and other hiking trails around the Cape. This afternoon, you are spending some time again with Dominic Chadbon on Signal Hill. For dinner, you have the freedom again to choose from the myriad of restaurants at the V&A Waterfront. Whether you're in the mood for local delicacies, international cuisine, or something in between, the staff at Parker Cottage will be delighted to recommend the perfect dining spot to suit your preferences. Meal Inclusions: Breakfast Going Home 17 September 2024 You'll have a leisurely start to the last day of your holiday with breakfast at Parker Cottage. The morning is yours to enjoy at your own pace. Take this opportunity to do some last-minute shopping for souvenirs or explore any corners of Cape Town you haven't yet visited. In the afternoon, you can soak in the final moments of your Cape Town adventure, perhaps with a visit to a local market, a stroll along the V&A Waterfront, or simply relaxing at a cafe with a view of Table Mountain. At 8:00 pm, Chris will arrive to transfer you to Cape Town International Airport. There, you'll board KLM0598 flight at 23:15 pm for your journey home. Safe travels until we meet again!"

However it has to be the elephants that make this such a special place. We average over 10 elephants every 2 hours of driving around the park, so this frees up time to try and search out some of the smaller and seldom seen animals like meerkat, yellow mongoose, bushbuck, caracal as well as dozens of bird species. Over the next 5 days here you will be able to spend as much time as you wish inside the park, we will aim to be in the park at sunrise until sunset each day and by taking lunch and some snacks we will be able to spend the entire day inside the park if you wish. Each night the park rangers also organise a spotlighting tour of the park, and it is on these spotlighting drives that some of Addo’s most special species can be seen. As well as lions and hyenas being more active and commonly seen during the evenings it is also the only time to see nocturnal animals like springhare, porcupine, bat-eared foxes, striped polecats and aardwolves.

We'll start with a traditional lunch, typically Potjiekos - a stew that's slow-cooked in a cast iron pot over a fire and served with salad. After we've eaten, we'll head out on a Soweto tuk-tuk tour accompanied by a local resident and guide to discover the neighbourhoods of Soweto. We'll visit the Hector Pieterson Memorial, a museum that honours the vital role that the youth of South Africa played during the struggle. He was one of the first students to be killed during the uprising when he was just 13. We'll also travel down the vibrant Vilakazi Street, the former home to two Nobel Peace Prize Winners - Nelson Mandela and Bishop Desmond Tutu. If you'd like an airport transfer today, you'll need to arrive into O.R. Tambo International Airport (JNB). Please note, that if you wish to join the Soweto tour, you'll need to arrive at the hotel by 12pm.

During today's safari, we'll stop at various watering holes where buffalo and antelope are often spotted. Other visitors we might see include the legendary Big 5 - lion, leopard, rhino, elephant and cape buffalo. We'll spend the morning looking for wildlife before stopping at one of the park's restaurants or cafes for lunch. After a lunch break, we'll continue with an afternoon safari experience returning to our lodge in the late afternoon."

If you are more of a red fan, then expect big earthy reds, a great companion for a sumptuous steak or meat on a braai.

Apart from its obvious geographical attractions, Cape Town is also famous for its food and drink culture, with an abundance of restaurant options, from the trendy downtown to the more touristy but beautiful V&A Waterfront. For our 2025 departures, we'll be using two different hotels in Cape Town, the AHA Harbour Bridge Hotel and the equally beautiful Cresta Grande.

We may have time to have a quick explore of the shops and the small curio museum before driving onto the huge limestone caverns of the Cango Caves. These caves are an underground network of extraordinary structures, millions of years old. The combination of dripping rainwater and limestone has led to the creation of ancient stalactites, stalagmites, and mighty rock columns.

Lunch is followed by time to relax and enjoy the views from your private deck with river views, before your afternoon game drive in the Wild Rivers Reserve, before returning home for a sumptuous dinner. On your first full day on safari we will include our unique bush senses experience. This is an activity that we have developed over many years and has proven to be very popular with our safari guests. In a fun way it encourages you to use all of your senses when in the bush. Not just sight, but also smell, hearing and touch. Some of our senses are dulled by modern living, but this simple and fun exercise quickly hones one’s bush senses, ideal preparation for any safari."

There will be time to rest and relax and enjoy lunch, and when the heat of the day has faded a little, you may join our rangers learning to track leopards and other predators within the reserve, where the Ingwe Leopard team are monitoring the resident leopard population. You will have the chance to try your hand at camera trapping. You’ll be given a motion activated camera trap to put at a place of your choosing on the reserve, with the aim of capturing images of the resident leopards. Over the remainder of your safari your camera will photograph any animal that walks by and triggers the motion sensor day or night. We’ll see what animal pics you capture at the end of your safari. This is the point when you can put all you have learnt so far into action. Guided by the Ingwe team you are able to consider and select places along game trails that you feel are likely spots to photograph the local leopards as they roam during the forthcoming nights. Leopard movement and territorial behaviour changes almost on a daily basis and is dependent on many factors, making this a fascinating and fun exercise and rightfully invites you to feel and become part of the Ingwe team. Return to camp for drinks and dinner."

These guides have decades of experience working and diving with sharks through Southern Africa. These guides are experts in shark biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all boat trips, dives, snorkels, cage dives and other activities mentioned. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the water. You will have to speak to your guide on arrival there and book places on these (this is not included). A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>The weather in South Africa and Mozambique during September varies from Cape Town to Tofo, but the temperatures are usually between 25-30 degrees C with little rain.

Travelling to watch great whites hunting fur seals, then enjoying some of the best whale watching in the world, spending time around penguins at their colony before heading inland and looking for some of the rare and unusual species that inhabit the dry grasslands and rocky escarpments of the zone between the Karoo to the south and the Kalahari to the north. If successful we could be among the first people (if not the only people) to see great white sharks and aardvarks in the same trip!. <br/><br/>Exploring many different habitats on this tour we will find wildlife at home in the shallow rocky waters of the Southern African coast, animals from the open ocean who are only coming into the bay for food or protection, animals that live on the sandy beaches and rocky cliffs of the Cape, plants and animals that make up one of the five floral kingdoms of the world the unique and endemic Fynbos.<br/><br/>All in all this dedicated and comprehensive wildlife tour of some unusual South African ecosystems that we hope will have you falling in love with the other side of safari holidays in South Africa. The whole of Southern Africa has many hidden secrets and much more than the Big Five and we hope to showcase some of these highlights throughout this tour.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary). We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers and game drives, guided walks, shark &amp; whale watching boat trips. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through South Africa (and elsewhere in Southern Africa). Your naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. Whilst the trip involves a lot of camps, these are not pitch your own tent camping camps, instead these are luxury tented camps where the tents are permanent and you do not need to bring any camping equipment or sleeping bags with you. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the Kalahari wilderness, night safaris are available in some locations (subject to the local conditions on that day). You will have to speak to your guide on arrival there and book places on these (this is not included). A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced zoologist (where available- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) or naturalist guides as well as local drivers, boat skippers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it. We do our best to include as many wildlife activities as possible in all of our itineraries.<br/>• Depending on budget and interest we have a range of different accommodation packages to offer, from luxury top end lodges, national park safari lodges and mobile-camps which often offer unbelievable wildlife watching deep inside national parks as well as camping. We can also arrange mobile camping safaris of Botswana is very popular and all of your camping gear will be provided.<br/>• Spend all the daylight hours searching for wildlife and visiting various natural wonders and stunning landscapes.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our South Africa wildlife safaris a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Southern Africa so that we can try and find and observe some of the rarer and more elusive species. We have great itineraries and expertise in all Southern African countries (Namibia, South Africa, Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Mozambique) and can arrange trips to find some of the rarer species such as aardvarks, aardwolves, brown hyenas and black-footed cats among other species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Best time to visit:<br/><br/>The southern Hemisphere winter is best, July - October. This tour is best in the southern Hemisphere winter into the southern spring. This is when the weather is at its most comfortable for us to visit and the seas around the Cape of Good of Hope are calm enough to allow pelagic birding trips as well as whale watching excursions too. As for the Kalahari early August to late October is the dry season in the Kalahari, is the best time to go for wildlife watching. <br/><br/>Fitness level required:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from 4x4 safari vehicle or from boats and there is very little physically demanding activities needed. There are some guided walks, but they are usually along flat trails and no longer than 1 hour.<br/><br/>Minimum age: 18",

When we descend towards the bay we will see some of the small communities that are dotted along the coast of False Bay. Fishoek, Muizenberg, Kommeije and Simonstown are the main ones. They were all once small fishing villages that are now hotspots for the rich and glamorous to live (such as Simonstown and Kommeije) or are thriving backpacker and surfer towns such as Fishoek and Muizenberg. We will head to Simonstown, this is the largest harbour in the bay and also home to the largest South African naval base, which when you see the small size of it makes you realise that the South African navy is not a global force. The town is base of our cage diving operations and also the most picturesque and conveniently located for many excursions to sites around Cape Town and Cape Point. After checking in the rest of the day will be free to rest and relax. (no meals are included today)"

        "description": "False Bay & Surrounds - Wildlife Watching & Sightseeing Our activities for the next week or so are heavily dependent on the weather, unfortunately the best time to see the hunting great white sharks is also the winter. Whilst rare it is not unheard for storms to come through the Cape and disrupt the shark boats for a day. However you will receive a full refund for the any boat trips that doesn’t head out due to the weather and with a week dedicated to this and 10 different trips on the boat planned we should have plenty of time on the boat and get the photographs of the breaching sharks we are after. So the order of the activities listed here may vary depending on the weather, but the activities mentioned (other than the shark trips) will all be done as they are less weather dependent and we will be able to do them. Even if they are not done in the exact order mentioned. So scheduled for today is a morning trip to Seal Island and its resident 64,000 Cape fur seals and their 100 or so toothy neighbours. We will meet the crew at 7:00am sharp, they can and will leave without us if we are late because the best breaching and predation events occur at first light. The island is located around 7km offshore and on a very clear day it is just visible from shore. It takes around 45 minutes to get to the island and the sunrise over the bay is spectacular. Along the way it is possible to see southern right whales, pods of dolphins (dusky dolphins, common bottlenose dolphins, short-beaked common dolphins as well as (rarely) orca (we will be praying not to see orca as they are the only predator of great white sharks and when they have been seen around here and other aggregation sites around the world the sharks disappear for a few days to avoid them)), as well as African penguins and of course the seals. The bird life around the bay is also spectacular with Cape gulls, kelp gulls, Hartlaub’s gulls, sooty shearwaters, various petrels, cormorants and the occasional albatross all possibly sighted. This morning will be visiting the island. Once we reach the island we will first of all scan the waters and particularly the ‘gauntlet’ which is a narrow channel under the water which is used by the sharks to launch most of their vertical ambushes. Whilst predations occur all around the island and up to around 100m offshore from the island, most occur just off the southern tip. This is where the underwater topography is perfect for ambushes and the seals seem to aggregate before heading off to the deeper water. At first we just watch the natural predations and try our best to predict which of the many seals will be targeted. As the sun rises the amount of attacks decreases, with the sun higher in the sky the seals can see deeper and so can spot the sharks below easier. At this point (when conditions are good) we will tow a decoy seal behind the boat. This entices the sharks to launch a breach attack on the decoy and as you only have one target to focus on you have a much higher chance of capturing a breach with your camera. This is the best and possibly only place in the world where great white sharks can be seen easily without getting in the water and without the need to use bait and chum. We will be out at the island for the morning and then we will return to the harbour and to the guest house to freshen shower and change. Afterwards we will head around the point to Cape Point National Park, the drive into the park will take us around some of the point and the views are just spectacular. Chacma baboons are not uncommon along the way and once we enter the park we will be in the Fynbos, this is one of the 5 floral kingdoms in the world and when you consider some of the floral kingdoms are Paleo-Arctic-temperate-deciduous forest and span the entire world, the fact that the western cape of South Africa has one of its own you realise the importance of this ecosystem. Unfortunately during the winter the fynbos will not be flowering but the wildlife here will still be around. Inside the coastal park we could see ostrich, Cape Mountain zebra, eland, endemic bontebok, rhebok, chacma baboons as well as wealth of bird life. We will go to the visitor centre today and have lunch here before heading up to the Cape Point lighthouse. We will also explore some of the park and get out and walk through the Fynbos and visit some beaches, the endemic bontebok are beautiful and usually found around the beaches, there are also a couple of beaches where spotted-gully sharks can be spotted from the beach if we are lucky. After spending the afternoon here we will head back to Simonstown and have dinner. (breakfast is the only meal included today)."

        "description": "False Bay & Surrounds - Wildlife Watching & Sightseeing This morning we will all depart for Seal Island like yesterday and the routine on the boat will be the same as described above. On our return to Simonstown today we will have lunch in the town and then head the short distance to the largest African penguin colony in the world and also possibly the most accessible penguin colony (of any species) in the world. You will start to see penguins as we drive into the car park and even before we get into the official entrance you could have seen dozens of the little critters. The walk bold as brass right past people and between the cars, they seem to be completely oblivious to the presence of people and vehicles. These traits make them very good photography subjects as they will allow you to get as close as you wish but bad when they try and cross roads and several of killed on the roads every year. We will spend an afternoon with these adorable little birds, they will be nesting at this time of year and so you can observe the male and female mating rituals and little beak slapping dances they perform when they greet each other from another fishing excursion. They also tussle with each other; each penguin is after the perfect next burrow and the best vegetation to line their burrow with. This causes a conflict that are usually decided by who brays the loudest, in fact the noise can be so loud that it is clear where they get their other common name from, the Jackass penguin. As we explore the colony you will also see some penguins coming back to shore from a day fishing as well as many playing in the surf zone, they are predated on by dolphins, seals and of course the multitude of sharks in the bay including the great whites too. Also living around the colony are rock hyraxes, they can be seen around Cape Point too but they are very easy subjects here as they are very used to people. Afterwards we will have a relaxing evening with dinner at a restaurant in Simonstown. (breakfast is the only meal included today)"

We will drive half way up and then take a cable car to the summit. We will pray for good weather and a clear summit, however it is very common for the ‘table cloth’ to be on the mountain. This may sound quaint but it is a cloud, however even if the views from the top are not fantastic the landscape on the top is well worth going to see. The cable car will take us to the top and from here we will have an explore of the strange rock formations and also if the weather permits enjoy the great views out over the city and to the old penal colony of Robben Island. There is some wildlife here too, Cape grass birds, Cape Sugar birds, southern rock agamas, plated lizards and possibly klipspringers can all be seen on the top of the mountain.

This afternoon we will have a trip over to the island, this was the prison where many black activists were incarcerated during apartheid. This is not a wildlife excursion (although African penguins and introduced springbok can be easily seen on the island), but it is not possible to understand South Africa without understanding what happened on this island and what it was like for people during the apartheid era. Your guides around the island will be former prisoners who lived here, this allows for a wonderful insight into what life was really like here. You will get told about the history of the island and also visit the prison (seeing Nelson Mandela’s actual cell and belongs as they were when we was here) and the limestone mines where many of the prisoners worked until they dropped and went blind with the glare of the sun reflected back from the white rocks.

Hermanus is an old colonial town that is now one of the most picturesque bay towns in Africa, it is also the premier land-based whale watching destination in the world and after lunch we will go and see if we can see of the southern right whales that entire the bay in June. They spend the Austral winter here, which is far warmer than their usual home in the Antarctic waters furthe south. They come here to rest, mate, calve and rear their young so there is a chance you can see some incredible behaviour whilst here. Sometimes the whales can be seen only a few meters away from the cliffs. So it is the cliffs that stretch from once side of the town to the other that will be our destination this afternoon and we hope that the whales are cooperative.

Once we return to the harbour we will have lunch and then head to Stanford (around 25 minutes from Hermanus) and here we will have a private Cessna flight out over the bay. This will be one hour and we hope to see the bay, surrounding countryside and the whales in a completely new way. The aircraft is perfectly set up for photographers with a removable door offering unobstructed views from a stable, smooth platform. I hope that you will be the first amongst your group of photographer friends to get aerial whale photographs of this kind.

Whilst it can in theory be driven in a day (under 12 hours, as it's around 1 000km long), in reality the massive variety of biome, the number of experiences and places along the route mean that an absolute minimum is really five days.<br/><br/>So we've deliberately kept the pace of this journey sedate to allow you to fully experience the unique identity of each place along the route: the Garden Route is often touted as a 'drive along the N2' (that's the name of the main highway that connects the larger towns) and whilst this is to an extent true, getting off the highway and getting to the more remote locations makes this into a truly magical trip.<br/><br/>This trip is 100% ethical; every supplier has made a commitment - and has been independently audited in the fulfillment of that commitment - to placing people and planet first in every aspect of their business practice. Rest assured then that everything you will see and do on this trip makes a positive impact on the places and people you visit, not the opposite.

Rukiya is a small luxury tented camp within the Wild Rivers Reserve and is a key area for our leopard research team. The camp nestles along the banks of the Blyde River among age old tress, a truly stunning location.

This is an activity that we have developed over many years and has proven to be very popular with our safari guests. In a fun way it encourages you to use all of your senses when in the bush. Not just sight, but also smell, hearing and touch. Some of our senses are dulled by modern living, but this simple and fun exercise quickly hones one’s bush senses, ideal preparation for any safari. We also encourage our guests to download our leopard research App and become a citizen scientist by using the App while on game drive to help monitor Leopard movement. Territorial behaviour changes almost on a daily basis and is dependent on many factors, making this a fascinating and fun exercise and rightfully invites you to feel and become part of the Ingwe team should you wish."

From the main road, in the bush 20kms away, a cloud of mist and spray can be seen against the blue sky. As you get closer, a low rumble like thunder can be heard. When you arrive it is a surprise to discover the enormity of Victoria Falls. One mile wide and hurling over 5 million cubic metres of water a minute into the Zambezi Gorge this sight is breath taking at any time of year. The water levels vary hugely depending on the time of year, but it is always an amazing spectacle - in fact it can actually be better when there is a little less water, as there is less spray blocking the falls from view. The Gorge below the falls is also the setting for one of the most adrenaline fuelled grade 5 white water rafting rivers in the world. But there is also plenty to do here for the less active too. Why not take a day trip over the Victoria Falls bridge to view the falls from Zambia, take the Flight of Angels - a great way to get a birds eye view of the falls in a microlight or helicopter, enjoy a civilised afternoon tea at the Victoria Falls Hotel, join a Sunset Boat Cruise or a more sedate Canoe trip. For those who want to make the most of the adrenaline activities, get your fix with the Gorge Swing, Abseil or 'enjoy' one of the highest commercial Bungee Jumps in the world."

From Cape Agulhas we pass through the Outeniqua Mountains to the Little Karoo - we will visit an Ostrich farm to learn more about the worlds largest bird. The Ostrich has been around for 8 million years and a feather was actually discovered in King Tutankhamun's tomb in Egypt. 97% of the world's population of Ostriches lives in the Karoo. We will also explore Cango Calcite Caves recognised as one of the world's finest network of Calcite caves. The bizarre formations of Stalagmites and Stalactites represent over a million years of slow formation."

Your zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) escort is an expert in mammal biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge of where some of the most elusive African animals are. As well as having years of experience in bringing people out to see sharks, whales, lions, elephants and other wildlife safely. We also include all vehicle safaris, guided walks, spotlighting drives, seal island cruises, pelagic trips, whale watching excursions, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the African bush or trip out to sea for whales or dolphins. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour.<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>The southern Hemisphere winter is best, July - October. This tour is best in the southern Hemisphere winter into the southern spring. This is when the weather is at its most comfortable for us to visit and the seas around the Cape of Good of Hope are calm enough to allow pelagic birding trips as well as whale watching excursions too.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>•\tAll of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by a local naturalist guides, drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife your watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>•\tWe can offer you spotlighting trips of the Karoo National Park so that you can search for the rarer species and other nocturnal wildlife when they are more active.<br/>•\tWe can also bring thermal imaging and night vision equipment as well as hydrophones (on request) to also aid in finding the nocturnal mammals after dark and listen in on the underwater conversations of whales and dolphins.<br/>•\tWe use camera traps (where available) which will increase the chances of getting close up pictures and movies of rare animals and other rare nocturnal wildlife.<br/>•\tClimb the stunning and iconic Table Mountain for exceptional views of Cape Town.<br/>•\tAll the above reasons give this tour of Southern Africa’s Western Cape a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here.

        "description": "Cape Town – Arrival – On arrival at the Cape Town International airport, you will be met by your local guide. If your flight arrives in the morning we should have time for some sightseeing after you have been transferred to our accommodation in Simonstown. Simonstown is a beautiful little harbour town situated on the south side of Cape Town and is nestled between False Bay and Cape Point National Park. On the drive from the airport there is a chance of spotting black wildebeest, Cape mountain zebra, eland and grey rhebok as the motorway flanks the national park boundaries. Once we have checked in and grabbed some lunch (depending on the time) we will head out to Simonstown’s number one attraction. Boulders Beach National Park. This is one of the smallest national parks in all of Africa but it is home to a huge population of African penguins. They nest here and the beaches and pathways get you really close to the birds as they fearlessly waddle right up to you and seem more interested in you than you are in them! In addition to the penguins there are plenty of rock hyraxes or dassies here. They are the closest living relatives to elephants but you have to look hard to see why as they look more like guinea-pigs. We can stay here as long as you like and afterwards we can either go back to the accommodation so you can rest or drive around the bay and take in some of the sites, including a view of Table Mountain in the distance. Our evening meal will be back at the accommodation. (Lunch and or Dinner included (depending on the time of arrival))."

Karoo National Park is isolated park and is mostly semi-desert but boasting more tortoise species than any other park in South Africa and recently playing home to the re-birth of the quagga, Karoo really is more than just semi-desert. In fact we have a good chance of finding black rhino, cape buffalo, red hartebeest, black wildebeest, kudu and both the Cape Mountain zebra and the quagga-like-Burchells zebra. The quagga project has bred the Burchells zebra to havce quagga like characteristics and as the quagga was only a subspecies of the Burchells zebra it is not as farfetched as it may sound to bring the quagga back from extinction; and if we are lucky enough to see one you will agree they look pretty convincing. On arrival we will check into our accommodation, level - cottages / chalets (national park main camp) and get ready for a night drive with a national park warden. The spotlighting drives are the best and usually only way to see some really remarkable animals like aardvarks, aardwolfs, bat-eadred foxes, African crested porcupines, striped polecats and African wild cats. We will have our evening meal in the camp restaurant. (Breakfast, Lunch & Dinner included)."

        "description": "A vacation to Africa ignites so many dreamy images and preconceptions: lions roaring, elephants marching, wildlife congregating as if from an animated movie. The Sabi Sands is quick to confirm these images, a drive from the airstrip to the lodge encountering a wide array of Africa's wild mammals. Elephants and giraffes are easily spotted, rising in and out of the trees. Rhinos are equally ubiquitous, sniffing and grazing their way across the savanna. Zebra canter while impala skip across the grasslands. All this and you're just being transferred to your accommodation. Your family will land at O. R. Tambo International in Johannesburg, where a representative is on hand and assists in transferring you to a domestic flight. Touch down in the Sabi Sands Game Reserve and you're already surrounded by the Big Five and more. After the intercontinental flight, the lodge makes for a quiet place to rest and relax, although there's always an air of excitement here. Wild animals roam past the verandah, the continual procession an indication of what's to come on these four nights in the Sabi Sands. This game reserve shares an unfenced border with Kruger National Park and is an irrevocable piece of the Kruger ecosystem. It's a haven for the complete diversity of Kruger wildlife, with a particular abundance found along the Sands River. You have two interconnected suites at the luxury lodge, along with a wooden verandah overlooking this river."

        "description": "On a game drive, the guides focus on the highlights, the animals that really get the heart racing and the memories embedded. Lions bask in the open, their manes flowing on the morning breeze. The vehicle stops and your family holds its breath, the lionesses getting closer before snoozing just a few meters away. Two white rhino arrive a few minutes later, a mother and calf on their own family journey. Elephants are abundant, their rumps barging against trees and their tusks a wonderful show of pride. Stop at a bend in the river and a huge pod of hippos provide the entertainment, then turn around to see a baboon troop arriving for a drink. For its diversity and ease, Sabi Sands makes an excellent family safari destination. All the famous animals can be encountered without long bumpy journeys through the bush. Game drives are scintillating, taking you out for three hours before returning to the lodge. Rather than have to travel far, wildlife often comes to you in this game reserve. During the time at the lodge, you're able to relax on the verandah and appreciate the mammals and birds at the river. Specialist guides entertain the children, teaching basic bush survival skills and introducing the tenets of animal tracking. At times it's a true wilderness experience, yet it's also a decadent five-star stay in a famous safari destination."

        "description": "A Sabi Sands safari constantly offers new angles. Today you explore on foot, stepping across the savanna with barefoot indigenous guides. It's not a race, it's a slow journey that acknowledges all the clues of a wild environment: prints in the sand, indentations in the tree, different mammal dung, trees that have been picked clear of fruit. Walking with these guides brings astonishing encounters, like a zebra herd standing just a few meters away, or wild kudu and wildebeest bounding past. It's very safe and the local guides have been doing this since they were children, staying clear of the big animals while connecting with the ungulates. An armed ranger provides a back up. By learning through experience, tracking animals on foot is probably the most effective method of instilling respect for the wild environment and its inhabitants."

        "description": "Sail on the sunrise breeze in a hot air balloon, rising above the Kruger savanna and drifting towards the gaping scar of Blyde River Canyon. Initially you spot animals from the air, like elephants and rhino on their nomadic journeys. Gradually the river expands, weaving through a canyon of crumbling sandstone walls. Mystical peaks rise while a forested valley opens out below. Touch down and it's still morning, so a second breakfast is enjoyed with views over the Three Rondavels. Then you're driven back to the Sabi Sands along the Panorama Route, winding around one of the world's biggest canyons. The afternoon provides a final game drive, a last chance to spot the Big Five in their natural habitat. Sometimes, the abundance is baffling. You're all enjoying the sight of a leopard in a tree; turn around and a herd of buffalo are just three meters away. Another advantage of the Sabi Sands is that it's a de facto malaria-free zone, unlike the savanna further north in the Kruger. Over 1 million visitors have stayed in the private Kruger reserves over the last 40 years; there have only been three reported malaria cases. While this landscape isn't considered fully malaria-free by the World Health Organization, a tourist hasn't contracted malaria in the Sabi Sands for almost two decades."

Others want to connect, to stand on the summit and take in views of both the Atlantic and Indian oceans. The really adventurous might want to jump off the side and rappel down 100 meters of the vertical slope. This mountain can be all those experiences and a local guide tailors the morning to your family, including either a hike or cable car to the summit. After the mountain, you're transferred to Camps Bay, the city's main beach. Cafes and restaurants overlook the broad sand and it's a very safe place for an afternoon in the sun."

Color is everywhere, from painted shacks to local clothes, rustic churches to sculptures made from Coca-Cola cans. Especially for children, a guided township tour is an extremely poignant experience. This is a community that seemingly has nothing, yet is filled with such smiles and enthusiasm. Township tours are a means of uplifting communities and providing employment. While these settlements have a reputation for crime, community leaders provide assurances over visitor safety. In addition, the guide is likely to know everyone you meet and there's a form of community policing that has helped township tourism flourish over the last decade. During the tour, you'll learn how to speak basic Xhosa, taste traditional foods, visit churches, schools, shops, and other community buildings, as well as meet many families living in the township."

Ascend and descend over the Table Mountain chain and you reach Boulders Beach, where jackass penguins waddle comically across the sand. Couples share beak kisses on the beach while others dive off the cliffs to go fishing. These are just two highlights on today's private Cape Point tour, and another comes from standing on the very southwestern tip of Africa. A lighthouse marks the spot and there's a sense of achievement here, as if your family has traveled to the edge of the world. Well, it is the edge of the world: set sail from here and the next landmass you would reach is Antarctica."

        "description": "South Africa has almost 2,000 miles of coastline, stretching from deserted Atlantic Ocean beaches to equally deserted Indian Ocean sand. Rather than a single must-visit beach, there's always a wide choice of coastal destinations. Plettenberg Bay is chosen for this family itinerary as it's a crossroads for a wide variety of experiences. The town itself is small enough to walk around and relatively quiet, yet still has a wide choice of restaurants and cafes. Calm waters are ideal for less confident swimmers, but there's also a couple of light coastal breaks that are excellent for beginner surfers. The beach isn't deserted, but it's never crowded. Within an hour of Plettenberg Bay, you can discover a host of other Garden Route destinations, places to visit for half a day dependent on the mood. Best of all, direct flights have started operation from Cape Town to Plettenberg Bay, so you no longer have to take a five-hour road journey to get here. You'll be transferred to the airport for the domestic flight and greeted in Plettenberg Bay by a local representative with a rental car. This coastal chapter of the family vacation is open and flexible and the rental car ensures you have everything at your fingertips. Your boutique hotel is situated on a street just behind the beach, within walking distance of everything in the town."

        "description": "For these four days, it's easy to lie back and lounge on the soft sand. But perhaps that's not enough for the children. Local surf schools specialize in lessons for beginners and the foamy waters of the bay make an easy introduction to the sport. Kayaks can easily traverse these waters and a guided kayaking tour can be taken at any time during these four days. Paddling into the Indian Ocean, you encounter wild dolphin pods, their fins seeming to rise and fall in rhythm with the paddle. Sometimes they just swim past. Other times they become inquisitive, approaching the kayaks as if wanting to say hello. The Garden Route National Park and Tsitsikamma are just 30 minutes away, places that continue the theme of adventure. Ride a Segway through indigenous forest, cross long pedestrian suspension bridges above the Indian waves, and drive to cliffs with lingering views over the coast. A variety of hiking trails weave through the national park, hugging the coast as they connect cliffs with forest. Other coastal towns are close by for a day away from Plettenberg, like Knysna, Wilderness, and Sedgefield. Each has another wonderfully tranquil stretch of sand. Then there's Monkeyland, where a dozen different primates swing from the trees. Or the fluttering colors found at Birds of Eden, a haven for some of South Africa's rarest species. Plettenberg Bay's location in the heart of the Garden Route put all these other destinations within easy reach."

The hues merge, and the panoramas never stop. Gaze through God's Window, follow the trail along to Bourke’s Luck Potholes, and then take in the expression of scale at the Blyde River Canyon viewpoint.

        "description": "Leave Blyde River Canyon and you're quickly in Kruger National Park, a historic park that's home to over half the world's rhinos and a wonderful abundance of big cats. It's a prime destination for a first-time safari, able to showcase the diversity of African game while providing many intimate moments with nature's biggest and more impressive. Weaving through Kruger, you enjoy your first game drive. Turn a corner and a springbok herd skips across the dusty savannah. Follow the trail and white rhinos stand with enchantment; dotted along the sand are the tracks of a leopard. Next, you cruise through Kruger towards Sabi Sands Game Reserve, a private concession that borders the national park. Now the safari becomes more intimate. All the famous mammals are found in the Sabi Sands, but they share a compact area, arriving to enjoy the bounty of the Sabi and Sands rivers. Lions rest beneath the shade of branches, kudu and eland cluster in large herds, baboons are scattered above the trails, while a rustling amongst the green reveals a hiding cheetah. Now some elephants, a whole herd that trumpets its route to the river, then veers clear of where the hippos wallow in the mud. And of course, the rhinos, Africa's legendary endangered species, are found in wonderful abundance. Over these two days, you enjoy luxurious game drives in an open-sided vehicle, heading out in the cooler hours of morning and afternoon to experience African safari in all its wonder. On both days, you also have the opportunity for a nighttime drive. Open your ears to the sounds, feel the redolence of the savannah, and then turn on the spotlight to find great herds just meters from your vehicle. Yet for all the drama, and for all the moments of discovery out in the bush, safari in Sabi Sands is a relaxed experience. Hippos wander across the grass beside the river, giraffes raise their necks along the horizon, and large zebra herds gather in open clearings. All this is seen from the room of your lodge, nature's greats congregating on the plains as you tuck into lunch or lounge on the verandah. And when nighttime rolls around, the sounds keep you company, Africa's eternal tones echoing throughout the dark. It's not merely the mix of wildlife that makes this a premier destination for a first-time safari. It's the chance to fully immerse yourself in the unmistakable tones of Africa."

You ascend, rising past small villages and into the Kingdom. Swaziland is the epitome of many people's images of traditional Africa. Circular huts dot the landscape, standing over fields of horses and cattle. Nothing is flat, with the green slopes curving past villagers carrying baskets on their heads. Locals are curious, welcoming you with smiles and invitations. At first glance, the country appears poor. But that's only when using the economy to judge richness. This is a country that radiates culture and sense of society. Spend the day journeying through the country, stopping at village markets and visiting community projects. As dusk falls, you arrive at Mlilwane Game Reserve, where zebra and warthogs roam beneath your beehive hut.

Giraffe and buffalo stop their grazing to say hello while there's always hippos lounging in the lake. This experience can also be switched or complemented with a walking safari or bicycle safari. In the mid-afternoon, you will also head out to a traditional healer, or witch doctor as the West might call him.

You will land in Cape Town and will be persuaded easily. Table Mountain stands high above the ocean, and a multicultural atmosphere plays out on the streets. There is an energetic but ultimately relaxed feel, perhaps because nature plays such a prominent role in the city. You will be greeted at the airport and transferred to a hotel in Woodstock. This afternoon, your guide will lead you onto Table Mountain with an opportunity to explore the hiking trails around the summit. You will remain on the mountain until sunset before descending and trying out one of the excellent city restaurants."

        "description": "Ten years ago, there was a classic visitor route around Cape Town, taking in the V & A Waterfront, Camps Bay, Signal Hill, and the Cape Peninsula. The city’s recent popularity now means that these destinations have become crowded, nor reflective of Cape Town’s changing culture and atmosphere. Today’s guided, Cape Town tour will take you beyond the famous stops, focusing instead on how the city is changing after apartheid. Take an art-based walking tour through District Six, which is where you will see how graffiti is being used to both transform and protest the neighborhood’s regeneration. Learn about this neighborhood’s harrowing history at the District Six Museum before continuing the tour in Woodstock and Observatory. These two neighborhoods were gray areas during apartheid, so they have always been the most multicultural parts of Cape Town. They have transformed into quirky, creative, and engaging places to be. Now, they are reflective of a modern, changing South Africa. You can explore the trendy, black-owned boutiques, discover the city’s coffee culture, visit one or two groundbreaking breweries, and find that almost every street is dominated by graffiti. If there is time remaining, you will return to the city and visit Zeitz MOCAA, which is Africa’s most important museum of contemporary art. It reframes definitions of contemporary art and asks why the boundaries should be dictated by Europe and the West."

However, this road is a traffic jam during peak season, and much of the original charm has been lost. Rather than drive south, you will travel north today instead. The wild West Coast remains far from the tourist trail, although, after today’s private tour, you will be wondering why. You will leave the city to bask on a deserted white beach with a sublime view across the bay to Table Mountain. Further up the road, you will make a stop at a San bushman center where an ancient way of life is being preserved. An indigenous San will be your guide, leading you in the basics of the nomadic lifestyle and animal tracking. There is an opportunity to search for zebras, using local San clues before you continue north along the West Coast. Spend the afternoon in Darling, which is a farming settlement of whitewashed houses and old-world charm. Here, you will visit a theater that used satire to challenge apartheid along with a vineyard that will provide a nice introduction before tomorrow’s destination. You will have lunch at Darling Brewery, which is a superb community-based project. After the theater and winery, there are various beaches that you can stop at on the way back to Cape Town. These are wonderful places should you need some serenity."

Local guides stay on top of the changes and check out new venues such as when an old-world winery opens a brand-new tasting room. There is so much choice over where to go and what to drink that you should not have a prescribed itinerary. Instead, your local guide will tailor these two days to your tastes and interests. You will visit wineries that have received recent acclaim for particular wines along with longstanding favorites that continue to impress wine lovers all over the world. It takes less than an hour to travel between Cape Town and your vineyard accommodation. An extensive wine tasting will provide your welcome to the lodge before the afternoon explores unique flavors. You could visit the vineyard where Pinotage was first cloned, one that specializes in sparkling wine, or a valley where the country’s most awarded Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah are produced.

        "description": "It is just 30 minutes back to Cape Town International Airport where you will board a direct flight for the Sabi Sands. You will touch down in the wilderness, and a surreal atmosphere will take over. Orchestral trumpets suggest elephants are in the nearby trees, resonant growls may alert you to a resident lion, and baboon troops may battle on a dusty trail, yelping and hooting in an attempt to control territory. Leaving the trees, you may find giraffes and impalas, which are animals that are very common on every Sabi Sands safari. Even when transferring to the camp, you are likely to spot a dozen different mammal species, perhaps even three or four of the famous Big Five. A safari in the Sabi Sands provides luxury, and your lodge is positioned on the Sabi River, which is a popular gathering place for a wide variety of animals. Hippos are the permanent water residents, and they are joined by everything from buffalos to springboks and even leopards. Settling into a private plunge pool, you can watch the animals from a place of indulgence, probably with a glass of wine or cocktail in hand. Then, on an afternoon game drive, you may complete the finish your list of famous sights. With the first day of safaris, the focus is always on the big and famous animals, and for this, there is nowhere better than the Sabi Sands."

        "description": "Footsteps are slow and silent on a walking safari as every sound begins to register. Your senses will tune into the wilderness. There will be an air of exhilaration but also of tension as you share the land with Africa’s giants. An elephant may appear up ahead, and you may hear your own heartbeat as the trackers skillfully lead you away from the path of the herd. Walking slowly, you may pass a zebra herd. Next, you may see buffalo, which are noisy and hairy as they stare straight back at you. With no barrier between you and the animals, it will seem as if time stands still. However, the guides will already know that this is a harem, and encountering them will not be dangerous. Options for walking safaris are really beginning to open up in the Sabi Sands, and the experience will be entirely different from yesterday’s game drive. Nighttime game drives have been part of the Sabi Sands appeal for decades. A leopard may be spotted, and you will watch it prowl for prey. You can pay close attention to the cat’s neck and how it dips with solemn precision as it stalks its prey. Lions are also a good animal to track on a nighttime drive along with other nocturnal creatures that are almost impossible to encounter during the day such as serval cats and mongooses."

        "description": "Hot air ballooning is one of Africa’s most iconic safari experiences. You must be up early today as you will start soaring at dawn. Gradually, the acacia trees will come out of the shadows, and you can track the wildlife down below. A hot air balloon will provide a great vantage point onto moving herds, especially the patterns that are made by buffalos and elephants. You can see swathes of the forest where herds have passed along with giraffes that are clustered around their favorite trees. The hot air balloon will touch down deep in the bush where you will be served brunch with sparkling wine. From here, you will bump into South Africa’s most beautiful landscape. There are fewer animals on the Panorama Route, but the vistas are remarkable. Weather-carved pinnacles stand high above a forested valley, and ochre hues meet with lush green. The silence will seem to whistle through your ear, and the solitude can provide eternal memories. Occasionally, you do encounter life, and the animal sightings are heightened in comparison to the Sabi Sands. For example, a lone elephant may appear incredibly small and humble against the enormity of Blyde River Canyon, or a springbok herd may be skipping beneath the most bizarre rock formations. You will be back in the Sabi Sands before sundown, so you can venture on another game drive with the option of staying out after dark."

        "description": "The Sabi Sands has been South Africa’s most revered safari destination for many decades. It offers you luxury and indulgence in a wilderness environment and is home to the classic image of elephants that drink from plunge pools. Exploring Kruger National Park provides you with a different, more adventurous experience. Over these three days, you will make a long, circular journey through the park, heading north and west to parts of the Kruger that receive a lack of visitors. The accommodation will be mixed with one night in a national park chalet, one night at a small camp in a small private concession, and the final night at a contemporary lodge. Once inside the national park, there are more restrictions on activities. You can only explore on daytime game drives. This is why combining Kruger with Sabi Sands is advantageous. By now, you will have experienced different perspectives, and now, it is time for adventure. Over a dozen different ecosystems can be found in Kruger National Park, and this journey will explore their contrasts. You will discover the animals that thrive in miombo woodland, the drama that plays out on open grasslands, the strange creatures that lurk around the Lebombo mountains, and the importance of watering holes on a vast, arid landscape. On a safari, it is always impossible to predict exactly what you will see. Some animals are so abundant that they blur into the Kruger landscape, notably impalas, springboks, buffalos, elephants, zebras, wildebeests, giraffes, and hyenas. Maybe, you will see spotted hyena as they chase an impala herd. Perhaps, you will see a friendly buffalo herd that is all calm and charm as they graze the grass. However, it can also be a boisterous and belligerent herd. This three-day journey is also an excellent opportunity to search for some of Africa’s rarer species. Roan and sable antelope may both be a highlight along with the highly endangered African wild dog. White rhinos are plentiful, and five days in the Greater Kruger should provide numerous good sightings. However, black rhinos are very rare, and it will take some patience to search out one of these bashful creatures. The most dramatic action tends to take place at watering holes, which are excellent places to take a picnic and watch the wildlife world unfold."

The landscape is dominated by fynbos, the unique flora that makes up the Cape Floral Kingdom, which is found nowhere else in the world.

Standing in Nelson Mandela’s former cell, take a moment to reflect on his extraordinary resilience and capacity to forgive his captors once he was released, and pave the way to a peaceful and democratic South Africa. Due to its relatively small size, Cape Town is easily explored on foot. Once you disembark at the Victoria and Alfred Waterfront, this precinct of shops, cafés, and bars overlooks the busy harbor that is a great place to wander. Further towards the city, the streets around Greenmarket Square are worth spending a while exploring, on the lookout for interesting African arts and curios. Further up the hill is the Bo-Kaap, also known as the Malay Quarter. Colorful houses crowd onto cobbled streets, and the residents, descendants of Malaysians that arrived here in the early colonial times, are most friendly and welcoming.

Touching down at the airfield, you find yourself in the middle of the African wilderness, with nothing but pristine bush for miles around. Your guide meets you and directs you to his safari vehicle, in which you take the short game drive to the lodge. Keeping an eye out for animals along the way, the chances are you will spot at least a few impala antelope, zebra and wildebeest as they graze and move through the golden grassland. Arriving at the lodge, you find an elegant, stylish and modern lodge set on the banks of the Sabie River. It is astonishing, but here is a six-star luxury establishment in the middle of the African wilderness! Your suite is enormous, with a private veranda complete with a heated pool and stunning view over the river. After you have settled in, you wander over to the main building in the mid afternoon for an English high tea. A selection of delicacies is on display to tempt your taste buds while you discuss your afternoon’s adventure with your guide. You set off with your expert tracker and guide team, riding in an open Land Rover in order to maximize your field of view. With the light of the late afternoon giving the grasses swaying in the breeze a golden tinge, your sense of anticipation heightens as your eyes scan the surrounding bush. The Sabi Sands is a huge tract of land that shares a fenceless border with the Kruger National Park to the east. This creates an area of almost three million hectares of pristine wildlife habitat where animals roam freely. The abundance of wildlife here is astonishing, and apart from the signature Big 5 species of lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo and rhino, there are many more species of mammals and birds here to encounter. This is also the home range of the critically endangered African wild dog, the supreme hunters of this untrammeled wilderness. Highly social by nature, to encounter a pack of these predators on a high-speed hunt must rank as one of the most thrilling wildlife experiences you could possibly imagine. The dynamics of the group dictate that they kill quickly and silently, feed their youngest members first, and depart from the carcass before it attracts other larger predators such as lions and hyenas. As the afternoon draws to a close, your guide will select a spot to stretch your legs and take in the scenery. He produces a hamper packed with drinks and snacks, and you find yourself sipping on a glass of your favorite beverage while the sun sets the sky on fire in a pyrotechnic display of color. As the first stars begin to appear, you drive back to camp with a spotlight, seeking out the reflected eyes of nocturnal species as they emerge into the night. Civets, honey badgers and genets are often seen, while the loping stride of a hyena off on his nightly hunt is a thrilling sight. Returning to camp, you will find a welcoming fire blazing on the viewing deck, and delicious aromas wafting from the kitchen. A sumptuous meal is served in the dining room, bathed in soft lantern light, and after a final drink at the fire, you slip back to your suite and slide between the covers, serenaded by the sounds of the African night outside."

        "description": "You arise at dawn with a gentle knock on your door, and soon you find yourself sipping a freshly brewed hot drink on the terrace, watching the sun bring the world to life. Setting off on your game drive, the dew sparkles on the grasses and the air has a fresh tang to it that enlivens your senses. Scanning the ground intensely for spoor, your guide and tracker use their vast experience and skills to interpret every facet of their surroundings. By looking at tracks in the sand, they can tell the story of the night’s events- which animal went in which direction, and why they might have done so. Listening to the morning chorus of birds uplifts you as they welcome the day, and your guide knows the call of every one of them, and has a fascinating story to tell about each. Smaller birds like starlings will make a ruckus if they spot a snake; larger birds like francolins and grey go-away birds will tell you if there is a big cat nearby. A drag-mark on the ground reveals where a leopard made his kill, then took it to safety in the fork of a tree, and the overlaid pug-marks of a male lion show his intention of stealing the leopard’s prize. Every aspect of the bush has a story to tell, and if you look hard enough, the magic of this ecosystem will reveal itself to you. From the tiniest insect to the largest elephant bull, your guide will inform and educate you as to how they all fit into and function within this incredible mosaic of life. After a few hours, you return to the camp for a well-earned and hearty breakfast. After breakfast, if you so choose, you can take a safari walk with your guide, and it is well worth it. Nothing can compare to being on foot in the African wilderness. Walking along game paths that might never have felt a human tread, you feel your senses become heightened and more engaged. With this sharpening comes the sensation of being fully in the moment, alive and breathing in the warm air of this ancient land. Your guide will point out things that you might not notice from a vehicle- hoofmarks around a salt lick, a dung beetle rolling his enormous ball, the various uses of the plants you encounter: which are medicinal, which are edible, and which leaves make the softest toilet paper! Return to the lodge uplifted and energized, and after enjoying a delicious lunch, you retire to the shade for a well-earned rest. What could be a better place to while away a warm afternoon than in the pool on your deck, a chilled glass in hand, looking out over the African wilderness? Eventually as the sun begins to lower, you feel yourself compelled to venture out again to see what nature has in store for you. In the golden light of the late afternoon, you are once again moving through the bush, eyes peeled for any signs. Coming to a waterhole, you watch a herd of elephants lumber to the water’s edge to drink and observe the intricate family dynamics as they do so- watched over by the matriarch; the youngsters jostle and shove each other until their exuberance is quelled by a sharp trumpet from an elder member of the family. The tiny calves are not yet able to fully control their trunks and are comical in their attempts to mimic their mothers, while a teenage bull might try and challenge a larger cousin in an attempt at dominance. It is easy to spend hours watching the behavior of these amazing pachyderms as they interact among each other, but after a short while they turn and melt back into the forest as silently as ghosts. Returning to the lodge, you find the welcoming glow of campfire and lantern light. After another culinary experience conjured up out here in the middle of the wilderness, the excitement of the day comes to an end as you gratefully slip between the covers. Listening to the far off giggles of a hyena, you drift off into deep slumber in a moment."

Preconceptions usually revolve around excitement and thrills, but a Kruger safari is serene at heart, especially in the Timbavati. This is the most laid-back and compact Kruger region, and you will not need to spend all day, bouncing around a dusty savannah. In the Timbavati, you can often see the animals directly from your lodge, and you can take a picnic and dine on the view with hippos and buffalos as they quarrel at a watering hole beneath you. In short, you can take it slow and easy and still experience incredible wildlife sightings. After flying into Johannesburg, you will board a mid-morning safari flight to the Greater Kruger. The transfer to the lodge is a game drive, which will be a beautiful journey past many of the large species that also call this landscape home. An afternoon game drive will be included, and there is an excellent chance of encountering the full Big Five on a single Timbavati drive. Still, do not think too much about the Big Five and checking off your list because today is mostly about settling into the safari atmosphere.

Buffalos can also be heard, and they are giant grazers who like to huff and grunt audibly throughout the day. In contrast, rhinos and giraffes are silent animals; they move elegantly across the savannah and somewhat bashfully given their incredible size. You can see giraffes necks as they pop above trees.

This is perfect if you are still battling with a little travel fatigue, and it also helps to slow you down and settle into the Kruger’s day to day rhythm. After a morning game drive, you can choose a walking safari for the afternoon. Walks allow you to visit places that are inaccessible by vehicles and usually go in the opposite direction of vehicles. Game drives are also the only way to encounter predators and large, dangerous mammals. With Kruger walks, you will focus on smaller animals, notably the superb collection of antelope. Therefore, you can stand amid a springbok herd, walk alongside zebras, and watch kudu as they march past with their incredible horns. Walking safaris can be part of your customizable safari program in the Timbavati and Lebombo but less so in Mala Mala, where walks are usually not permitted due to the profusion of dangerous mammals."

        "title": "Mala Mala Private Game Reserve – Hot Air Balloon Safari and Extravagant Natural Landscapes",
        "description": "After an early start, you will be soaring across the Greater Kruger in a hot air balloon. From the air, you can appreciate the mix of habitats and how arid savannah is punctuated by riverine forest and thicker strips of bush. Even when soaring over Blyde River Canyon, you can spot animals down below, notably the elephant herds. The canyon is impressive, snaking into the distance like an elephant trunk. Peaks and canyon walls are colored an iconic African ochre with lush forest rising upon the slopes. There are few finer vistas anywhere on the continent, and it is a more intimate experience from a hot air balloon than from any of Blyde River Canyon’s famous viewpoints. You will touch down to the east of the canyon, where you will continue your journey by road. It will take around one hour to reach Mala Mala, which is the largest of all the Sabi Sands game reserves and the one with the best location. The Sabi Sands and Kruger National Park share an unfenced border. Wildlife migrates freely between the two parks and congregates where there is water, most popularly the Sabi and Sand river. Mala Mala has the longest shared border with the park. Essentially, it is on the inside of the Sabi Sands, deep within the Greater Kruger. Some of the cheaper Sabi Sands private reserves are located along the outside of the ecosystem, where they have a fenced barrier to the urban world. Naturally, the unfenced realm on the inside is more attractive to the animals."

        "title": "Mala Mala Private Game Reserve – Legendary Big Game Encounters through the Day and Night",
        "description": "As dawn breaks, you will be greeted by a special scene. A leopard may meet your gaze with its green eyes, piercing the morning haze. It will move slowly, serenely, and then in a split second, it will descend onto the savannah floor. A few steps at a time, the predator explores. It is elegance personified, but there is a deep earnestness to the hunter’s movements. Leopards are one of Africa’s most elusive and difficult to spot animals, and they are a specialism of Mala Mala. Guides know their hideouts and sunrise game drives can begin by venturing straight to their lairs. On most drives, you will simply watch a leopard as it moves slowly around the savannah, but sometimes, you can be treated to the spotted cat on a hunt. Leopards are also an excellent animal to follow on a nighttime game drive. Leopards and lions prefer to hunt at night, which is when the temperature is cooler, and their acute eyesight comes into its own. It is on a nighttime game drive when you are most likely to encounter lions on the prowl. Often, these drives have a near spooky resonance, but they are completely safe. The driver may cut the engine, so you can be led by sounds. Your eyes will adjust to the gloom, and the animals will seem much closer under the veil of darkness. These nighttime game drives help you understand the nocturnal world, and you can go in search of specific animals like leopards and lions. They will a beautiful addition to your daytime adventures and can be included on all three nights of your stay in the Mala Mala. The daytime game drives are all about abundance. Since there are so many animals here, it can be difficult knowing which way to look. Hippos wallow in a river as eland drink tentatively from the banks, baboons and vervet monkeys cry out from the treetops, possibly alerting everyone to a cheetah that hides in the grass, and white rhinos provide sublime and usually short moments as they cross your path and wander into a place of privacy. By the end of these two days, you will also know how to distinguish most of the Kruger antelope, including hartebeest, impala, waterbuck, endangered Roan antelope, and the stunning Sable antelope. As with the other destinations, you will have a private guide and driver, and this can really enhance your experience as it enables you to create a very personal Kruger storyline. For example, photographers can spend longer at specific sights to get the best shots, and hippo lovers can venture out before dawn to watch the giants as they return to a river. You can also focus part of a drive on anything from eagles to the unique pronking that is performed by Springbok. As this is a private reserve, you can also drive off the trail whenever you desire. In Kruger National Park, you do not need to stick to the roads and vehicle trails because going off the trail is essential for getting closer to the cats and the more elusive animals."

        "description": "After three nights in Mala Mala, you will enter Kruger National Park for the first time. Lebombo is on the far east side of the park, and it will take at least half a day to drive there. It could take the entire day, depending on what you see and how often you stop. A drive across the park must stick to vehicle trails, but it offers an outstanding impression of Kruger’s scale. This ecosystem also dwarfs many US states and European countries in size, and the deeper you go, the more surprises that you can encounter. Towards Eastern Kruger, there are fewer animals. You can drive for 20 minutes and claim that you have seen nothing, but then, you can cross a ridge, and suddenly a buffalo herd blocks your way. Your guide may also stop and use their binoculars to seek out a cheetah with cubs. One animal can seem to be following your journey, and that is the spotted hyena, which are active animals that are constantly on the move in search of food. They not only scavenge but seek out the weak and sick, using their incredible stamina to find food that others miss. At first, you may find them a bit ugly, but hyenas can be quick to change your perception. While reaching the Lebombo Mountains, you will check into your luxurious clifftop lodge. Mala Mala has an excellent camp and will provide an experience amongst the wildlife. It is the sort of place where you open your curtains to an elephant. Your final lodge in Lebombo is contemporary in style, and here, you can open your curtains to an almost endless view over the Kruger. There will be no other buildings or any vehicles in sight. This is an opulent retreat that is complete with a marvelous wine cellar, a safari spa, and some of South Africa’s best dining. After Mala Mala and a long drive, it will provide a nice change of pace."

Here, you can slow down again and feel the beautiful seclusion of a Kruger safari. That does not mean there will not be any wildlife sightings. Although life is not as abundant as in Mala Mala, the Lebombo Mountains hide an excellent array of wildlife, including smaller hunters like a jackal, which you may not have seen yet. Game drives are the mainstay of most programs, and they can be complement with game walks, nighttime drives, and also riding safaris. You can peddle through the bush on a mountain bike, or you can be lounge around the pool and enjoy a regal view over the Kruger."

        "description": "The word safari comes from the Swahili language, translating into English as “journey.” It's a fitting definition of the experience to come, immediately suggesting notions of an adventure into the unknown. Yet there's more to the Swahili interpretation as the word safari means more than just the movement of travel, but also a journey of changing perspectives. Land in the Sabi Sands and both sides to the definition are immediately apparent. The landscape evocatively showcases how you've traveled into a new world; one where rhinos roam free and elephants tower above the airstrip. And the first experience on the savanna quickly helps to shift many people's perspective on Africa; this is not merely a continent to visit and experience, but one to intimately connect with. From a giraffe elegantly wandering by to a zebra herd beside your suite, the Kruger savanna immediately invites you into a realm untouched by time. It feels like animals are everywhere, either in sight or the sounds that reverberate across the bushland. Your first luxury safari lodge overlooks the Sand River, and there are dozens of different species roaming freely on the surrounding savanna. Just sit back, sip on a welcome cocktail, and watch the procession of mammals tentatively drinking in big cat country. An afternoon game drive provides a close-up, and when dinner is served under the stars, there's a sense of making a connection that can't be found elsewhere in the world. The Sabi Sands is a short flight from Johannesburg, and a representative will assist with the transfer between planes at O. R. Tambo International."

        "description": "As the iconic African sun pierces the horizon, you're out on the savanna, trailing a lion pride in hunting mode. Six lionesses work together, exchanging stealth for a group attempt at a breakfast buffalo. They harass the herd, snapping at the fringes before getting chased away by large males. Their prize is hidden behind the fur and horns, a young buffalo calf being carefully protected by the herd. Getting trampled by a buffalo would mean certain death, but the lionesses keep coming, pulling the herd in different directions, a few brave hunters dragging out the wrath of the biggest males. Then there's a flurry of dust and a haunting cry, three lionesses bringing down their target. Yet the battle isn't over. As you watch transfixed, the buffalo charge the lions, attempting to save their calf. For another hour the scene plays out, made even more dramatic by a pack of hyenas on the prowl. As safari in the Kruger promises, you're not just sightseeing, but immersing yourself in the rhythms of the wild. On a Kruger game drive, there are moments of charm, like watching rhinos or giraffes slowly walk past the vehicle. And then there are snippets of drama, like a lion hunt or two herds battling at a waterhole. Nothing is predictable, and this is part of the immersion; one moment you're following a leopard, the next moment you're surrounded by a noisy baboon troop. A safari is not like being at the zoo. You don't pass a cage knowing that a certain animal will be there. Instead, you escape into the wild and allow the landscape to surprise you. Soon, any notions of the Big Five have been replaced by the beauty of connecting with the wild. Over these two days, you enjoy morning and afternoon game drives, punctuated by a few hours of quiet time to let the heat of the day pass by. Your suite has a private plunge pool, ideal for cooling off and watching the life at the river. A private terrace continues the sense of escapism, with uninterrupted views dotted with wildlife. Monkeys and baboons swing past; elephants roam just meters below, and a myriad of exotic birds land beside you. Safari is certainly an adventure, but few people predict the utter serenity when it's just you and the Kruger savanna."

There's a certain air of romance and exclusivity here, where varied wildlife can be viewed from a private plunge pool and your suite seems to be hidden in the wild heart of Africa. MalaMala is a large private reserve, only accessible to guests staying at one of its three camps. Drivers are permitted to take you off the trail, so game drives bring an even more inspiring proximity to the wildlife. For example, you see a leopard high in the tree and the driver bumps over the grass until you're just a few meters away. Like the landscape you just left, this is big cat country, and the encounters come thick and fast. Cheetahs disappear into the grass then emerge in a flurry of dust; hyenas scowl as they seek a meal, joining jackals and vultures in picking at bloodied, discarded carcasses. Sometimes you see a lion pride lazing in the sun, snoozing with eyes ever alert for what's moving on their savanna. On other occasions, you follow a rare caracal as it journeys beneath the moonlight. At MalaMala, you're not restricted to exploring during the day. Nighttime drives enable you to see nocturnal creatures and further mystical encounters between predator and prey. There's also an option to go on a walking safari with an armed ranger, another way to keep bringing new safari experiences after four or five days in the savanna. The daily itinerary is flexible, and you can pick and choose between the activities. Along with the big cats, the Kruger is also a celebrated haven of Africa's giants. Around 10,000 rhinos occupy the savanna, and they quickly become a highlight, especially in the quieter and private world of MalaMala. Elephants are hard to miss, and you might find one passing the camp at sundown as you sip on a cocktail. Hippos spend their day in the river below, their gaping jaws a mesmerizing display of power. Yet perhaps your finest safari memories come from something very personal; a private show of affection between two zebras, a kudu nursing her calf, maybe a hairless baby baboon carried on her mother's stomach. When you escape to a world like the Kruger, such inspiring moments further cement your connection with the wild. The next day, a final game drive is a bonus chance to savor the last safari memories. Perhaps two rhinos in the bush, giants with a grace that matches their imposing bulk. Maybe a leopard, the furtive hunter keeping you spellbound as she dips her neck and disappears in the grass. Or an adorable zebra herd, an ancient elephant bull, a hundred springbok skipping elegantly across the grasslands. Return from the drive for a second breakfast before you transfer to the Skukuza airstrip for the one-hour flight to Johannesburg. You'll spend the night at a boutique getaway in the old colonial suburb of Houghton. A driver-guide is at your disposal and the afternoon can be tailored towards your interests, from wine tasting in private cellars to the colors of the city's urban forest or sundowner cocktails."

The island is only shared by a maximum of 12 guests and the canopy further enhances notions of privacy. Your suite cascades down onto the white sand, and you could go days without seeing anyone else but the attentive personal butler. Settle in, dip into your pool, brush your toes in the sand and float on the turquoise waters of the Indian Ocean. Like when on safari, your package is fully inclusive of meals and selected drinks."

Next, the ocean laced with a divine blur of tropical colors. A forest backdrop adds another hue and the soothing sights are complemented by the islands' sounds; wind is rustling softly, waves lapping lightly, the odd exotic bird tweeting from the high branches. Mozambique has 2,000 miles of white sand coastline, along with a suite of islands cast adrift in the ocean. It's a country that remains off most travel radars, yet provides a compelling getaway into a realm untouched by modernity. Vamizi is an island where you take off the shoes and never put them back on, a place where time has no meaning and the day slips along with the utmost of tranquility. As you might expect on a private island, the accommodation adds a further haven of luxury. Expect a spacious suite with multiple places to rest and relax, along with a private pool and deck overlooking the beach. Spend your time lazing away the day and then add in one of the activities. Perhaps a deep-sea fishing trip, maybe snorkeling or diving on the surrounding reefs, or it could be sailing away in a traditional wooden dhow, with the captain timing your departure for a serene Indian Ocean sunset."

The gateway was built in 1682 and replaced the old entrance that faced the sea. Two pillars are carved out of gray-blue stone. The entrance is made of small yellow bricks which offer a unique example of 17th century Dutch classicism in the Cape. Soldiers in traditional Dutch uniforms march through the courtyard. Whether strolling through the courtyard in the warm Cape Town sun, or wandering through the castle museum, you can feel the history of the castle and its support in shaping the city and the world around. There is plenty of day left to see the fantastic African penguin colony at Richards Bay. The penguins are a wonder of imagination. Their shiny black and white coats glimmer in the daylight and their very existence on the continent is a wonder to see. Whether through evolution or constitution, the penguins at Boulders Bay not only live on the African continent but thrive along the water’s edge. They nest on warm sand and swim in the cold water. The beach is lined with boulders that penguins climb over. They waddle along the shore and squawk if you get too close. The waves fall gently along the sand. The penguins linger in groups, some along the lapping sea, others staunch in the sand. From a connection to Cape Town’s history to connecting with some of Cape Town’s most visited wildlife, just like a soothing sun, you can always take more."

The San were a tribal people once found throughout South Africa. Their drawings are elaborate and shine with bright colors contrasted with the color soft stone. Elephants stand in a herd. Lines of men are adorned with spears. Hunters and half-human, half-animal creatures believed to be medicine men or healers, decorate the rocks. The drawings were made with different colored stones. Finely ground red rock rubbed on a boulder to form the pictures could withstand weather for long periods of time.

Even when you're brushing your teeth a herd of buffalo can be seen grazing from the bathroom window. Everyone associates safari with adventure. But it's also indelibly calm and relaxing. There are few better ways for overcoming travel fatigue than sitting back and watching nature's remarkable show dance past your suite. At Singita Boulders Lodge the safari itinerary is completely flexible and dictated by you. There's no set departure times, shared game drives, or fixed schedules, so neither of you is going to miss out if you rest for a little longer. Game drives, walking safaris, nighttime drives, dinners in the bush...your romantic safari adventure is completely personalized dependent on mood and interests. If your partner adores giraffe, the guide will go find them. If you're both fascinated by hippos, a picnic will be arranged beside the largest hippo pool in Kruger. Indulge a little further in what's available; as the afternoon relinquishes into evening the hunters are prowling, hungry cats active in the dusk light. Through the binoculars you spot the lions, three of them nestled into the grass. Your guide approaches slowly and the zebra herd seems unsuspecting. After every few steps the lionesses blend into the grass once more, taking their time as you grip your partner in excitement. Wait for it. Wait for it. Keep waiting. And with an explosion of dust the predators pounce and the zebra scatter, muffled screams harrowing across the scorched landscape. Game drives are usually conducted in the early morning and late afternoon light, coinciding with the times when the wildlife is most active. Nighttime drives provide a completely different experience. It's quiet and eerily dark, especially when tree branches block out the moon. At night you can get closer, because while you can't see very far, neither can most animals. So flick on a huge spotlight and you're just ten meters from an elephant herd. Perhaps your guide expertly spots action in the forest. Get a little closer and it's a leopard dragging a bloody carcass up a tree. For absolute natural immersion try a walking safari, probably the most beautiful hand-in-hand walk you're ever likely to take. It's the same wilderness, complete with the Big Five. But it all seems a lot bigger when you're also on ground level."

        "title": "Beautiful Private Adventures in Kruger National Park",
        "description": "Singita Boulders Lodge is situated in Sabi Sands, a private concession that's only accessible to its handful of guests. It's one of Kruger's most untouched and unseen areas. And the scale is baffling. This natural wilderness dwarfs some US states in size. The main national park covers over two million hectares, and that doesn't include the vast private concessions that share unfenced boundaries. For the next three days you entertain a resonant impression of scale by crossing Kruger. Each day involves long game drives, idyllic picnic spots, and private camps in remote areas. And throughout it all, the unpredictability of African safari is at its most divine. Weave through forests and out onto the vast open plains. A lion pride chills behind an unexplainable rocky outcrop. Elephants are also moving across the grass. White rhinos seem to be everywhere. Kruger National Park contains half of the world's wild rhino population and they almost blend into the visual backdrop. These game drives are iconic journeys, taking you deeper into the hinterland yet providing you with time to stop and admire the enchanting scenes. Stop in the heart of this untamed bliss and have lunch, your guide cooking up a feast to accompany the sight of rampaging hippos. Then continue through Kruger to your private camp. The exact route and camps will depend on when you are visiting South Africa. During dry season months the wildlife follows predictable migratory routes as everything searches for water. However, everything scatters far and wide when the rains come. It doesn't matter when you come because your guide will craft the best route. Lost in this wilderness are quaint private camps. Think of them as elegant homes away from home, just surrounded by the wild. So don't be surprised when a springbok herd grazes beside the tent. These en-suite camps feature hot bucket showers, spacious tents with king sized beds and wooden flooring, and solar powered lighting. Your dinner table for two is erected on the Kruger plains and an enchanting soundtrack provides the nighttime lullaby."

It rises vertically, the stark walls juxtaposing with blue ocean waters and sprinklings of green forest. It's one of the planet's most iconic cityscapes. And what better way to view it than from a helicopter? Soar above the mountain, just you, your partner, and the pilot. You first fly north, gazing down on deserted beaches and rugged Atlantic Ocean waves. Turn 180 degrees and ride alongside the mountain, following the succession of peaks down to the very Southwestern tip of Africa. It's a journey of contrasts; isolated summits adrift in the ocean, rolling pastures extending in the distance, and Cape Town neighborhoods hidden amongst the topography. While many visitors take a cable car up Table Mountain to see the city, there is no better way to take in the scene than with an aerial view from a helicopter."

After all, for unadulterated amorous bliss, you're looking for those moments that can't be repeated anywhere else on the planet. Today you're in a vintage WWII sidecar, weaving along the Sir Lowry pass as you drive along the very edge of Africa. Stop for photos at numerous lookout points, wind into the old fishing community of Hout Bay, drive past the immense Llandudno Beach, and keep driving until you reach the lighthouse on the tip of Africa. It's an epic journey, although it's only about one hour of actual driving time. The shimmering sidecar attracts plenty of smiles from other drivers. It's not the kind of vehicle you usually see, never mind in a nature reserve filled with skipping springbok. Perhaps the only sights that can compete for inimitability rights are penguins. Down at Boulder's Beach you'll find them diving off rocks, waddling across sand, and generally acting as humorously as the wildlife documentaries suggest. First watch them from a raised platform, then walk around to a small part of the beach where penguins share sunbathing space with people. Your arrival should have been well timed for standing on the beach and watching the penguins return from their afternoon fishing."

That might be climbing Lion's Head together, but it could also be lounging in a Camp's Bay restaurant eating fresh lobster and ordering champagne.

But a safari can also be defined by serenity as it feels as if you are alone in the wilderness, a million miles from the rush and stress of the modern world. Natural landscapes seem to stretch for eternity; their elegance immediately relaxes your rhythm. Silence reigns, yet all good silences are filled with noise. An elephant trumpets its call through the forest as herds graze on the grass beneath your balcony, a hippo grunts, and exotic birds sporadically add to the soundtrack. After your flight to South Africa, touch down in Kruger and you are immediately soothed as you are transported into a natural realm as tension melts away and the panorama is instantly energizing. Your airport transfer is also a game drive, so expect a few fantastic sightings before your relaxed evening at the lodge."

In the still air, you can make out the thud of buffalo hooves as a herd canters along in a mass of black fur. Excitement is everywhere, but Kruger retains its tranquility. Head out on a game drive and this paradoxical paradigm continues as you slow into nature's soft rhythm, yet every corner brings a surprise to make your heart jump. A lion pride basks beneath a jackalberry tree, content to rest in the shade as two more rhinos saunter past, their horns an exquisite piece of the safari landscape. Keep moving into a grassland that ripples with an atmosphere of fear. Now the rhythm changes as leopard hides in the green as it stalks a herd of impala. Tension builds and the antelope scatter and gallop in any direction they can. But where has the leopard gone? Keep watching and the rest of nature's drama will play out as the hunt takes place just below your camera. After a morning game drive, return to the lodge for lunch before your afternoon brings a second drive and another chance to encounter the Big Five and introduce yourself to all the characters of the Kruger ecosystem. You will be getting closer to them on the walking safari that starts tomorrow so for now, just sit back and enjoy the views."

        "description": "Walk slowly and carefully pick a route through the rugged grassland of Kruger. A rhino dozes 100 meters away and even at this distance, you can sense its belly rising and falling. Follow the guide, remain silent and stay downwind from the rhino. Take a few more steps and then stop, wait, and then continue. Soon you are just 15 meters away and can admire the bulk and the beauty of one of the world's most endangered giants. There is not just one, as the group of white rhinos will rest and create a trilogy of excitement on your first day of your walking safari. There are very few places in the world where you can track rhinos on foot, and you will find three within the first hours of your walk. Continue through the bush as expert trackers piece together the clues. They will crumble dung in their hands to discover its age, follow indentations and upturned stones, and anticipate the future direction of prints in the sand. Follow them to greet the zebra herd, a mass of adorable black and white charm. The herd doesn't run as you meet their eyes and share the emotion that's etched across their faces. Journey further into the wilderness and a herd of buffalo will grace the horizon. The guide will turn if they are bachelors, filled with testosterone and not to be encountered. But later on your walk, you may find the females, who are happy for you to get a little closer and admire their furs. It's the same landscape as yesterday, a mystical wilderness of big mammals. Except it feels all the more real when you're also on foot. After a full day of a walking safari, spend your first night at a luxury- tented camp to complete your immersion in the Kruger wilderness."

        "description": "Your itinerary is flexible during these three days of the walking safari. Your route is dependent on the wildlife as trackers keep you safe but seek to encounter the giants of the environment. It could be two shorter walks with a lunchtime break back at the camp, or a full-day walk with a picnic on the route. The guides may also radio in a vehicle pick-up and enable you to make a one-way walk that goes deeper into an untouched world. Cross grasslands that overflow with impala and springbok. Stop at rivers where kudu and eland take a drink; walk through the thorn thickets and spot more rhinos in their haven. Then follow the sounds to a wildebeest herd as their enthusiastic rutting is an exciting part of the day. You can easily spot the giraffe from a distance as their necks stretch above the trees. They can also easily spot you, but they are not perturbed as you weave through the bush and stand just 20 meters away as the giraffe feast elegantly from the treetops. Stay silent, feel the connection with nature, and admire the giants as they wander off with easy strides. On your walking safari, you are just another mammal, not a large and sometimes noisy safari vehicle. Wildlife isn't scared as it inspects you like it inspects every visitor to its realm. The respect is usually mutual; if you don't get too close or invade the space with too much noise, most animals will accept your presence. You can get very close, and everything feels bigger than your imagination. Kruger gives you feelings that contrast between the serene and the surreal yet it's also an intrepid adventure that leaves goosebumps all over your arms."

You start to notice the clues and respond to animal behavior as you take the time to meet the eyes of the mammals that you find. Approach a river as an elephant herd baths, splashing and shooting water across the banks. Now the giants cross the river and wander just 20 meters from your eyes. It's still safe as the trackers check for infinitesimal signs of annoyance or aggression. Remember, the local guides and trackers have grown up on this landscape and for many generations, they have lived side by side with all of these giants. Their understanding of what to do is as automatic as your understanding of how to negotiate a shopping mall or highway intersection. Armed rangers always accompany your expedition to provide another layer of security in the case of emergency. On extremely rare occasions, a shot into the air will ward off any animal that is dangerously approaching. While big cats also inhabit this wilderness, the walking route is always designed to avoid their presence. Encounters with predators are saved for the game drives either side of your walking safari. A tented camp provides a natural resting point in the evening, a simple but luxuriously appointed accommodation that blends effortlessly into the landscape. There are no extra thrills or opulent amenities as your experience is centered around your connection with the Kruger ecosystem. Dine beneath the stars as a fire sporadically crackles as you listen to the endearing soundtrack and appreciate the lack of the usual noise of regular life. Be moved by nature and wake each morning to the serenity of the bush."

When there is such an abundance of food, you can always expect a mass congregation of predators. Big cat encounters are what the Sabi Sands is famous for, from resident lion pride to the wandering leopards, raucous hyenas to elegant cheetahs that hide in the grass. After the walking safari, it's likely that the different predators will be the focus of your safari activities. Over these two days, create your own program and choose morning and afternoon activities that reflect your mood and interests. Game drives and walking safaris are expertly tailored towards the sights you have yet to see, while nighttime drives reveal a new and thrilling world. The guide flicks on a spotlight and herds are grazing just meters away; buffalo, zebra, springbok, kudu have their ears alert and then they run, chased by a leopard that's jumped out from the darkness. Much like a walking safari, a nighttime drive provides a fresh connection with the landscape and enables you to discover a world at its most pure. The safari activities are punctuated by quiet time at the lodge, where you can lay back and allow the sights of the river to entertain your eyes.

        "description": "An eery silence hangs over the savannah at dawn as the odd bird tweets, and a zebra is rustling in a bush, but it seems that nothing is happening. But then suddenly a yelp with a haunting cry followed by a cacophony of protest. Your driver will quickly take you towards the noise, and there you will find a leopard in the trees, carrying a vervet monkey into the highest branches. Primates shout their disapproval, but there is nothing to be done, as no one had suspected the leopard's hiding place. Anything can happen in an instant when you are on safari, especially on a morning game drive. A little later, you will find a lion pride and hold your breath as they walk past your vehicle. Following their prints, you will spend an hour to admire the pride as they work a wildebeest herd into a frenzy. Safari always brings surprise and every game drive will bring a new scene. Maybe two elephants in the river, squirting water as if on a postcard shot. It could be a cheetah hiding in the grass or a leopard chasing an impala across the bush. Zebra pairs share looks of adoration while a bushbuck herd reveals extraordinarily large horns. Greater Kruger has a marvelous diversity and Thornybush is home to almost all of the ecosystem's different species. Starting a safari here means an easy journey through the mental tick list, with every hour likely to bring two or more new mammals. You will enjoy morning and afternoon game drives in open-sided vehicles, with trackers helping to bring an exceptional proximity to the animals. Balancing out the drama of the game drives is the lavishness of your lodge accommodation. An inclusive wine cellar allows you to taste through the best of South Africa as a whole host of antelope graze below. Spa treatments are savored as the elephants' hooting calls flicker through the forest. Nightly feasts are served under the stars, with hippos and zebra roaming freely on the plains below. Your personal butler will bring everything you need and these two days could easily be spent watching the world go by from your verandah. In comparison to the other private reserves, Thornybush doesn't quite have the same density of wildlife, yet this is balanced by the sheer luxury of your accommodation."

        "title": "Sabi Sands Game Reserve – The Predators' Paradise",
        "description": "It's a quick drive south to the Sabi Sands Game Reserve, the most famous of all of Kruger's private reserves. Most of the Sabi Sands is marked out into smaller individual reserves, the majority of them centered on either the Sabi or the Sand River. These permanent snaking rivers entice tens of thousands of mammals from the neighboring Kruger National Park, some of them migratory visitors and others becoming permanent residents. Each reserve has its specialty, thanks to the subtle differences between habitats. In Londolozi, that specialty is the leopard. A thrilling resident population occupies the trees, and you will be quick to find them. Birds cry out, alerting all the antelopes of the leopard's presence. From an elevated vantage point in your vehicle, you can also find their camouflage. The tails flick and clear blue eyes return your gaze before the leopard dips her neck with cold precision to follow the trail of the kudu. But the birds have done their job, and the antelope begin to scatter, leaving the leopard to seek out another target. With two days here, you are virtually guaranteed to see the cheetah at work, and there is great chance of spotting one out on the prowl. While this hunt may have been unsuccessful, another may continue into a blur of dust and a kill. The leopards are normalized to visitor presence, and they continue their hunt within clicking range of the camera. Lion and hyena provide equally hypnotic moments, as do the hippos that gather in the Sand River and the continued presence of wild white rhinos. Your suite is fitted with private heated plunge pools and a verandah that gazes over the savannah. Grey duiker and nyala regularly roam below, along with bushbuck, waterbuck, mongoose and civet. Wahlberg's eagles soar overhead, and like all of the Kruger's private reserves, safari starts straight from the suite. As you will come to expect, your luxurious suite will have floor-to-ceiling windows, so you will always enjoy the authenticity of the wild. Your safari program is flexible, and you will have an opportunity to switch a morning or afternoon game drive for a bush walk. Guided by an armed ranger, these walks focus on the rich array of antelopes that occupy the reserve."

Yours is not a traditional treehouse as rather it is a luxurious home in the sky, as even your bathroom has an incredible view. Your evening meals are served beneath moonlight and lanterns. Exclusive to just two people, your treehouse is serviced by a personal butler and is exceptionally well-located to hear the narrative of the Kruger. Throughout the day and night, you will hear the calls of the wild as the landscape speaks to you through its mystical soundtrack. Lion Sands is another of the enclaves found within the Sabi Sands Game Reserve. While its lodge accommodation is excellent, the opportunity to sleep in a luxury treehouse makes this one of the iconic Greater Kruger stops. Gloriously appointed, this is also an idyllic place to relax on a longer safari itinerary. As with all Sabi Sands lodges, the surrounding landscape has an extraordinary density of wildlife. Roaming pride of lions seek out the resident wildebeest and kudu and then battle with hyenas to keep their kill. Dawn and dusk provide delightful moments as hippos rise out of the water, the big giants plodding and huffing away. Elusive creatures like the wild dog bring a new sight to the safari, their resplendent fur rising in and out of the grass as they run. The Sabi Sands is a compact area and game drives travel at a languid pace along the river. Moving carefully and slowly allows you to see everything and not lose the raw impression of the wild. The wildlife stays close to the water, so even though you cover a short distance, you are likely to encounter a rich medley of sights and scenes. The highlight of one drive might be two elephant or buffalo herds clashing while on another, there might be a cheetah tracking its prey. There will always be thrills here, which makes the tranquility of your treehouse even more inviting as your day ends."

Few visitors make it into these mystical mountains, so your safari experience will truly be unique and a true adventure. Your next camp is an authentic hideaway, lost amongst the trees and concealed from the rest of the world. You will feel as if you are staying in the trees with your elevated vantage point that provides incredible views over the Sweni River below. As you will have grown accustomed to, it will only take a brief glance from your lodge to admire an astonishing array of animals and birds that inhabit the water below. Open your curtains in the morning with coffee in hand to find hippos, and then an elephant as you return at noon, and then find that your guided stargazing excursion has been interrupted by a tower of giraffe. There is also an onsite spa and swimming pool for your enjoyment, as well as an exceptional wine cellar. Your safari program is flexible, and a couple of activities deserve special mention. This region is one of the very few places in the Kruger for a mountain bike safari, a rugged adventure across pristine mountain trails that are dappled with zebra, springbok, wildebeest, warthog, and more. Walking safaris can be longer here, providing a chance to get out into the wilds of the bush.

Size makes Mala Mala special as a vast swath of savannah is reserved for just a handful of visitors. Thanks to its flowing waterway, the landscape has become a home to almost all of the species you will find in the Greater Kruger area. In many ways, the reserve is the whole of Kruger in microcosm, although that does not do justice to the surprises and sublime encounters. Leopards are a regular part of the game drives while battles between lions commonly create the commotion that echoes through the air. You will be staying at an exceptionally appointed camp that has been the blueprint for other camps and reserves across Southern Africa. The lands are fully unfenced, so it is an oasis in the heart of the bushveld, where private suites are tucked into the green and filled with natural birdsong. Standing over the Sand River, the lodge is a serene place to escape the world and settle in for your final few days of safari. When your camp is this good, you will never feel bad about spending a morning or an afternoon just relaxing as just below your deck, the parade of safari wildlife continues. Mala Mala really relaxes the rules and each of the activities is imbued with a thrilling intimacy. After seeing a leopard in a nearby tree, your driver will bounce the vehicle off of the trail until you are not more than ten meters away. When vultures circle and baboons hoot, your guide will find a path through the trees so that you can inspect the decaying carcass. A full selection of safari activities are available, and by now you will know which are your favorites. In Mala Mala, it is highly recommended to take the nighttime drives as your excellent guide will bring memories that will last a lifetime.

During the morning, an easy walk takes you from the hotel to a couple of bays where whales breach just 20 meters from shore. In the afternoon, a whale-watching safari provides additional intimacy; tail fins crash down in the blue, breaching females rise and fall, and flumes of spray rises from blow holes. Then the whale pair disappears into the abyss, unlikely to be seen again for a few hours. But don't worry, there's plenty of others swimming around. From June to November, these close-up whale encounters are practically guaranteed and there's no need for long boat rides onto the ocean. The majority of these whale sightings are within 15 minutes of the shore."

The ocean side of the mountains is green and vibrant, yet the inland view is one of semi-arid desert and memorable bushland. This is more like the African landscapes of visitors' dreams, one of rugged beauty that's tinged with paw prints. These evocative plains provide a playground for the next three days of your vacation. Tucked away in this remote hinterland is your safari lodge, an atmospheric ode to vintage old-world safari. Sip wine on your private deck, jump into the plunge pool, listen to the crackling of an evening fire; every piece of romance is complimented by views onto roaming buffalo and antelope. Game drives traverse the Sanbona wilderness and the experience is an exclusive one. You're the only two in the Land Cruiser as an expert guide tours the Karoo. Large elephant bulls are easily spotted, their great hulk and long tusks picked up against a raw rocky backdrop. Antelopes abound, from gemsbok and springbok to the burning red features of hartebeest and the diminutive stature of a duiker. Their movements are tracked by the reserve's predators, prides of lions and solitary leopards offering the most impressive of safari sightings. Yet what's this? You had anticipated the Simba -like male with his main of yellow. But this lion is white, resplendent beneath the sunshine, and charming until he roars with fury and a set of sharpened teeth make even the guide flinch. Sanbona offers a very rare opportunity to spot wild white lions, one of just a select handful of reserves on the whole continent where the species is found. Don't completely fill your camera card. Other favorite predators will fill the three days of safari, including cheetah, black-backed jackal, and brown hyena. Each day includes two long game drives with a focus on offering personal encounters with all the Big Five and more. Stop for nibbles and wine as you both admire the wallowing of playful hippos. Gaze down on the bushland and watch as the giraffe towers silhouettes against the sunset. Then stand in amazement as a White rhino lumbers past, you and your partner at a loss for words. Endangered and wild, yet graceful and charismatic, the rhino is both symbol of the safari inimitability and memoir to the African experience. Some of these game drives can be switched should you wish to enjoy alternative safari impressions. Choose a leisurely boat safari with picnic and drinks on board, or strap on the boots and walk hand in hand into this big game filled landscape. Elephant, giraffe, zebra, rhino; as you wander on their level you ascertain new perceptions of size. Hand-in-hand walks have never been as thrilling. Throughout your stay, all meals are included and there's ample time to indulge in your suite's spacious beauty. Some people seek out beaches for an escape. The mammal covered bushland of Sanbona provides the same solitude, with a redolent series of surprises."

It's a road that journeys across the vast dimensions of South African wine, from the more arid climates of the Karoo to the breezy green vineyards of Paarl and the Cape Winelands. As you return westward the yellows give way to lush colors and the rows of vines seem to occupy every inch of the panorama. There are hundreds of vineyards to choose from in the Cape Winelands. But how to choose? Arrive in Franschhoek and check out the view from your suite in a renowned wine estate with stunning views across the valley. Then meet your new driver-guide, a local wine expert who will ensure you can enjoy the full bounty of the Cape Winelands. A sensual elegance fills these three days of discovery of South Africa's wine treasures. Diverse conditions make this region an abundant growing area for a huge range of grapes, over 50 soil types utilized by the hundreds of growers. In particular, the cabernet sauvignon, shiraz, and sauvignon blanc enjoy celebrated status around the world. Allow your guide to craft an itinerary based on your interests. Large wine estates offer paired cheese and wine tasting, or unusual cupcake and wine tasting treats. Roll through the vines and discover converted farmhouses full of peculiar concoctions and lavish lunches with mountain views. Tour the cellars of family-run wineries and sit down to elegant tasting sessions that can fill whole afternoons. It's not just about wine here. Franschhoek is one of South Africa's oldest settlements, a delightfully quaint town of colonial relics and cultivated gardens. Its restaurants are among the most celebrated in the whole of Africa, combining ingenious use of local produce with influences from around the world. Nearby Stellenbosch brings whitewashed walls and refined tradition to your vacation, every corner in this town seeming to provide a chance for a shared coffee or romantic meal. But perhaps it's left to Mont Rochelle to provide a fitting finale to this exclusive vacation for couples. Clink the wine glasses as the sun sets behind a valley of enchantment, and toast to an adventure through one of the world's most diverse regions."

Bushwalks increase the intimacy, bringing you into a world of the smaller mammals and extensive birdlife that swarms around Thanda. Don’t forget about the little five. Wandering these plains are the rhino beetle, leopard tortoise, buffalo weaver, ant lion, and elephant shrew. Springbok and kudu hop around, giraffe stand proud against the lavishly blue sky, and the guide's narrative weaves cultural history with natural knowledge.

        "description": "From wilderness to wilderness you journey across South Africa. A private flight takes you over the wetlands, the dazzling expanse of blue and green admired for a final time. You're flying north, cruising over scorched plains and jagged mountain lines. Kruger National Park is one of Africa's largest and oldest, almost 20,000 square kilometers of competing ecosystems that provide a haven for almost all of Africa's unique mammals. One magnificent sight immediately grabs your attention: White rhinos roam free here, over half of the world's wild population found within the Kruger's boundaries. Horns sparkle and bulky frames merge power with grace, these endangered wonders providing a lasting impression as you touch down and make the short drive to camp. The Kruger is undeniably, and justifiably, popular. There are few national parks on the continent that can rival Kruger for its sheer abundance of life and diverse ecosystems. However, popularity won't dampen the exclusivity of this itinerary. Your dazzling lodge is set within its own private game reserve within Kruger, ensuring you receive all the intimacy and authenticity but none of the crowds. A superior suite offers gorgeous views onto the bushland, with rhinos and buffalo as regular wanderers past your veranda. Turn around and the floor-to-ceiling windows offer uninterrupted vistas into the forest, providing a new set of safari delights that can be photographed from the bed, the lounge, deck area, or swimming pool. Two private game drives a day explore this pristine wilderness. Marvel at hartebeest and their red-striped coats, soak up the interaction between competing elephant herds, or stop alongside vast grassland and watch cheetahs speed towards a springbok herd. By its very nature, safari is unpredictable. Game drives are not zoo experiences. But Kruger's sheer abundance of ecosystems makes tailoring the experience easy. Elephants are found in riverine forests, ungulate herds swarm around permanent water sources, and a predator's movements are regularly watched by trackers; so you define the safari wish and these Kruger game drives will respond."

Oil lanterns provide the lighting, wooden stilts mingle with the forest backdrop, and the sight of rhinos never grows tired. They keep coming; one by one, then in larger groups as they maraud past your wooden veranda. As you've grown to expect, the safari experience effortlessly combines indulgent relaxation with the thrills of the wild. For every dramatic intimate moment or raw hunting scene, there's an antidote; perhaps a scented bathtub gazing out at elephant silhouettes, an evening of quietude around the fire, or opening the curtains to the black and white stripes of a grazing zebra herd. Game drives are private and continue to respond to your wishes. Stay within the reserve or take long journeys into far corners of Kruger National Park, exploring a vast animal paradise that is difficult to take in in just one or two days. Only after four days do you start to appreciate the scale; Kruger stretches on and on, and the wild game keeps rolling by."

        "description": "Into the wilderness, the plane touching down on an airstrip nestled deep in the savannah. Breathe in the fresh morning air and take in the panorama, the odd giraffe neck or elephant trunk poking above the flowing acres of bush. Stretching across the northeast of South Africa, the Kruger ecosystem is the country's most evocative wilderness. And it doesn't end at the border; it extends into neighboring Zimbabwe and Mozambique. You can't see all that way, but you can sense the scale, especially when buffalo herds rumble past on the game drive to the lodge. Standing on the Sand River, in its own private reserve, Singita Boulders Lodge is an ode to the wild surroundings. Organic interiors complement the raw beauty outside while glass walls ensure the wildlife experience continues uninterrupted. Good wine is integral to the Singita experience, and the boutique cellar is stocked with some of the country's finest vintages. On an afternoon game drive, you uncork a bottle in a clearing, spending a relaxed hour as zebra herds and wild rhinos march on past. As the sun descends, you sit on a private terrace with a glass in hand, watching the antelopes skip past on their migratory journeys. It's the Sand River that gives the landscape its legendary abundance, the animals sticking close to permanent water and food. During a relaxed evening, with a bottle of vintage wine from one of the Wineland's most celebrated estates, there's always a procession of mammals to find in the waters below."

From a hidden branch, a leopard descends, elegantly passing the vehicle and then disappearing into the grass. Baboons cry out, alerting antelope to a cheetah that flickers in and out of the highest green shoots. As you drive down to the river, you see the hippos in a boisterous mood, the odd one yawning to reveal a cavernous jaw. Even when you gaze across at a seemingly static wilderness, there's something moving; a springbok skipping, kudu poking up their heads, a low reverberating grunt from a hidden lion. Game drives are complemented by bush walks, short journeys into the wild that focus on different ungulates. Stop beside a zebra herd, watching the exchange of tender greetings, then walk on to a clearing populated by vervet monkeys. It's also possible to explore after dark, with a nighttime game drive that showcases a very different atmosphere. And when the thrills of the activities are over, the charms of the lodge take over, the wilderness extending from swimming pool and terrace, the wine cellar an accompaniment to the rich parade of mammals that flow past."

The panoramas are equally expressive as in the Sabi Sands, just with the Big Five replaced by rows of flourishing vines, and the epic baobab trees swapped out for jagged spires of hard granite mountain. Over 500 vineyards grace these sweeping valleys, some of them with nearly two centuries of history, others providing contemporary luxury and innovation. First, you fly to Johannesburg, then transfer onto a flight to Cape Town International Airport, where it's just over 30 minutes drive out to the elegance of Mont Rochelle, Richard Branson's boutique hotel in the heart of the Winelands. A degustation lunch introduces you to fresh local flavors, particularly the range of Pinotage wines made from grapes on the surrounding slopes. They're paired with exquisite cured meat – known as biltong – and cheeses from the family-owned farms around Mont Rochelle. This afternoon has time for stops at one or two other wineries, a good starting point being those on the winding road between Franschhoek and Stellenbosch. Delaire Graff is internationally acclaimed, and their cultivated gardens are matched by cultured wines. But along the same road, there's more bite and full-bodied intensity in the wines from estates like Tokara, Zorgvleit, and MolenVliet. With a private guide, the afternoon's tastings can be tailored to your tastes."

There's a modern side to the area as well, like at the Spice Route, where chocolate and wine pairings are tried, as well as a string of innovative craft beers. You'll recognize the names of some vineyards, major exporters who have found fame across the world.

This color continues in the township of Khayelitsha, where murals add to the vibrancy, and there's nothing gray for miles. While this is a poor neighborhood, the smiles are endless, inviting you to explore and see a lesser-known side of urban Cape Town. You'll spend a couple of hours with a community leader and chef, who feeds local children from a kitchen in an aluminum shack. It's perfectly safe to visit here, and a guide helps reveal the intriguing local sights. Back to the city center and there are a hundred more influences in the city; a street market, an Ethiopian restaurant, boutique jewelers, and those beaming smiles that make Cape Town so famous.

After settling in, you depart for an afternoon Botswana safari game drive. This region has a rich diversity of habitats, which in turn support a wide variety of wildlife. Along the Chobe River are woodlands characterized by towering groves of ebony and leadwood trees that face open grassy floodplains along the water’s edge. Here you keep an eye out for red lechwe antelope, hippos, and crocodiles sunning themselves on the banks. Lions often rest-up among the trees and palm thickets, watching for activity on the plain. Further inland, the thickets become denser, and mopane woodland dominates the landscape. It is here that leopards stalk, kudu walk like ghosts through the shadows and elephants come to feed. As the afternoon draws to a close, your guide selects a spot to stretch your legs and take in the scenery. He produces a hamper packed with drinks and snacks, and you find yourself sipping on a glass of your favorite beverage while the sun sets the sky on fire in a pyrotechnic display of color. As the first stars begin to appear, you drive back to camp with a spotlight, seeking out the reflected eyes of nocturnal species as they emerge into the night. Civets, honey badgers and genets are often seen, while the loping stride of a hyena off on his nightly hunt is a thrilling sight. Returning to camp, you will find a welcoming fire blazing, and delicious aromas wafting from the kitchen. A sumptuous meal is served below the stars, bathed in soft lantern light.

After settling into your suite, you cannot resist the urge to set off and explore the area with your guide. The Manyeleti and Tintswalo concessions are a part of the greater Kruger National Park region, where fenceless borders give on to the famous park, as well as the renowned Sabi Sands Game Reserve. This creates an area of over two million hectares of land given over to wildlife that moves freely across the region. A variety of habitats support a tremendous amount of animals and birds, including the Big Five. The first thing you will notice is the difference in the landscape; the vast, flat plateau of Botswana is now replaced by topography on a grand scale. The Drakensberg Mountains rear up dramatically in the distance to the west, and the contours of the land here consist of gently rolling hills and gullies. Driving along the tracks in the light of the late afternoon, golden hues paint the world in a magical display. A gentle breeze rustles in the grass, and your senses take on the many aromas of the bushveld: the scent of the earth, dust and wild sagebrush. Your guide and tracker team work together, using their vast experience and knowledge of the region to open up the secret world of the bush: reading spoor, listening to the sounds around you and interpreting their hidden meanings. As the sun dips toward the horizon, your guide selects a scenic spot for you to stretch your legs, before producing a hamper packed with snacks and ice cold drinks. As the sky changes into a glorious display of colors, you listen to the sound of roosting birds settling in for the night, the chirrup of crickets and the far-off roar of a lion. Raising your glass in a toast to the splendor of this elemental scene, you realize the magic of moments like this in the African bush. In the gathering dusk, you make your way back to the manor, while your guide deftly wields a spotlight in search of nocturnal animals. Glinting eyes reveal genets moving like quicksilver through the trees, the loping stride of a hyena off on its nightly hunt, and you are riveted by the possibility of encountering a leopard, the spotted king of darkness. Returning to the lodge, you find it bathed in the light of lanterns, and the roaring fireplace is a welcoming sight. Delicious aromas drift from the kitchen, and before long you find yourself at the dining table, enjoying the first of what will be a memorable series of delectable dinners. Gentle conversation and the tinkle of glasses are offset by the primal sounds of the African night outside, where hyenas call, lions roar and elephants trumpet in the darkness."

        "description": "You allow yourself to succumb to the spirit of this untamed wilderness, where you rise at dawn with a freshly brewed hot drink and set off into the wilds on an adventure that is guaranteed to be different each time. The density of wildlife is astonishing, and each new scene you encounter will instill a sense of wonder in you: herds of antelope grazing in the grasslands, the silent passage of a family group of elephants through a forest, the amusing antics of a troop of baboons. The midday hours are spent, like the animals, resting in the shade and comfort of the lodge, where the swimming pool provides a refreshing spot to while away the afternoon with a book, while occasionally you glance down at the visitors to the waterhole. There is no better way to enjoy the African wilderness than on foot, silently walking a game path that may never have felt a human tread. Smells become sharper and sounds more acute as your senses engage more fully than ever before. Your guide shows you the secrets of the world that surrounds you: hoof marks around a salt lick, pug tracks from a lion passing in the night, the medicinal uses of the plants you find. This holistic experience allows your muscles to move, your body to breathe, and you find your place in this incredible mosaic of life."

Just 25 kilometers from the Kruger Park, White River has a host of adventure activities right on your doorstep.

Your next lodge offers an intimate and exclusive lodge experience in luxurious surroundings. Superior cuisine, gracious service and all the modern amenities make this a lush oasis of tranquility in the midst of the African bush. Game drives here are nothing short of thrilling; along with your experienced guide and tracker team, you venture into this Big Five territory that is renowned for its population of leopards. These magnificent cats are seen on a regular basis, and nothing can compare to the singular beauty of seeing them in the wild, the masters of stealth and camouflage, the undisputed lords of the night. Twice-daily expeditions into the wilderness see you out in the cool air of the morning while the air is clear and spoor is still fresh on the ground, then once again in the golden light of the early evening , when the dusk wakens the predators for another evening on the hunt. During the middle of the day, after a delicious brunch in the shade of the terrace, you can work off some energy on a guided bush walk. This is where you feel the soil of Africa below your feet, engaging your senses to the highest degree as you lightly step along paths worn by game over the centuries. You learn of the secrets of termite mounds, the tracks and signs on the ground, and the many traditional uses for the trees and plants around you. Return to the lodge for a refreshing dip in the pool or perhaps a pampering session at the spa, relaxation in preparation for the excitement of your late afternoon game drive. As the afternoon wears on and the light begins to soften, you feel yourself compelled to venture out once again to see what adventures nature has in store for you. No two game drives are ever the same, and this is what makes experiencing this unique African wilderness so compelling. The only things that are guaranteed are a glorious sunset at the close of the day, along with the almost obligatory “sundowner” stop to raise a glass to its beauty, and a sumptuous dinner in gracious surroundings, accompanied by fine wines and serenaded by the chorus of the African night just beyond the circle of firelight. Taking a seat at the fireside after dinner, you gaze up at the Milky Way and the Southern Cross, and the air is so clear it feels as if you could reach out and touch them."

Fly from Cape Town to Johannesburg, where you are greeted by a representative and shown to the Federal Air Terminal and a small Cessna aircraft. Swoop across the savannah of South Africa and gaze down upon the unbroken expanses of wilderness. From the window, there's a good chance of spotting wildlife herds, often near the rivers that curve around the iconic bush. You arrive in the heart of the big game country, on an airstrip that has to be checked for passing wildlife. From the Sabi Sand Airstrip, you're transferred in an open-sided safari vehicle, but this is no typical transfer. Rhinos roam freely along the track, elephants tower over the vehicle, and there's often a lion pride or two to find. Today, you don't need to wait for the safari to start. The wildlife comes to you. Sabi Sabi is one of a series of private game reserves that make up the Sabi Sands. Access is restricted to the reserve's overnight guests, so it's rare to see other vehicles and tourists on your game drives. This is not a small fenced reserve. Wildlife roams freely amongst a huge ecosystem that's centered on Kruger National Park, home to over half the world's rhinos. Especially during the dry season, wildlife migrates to the Sabi Sands to enjoy the bounty of its two permanent rivers: the Sabi and the Sands. The water brings a phenomenal concentration of life, including huge numbers of the big five. For a private safari base, there are few places in Africa that can rival Sabi Sabi for big game abundance. You'll spend four nights in a luxurious safari camp that provides seclusion and unparalleled intimacy. Thatched huts overlook the savanna while a heated spa bath is a prime location to watch wildlife at the river. Eat dinners underneath gently lit trees and enjoy the space of this iconic camp."

You and your family are completely immersed, deep in one of Africa's most famous wilderness areas. Safari never stops; see a zebra herd from the spa bath, eat lunch with views of giraffe, and hear the grunts of nearby hippos. Regardless of your age, every moment is an inspiring experience; a connection with nature that reveals what African safari is all about. Over these three days, you enjoy twice-daily game drives. Head out in the early morning when the savannah is at its most active. Leopards are on the prowl, lionesses in hunting mode, and antelopes look fearful in these cool early hours. Returning around 10 am, you enjoy a second breakfast and a few hours of downtime. This is when the savannah grows quiet, with many animals resting during the heat of the day. It's a time for you to relax on the verandah and enjoy the spa. Children are entertained in the junior tracker and junior ranger programs. Local experts teach them about survival in the bush, how to track animals, and how to recognize different species. Then there are specialized game drives and walks for children, activities that are tailored towards their imagination and sense of safari wonder. By 3 pm, the landscape is alive again. An afternoon game drive unravels the complexities of the landscape. Warthogs scurry away from marauding hippos, eland and springbok herds meet at the river, and dozens of rhinos elegantly wander close to the safari vehicle. With three full days, you have an excellent chance to spot the most famous safari scenes, like lions on the hunt and the big mammals interacting at the water. Every drive brings a new memory, a new expression of Africa's primitive and untouched natural wonder. And just when you think you've seen it all, a black rhino slowly walks past your room as you're eating dinner. These three days are African safari at its finest, inspiring for all ages yet also filled with tranquility."

Activities are tailored to the children's interests and can include exploration of the local area, with sailing trips and journeys through the tropical forests. Throughout your time on the beach, there is always something to keep everyone entertained. Live jazz bands play soft sounds through the evening, and it's easy to wallow away hours in a swimming pool overlooking the Indian Ocean.

Driving back along the False Bay coastline, you will find several quaint seaside towns to explore along the way, and the African penguin colony at Boulders Beach is a delightful experience. While clumsy on the land, these birds become a picture of effortless grace when they “fly” through the water! Take a wander around the historic naval village of Simons Town, which is steeped in many tales of sea-faring adventures and anecdotes. The nearby Kalk Bay Harbour is used by many colorful working fishing boats, and the fishermen sell their catch at stalls upon the wharf, while seals splash and roll for scraps in the water below. Harbour House overlooks the bustle and color of Kalk Bay and is an excellent venue for a delicious seafood lunch accompanied by a wonderful wine list. Finally take a scenic meander back to Cape Town via the colorful beach houses of Muizenberg and the oldest wine estates of the country in Constantia, stopping for a tasting or two along the way."

A fascinating museum on the platform charts the multifaceted history of the town and surrounds. The scenery then transforms as the Karoo rolls out before you. Rocky and arid, the region boasts incredible geological formations and vistas that stretch on forever. The train halts for a tour of Kimberley, a former diamond-rush town in the late 1800s, and includes a visit to the Diamond Mine Museum and the Big Hole, the largest man-made excavation on Earth.

        "description": "A charter flight from nearby Johannesburg takes you to the renowned wilderness region of the Lowveld, home of the famed Kruger National Park and the adjacent Thornybush Private Reserve. Meeting you at the airstrip, your guide will take you on a short game drive to your safari lodge. Set in a stunning location, deep in the African bush, this lodge will simply take your breath away. Each palatial suites feature air-conditioning, an infinty pool and a private verandah to enjoy the sights and sounds of the surrounding wilderness. Raised walkways link the suites to the impressively elegant main buildings and spa. No element of comfort or modern amenity is spared here, and the level of service and cuisine are of a world-class standard, located in a wilderness setting like no other. Venturing out on twice-daily game drives, you will encounter a plethora of animals and birds here. While the Big Five are sought-after animals to spot (elephant, buffalo, rhino, lion and leopard), there is so much more to absorb and experience than a mere checklist of species. Allow the magic of the wilderness to embrace you, and you will find an altogether holistic experience that is quite unlike any other. Your guide and tracker will draw on their immense knowledge and experience of the area to show you the intimate secrets of the wild, sharing their expertise in a manner that is both informative and engaging. Up close and personal encounters with a variety of animals are bound to happen, and thrilling experiences await you in this most special of reserves. The leopards here are renowned for their relaxed behavior, where they regally go about their lives disdainfully ignoring the clicking of cameras with the practiced ease of Hollywood celebrities. Nothing can prepare you for the awe you will feel at your first sighting of a pride of lions: the sheer presence of these magnificent cats, coupled with rippling muscles and their haunting amber eyes, will send a shiver down your spine. Stopping at a scenic spot to allow you to stretch your legs, your guide will produce a hamper of ice-cold drinks and delicious snacks from the kitchen. In the last light of the setting sun, you gaze out over this spectacular wilderness, at peace with your surroundings as you toast the magnificence of an African sunset. In the gathering dusk, you drive back to the lodge with the aid of a spotlight to seek out nocturnal animals as they emerge into the night. Glowing eyes reveal civets and genets moving acrobatically through the trees, while close to the ground the red eyes of a spotted hyena come into view. These much-maligned animals are as fierce a predator as their competitors the lions, and with their easy loping stride they can tirelessly cover miles in pursuit of prey. Returning to the lodge, you find it ablaze with light from lanterns, and the sumptuous colors of the furniture and fabrics glow richly, welcoming you home. An indulgent feast awaits you for dinner, accompanied by the best wines from the sensational offerings in the cellar. As the sounds of the African night serenade you from the outside, enjoy a convivial evening listening to easy conversation and tales of adventures in the bush from your guide. Moving out to the fireplace for a final nightcap, marvel at the shower of stars above you before slipping off to your suite. Drift off in blissful slumber, while the distant roars of a lion and the whoops of a hyena echo through the stillness of the night."

Later, you may spot an elephant herd, including a newborn that likes to stay close to its mother. Hippos may make an appearance during a picnic lunch, and wildebeest may bring enthusiasm to the early afternoon. Then, this afternoon, you may catch a glimpse of a lion. Within a few hours of arriving, your tick list will be completed, and this is just the beginning of your African safari adventure. Laikipia is a great place to start for any first-time safari. You will be staying in Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, which is one of the unfenced, private reserves on the plateau. Animals move freely between these reserves, but human access is heavily restricted, which helps to preserve the land and provide a more private visitor experience. In relative terms, the conservancy is small and compact. Here, you can encounter a large range of animals without needing a long game drive. You can explore slowly, starting to understand wildlife behavior and getting a good feel for the day-to-day safari experience. Safaris are always fun adventures. Few first-time visitors appreciate how tranquil they can be. Nature will write the script, and the digital detox will provide wonders for wellbeing. Stresses will melt away as elephants wander past, and monkeys chirp their morning alarm call. Animals will appear as nearby silhouettes as you sit around an evening campfire. The lodge will be rustically luxurious as it is converted farmstead that has been preserved in the old-world style. Again, it will be something to ease you into the safari. For two days, you will drive and walk in the reserve with rhino encounters being a particular highlight. Rhinos are one of the continent’s most hard to find sights, and in Lewa, there are both black and white species. Plus, it is possible to go on game walks, so you may feel their presence more keenly."

You will fly directly to the Maasai Mara and admire how the grasslands unfold. Wildebeests may gather in the thousands, which are euphoric animals that are full of energy. Zebras may crowd in tight groups, so their black and white stripes create a blur and fool predators. Thomson’s gazelles may skip around, bouncing endlessly over the grass. You saw buffalo in Laikipia, but now the herds have multiplied, sometimes 80 individuals marching in unison. Laikipia shows you the animals, and now the Maasai Mara reveals Africa’s wildlife abundance. From July to September, there are more wild, four-legged mammals here than anywhere else on the continent. For every other month of the year, there is still an unfathomable density of life. You will be staying in Mara Naboisho, which is a private conservancy that is adjacent to the Maasai Mara National Reserve. Here, you will see all of the same animals but without any crowds. These quieter plains are very attractive to certain animals, especially spotted cats who are raising their cubs. Local guides take visitors around the same concession each day. This gives them an intimate understanding of different territories, especially where elusive and solitary animals hide. It is not uncommon to encounter more than one leopard or a cheetah on every single drive. Drivers are permitted to take you off the main trails inside the conservancy, and this enhances the intimacy with the animals as you can safely approach all the different wildlife rather than just watching it from the trail. Day four will be spent in the conservancy, experiencing the wonders of the Maasai Mara. From lions battling zebra to cheetah cubs peering from the grass, the destination lives up to its hype. On day five, you will explore Maasai Mara Game Reserve with a full-day game drive and a picnic lunch that will overlook the Mara River. During this experience, you will pass hundreds of thousands of wild mammals. Even when the wildebeest migration is not in the Maasai Mara, the quantity of life makes for continual theater. You may watch animals interact at a watering hole, and you may see another pride of lions. Here, you will feel the wilderness and drift off to the evocative calls of nature."

You can glimpse the falls through the trees before the first viewpoint looks across the canyon as a circular rainbow may appear in the mist. Following a one-mile trail, you will walk parallel to Victoria Falls, stopping at over a dozen viewpoints. You will get so close that mist will rain down and drench you in an instant.

It is one of the continent’s largest and oldest protected areas with the trans-frontier conservation area larger than the State of New Jersey. Mala Mala is the most wildlife-rich area within this ecosystem thanks to its constant water flow and broad range of vegetation. Within an hour of landing, the diversity of wildlife encounters may be quite remarkable. You will spend three days going on game drives and short game walks in this private conservancy. Again, a private conservancy means more intimate animal encounters and no crowds. There is a strict rule of two vehicles per sighting, and only guests that are staying at a Mala Mala lodge are permitted inside the conservancy. Soon, you will lose track of the lion prides, the buffalo herds, and baboon troops. Now, you can quickly identify hartebeests, impalas, and elands. Giraffes may be so common that they start blending into the landscape. It may feel like zebra and wildebeest are part of every vista. Kruger will live up to its reputation when you safari in one of its private reserves. Mala Mala has the best location of all the Sabi Sands private game reserves as it has the longest border with Kruger National Park. Here you will be deep in the bush and not on the outskirts. Nighttime game drives will also add something new to your experience. Leopards can be abundant and at night, and you may follow them as they prowl for food. You may also encounter peculiar nocturnal creatures, adding more to the list of animals that you have encountered. Most of all, a safari in Mala Mala provides the opportunity to relax.

        "description": "Land in Africa for the first time and there's always anticipation. All the photos, all the wildlife documentaries; is that what it's really like? Touch down and the mystique captivates, a savanna landscape stretching beyond the horizon. Look closely and nothing is still. An elephant roams alone through the bushwillow trees. Giraffes stand like sentinels to a lost world. Black dots create a patchwork; get closer and they become cinematic buffalo herds. Balule is home to all the revered African animals, making it an indelible place to start a safari. Within the first hour, the questions in your mind have been redefined. It's no longer “will I see this animal and that animal?” but rather, “how many times am I going to encounter them?” After the short transfer from the airstrip, you check into your boutique bush lodge that combines iconic safari luxury with a pristine sense of the wild. Throughout the day, yours is a luxurious base where the safari never stops. Dip into the pool with a zebra herd grazing nearby. Lounge on your wooden verandah and watch life approach the waterhole. Then enjoy two activities a day, game drives and walking safaris that take you across the inspiring big five landscape of Balule. Sharing unfenced boundaries with Kruger National Park, this is a fabled home of all Africa's great mammals. Nothing is guaranteed on a safari. But if you came for the big five, there's a good chance of seeing them all here, every day."

Look the other and a rhino's horn is heading straight for the safari vehicle. Along the horizon are the giants; elephants, giraffes, dust kicked up from marauding herds. Refocus and just meters away are the small and noisy, a troop of baboons or vervet monkeys swinging through the trees. It's sometimes too much to take in, such a diversity of life roaming before your eyes. The sights come thick and fast, almost every turn on the dusty trail revealing something new. You follow the classic safari itinerary here, with a long morning game drive followed by a few hours of tranquil time at the lodge. Explore again in the afternoon, staying out until dusk, savoring the thrills of a raw African safari."

        "description": "Now a new angle is introduced. It's the same landscape, teeming with the big five and more. But now you're exploring it on foot. Local trackers guide the way, piecing together minute clues as they take you away from the big cats and towards the ungulate herds. An armed ranger is also with you, ensuring nothing gets too close. It rarely does, as the trackers' phenomenal knowledge weaves a path straight to a herd of zebra, then a tower of giraffe, now a grazing kudu herd and the skipping steps of springbok. Every piece of animal dung is understood, every indent in a tree can be analyzed, every change in animal behavior guides your next steps. Walking safaris are all about intimacy. You've seen zebra and kudu before. But now you share the land that they walk on. You meet their eyes, and they move closer, as intrigued by you as you are with them. The experience also focuses on the interaction of life, showcasing how everything in the ecosystem is intrinsically linked. Come to a clearing and an elephant wanders by. It's an old bull, great tusks towering far above you. Stop. Stay silent. Watch it roam by, just 20 meters away. After the morning's walking safari, you can choose between a walking safari or game drive in the afternoon. The itinerary is always flexible in Balule, with a range of activities enabling you to follow your own charming moments."

        "description": "Balule is easy and compact, a remarkable number of animals cohabiting a small space. Kruger National Park is bigger than some European countries. Its beauty cascades across the northeast of South Africa, winding along the borders of Mozambique and Zimbabwe. The scale baffles. It's home to millions of mammals, including over half the world's wild rhino population. As you journey through the park, you unravel complexities. Mopane savanna provides a haven for elephants and giraffe. The thorn bush is favored by the white rhino. The Lebombo mountain bushveld has its own cast, with wildebeest charging beneath the stare of primates. Rivers wind a serpentine trail, always attracting a congregation of nomads on the move. Remote waterholes are the scenes of ambush, like leopards descending from the bushwillow trees to attack at dusk. Every angle is different, bringing another intimate scene. And it's all connected. Hyenas attacking a carcass at one waterhole means the zebra herds walks straight into a lionesses' trap at another. As you connect the scenes, you appreciate Kruger's scale. Full-day game drives take you on a rugged adventure, bumping across the wild corners of an untouched landscape. You picnic en route, stopping to watch the hippos at lunchtime. Then spend the night at one of the national park's excellent rest camps. These are very comfortable, although not as luxurious as the accommodation in Balule and Sabi Sands. You stay in deluxe cabins with private facilities, with the guide cooking traditional South African barbecues in the evening. Today you travel north, to your camp located in Kruger's least visited area."

Dozens of rhino are spotted, flickering through the thorn bushes with trademark grace. Drive for 15 minutes and nothing, bar the skipping of springbok. But turn a corner and a huge lion pride lounges in the sun. The vehicle stops and the pride comes closer, a large male staring intently. Stop for a picnic and monkeys surround you, keeping an eye on the scraps. Wind through the trees, following the destruction of elephant herds. Find a zebra herd. Follow their gallop and the savanna opens onto a beautiful stretch of grassland, with thousands of animals grazing contentedly. It's true African adventure, getting lost in the wilderness and surrounding yourself with all the wildlife charms."

Hippos roll in the mud, rhinos drink, leopards attack crocodiles, buffalos charge, elephants splash around, and everyone comes to sip some water. Today's drive winds along the Sabie, a short journey that's packed with drama. On a two-hour picnic, you watch it unfold, the animals congregating along the shore. Everything interacts. Birds chirp, warning the impala of a nearby cheetah. Zebras gallop, setting off a chain of fear across the kudu herds. Hippos grunt as a warthog cheekily drinks beneath their nose. And then the rhinos arrive, everything stopping to respect their movements. By following the river, you follow the chains of Kruger's life, connecting a necklace of animal treasures and creating your own documentary of scenes."

Drive out beneath the stars and bask in the serenity. The engine is cut. You listen to the clues. Animals breathing, others galloping, a loud grunt from the trees. Slowly your eyes become accustomed, and you pick out the silhouettes. Now the guide flicks on the spotlight, and you realize just how close everything is. Nighttime safaris are a specialty here, a chance to explore a nocturnal world but also feel the thrill of the dark.

Spot a leopard out hunting, tick it off your safari list, and you'll still want to witness the same scene again. It doesn't how many times you encounter a rhino; it always leaves you inspired. Similar feelings are evoked when you see a lion's mane or a zebra tenderly caring for her calf. Three days in Kruger allows you to see the different animals. A week or more ensures you can truly appreciate the interactions and complexities. Plus, the longer the safari, the more relaxed the itinerary. Rather than rush to squeeze in all the sights and activities, the pace moves slowly, more in keeping with the rhythm of the environment. The luxury of your lodge provides the serene base to end the experience. But the safari team can customize a day to your exacting mood and interests. Hippos? The guides take you out for a champagne picnic beside a large wallowing pod. Lions? Trackers know in advance where they'll be found. An all-day adventure or two hours of slowly looping around the popular waterholes? Spending nine days in Kruger enables you to try everything, before picking the activities that reflect your dream safari."

        "description": "Into the wild, the plane touching down in the Sabi Sands as elephants watch on. Gaze towards the horizon and giraffe poke their heads above the trees. Transferring to the lodge, you spot springbok jumping around, their fearful antics suggesting that a predator is nearby. Turn a corner and the pride sits serenely, the yawn of a lioness indicating that now isn't the time for a hunt. Sabi Sands is a reserve that borders Kruger National Park, offering all the animals of its larger neighbor in a secluded area. It's an ideal safari starting point, filled with a diversity and abundance that can be seen on short game drives. The transfer to the lodge is just the start, a great myriad of four-legged mammals discovered before you've even checked in. Relax and take lunch at the lodge, continuing the game viewing from a private verandah overlooking the Sand River. Then an afternoon game drive traverses the famed haven of Africa's big five. On the first day, there's often an anticipation of seeing the most famous. Sabi Sands excels on this point. A pair of rhino gracefully wanders past the vehicle, entertaining with their serene stares. Buffalos block the trail, rumbustious beasts that huff noisily. An elephant pride drifts across the landscape, the baby jumping around as it chases a warthog. Now a lion pride, chiefs of their realm, lounging just a couple of meters from the vehicle. Returning to the lodge, there's a flicker in the trees, a tail wiggling around. Look closer. It's a leopard, as content as could be, sleeping with one eye open. While a safari never guarantees you can see certain animals, Sabi Sands always has the abundance to satisfy."

        "description": "Dawn breaks and the Sabi Sands is alive. A herd of elephant is splashing in the Sands River, throwing up ladles of mud and squirting jets of water. They're the attraction as you begin breakfast. But as you sip on a second coffee, a white rhino arrives, its horn a showcase of elegance and power. Inyati Safari Lodge's superb positioning means that the safari never stops; there's always something in the Sand River below, from wallowing hippo pods to an eclectic cast of antelope. Every animal must come to drink. So from a relaxed luxury suite, you can watch the Kruger circle of life unfold. It's particularly mystical at dawn and in the early hours of the evening when spotlights ensure you can savor the nocturnal action of the park. Over the next two days, you enjoy morning and afternoon activities, coinciding with when wildlife is most active. In a four-wheel drive vehicle, you loop across the landscape, initially following the river before crossing an expanse of the iconic savannah. Impala graze tentatively, lionesses wander menacingly, and you're never far from the antics of the park's primate cast. Baboons are shouting ferociously. But why? It doesn't appear to be a conflict between troops. Drive to the space the baboons have vacated, and a cheetah walks furtively through the grass. Spots initially disappear before a slender neck emerges from the green, a look of determination in the mother's eyes. With a Kruger safari, you're not just admiring the different animals. You're immersed in their interaction, appreciating how everything is linked, from baboons warning impala to buffalos and hippos staring each other down beneath your balcony."

And the lions are on the move, a pride inspecting the breakfast menu. This is the prime time to see the predators out hunting. Sometimes you follow their movements, other times you arrive to find a bloodied carcass. And sometimes you arrive long after the kill, watching the frenzied battle between hyenas and vultures unfold. Like yesterday, you arrive back at the lodge in the late morning, for a few tranquil hours along the Sand River. Shangaan trackers are constantly watching the landscape, picking up on clues as they maintain an encyclopedic knowledge on what is residing where. They know how to avoid the lions, where to find the zebra, and which sandy routes are safe to take. This afternoon, they lead you on an interpretive bush walk, teaching some of their knowledge while guiding you to intimate moments with the ungulate herds. Travel on foot and you're almost silent. You're also relatively small. So the antelopes are not scared away. They stop to greet you, providing beautiful moments of recognition as you stand just meters from a zebra or impala herd. On some walks, it's even possible to cross elephants and giraffe safely. An armed ranger provides another layer of security to keep you safe through the experience."

Today you spend the day crossing the park, traversing different ecosystems that are havens for diverse characters. Drive through the bushwillow woodlands, revered hangout of the elephant herds, where their tusks roam through the trees. Now along a strip of thorn thickets, where rhinos congregate in astonishing numbers. Kruger is home to over half the world's wild rhino population, and their horns are a constant part of the experience. Next, it's into the bushveld, iconic sweeps of rustic earth and sporadic green, a meeting point for a great variety of life. Picnic here, watching ungulates graze and admiring the hippos that splash in the muddy pools. Your destination is the mountain bushveld of the Lebombo Mountains, a raw and rugged corner of Kruger. It's many miles from civilization, and that's the appeal. The big game experience is complemented by a sense of seclusion, of being alone in the wild African bush. Discreet and delightful, Camp Shonga completes the impressions. With just five luxurious tented suites, it enables you to be fully absorbed in the landscape. Close your eyes and listen. An elephant's trumpet, a hippo's wheeze-honk, a herd of zebra munching, monkeys yapping; there's always a resonant soundtrack to keep you company in Kruger."

Such a tour only enhances your admiration for modern South Africa's father. Return to the city and a patchwork of history narrates a tale of oppression and triumph. Explore the District Six Museum for an account of how apartheid took root in the city, and then wander the steep streets of the old slave quarter Bo Kaap, where every house is painted a different pastel shade. An African multiculturalism fills the center of Cape Town, where eclectic markets and restaurants are juxtaposed with the grandeur of colonial buildings. Lunch is included, and there are a variety of places to choose from."

        "description": "A dramatic road clings to the coast, undulating and winding above the Atlantic Ocean. It rises above empty beaches, sweeps through fishing villages, climbs to expressive viewpoints, and then dips back down towards the southwestern tip of Africa. Along the way, it passes a bay covered in seals, then a beach filled with jackass penguins who flop and waddle across the sand. Springbok and other antelope grace the panoramas as you traverse the uninhabited savannah towards a gleaming white lighthouse. Is this South Africa's tip? Not quite. Follow a rugged trail down last piece of Africa's spine, to a lighthouse and cliff that stands over the ocean. Gaze south from here and the next stop is Antarctica. Gaze west and it's South America. On this private Cape Point tour, you take a different road back to the city, stopping in Muizenberg for a late lunch and arriving back by mid afternoon."

The desire for adrenaline is easily satisfied by skydiving or rappeling down Table Mountain. Less than a two-hour drive is the whale-watching town of Hermanus, home to three migratory species from July to November. Similarly close is Gansbaii, where you can see great white sharks from a cage suspended in the water. Cape Town's townships continue the cultural experience, revealing a beauty and positivity in contrasting neighborhoods. Then there is the city's unique suburbs, areas with a new organic cafe or boutique bar opening every week. And this is just the start of what else is on offer.

        "description": "Two white rhino slowly march across the savannah, sniffing and snorting as they pass the safari vehicle. Elephants curl their trunks besides the water, giants on the move through the Cape's wilderness. Now a buffalo herd, big and hairy as they stare back at you. Aquila is only a two-hour drive from Cape Town, but the landscape's transformation couldn't be more absolute. Gone are the mountains and coastline, replaced by a redolent bushland that's home to all the famous Big Five. After a relaxed morning, you arrive here for lunch, a feast to enjoy as peacocks fluff their feathers and zebra canter on the landscape below. Then an afternoon game drive brings personal encounters as it explores this private game reserve. Aquila doesn't have the same scale as Africa's other safari destinations, such as Kruger. Nor can the Cape rival other parts of South Africa for wildlife abundance. However, there is diversity here and a visit to the city can easily incorporate a private safari experience, a chance to experience the wild mammals in their natural habitat. Spending the night adds to the charm, with antelopes and hippos grazing nearby as you dip into the infinity pool. It's difficult to imagine you're still so close to Cape Town."

Hippos are grazing, wildebeest are skipping, and everything seems more active in these cool morning hours. Spending the night at Aquila also ensures you can enjoy two game drives. The first one is likely to be a connection of highlights, experienced through the camera lens as you capture the wild in its glory. A second game drive is more relaxed; just sit back and admire all the subtleties and complexities of the savannah wilderness. Coffee and a snack is served at the start of the drive and you return to the main lodge for an extended breakfast. From Aquila, you traverse the valleys of the Cape, crossing extensive farm country before turning into the Cape Winelands. Green rows cascade across most slopes, shimmering beneath precipitous rocky peaks that rise sporadically across the landscape. Wind spirals softly through the valley and every angle is a postcard. For the next three nights, you're staying at a boutique wine farm in the Stellenbosch wine region, where your lavish room commands uninterrupted views over the Winelands. To get you started, take lunch and wine tasting at this farm, savoring the flavors of the day. A new guide meets you and discusses the tastes, using them to build a personalized tasting itinerary in the Winelands. On this first afternoon, a recommendation is to visit some of the region's pioneers, vineyards that delight in their history and quality production of Pinotage."

Choice is everywhere, and your guide has tried out most of these vineyards. By understanding what you like, these two days in Stellenbosch will be tailored to your tastes and interests. It could be a wine connoisseur's tour. Or a relaxed exploration, trying a few wines and savoring the revered gastronomy of the region. Perhaps a visit to the towns of Stellenbosch and Franschhoek, South Africa's oldest settlements. Or a day at the most exclusive vineyards, where the winemaker conducts closed-door tasting sessions.

An untouched landscape spills out from your wooden deck, clumps of forest rising above a sweeping curve in the Sands River. Look onto the water and a few hippos are bathing. Gaze beyond the river and two rhinos are wandering past. The soundtrack is a wild one, with nothing manufactured interrupting the resonant calls of those who call the Sabi Sands home. While safari is very much an adventure, game reserves like the Sabi Sands are some of the most serene places on the continent. It's just you and nature. Relax on the verandah and a whole procession of wildlife roams past, making an indelible introduction to the beauty and charm of South Africa. Your international flight will land at O. R. Tambo where a representative helps transfer you to a domestic flight that lands in the Sabi Sands reserve, where it's just a short game drive to one of Africa's most exclusive lodges.

Many mammals reside in, or migrate to, the Sabi Sands for its two permanent rivers, including a huge profusion of Africa's most famous species. Over these two days, you enjoy morning and afternoon game drives in open-sided safari vehicles, each exploring a different piece of the compact Sabi Sands landscape. It's rare that you have to travel far for intimate encounters with the reserve's giants. Lion prides lounge in the open, and then come to rest in the shade of the vehicle. Elephant herds march towards the rivers, tusks elegantly pointed as they pass the vehicle. Over half of the world's wild rhinos inhabit the Kruger ecosystem, and most game drives encounter some of these endangered wonders. You always move slowly, the guides piecing together nature's clues to bring endearing encounters with the elusive. The grass rustles and you watch closely. Nothing. But be patient and eventually, the cheetah sits up, her elegant spots the highlight of any safari. Bustards start squawking, and you listen to their panicked harmony, following their voices to find a leopard that's draped across a jackalberry tree. A Sabi Sands safari is always relaxed. The trails sweep through contrasting habitats, each bringing new wildlife experiences. Springbok and impala skip across the grasslands, hyena scuttle past, giraffes and elephants march through the woodland, while eclectic waterbirds grace the rivers. It's often remarkable how little you have to travel to see dozens of mammals and over a hundred bird species. Most game drives last around three hours, with the rest of the time free to relax and enjoy all the facilities of the lodge. Even when you're dozing, or reading a book on the verandah, the calls of the wild resonate across the landscape."

A tour to Robben Island is an interesting perspective where Nelson Mandela was incarcerated for 18 years, although the harshness of the surroundings isn't always easy on the eye. With a former inmate leading the tour, visiting Robben Island imbues an even greater admiration for the man who fought and led South Africa peacefully from the injustices of apartheid. Seeing the cell and hearing the stories is a powerful insight into how the country's modern legacy was thought out and founded.

Clouds often roll in during the afternoon, creating the waterfall or veil that the mountain is famous for. The winds pick up and can be ferocious when you're standing at over 1000 meters above the ocean. In comparison, mornings are calm and quiet. A revolving glass-fronted cable car takes you to the top of this newly anointed world’s seven wonders. There's a leisurely walking trail along the summit, either a 15 or 30-minute walk that brings you to different lookout points. With the sun in the east, the mornings are also ideal for photographs of the city and ocean that stretches out to the west. Descend by cable car, and a private guide takes you on the winding road that leads to the Cape of Good Hope, the southwestern tip of Africa. How far you want to travel is up to you as there are dozens of lookout points and destinations on route. Gaze across at the Twelve Apostles peaks then spot seals in the harbor at Hout Bay, South Africa's famous home of fish and chips. A little further along is Boulders Beach, where wild jackass penguins waddle across the sand. Another 30-minute drive and you reach the lighthouses on the edge of Africa, defining symbols of both the city and the continent."

Undulating hills stretch beyond the horizon, the great sweeps of farmland complemented by pristine vineyards. It's a two-hour transfer to Hermanus, where the road returns to the coast. This is one of South Africa's most charming towns, a small strip of ocean-facing restaurants and boutique hotels that hang over the cliffs. Walking trails lead along these cliffs, connecting quiet beaches as they follow the outline of Walker Bay. Particularly from June to December, these quiet charms make Hermanus one of the country's most popular destinations for senior travelers. It's not just easy coastal walks and picturesque sand; Hermanus is also visited by whales during these months, huge southern right whales that migrate from Antarctica. Initially, they arrive to raise their calves, but then the males turn up in October and fight for a mate. Weighing almost 150 tons, these are some of the world's biggest giants and they breach barely 50 meters from the cliffs. Just open the curtains of your boutique hotel and the whales can be seen in Walker Bay. Using a bizarre kelp horn, the Hermanus whale caller keeps everyone informed, the trumpeted call echoing whenever another whale rises in the bay. These three relaxed days include a half-day boat safari, which brings closer encounters with the southern rights and their humpback counterparts."

On these tours, a driver will pick you up after breakfast at your hotel and depart along the Atlantic Seaboard that leads you out of the city center. As you circle beneath Lion’s Head, you emerge into the picturesque Cape Town suburbs, which lie in the shadow of the 12 Apostles mountain range. Weave around surfer-filled beaches and snake along thrilling cliffside highways, pausing frequently for photo opportunities. Consider detouring to the World of Birds or the Botanical Gardens if you are interested in witnessing some of the rare flora and fauna that used to exist in the region. Alternatively, consider taking a tour of a Cape Town township for a broader understanding of the city’s dynamics. The climax of the tour occurs as you drive through Table Mountain National Park towards the Cape of Good Hope, eventually climbing to the lighthouse perched on Africa’s most southeasterly point.

For those interested in South African and Capetonian history, it is well worth hopping on the ferry and sailing out to Robben Island to visit Nelson Mandela’s prison cell (weather permitting). This poignant tour through what is now a museum highlights various components of the anti-Apartheid struggle and post-Apartheid South Africa. Others may enjoy heading to either the South African, Jewish or Bo-Kaap Museum, each of which reveals different facets of South African history and culture. A day at the museum is well paired with explorations of the city’s shops and antique stores. Greenmarket Square is a favorite shopping destination for those enthusiastic about antiques. It has been an open-air flea market in the heart of the city since 1710 and is renowned for its treasures. Alternatively, Long Street features innumerable South African designers and street side cafes and is perfect for aimless wandering and window-shopping.

Drive through some of the country’s most famous wine estates, sampling some of the best new-world wine available. Lunch is central to this tour, and we will assist you in strategically selecting a vineyard for a fabulous meal in a breathtaking setting.

The adventure begins when you meet a member from your safari lodge and are transferred to the spectacular property in an open-aired game viewing vehicle. You will drive through the heart of the Sabi Sand Reserve, quickly reaching the boulder filled banks of the Sabi River. You will be ushered into this airy and tranquil lodge with a refreshing fruit drink, moving casually through the expansive property to your private suite. Take the remainder of the afternoon to unwind in your private plunge pool, before eventually wandering to the main lodge for tea. Following tea and snacks, you will set out for your first game drive. Led by an expert ranger and highly skilled tracker, you will drive throughout the dirt tracks that intersect the Sabi Sands Reserve in search of intimate wildlife encounters. With only a handful of properties permitted to traverse these roads, you can expect near solitude in this stunning African landscape. Pause by zebra, wildebeest and impala as you continue on the search for the region’s famed species, including lions and elephants. As the sun sinks in the sky, stop in an open field to indulge in a timeless safari tradition: bush sundowners and canapés. Sip a gin and tonic as the sky transforms around you, before returning to the vehicle for a night drive. An impressive dinner will be served back at the lodge under the starry night sky. All courses are served with recommended wine pairings that are drawn from the lodge's famed and prized wine cellar. Wine aficionados may even enjoy taking it a step further, and participating in a wine tasting in the lodge’s private cellar. As your night draws to a close, a guard will escort you back to your private cabin where you will slip into a warm bath before falling into a deep sleep."

While there are never guarantees in this wilderness, relying on the expertise of your ranger and tracker often reveals solitary leopards, prides of lion and – for those with a bit of luck – a pack of wild dogs. Pause at some point during the morning to refuel with coffee and snacks, examining the abundant life around you. After a few hours in the bush, you will return to the lodge, where you will be greeted with an elaborate breakfast of fresh fruits, eggs, pastries, and yogurt. Given your isolation in the bush, this breakfast will be quite inviting. The following hours will be spent entirely at your leisure. Some may wish to pamper themselves at the spa, while others may prefer to lounge poolside with a book from the library. Be sure to keep an eye on the surrounding bush as curious wildlife often wanders by your private pool for a drink. Lunch will be served outdoors at the main lodge before you return to the vehicle for an afternoon game drive. Continue with the search for the remaining members of the Big Five – the elusive and endangered rhinoceros, and enormous herds of African buffalo. Pause to learn about the strength of the dung beetle and the call of the ‘go away’ bird before pausing for another sundown.

Drive along the edge of swamps and marshland, where antelope move with a troubled inelegance. Then rise to the summit of the Chilojo Cliffs and admire the landscape from the scorched red sandstone. Gonarezhou is one of Southern Africa’s least visited parks, although the infrastructure has really developed in the last few years.

It’s a wild mopane savanna stretching for thousands of square miles, home to upwards of a million animals. And it’s where you’ll find the Kruger at its surprisingly best. Distances are large, and the game drive will take the full day. You’ll need a little patience, as sometimes you see nothing. But embrace an adventurous spirit and the scenes seemingly come straight from a wildlife documentary. Spot some rustling in the shrubs and watch a white rhino emerge.

Perhaps zebras galloping into the distance, elephants locking trunks at a waterhole, or the flowing mane of a grandiose male lion? Or maybe your safari daydreams feature hippos along the river, giraffes wandering past the vehicle, or a leopard hiding high in a tree? Timbavati responds to all these preconceptions and much more. Located on the western side of the Greater Kruger ecosystem and sharing an unfenced boundary with Kruger National Park, this is a game reserve that offers a wonderful diversity of wildlife. Such a varied roll call of animals makes it a perfect first-time safari destination. Even on the game drive from the airstrip to the lodge, you’re likely to encounter many of the animals from the top of your wish list. Your international flight lands at O. R. Tambo International in Johannesburg, Africa’s largest airport. After clearing immigration, you transfer onto a local flight to the Timbavati Airstrip, where you’re picked up in an open-sided safari vehicle. It’s a thrilling journey to your luxury safari camp accommodation, one that may even include the complete Big Five. Sit down to a sumptuous lunch then spend an hour or two relaxing in your suite. Then an afternoon game drive continues the relaxed unraveling of wild Africa, leading you past elephants, lions, buffalos, zebras, and giraffes. Returning for sundowners, you’ll already know how to recognize up to half a dozen different antelope species. After dinner in the traditional boma (covered meeting place), you drift off to sleep, already excited about tomorrow’s game drive."

Fresh tea and coffee are delivered to your private deck, along with a light snack to get you going. Early morning is the prime time to explore the bush, as many of the predators are on the prowl before the heat of the day kicks in. Spend an hour seeking out lions, cheetahs, and leopards, with an expert guide and tracker revealing their intimate knowledge of the landscape. They know where particular prides hang out, or where a leopard likes to hunt wildebeest. Then enjoy a hearty breakfast beneath a majestic bushwillow tree, a chance to energize, stretch your legs, and listen to the chirping of the endemic birds. On each morning, there’s an option to continue the safari adventure in the safari vehicle, or on foot. It’s your choice, as the program is fully flexible to your interests. You return to camp in the late morning. Relax and unwind on the viewing deck, take a snooze or check out the library, then indulge in an excellent lunch. When the heat of the day is dissolving away, you head out for a late-afternoon game drive. Explore at leisure, stopping for canapés and refreshments as the wonders of wild Africa gradually reveal themselves. Relatively unique to Timbavati, the game drive will continue after sunset, giving you some time to spot nocturnal animals. Whenever you’re ready, the guides will then head back to camp where a romantic dinner is waiting. It’s accompanied by fine South African red and white wines (chosen from an extensive list), along with the animals that roam along the savannah beneath the camp.

At other times, you find lionesses on the prowl, or a pride tearing apart a zebra carcass. On every game drive, you’ll encounter hundreds of buffalo. But that’s nothing like seeing hundreds of buffalo congregating in one giant herd, with the guides getting you close enough to hear their hissing, exhaled breath. In such an abundant landscape, every few moments are going to bring fresh and exciting scenes. Game drives allow you to get close to the giants and the predators. This is when you see the most revered of safari scenes, such as the hunt, or animals mating. The guided walks move at a very slow pace and help you experience flora and fauna from a new angle. You’ll track different antelope, like kudu, springbok, and eland, along with gaining a detailed understanding of how each animal move.

Stop beside a bushwillow and gaze up at a leopard that’s draped across the highest branches. It returns your gaze, resplendent blue eyes shining through the foliage. Then it descends, bounding down the trunk and heading off on a hunt. You follow at a respectful distance, goosebumps rising on your arms as the spotted hunters attack a herd of wildebeest. Sometimes it’s a success, and the leopard emerges carrying a carcass. At other times a sentinel raises the alarm, and you watch a herd scatter in fear. An African safari isn’t about seeing animals in isolation. By spending seven days, you’ve become engrossed in their world, settled into the ambiance of a landscape untouched by man or time. The experience isn’t about spotting and photographing an elephant. It’s about watching a herd interact as you take breakfast in the bush. It’s about snoozing on your balcony as zebras splash gleefully in the lake below, or hearing two lions roar then spotting the lioness they’re fighting over. Each visitor to the Greater Kruger will be treated to different scenes and that’s why this is unlikely to be your last safari.

The people of the community seem to dance for the camera with all of the contrasting hues juxtaposed. In the mid-morning, you will take a boat out to Robben Island, where Nelson Mandela was incarcerated for 18 years. A former inmate will guide you around, and you can photograph the inside of the prison, including the tiny cell Mandela once lived. Once you have seen it all, you will return to the city for any afternoon at your leisure to relax and unwind."

        "description": "Sabi Sands Game Reserve shares a border with Kruger National Park and is packed with evocative scenes. Rhinos march around and then bashfully hide amongst the bushes while elephants roam past the lodges, occasionally drinking from the plunge pools. The eyes of a leopard eyes will light up the dark forests to create a photo that could grace any magazine. Life congregates around the permanent water sources, and you will never have to venture far to see it all, from a zebra drinking to lions prowling for a meal. For a Big Five safari, this region is one of the best destinations in all of Africa. The area is made even more accessible thanks to direct flights from Cape Town, and you will land with plenty of time for an afternoon game drive. As you do with all wildlife photography, you will need patience. But luckily, you will not be spending a full day seeking out one revered shot. Life abounds and your game drives will bring up all manner of surprises and enchanting scenes, from cheetahs on the move to predatory jaws snapping around a zebra carcass. Over these three nights, you will stay at a luxury lodge standing over the river with your camera quick at hand as there are some remarkable animals wandering past throughout the day and night."

        "description": "This South Africa tour is tailored towards those seeking to capture all sides of the country, so three days of safari are in the middle to ensure that the incredible wildlife is part of the picture. Other photography tours may spend two weeks in remote parks, patiently documenting the revered scenes. The Sabi Sands is compact, making it an excellent place for a short wildlife photography safari. You will not need to spend hours on the move to seek out the animals as so much of the wildlife comes to you, roaming past the lodge or gracing the savannah that stretches down below. Within a single game drive, you could be photographing lions hunting, elephants bathing in the river, hippos quarreling, and a mystical array of different antelopes. Morning drives leave at dawn as the landscape is most active, and the light will help you to produce some astonishing images. Return to the lodge mid-morning for a second breakfast and a few relaxed hours enjoying the luxury. Head out again at 3 pm for a game drive that will continue until the last light has disappeared from the sky. Your guide will have a good understanding of wildlife photography and will aim to provide the best angles, giving you more time at each scene than on a typical game drive. Rather than rushing on to tick off every angle, your focus will be on finding a beautiful safari scene and taking your time to photograph it. With the full Big Give in residence, you can expect some dramatic wildlife shots."

It takes six hours to drive from the Sabi Sands to Saint Lucia across Swaziland, and the overland journey offers you an entirely different perspective on the continent. This is traditional Africa, and your guide will stop in villages and valleys that reflect your dreamy preconceptions.

Birdlife is prolific here, and you cannot go 100 meters without catching site of another unusual species. The iSimangaliso Wetlands are a wonderful expression of nature's exotic colors, and the four-legged giants provide a stunning focal point.

Whereas Sabi Sands was all about getting you close to the individual animals, a safari in Hluhluwe-iMfolozi is about photographing the panoramic scenes. So much seems to fit into your viewfinder, and your photos can showcase how everything is interacting and communicating in the bush. It will not just be a herd of springbok as it is also a monkey troop shouting to the springbok to warn them of a lioness hiding in the grass, which in turn will send a herd of kudu galloping onwards. Like an ancient Eden, this park provides a fitting conclusion to your South African photography tour as it pulls together the wildlife and the landscapes to reveal just how raw and untouched the country can be.

In the afternoon, you will have time to explore these towns, which are all just a 15-minute drive from each other. The valleys have subtly different tastes. Franschhoek's vineyards are few, and their focus is on quality, akin to what you would find in France's Burgundy region. Expect exquisite wines covering the Winelands' main grapes as you visit. The Stellenbosch Valley is packed with wine farms, hundreds of them spreading out beneath the mountains. They have contrasting styles, some following classical production techniques while others are very experimental.

Your boutique hotel will feel more like a lavish country house, and a bit of a balm to your soul. While the Winelands are a base for a horse riding adventure, they are also a haven of utter serenity.

Traveling this way provides the best vistas as you take Chapman’s Peak Drive back to Cape Town. Clinging to the mountain, this remarkable road seems to literally stand over the ocean. The vistas will linger long in your memory, and the cute fishing village of Hout Bay provides a delightful optional stop before you reach the city."

        "description": "From Cape Town International Airport, you board a direct flight to the Sabi Sands, where the transfer to your lodge provides an introduction of what’s to come. Elephants roam, rhinos plod past the vehicle, and there are thousands of springbok and kudu skipping about. An afternoon game drive continues the immersion, and the focus is on moving slowly, taking your time with every scene. Lions bask beneath shady acacia trees; rhinos send goosebumps across your arm, and buffalo herds seem to inhabit every corner. On a first journey, there’s almost too much to take in, with so many animals inhabiting the resplendent savannah. Sabi Sands is a collection of private reserves, all unfenced and opening out onto Kruger National Park. Animals move freely, and many come to settle in the Sabi Sands, due to the permanent Sabi and Sand rivers. Your lodge has an ideal location in the heart of it all, with your suite expertly positioned to enjoy the show. From a private balcony, you can watch the wildlife roam by, from trunk-swinging elephants to rumbustious hippos that emerge at sunset. Accommodation is full board, and every meal is taken in a different location within the reserve. Over these three days, you’ll enjoy picnics in the bush, dinners beneath the stars, and breakfasts overlooking the Big Five."

        "description": "A leopard prowls in the sunrise light, descending from the high branches and wandering elegantly through the grass. You can see the springboks; their ears alert for danger, yet their senses not picking up the hunter. Watch the scene play out, tension rising as the predator seeks out breakfast. A little later on the drive, you stop by a thicket, waiting for a rhino mother and calf to emerge. Time seems to stand still and only ten minutes later do you turn around and spot the elephant herd; they’ve been feeding on the trees just 20 meters away. Over these two days, you enjoy a privately guided safari. There are options for daytime and nighttime game drives, as well as the choice for a short walking safari. Each day is tailored, and by building a relationship with the guides, you can seek out anything that’s been missed. Buffalos become such a regular sight that you hardly stop, while the profusion of lions and leopards makes the Sabi Sands a legendary destination. A safari in the Greater Kruger takes you far beyond the Big Five. You’re enveloped by life, admiring how everything interacts on an untouched savannah. This is a safari that puts you on the center stage in a wild world, where big cats are seen hunting their prey and large herds clash at the waterhole. These three days will reveal more than you could possibly imagine. You’ll see animals mating, antelope fighting, and giants sending out echoed calls."

Today you enjoy an appreciation of the Kruger’s scale, with a full-day game drive in the national park. Half of the world’s rhinos live here, and you’ll lose track of the number of encounters. By covering a large distance, you move through the realms of many lion prides, along with seeking out waterholes favored by elephant herds. Take a picnic and stop beside a pool filled with hippos, watch giraffes as they lope into the distance, and find a cheetah perched on a cliff. The journey ends in the Thornybush Private Nature Reserve, where your lodge accommodation is still surrounded by wildlife.

Colors shine in the morning light, the aesthetics of a world wonder painting a majestic picture below. Touch down, and when the propellers cease, you hear the rumble, the growling roar of the world’s most powerful waterfall almost deafening. A self-guided walking trail takes you alongside the falls, and the visuals are accompanied by sound, as well as the soft smell of freshly falling water.

Mala Mala is the largest and has the best location. Why? It is on the water on a border with the national park, so essentially, it is deeper in the wilderness and in a natural wildlife corridor, rather than being on the outskirts of the conservation area. Location is everything, and it makes Mala Mala the ultimate of all South Africa’s safari destinations. Your lodge is traditional in style, without the same decadent extras as its neighbors, but with close to a century of providing high-end hospitality. Touch down and immerse yourself in this intimate world. Go out tracking leopards, as there is nowhere better in Africa to see the spotted cats, and then stay out after dark to follow the predatory cats as they eye up their prey. Back at the lodge, the safari continues, a floodlight illuminating the river and all those that come to drink."

These experiences are what make certain destinations really stand out. Rather than see animals in isolation, you are immersed in the ongoing interaction. It is not an elephant, it is a boisterous young male elephant getting told off by the patriarch. That is not just a leopard, it is a mother hiding two cubs in a treetop den."

So you might see the same lionesses or hyena, experiencing how they act differently based on when they last ate. Game drives are rugged and wild, but it is calm back at the lodge, as you sit around a campfire as buffalo take a drink in the river below. You will also remember the exclusivity.

        "description": "Following breakfast at the hotel, you and your family will meet your private driver for an all-encompassing and tailor made tour of Cape Town and Table Mountain. We will design a tour that caters to your family’s particular interests, whether it’s the historical, outdoors, culinary or retail orientated. What follows are suggestions we find to be popular with families traveling with young children. In the morning, a great family destination is Boulder’s Beach where African penguins laze on the shore and frolic in the waves. A wooden boardwalk allows you to stand mere feet away from these hilarious birds, observing their behaviors for as long as they captivate you. The landscape more broadly around Simon’s Town and Boulders Bay is breathtaking, and the neighboring beaches are perfect for an early morning stroll – or a dip! Other families may prefer to spend the day exploring the variety of museums found throughout Cape Town, which highlight African, Jewish and Islamic experiences. The focal point of today’s tour will inevitably be an excursion to the peak of Table Mountain. For adventurous and energy-filled children, this may be the perfect way to burn off some steam as you climb to the summit as a family. Alternatively, it is also possible to take the rotating cable car to the peak (weather permitting) and wander around the trails on the plateau, admiring the view below and the unique fynbos ecosystem. The plateau is a great spot to enjoy a family picnic, the supplies for which can be prepared by the hotel or independently at the Woolworth’s grocery store adjacent to the Cape Royale. Spread out chips, dips and vegetables on a sunny rock and enjoy the cool breeze blowing up from the ocean."

        "description": "Today you and your family will be free to independently explore the city at your leisure. For those who enjoy the guided tours, a driver will gladly carry on with yesterday’s tour around the region. Adventurous families may enjoy a trip to the Cape of Good Hope where another climb to a lighthouse promises to burn off some energy. The drive to the peninsula often passes by ostriches and a number of ungulates, which serves to build excitement for the safaris ahead. For families craving a bit of independence, we recommend walking down to the Victoria and Alfred Waterfront where you can explore a working harbor with no end of activities, shops and restaurants. A highlight here for children is definitely the Two Ocean’s Aquarium. Here, children can peer through glass at local marine life including gully sharks, eagle rays and giant sea horses amidst a plethora of tropical fish. Wander down towards the water’s edge near dinner time and find a number of laid-back restaurants serving spectacular fish and chips – among other kid-friendly dishes. The vibrancy and energy of the harbor front in the evening is sure to captivate both you and your children!"

        "description": "Following breakfast at the hotel, your private driver will collect and return you to Cape Town International Airport. Here you will catch a quick one-hour flight to Port Elizabeth on the Indian Ocean. Upon landing, you will be met by another representative who will drive you an hour further to reach your lodge. Located in the southern portion of this expansive reserve, your lodge is a fully fenced property extremely well suited to catering for children. Upon arrival, each child will be welcomed with a gift from the designated child coordinator. They will they proceed to plan a number of child-friendly activities that will occur both with and without parents. In addition to game drives, your kids can look forward to scrapbooking, a number of books and board games, visits to rehabilitation centers and a number of cultural activities. Children over four years old will be permitted on game drives shortened to best suit their preferences and attention spans. Spend the remainder of the afternoon familiarizing your family with the property and taking a dip in the infinity pool while keeping an eye out for passing wildlife. Elephants often roam the plains beyond the lodge, while ungulates approach the Riverdene perimeter. Dinner will be held in an indoor or outdoor dining area, and all children will be provided with a child-friendly menu."

        "description": "This morning the quintessential African experience begins as you set out in an open-air safari vehicle to explore the far corners of Shamwari. Departing as the sun rises, you will quickly run into a wide variety of ungulates grazing in the grass in the early morning. While you will quickly recognize impala and zebra, keep your eye out for the majestic kudu or the rare oryx that wander the plains in smaller herds. Learn to differentiate between a blesbok and a springbok, as you learn about all the creatures that thrive in this restored environment. Of course, Shamwari is a Big Five game reserve, meaning considerable energy will be devoted to searching out this famous group. Lions, elephants and buffalo are often quickly spotted – while leopards and rhinos remain somewhat more elusive. Work with your ranger and children to identify tracks on the road, building excitement as you follow signs of your favorite species. As the morning sun climbs high in the sky, you will begin to make your way back to the lodge for a hot breakfast and an afternoon of relaxation. Following lunch in the dining room and high tea in the lounge, you will then set out on a late afternoon game drive complete with sundowner cocktails and treats. For those traveling with particularly small children, you may wish to take advantage of the nanny service provided at Riverdene. Caregivers are always available to entertain and care for your small children while you set out on an adventure with the rest of the family."

        "description": "This morning you and your children will set out again in the early morning to continue on the search for intimate wildlife encounters. With only seven small lodges operating within the park, you can expect near exclusivity as you wind along the dirt tracks that climb and descend the hilly landscape. It is likely that upon reaching a herd of elephants or a pride of lions you will see only one other vehicle at the sighting – if any. This in and of itself is a coveted luxury when so many African safaris are now coated with vehicles. Enjoy the tranquility and serenity of your silent surroundings, listening only to the trumpets of elephants and roars of lions. At some point during the day it is worth detouring past the Born Free center located minutes away from Riverdene. The Born Free Foundation is an international wildlife organization that rescues animals from abhorrent conditions and builds sanctuaries within wildlife reserves worldwide. Shamwari is home to the sole Born Free branch in South Africa, and provides a safe home for lions and leopards rescued from captivity. A tour through the center gives you and your family the chance to see the rescued animals, but also makes for a great learning opportunity. Central to Born Free’s philosophy is education, and they have established a number of hands-on learning stations for visiting guests and local schoolchildren. A walking tour of the center takes roughly an hour and can be done in addition to game drives or as an alternate."

In the late morning, a driver will collect you from the lodge and transfer you to the stunning Oceana Beach and Wildlife Reserve, located just outside Port Alfred on the Indian Ocean. As you approach Oceana, you will be warmly greeted with a refreshing drink and a cool face cloth. The sweeping views of the bush and coastline will quickly captivate you as you walk through the property to your private suite. Complete with heated floors, these spacious and elegant rooms will set a tone of deep relaxation and pampering for the coming days. Wander to the main dining area in the late afternoon for cocktails and a sunset before indulging in a delicious three-course meal. Chefs will alter the evening menu to suit the palates of small children, ensuring the entire family is happy and well fed for the entire duration of your stay."

The seven kilometer private beach is located only a two minute open-air drive from the lodge, making it easy to head down in the early morning with a packed picnic. Laze away the day building sand castles and taking dips in the ocean, occasionally migrating towards the beach deck and lounge chairs for some reprieve from the sun. For those craving another dose of the bush, Oceana also runs a daily game drive for clients. While the schedule changes seasonally, this is always an interesting way to compare Shamwari with another region of the country. There are few properties on the continent that boast both bush and beach with such proximity and you would be wise to take advantage of this remarkable treat! As with Shamwari, it is possible to leave small children with a nanny while you explore either the bush or the beach."

The water is just as sweet as the breeze that rushes through the air. Standing along Cape Point summit you can see the actual southern tip of Africa pointing to where the two waters, the Atlantic and the Indian Oceans, converge. The gentle crash of waves along the rocky point rises from below. The air is otherwise quiet except for the occasional rush from the breeze. The water is a deep blue connoting its depths and cold temperature. A tour to Seal Island will take you from Hout Bay to the enigmatic island covered with seals, seals often smothering one another. Their barks and head-bobbing cannot be missed. Birds soar around the sand sometimes landing in the open spaces between the masses of seals. The seals’ noses are tiny, their whiskers stretch long, and they rush from the sand to the water to cool themselves from the hot sun. Continue your explorations of the Western Cape and its exceptional wonders with a visit to Boulders Bay. The African penguin colony is large, adorable, and loud as you make your stride along the boardwalk to see them in their natural, if somewhat odd, habitat. It is understandable to wonder how and why penguins are inhabiting the African continent but these penguins, affectionately known to locals as jackass penguins because of the awkward, donkey-like bray that can be heard from beyond the boardwalk, thrive in the cold waters and warm sun. They fly fast through and dive deep beneath the waves. They build nests in the warm sand from February to August and molt from November to December. Discover the fun and beauty of the penguins along with the southern tip of the continent knowing that there is so much more to be experienced."

Concealed in central Cape Town, beyond the hustle and bustle, is the neighborhood of Bo-Kaap. Currently it is filled with Cape Town’s Malaysian neighborhood, but is truly multicultural, tucked safely in the shadow of Lion’s Head along the foothills of the range. The cobblestoned streets guide you to the lively neighborhood filled with brightly colored homes dating back almost 300 years in some cases. The buildings are so bright that they glisten in the sunlight and almost glow in the dark. Many mosques, including the first Muslim Mosque in South Africa, call Bo-Kaap their home. Their spires rise above the homes and the soothing chant of the call to prayer moves through the streets. With your guide urging you forward you will visit the District Six Museum. District Six was originally a bustling community mixed with freed slaves, merchants, artisans, laborers, and immigrants. However, by the 20th century the government began the process of removals and marginalization. The removal and relocation of District Six was satirized and metaphorically memorialized in the movie District 9. The museum was intended to create a space that would enable a reaffirmation of identity, to celebrate the heritage of those that had lived, thrived, or perished in the district, along with allowing for a place where people could confront the complexities of South Africa’s history. The museum is warm and quiet except for the shallow breaths of people literally reading the writing on the wall. The beauty of South Africa’s history is mixed with tumult but it is the country’s past that has led to its majestic present. Every explorer uncovers the dark pasts of their excavated worlds; however, it is beauty that brings about change. Travel to the top of Table Mountain on the rotating gondola that gives you the amazing panorama of the Cape of Good Hope. The bustle of the city is set far below you. The color of Long Street and the Company’s Gardens stand out as if floating above the rest of the city. Victoria and Albert Waterfront shines along the harbor. With every breath you take the cool air of Table Mountain helps the stunning present come back, and the wonderful excitement of South Africa is once again ready to explore."

You will head to the world-famous Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens, a lush complex of gardens filled with the indigenous plants of Southern Africa, nuzzled at the eastern foot of Table Mountain. The mountaintops hover over the garden’s edge. The garden supports the natural forest along with numerous indigenous animals and birds. The riot of color cries out from the blooming and blossomed flowers. The vibrant colors of yellow, fiery-orange, and reddish-purple, shine in the warm sun. Flowers that resemble sea anemones glow, their pistils a stunning rich purple while their petals are thin and pink, swirling upward to their bulbous tips. From the lush gardens to the luscious winelands, spend the remainder of the day exploring the incredible Stellenbosch region. One of the oldest towns in the Western Cape, Stellenbosch boasts some of the best restaurants and wine in the region, let alone the country. Vineyards stretch along the valley’s floor to the foothills of the mountains. Olive groves intermingle with grapevines. The sweet smell of ripening grapes flows along the country roads. Trust your guides as they take you to some of the best tasting-rooms to experience the wines like a local. Try the Ernie Els Sauvignon Blanc 2013. The wine swirls around your glass and the nose bursts with fig and a medley of tropical fruit. The palate is rich and elegant, fruit-driven and complex. Explore more of the vineyard’s beautiful productions or settle in with a full glass and the view of the vines from the window."

        "description": "Today you will transfer from the Western Cape province to the stunning African beauty of Sabi Sands, a private game reserve close to Kruger National Park. On the ground and ready for adventure, climb into the vehicle as your guide takes you through the incredible bush of Sabi Sands. The savannah stretches in every direction, a golden field full of life ready to be discovered. The Big Five refers to the five most dangerous animals to hunt in Africa: rhino, elephant, lion, leopards, and Cape buffalo. Each animal lingers in the bush and around watering holes, some grazing on the grass, others waiting for an opportunity to pounce. Your vehicle tumbles over the dirt paths. The smell of golden grass rushes through the open vehicle. The breeze is cool in the warm afternoon. Sabi Sands is one of the best locations to view the elusive leopard. Its golden coat spotted with black dots blends into the trees beneath the canopy, hiding from the hot sun. You can spot its paw or tail dangling lazily off a branch as it watches out for a wandering impala or careless zebra. The sun sets along the savannah and turns the golden grass a stunning orange. Enjoy a cool drink in the sunset lounging in the cooling air, as the reddish sun bleeds along the horizon. When the sun has set you will traverse the grounds in the dark, a spotlight shining along the tall grass as you listen and watch for nocturnal life in the park. Large cats, such as leopards and lions, come alive in the cool evenings. Aardvarks and pangolins graze along fallen branches and feed on termites. Genets, long spotted animals similar to mongoose, dive into the bushes to hide from the oncoming lights and the dark nightlife of Sabi Sands comes to bright life with you there to witness the whole thing."

The cup is warm in your hands during the cold morning dark. The taste is rich and comforting. The sun rises slowly along the horizon bringing in the bright blue of a warm day. Follow the sound of playful lion growls, the noise coming from the active cubs climbing on and over their mothers. The vehicle travels off the road venturing into the bush so that you can see the cubs in the stretching morning. The cubs have pale brown fur and their size and light spots indicate their youth. The mother grabs the cubs gently between her teeth, lays them beneath her paws and begins to lick, grooming them, the cubs’ fur sticking up with each lick. The male lion lies still on the far side, his mane brown mixed with red. The sound of his shallow breathing releases like a huff. The cubs begin to purr; the sun is now high in the air, and the pride begins to move toward shade to hide from the afternoon heat."

Venture back out into the bush in search of the incredible wildlife that has yet to reveal themselves in the golden fields of the savannah. The sweet smell of acacia trees fills the reserve. The rustle of bushes gives the guide warning as he points out a heard of elephant feeding on the brush. The matriarch stands tall and proud, her trunk stretching through the trees and tearing the leaves away. Adolescent elephants follow suit still learning how to properly act like an elephant; their trunks stretch as high as they can reach to feed themselves while imitating the older elephants. They traipse through the brush, pulling up smaller trees to mark a path. They stomp along the road for an unimpeded walk until they eventually make their way back into the bush, through the trees and vanish into the savannah as quickly as they had appeared."

The elephants trumpet, the lions roar, and the impala call out in the morning sun. The calls and cries of the savannah morning will be as memorable as the savannah itself as you make your way through the park. Cape buffalo meander along the watering hole slobbering up water and grazing on the grass. White egrets stand beneath the buffalos’ girth and peck at what the grass leaves behind as it’s tugged from the earth, the bugs that are pulled from the mud below. The smell of fresh grass fades as you make your way out of the Sabi Sands and to the KMI airport. Whether heading to Johannesburg for the end of this particular South African exploration or being whisked away to another exotic location, the choice is yours whether you would like to extend your trip or venture back home. Visit the South African safari reviews for ideas on trip extensions. Either way, the explorer in you, the one who has traveled the globe and ventured through the incredible majesty of South Africa, will never settle for anything less than another expedition; if not now, soon.

Your boutique guesthouse is just out of town, gazing over the ocean and offering unrivaled privacy. With just a few downhill steps you can be walking hand in hand on unfrequented beaches. Hermanus retains a delightful village feel, offering all the enchantment of a cute fishing village. It's less than two hours from Cape Town and a place for watching the sunset over rocky outcrops, sipping wine as whales breach just offshore, and settling into a gentle rhythm of yesteryear. Set aside time to explore the ocean. A private boat safari heads out into the secluded bay. Slowly you cruise the benign waters. There's one, the humpback's immense tail crashing down and spraying water in every direction. There's another two, a Southern right mother and calf unhurriedly swimming the nursery waters. As you tuck into an opulent picnic a whole family of humpbacks coast past. Their leader is 15 meters long, weighs more than ten buses, yet it moves with effortless and uncomplicated elegance. Water jets out of blowholes and the whales continue their migration. But turn around; the next family isn't far behind."

Every journey is a game drive in Kruger, the wild mammals roaming free in a national park that dwarfs some US states. Springbok dance across flourishing grasslands, rhinos rumble across wide-open clearings, and the trumpeting calls of elephants come through the truck window. And you've not even officially started the safari yet. Kruger is one of Africa's oldest and largest national parks, an epic expanse that covers Northeastern South Africa. It's home to over half the world's rhino population, huge populations of big cats, and a dazzling abundance of Africa's mammals. First impressions fly past the window and it's hard to contain your shared excitement.

        "description": "Open the curtains and check out the view. You're resting on a sumptuous king sized bed, gazing out of floor to ceiling windows at a group of wild rhinos. Is it time to get up yet? Or time to cuddle and watch the elephants saunter past in the distance? A Kruger safari experience is undeniably thrilling. But that excitement is always complimented by charming tranquil moments; like dining on croissants on a private verandah as herds of buffalo graze below, or clinking wine glasses with an uninterrupted view of prowling cheetahs. Like everywhere on this itinerary, the trips run at your pace. All game drives and safari activities are private. So you can decide to watch the morning show from your lavish en-suite bedroom. Or wake at sunrise and search for lion prides out on a hunt. So what's a Kruger safari with a romantic twist? You get all the classic safari activities, and then they're supplemented by hidden experiences that elevate the feeling of immersion. For example, a morning game drive winds through the trees. Elephants rampage a trail to follow, kudu rest on the forest outskirts, and then a pair of lucid eyes grab your attention. Gaze onto the branches and the leopard lies still. A tail flickers and the leopard continues its slumber. But it eyes are always awake, ever alert for an opportunity. The game drive continues; mesmeric oryx, hyenas scavenging through the grass, every corner bringing a new sight. Then it takes a new turn. Stop on a secluded rocky outcrop and leave the truck. A picnic hamper has been set up above the plains, complete with wine bottles and binoculars. A huge section of Kruger extends beneath your eyes. So tuck into lunch and point out the herds that cover the landscape. Game drives and romantic picnics are just the start. When dusk descends you're back out exploring, seeking out the nocturnal Kruger world. It's almost eerily quiet and the darkness is near absolute. The guide cuts the engine. You hear something. But what is it? Keep listening and it gets closer. Then a roving spotlight reveals a buffalo herd grazing just a few meters from your eyes. Over these three days the itinerary is completely flexible and it's all included. So if a night time game drive sounds too active, you can opt for a candlelit meal in the heart of the wilderness. A table is erected in a small clearing and dinner is served to the backdrop of wandering herds and meandering soundtracks. Sublime surprises keep coming as you walk into the Kruger wilderness. It's a hand-in-hand walk with a difference. You're following the animal clues and joining those with four legs in their own environment. Vivid red hartebeest stand before you, blocking the trail with 2,000 pounds of bulk and a collection of horns. Up ahead there are more ungulates; zebra, kudu, giraffe, it's all much bigger when viewed from ground level. If conditions are right, on some walking safaris you could be standing in the bush admiring a group of White rhinos. It's left to Kruger's greats to leave the final impressions. Let's not forget that this is a land patrolled by the big and powerful. Lion prides are regular parts of almost every game drive, either lounging beneath a tree or slowly stalking a varied dinner menu. A rhino wanders past the safari truck. But as you take photos you're already distracted; there's a further eight rhinos arriving from behind. These three days satisfy preconceptions and elevate them further. This isn't about ticking off the big five. It's about a private safari experience in one of Africa's finest parks, one that's sprinkled with romantic treats and treasures."

Indian Ocean waves roll onto unadulterated white sand, rivers meander into lush surrounding greenery, and your private villa has glorious views into a haven of reverie. The long coastline around St Lucia rarely sees footprints. While the central beach has a mini-hub of cafes and small restaurants, the outlying sand is blissfully tranquil and virtually deserted. Settle into your villa and listen. Silence. Except, of course, from waves rolling in the distance and endemic bird song occasionally flickering into life. For four days this is your own piece of beach heaven. And while South African Saint Lucia may share the visual characteristics of its namesake in the Caribbean, it gets just a small fraction of the tourists. And as you sip on your morning coffee, contemplating the tranquility, a local fisherman wanders past with the freshest seafood delights. Wallow and indulge, spending the days sipping cocktails, lounging on the beach, and making outdoor barbecues in your private garden. St Lucia allows you to decompress completely until there's nothing in the world but you, your partner, and the sand that squeaks beneath your feet. However, pull yourselves away and the surrounding area holds intrigue and wonder. Just an hour away are rivers engulfed by wallowing hippos and crocodiles. A mere 20 minutes’ walk away you'll find monkeys parading through indigenous forest. It's also possible to arrange day trips into Swaziland from here, a journey that showcases another angle of Africa. Then again, it's also possible to get cocktails delivered to the beach and a fresh seafood platter grilled before your eyes. Like most destinations on this itinerary, the days are left flexible and respond to your mood."

A day in Cape Town isn't enough to see it all. But the city is smaller than most people realize and most attractions are within a 15-minute drive.

It's an hour's drive south to the southeastern tip of Africa, a journey made exhilarating by traveling in a vintage WWII sidecar. Put on the goggles and follow the curves, stopping for photos at Chapman's Peak then soaking up the atmosphere of the fishing village of Hout Bay. Continue further, passing vast open beaches then admiring the hundreds of penguins that waddle around Boulders Beach. You can almost get close enough to touch them, a sign of things to come on your African safari. Some dive off the cliffs, others walk comically across the sand, while couples guard eggs beneath the bushes. Onwards, across the expanse of the Cape Peninsula to the two lighthouses that mark the edge of Africa. Gaze out from here and the next piece of land is Antarctica.

And then there's the beach, stretching for endless miles as it spills into the Indian Ocean. Every coastal view is an urban tropical postcard, Durban not just being a city on the coast, but a city that's practically built upon the sand. You'll be transferred to Cape Town Airport for the two-hour flight, where you're greeted at King Shaka Airport and taken to your hotel. For these two days, you're free to enjoy the beaches, relax in the tropical warmth, and soak up the culture of the city. A driver can be made available for guided excursions to the city's historical sights. Or it's possible to head out on the waves and sail the Indian Ocean waters. While Cape Town is dominated by the must-sees, Durban envelops you in its character and gently builds a poignant impression of a relaxed city, one filled with different faces that all have the same smile."

Bushman rock art is dappled across caves and coves while vast battlefields reveal the Anglo-Boer war. Then there's the giraffe that roams freely and the myriad of wild antelope that graze across the slopes. Nature meets traditions and the 3,000-meter peaks of the Drakensberg stand unanimous in the distance. This rural area is one of Africa's most sublime, an expanse of mountains and fields that's occasionally broken by a tiny village. On many days, it's possible to glimpse giraffe, antelope, and even white rhino wandering along the nearby horizon. Today is one of relaxation and leisure, enabling you to explore the natural splendor of the area. The following day, you enjoy a specialized tour of the Second Anglo-Boer War, accompanied by a historian who's a preeminent authority of the 1899-1902 conflicts. Battlefields come alive with stories of famous casts meeting on the Spioenkop. The lives of Gandhi, Winston Churchill, and Louis Botha collided, and the tales are fascinating."

        "description": "Your South African journey concludes with three days of safari, based at two very different destinations and styles. Hluhluwe-Umfolozi is Africa's oldest game reserve, a place where conservation on the continent began. Around 1,000 white rhinos roam through its thick bushland, stopping on the trails as you explore with fascination. Cheetahs and leopards hide amidst the high grass, beguiling sights when you take a game drive in the late-afternoon coolness. Elephants rumble around; giraffes speckle the horizon, and hundreds of bird species signal their arrival with a call. Over the decades, many animals have seen their range diminished. Hluhluwe-Umfolozi has provided a haven for over a century, enabling many unusual species to flourish within proximity. You'll discover bizarre antelope getting warned of predators by vibrant tropical birds; hippos dominating waterholes with their theatrical antics, and lions resting on the trail and then controlling the evening with their throaty roars. Enjoy a full-day game drive through the park in an open-top safari vehicle, and then settle in to a night on the park's outskirts. From your lodge, the safari continues. Perched on a clifftop, your chalet provides stunning views into the wilderness and the procession of life that's constantly wandering past."

Private plunge pools provide views of wildlife; villas are surrounded by the sounds of nature, and you drive off the trail, so the famous mammals are seen at an unflinching proximity. Thanda doesn't share the same wildlife abundance, but the expression of luxury and exclusiveness more than compensate. For most of your two days, there's no other tourist or safari vehicle in sight. Radio calls alert your guide to a leopard kill, buffalos continually charge across the savanna, while there's something unforgettable about drinking champagne on a verandah as zebra herds canter past. Thanda offers two accommodation options. The safari lodge is a hideaway full of decadence and excess, an opulent getaway centered on your 220 square meter villa. The tented camp is simpler and with very little artificial light, a complete immersion in the bush atmosphere and the sounds of nature. With both, you spend days enjoying a full range of safari activities. Game drives unveil Africa's big mammals while nighttime excursions reveal the landscape in its most primitive splendor. Enjoy game walks around the camp, an idolized way to appreciate the true scale of the Great Plains animals. Tailored wildlife photography drives are also a possibility and there's always the game viewing that continues when you're relaxing on the verandah."

After taking the cable car up and down, you’ll spend the rest of the day exploring the hidden side of the mountain. The back slopes are draped with vines and 17th-century vineyards, which go mostly unseen by international visitors. Start at Constantia Glen, where a cheese and charcuterie platter is mixed with the vineyard’s red blends. Then continue along the slopes to Klein Constantia, the most revered of all the Constantia vineyards. One of the winemakers takes you through the tasting, leading up to a dessert wine that was in Platter’s top ten wines of the world. Then spend a leisurely afternoon at Steenberg, a historical vineyard that’s taken a new-world approach to production. If there’s time, the Constantia wine route has another eight vineyards to explore, all with stunning views of the city."

Devil’s Peak Brewery is an obvious place to start. It’s been the most successful in pushing craft beer into the mainstream market. Their tasting tray is all about classic styles crafted to perfection. Continue to Woodstock Brewery, where their tasters are always infused with the brewer’s quaint styles. You’ll start to experience the experimentation, in Indian Pale Ales, whiskey barrel matured stouts, and amber ales. Then continue to breweries peppering the city, each of them passionately producing something to try. There’s youth and vitality here, in both the beers and the tasting.

After a relaxing morning, you are taken to the township of Gugulethu, where the legendary Mzoli’s Grill is packed with locals and celebrities alike. Meat is purchased from the butcher, a range of steaks along with boerewors , thick traditional sausages. Rather than separated sausages, boerewors is a single circular roll that could weigh close to a kilo. Packed with the juiciest parts of a cow, it’s been a classic for three centuries. The meat comes out on a platter, and you eat with plastic cutlery. This is no luxury restaurant, but rather a local hangout that celebrates the multiculturalism of modern South Africa. Mzoli’s is widely regarded as the best barbecue experience in a country that loves to barbecue. Except it’s not a barbecue, it’s a braai , a local term that reflects the method of cooking on hardwood coals."

With live music and a colorful atmosphere, this morning market has grown into the most loved Saturday hangout in Cape Town. From here you drive north to the vineyards of Paarl. The wines are rugged and full-bodied here, cultivated in a valley with challenging conditions. Winemakers must work hard, and that’s reflected in the wines they produce, particularly the Bordeaux-style blends. These wines are the perfect complement to the flavors of an old farming region. At one farm, you’ll combine wine and cheese, and then at another, you’ll pair the wines with local chocolate. Complete the tasting at The Spice Route, where multi-award-winning schnapps is among the select tasters.

For bubbles, head to Villiera, where their Method Club Classique is the finest in the country. Shiraz grows wonderfully well on the graveled slopes of Hartenberg. For a journey through South Africa’s local grape, Pinotage, there’s no better experience than the winemaker leading a tasting journey at De Waal. Stellenbosch has five distinctive wine areas, and it’s always nice to explore the differences. Stellenbosch Berg is all about crisp whites and opulent red blends. Greater Simonsberg is where swanky wine farms create some of South Africa’s flagship bottles. The verdant slopes of Bottelary Hills provide unusual terroir for vineyards that aren’t open to the public; of course, your guide will be able to gain access to the finest private cellars here.

The wines of this valley are unashamedly expensive, cultivated in the Burgundy style by a very choice picking of grapes and production. These are wines for a refined palate, offered from cellars that use first-fill French barrels and keep their bottles for years before release. Like yesterday, the itinerary will follow your taste buds. After a day of tasting, you have a dinner reservation at a restaurant that combines old-world European influence with the tantalizing tastes of Africa. Like the vineyards, you can appreciate how foreign influence has pervaded through Franschhoek. Yet everything is also distinctively African, celebrated through the beautiful vistas, welcoming atmosphere, and friendly smiles that greet every turn. The beauty of exploring South African food and wine is that it’s such a part of local culture.

        "description": "From the luscious landscapes of the temperate Garden Route, you will cross a mountain pass to the Karoo. In just one hour, the landscape and climate will change dramatically. Arid plains will stretch out, and you can watch the dust swirl with springbok herds sometimes passing the road. These animals are specially adapted to survive without water. An old-world farm life dominates the small town and makes an intriguing contrast from Cape Town and Hermanus. Then, there are the Cango Caves. You will spend the afternoon exploring these caves and wandering in a murky world of stalactites. It is an adventure, and this is what a South African vacation is all about."

        "description": "With the second day in Oudtshoorn, there are two iconic activities to try. An elephant rescue center provides some intimate moments with gentle giants, including the inspiring feeling of a trunk as it moves across your shoulder. It is also an excellent place to get excited about the safari that is yet to come. At an ostrich farm, you will then learn all about the strange, flightless birds. Anyone weighing under 200 Ibs. can also ride an ostrich although you may prefer to watch the jockeys show you how it is done. With two days here, you will also explore Oudtshoorn town and get to know its traditional ways of life in addition to its superb farm-style food. From Oudtshoorn, you will drive an hour back to George this afternoon, so you can fly to Johannesburg for two nights."

        "description": "Johannesburg is a city of many colors and cultures. It has developed enormously over the last five years with the city center trying to reinvent itself through popup stores and artistic precincts. You can explore some of this in the morning before spending the afternoon in the Soweto township. This was South Africa’s largest township and was at the heart of a battle against apartheid. You will visit Nelson Mandela’s former house and witness the Hector Pieterson Museum to help you to understand what happened here during apartheid. Then, you will cycle the streets with a local guide to understand life today. This includes meeting with families, tasting local food and drinks, discovering vibrant street graffiti, and learning the welcoming way of life in Soweto."

        "title": "Timbavati Private Game Reserve – Intimate Big-Five Safari",
        "description": "Excitement builds when you fly from Johannesburg to the Kruger, which is one of Africa’s most famous safari ecosystems. Stretching across an area larger than New Jersey state, the Kruger is home to millions of wild mammals and a quintessential Big Five safari. Your safari will take place in the Timbavati, which is a private game reserve on the Western side of this ecosystem. Although the reserve is partially fenced, which is a necessary precaution due to poaching, it has a long unfenced border with Kruger National Park, providing an uninterrupted pathway for wildlife. Water brings animals to the Timbavati, especially in the dry season from May to October. Migratory arrivals meet with residents, and the profusion of animals soars. You will find a diversity of wildlife and safari experiences all over the Kruger. Timbavati is great for families because all the action is compressed into a relatively small but wild area. You can see all the famous animals and explore their behavior without spending very long days out on the hot and dusty bushveld. Instead, in Timbavati, you will go on morning and afternoon game drives with time to rest and relax through the middle of the day. There will be the option of a nighttime drive and also a game walk for anyone over the age of 12. You can often see the animals directly from the lodge because it overlooks a river where many species come to drink. Elephants may meander through the trees with swinging trunks and flapping ears, lions can be easy to find on the open bushveld in Timbavati, and rhinos can be shy, but your guides will know where they hide. There will also be the Timbavati leopards, which are beautiful predators that live in the trees and hunt on the savannah floor. These famous five are joined by a complete collection of other safari favorites, like giraffe, zebra, wildebeest, roan antelopes, and so many more. And remember that all these animals are not seen in isolation. You will encounter them as they truly are, running free through the wilderness."
