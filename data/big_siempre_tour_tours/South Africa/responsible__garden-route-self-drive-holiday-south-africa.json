  "placesVisited": "",
  "generalInfo": "A trip perhaps for second time visitors to South Africa, or those wanting to get off the beaten track and self-immerse into the local culture.  This is a superb sample self drive itinerary starting in Cape Town, passing through the Karoo - with incredible scenery and tiny villages, along the Garden Route - with lots of opportunities for hiking, boat trips - and amazingly fresh seafood, as well as a little-known wine route - to the Eastern Cape's Sunshine Coast and Wild Coast.  Well off the beaten track, these last stops are areas begging to be explored, with picturesque villages, pristine white sand beaches, friendly locals, and scenic walks and hikes, fishing, kayaking, and sand boarding opportunities - as well as simple relaxation.",
