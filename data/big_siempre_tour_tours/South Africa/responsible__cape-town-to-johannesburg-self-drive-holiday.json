      "description": "CAPE MALAY COOKING CLASS: For most travelers, the vibrant houses in Bo-Kaap are just a cool spot to take a travel picture, but there’s a whole history behind them. This area used to be home to South Asian slaves, and now their descendants, the Cape Malays, live here, still keeping their culture and traditions alive. You can really taste it in the food – think biryanis and samosas. Today you will join a local cooking class, and you’ll get to meet them, hear their stories, learn about the spices they use, and of course you whip up some of those delicious dishes yourself."
