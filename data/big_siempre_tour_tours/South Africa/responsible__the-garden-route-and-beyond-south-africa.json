  "generalInfo": "The Garden Route, which traverses the south coast of South Africa from Cape Town to Addo, is arguably one of the most splendid road trips you can do anywhere on the planet. Whilst it can in theory be driven in a day (under 12 hours, as it's around 1 000km long), in reality the massive variety of biome, the number of experiences and places along the route mean that an absolute minimum is really five days.<br/><br/>So we've deliberately kept the pace of this journey sedate to allow you to fully experience the unique identity of each place along the route: the Garden Route is often touted as a 'drive along the N2' (that's the name of the main highway that connects the larger towns) and whilst this is to an extent true, getting off the highway and getting to the more remote locations makes this into a truly magical trip.<br/><br/>This trip is 100% ethical; every supplier has made a commitment - and has been independently audited in the fulfillment of that commitment - to placing people and planet first in every aspect of their business practice. Rest assured then that everything you will see and do on this trip makes a positive impact on the places and people you visit, not the opposite. This is a self-drive route but we can just as easily make this into a guided and chauffered route if you like. Contact us for a price.",
