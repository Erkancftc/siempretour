      "description": "Arrival at Hoedspruit & Welcome to Rukiya Hoedspruit (Eastgate) Airport is the gateway to South Africa’s premier wildlife viewing reserves, with daily flights arriving from Johannesburg and Cape Town. We can arrange your internal flight to Hoedspruit (approximately 50 minutes). Upon landing, you'll be greeted by your On Track Safaris (OTS) representative and transferred to Rukiya Safari Camp. Keep an eye out as you drive past game fences—your first wildlife sightings may happen before you even unpack! No matter how you arrive, you'll reach Rukiya Safari Camp in time to settle in, unwind, and enjoy the tranquil surroundings. You’ll also receive a reusable On Track Safaris metal water bottle to help reduce plastic use during your stay, along with a spoor card to help identify animal tracks during game drives and bush walks—be sure to keep it handy! Rukiya is a small, luxury eco-tented camp nestled along the banks of the year-round Blyde River, shaded by towering trees. It’s also an important location for our leopard research, making your visit part of a meaningful conservation effort. Depending on your arrival time, lunch will be served, followed by an optional afternoon drive through the Wild Rivers Reserve. Don’t forget to order your sundowner drinks for the perfect end to your first day. At Rukiya, you’ll receive a complimentary camera trap (one per couple or single guest) as a gift from On Track Safaris. On your first day, with guidance from our expert team, you’ll choose a location on the reserve where you believe leopards and other wildlife may pass. These motion-sensitive devices capture photos or short videos of animals—day or night—offering a thrilling glimpse into their natural behaviour. Camera Trap Challenge Capturing Africa’s wildlife with a camera trap is both exciting and deeply rewarding. Begin by selecting a location frequented by animals—such as watering holes, game trails, or mineral licks—where wildlife naturally congregates. While our guides are there to assist, the final choice is yours. Your camera will be securely mounted to a tree or post at animal height and angled slightly downward for optimal shots. Equipped with infrared technology, it operates silently to avoid disturbing nocturnal creatures. The camera will run continuously throughout your stay, capturing candid moments of Africa’s untamed beauty. These will be checked before departing Rukiya. After dinner at the lodge, you’ll likely retire early to your tent, ready for your first early morning rise and the adventures ahead."

      "description": "A Day at Rukiya Safari Camp Your days at Rukiya begin with a gentle wake-up call, accompanied by a warm drink and traditional rusks (local biscuits) to start your morning. You'll then set off on a morning game drive through the Wild Rivers Reserve and into the adjacent Balule Reserve, part of the Greater Kruger National Park. This marks your first adventure in a 'Big5' Reserve. These drives may extend longer than usual, often including a bush breakfast served in the wild, before returning to the lodge in the late morning. Lunch is served at the lodge, followed by time to unwind and take in the tranquil views from your private deck. Bush Senses Experience During your stay, you'll have the chance to participate in our unique Bush Senses activity—a short guided walk paired with a sensory exercise developed over many years. This popular experience encourages you to engage all your senses in the bush: not just sight, but also smell, hearing, and touch. In a world where modern living dulls our natural instincts, this simple and fun activity helps sharpen your awareness—perfect preparation for any safari. Conservation & Camera Trap Check You’ll also be invited to attend a fascinating presentation by the Ingwe Leopard Research Team, offering insight into the vital conservation work happening right on the reserve. In the afternoon, your PM drive will explore the Wild Rivers Reserve, possibly passing by your camera trap to ensure it’s still in place. Curious hyenas and baboons are known to tamper with these devices—sometimes even taking selfies before abandoning them in the bush. The resulting photos are often hilarious and a highlight of the trip. Evening at the Lodge After your afternoon adventure, dinner will be served at the lodge, offering a chance to reflect on the day’s sightings and stories under the African sky."

      "description": "Meet the Anti-Poaching Dog Unit & Visit a Community Project Today offers a well-earned break from early morning game drives, allowing you to enjoy a leisurely start before breakfast. Afterward, you'll embark on a meaningful day excursion, beginning with a visit to the K9 Conservation Group, followed by lunch and an afternoon at Zingela Ulwazi, a local community initiative. K9 Conservation Group The K9 Conservation Group provides vital anti-poaching support to privately owned conservation areas and game reserves through the deployment of elite, highly trained working dog units. You'll meet some of the dedicated rangers and their remarkable canine partners, and learn about the critical role they play in protecting wildlife. A highlight of the visit includes heading into the nearby bush for a live demonstration. Watch as the dogs expertly locate poachers’ snares and track human scent—an eye-opening experience that showcases their incredible skills and intelligence. They’re not only impressive but also a joy to be around. After the demonstration, enjoy lunch at a local café (at your own expense). Zingela Ulwazi Community Project In the afternoon, you'll visit Zingela Ulwazi, a grassroots non-profit focused on empowering rural women through sustainable farming, self-defense training, and community upliftment. During your visit, you’ll explore their inspiring projects, meet the women leading change, and see firsthand how small initiatives can make a big impact. To end the visit, we’ll stop by a lively community hub where children gather after school. You’ll have the opportunity to help serve lunch and share in the warmth of their daily routine—a heartwarming experience that connects you to the spirit of the community. Return via Hoedspruit On your way back to Rukiya, we’ll pass through the charming town of Hoedspruit, where you can opt to stop for a bit of shopping or continue directly to the lodge, arriving in the late afternoon. Dinner will be served in the evening, rounding off a day filled with purpose, connection, and unforgettable encounters."

Camera Trap Review & Riverside Relaxation On your return from the morning game drive you'll collect your camera trap and return to the lodge, where—assisted by your guides—you’ll review the photographs it captured. You're welcome to download any images you’d like to keep. If you’ve managed to photograph a leopard, those images will be added to the Ingwe Research Program database, contributing to our ongoing conservation efforts. You’ll also have the option to donate your camera trap to support further research, or—as many guests choose—take it home to continue your wildlife photography adventures. Afternoon Leisure After lunch, enjoy some well-deserved downtime. Grab a cooler box with refreshing drinks and head to our outdoor lounger area along the riverbank. It’s the perfect spot to soak in the peace and quiet of this serene setting, watch birds flitting through the trees, and perhaps spot a hippo or crocodile basking on the opposite bank. Evening Dining Dinner will be served in the evening, rounding off a day of discovery and relaxation in the heart of the bush."
