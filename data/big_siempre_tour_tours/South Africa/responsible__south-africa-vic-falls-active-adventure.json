  "generalInfo": "Tick 'been there' on your bucketlist with this journey to visit three of the world's most famous natural landmarks: Cape Town's Table Mountain, the transfrontier Kruger National Park and the largest waterfall in the world, Victoria Falls. This journey is ideally suited to first-time visitors to Southern Africa.<br/><br/>You can make this trip as active or passive as you like: we've included abseiling off Table Mountain, zipling across Victoria Falls and walking safaris in Kruger but you can just as easily take the cablecar to the mountain top or a river cruise on the mighty Zambezi.<br/><br/>Pricing is based on the assumption that you'll self-drive but this can just as easily be fully guided or partially guided, as you'd prefer - just ask us.<br/><br/>We've only used ethical and sustainable businesses, most of them Fair Trade in Tourism accredited, to build this journey. We are locally based in South Africa and personally visit and research every single place we use in our journeys to ensure standards are being met. <br/><br/>This journey's intinerary is just one way of seeing the landmarks: the whole trip can of course be done in reverse, made longer or shorter or include different landmarks, as you see fit.",
