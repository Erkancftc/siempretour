From there, a scenic 4-hour drive will bring you to Pakamisa Lodge, nestled on the Pakamisa Mountain plateau in the heart of Zululand. The lodge offers breathtaking views of the Pongola River valleys and the Reserve's rolling hills. With its unique blend of Spanish architecture and African ambiance, Pakamisa Lodge is home to 29 Arabian and Boerperd horses, lovingly cared for by the owner, Isabella. Upon arrival, settle into your spacious suite before heading out on a guided bush walk with experienced rangers. During the walk, you'll explore the reserve's diverse flora and fauna and may encounter giraffes, zebras, wildebeests, impalas, and warthogs. During your stay, you'll enjoy both horseback safaris and game drives. The horseback safari, which is suitable for all riding levels, takes you on a 2-hour journey through the lodge's private 2,500-hectare reserve. As you ride, you'll have the opportunity to see a variety of wildlife, including elephants, buffalos, leopards, hyenas, cheetahs, and rhinos, all against the backdrop of stunning mountain, valley, and plain views. Lunch breaks at the lodge provide a pleasant interlude. Alternatively, you can opt for a game drive, where you'll explore the reserve in an open safari vehicle, guided by knowledgeable experts. Spend 3 hours in the morning and afternoon observing and photographing wildlife, learning about their behavior, conservation efforts, and the region's rich history and culture. Night drives offer a chance to spot nocturnal animals such as owls, jackals, porcupines, and bush babies. Dining at Pakamisa is a culinary experience to savor. The award-winning El Prado restaurant offers a diverse range of cuisines, while the outdoor area provides a relaxed setting for a South African braai or bush dinner under the stars. The outdoor fireplace invites you to unwind with conversation and stargazing, making for a memorable African evening."
