We highly recommend ascending the mountain using the cable car, which has accessible access including elevators, ramps and parking bays. We will provide you with a map created for wheelchair users to navigate your way around the top of the mountain to get the best views out over the bay and beyond. There are also two accessible restaurants at the top of the mountain. We can organise for this trip to be guided or accompanied or just book the tickets and transfers."
