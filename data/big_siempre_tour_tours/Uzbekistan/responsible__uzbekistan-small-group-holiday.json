  "generalInfo": "Hear someone mention Uzbekistan and you’ll immediately think of the mysteries and legends of the ancient Silk Road – and this small group holiday takes you to its very heart. Along with a band of likeminded travellers and expert guides, you’ll spend ten days exploring the treasures of this extraordinary country and you’re sure to rack up a large collection of memories that will stay with you for a long time to come.  <br/><br/>Your journey begins in the Uzbek capital Tashkent, where there’s time to acclimatise before hopping on a plane to Nukus. Here, highlights include a visit to the Savitsky Museum, which details the region’s Karakalpakstan culture and early 1900s avantgarde Russian art. Next, it’s on to Khiva and its ancient city centre, before following the Silk Route to Bukhara, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the best preserved medieval city in Central Asia.  <br/><br/>The peace and quiet of the Nuratau Mountains are next on the agenda, and you’ll get a real insight into local village life around these parts. Your journey ends in fabled Samarkand, where the myths and legends of the Silk Road still loom large.  <br/>",

      "description": "Tashkent: City Tour Including Bazaar & Opera House: Tashkent is Uzbekistan’s vibrant capital which sat at the heart of the old Central Asian trading routes, gaining prominence under the Mongols and the Shabanids, before finally being absorbed by the expansionist policies of the Russian empire during the 19th century. Flattened by a devastating earthquake in the mid-1960s, the city was reinvented by the Kremlin to represent the very epitome of the socialist ideal. After our morning briefing, we will head out and see some of the capital's highlights - including the Khast Imam Complex, the stunning edifice of the Alisher Navoi Opera and Ballet Theatre and the Chorsu Bazaar, a vast open-air market that sits in the heart of the old part of the city."
