  "generalInfo": "Travel to the country of Gabon in Central Africa and track down some of the world's most enigmatic primates including the colourful mandrill and the huge and endearing lowland gorilla (among other awesome species).<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>Gabon is a natural paradise. The ‘jewel in the crown’ of Gabon’s natural parks is Loango National Park, where there’s almost no humans living around the park and where wild animals live protected by the rivers surrounding this natural part of Central Africa. <br/><br/>Any traveller here can easily spot big mammals such as the forest elephant, red forest buffalo, red river hogs (with their furry ears), sitatunga, various duiker species, a variety of monkey species, a huge array of birds, western lowland gorillas and chimpanzees (rarely seen). <br/><br/>This itinerary also visits Lope National Park with the most beautiful landscape of Gabon and the largest population of accessible mandrills in the world. <br/><br/>Gabon is also the home of one of the world's most iconic and famous species of primate; the Mandrill. Immortalized by Rafiki in The Lion King, the world's largest species of monkey is found here and can be seen easier than anywhere else in the world. <br/><br/>But it is not just mandrills that are the attraction for this tour. As mentioned above we will spend time with lowland gorillas and also have a fantastic chance to see forest elephants, red river hogs and other species known from the Central African tropical rainforest.<br/><br/>There is so much life in the forests of Gabon it is hard to say what else we may or may not see. <br/><br/>All in all we believe that this tour is one that any wildlife enthusiast and particularly anyone interested in primates will love. We are exploring a seldom visited country with expert local guides on the trail of some of Africa's most incredible wildlife.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Libreville. There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Gabon. Your naturalist escort will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, cruises, guided walks, park entrance fees and spotlighting fees where mentioned on the itinerary. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around (including spotlighting every night we are allowed and there is the possibility of nocturnal wildlife); only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the Gabonese forests. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>This tour is focused around the Mandrills and this species aggregates in the June / July each year to bred. During this period various troops of mandrills come together and form huge groups (sometimes 200-250 strong). So we only really recommend this tour for June or July.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it.<br/>• We will stay in a variety of accommodation when on this tour, from well established wildlife eco lodges to guest houses and chalets deep inside privately run forest reserves. <br/>• We will split our focus and activity depending on where we are and what we are looking for. So we are flexible in our ability to move from diurnal to nocturnal rhythms. <br/>• All the above reasons give this, our specialist tour for Gabon’s wildlife including mandrills and other mammal species a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Gabon and the rest of Central Africa so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the Lowland gorilla, Sun-tailed guenon, Forest elephant, Forest buffalo and Red-river hogs and many more species. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Gabon at other times of year and focusing on other species such as Giant pangolins and the famous 'surfing' Hippos and many other rare mammals of Gabon. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour is mostly focused around two national parks, Lope and Loango National Parks. However we also have the options to visit other wildlife watching locations such as Mikongo.<br/><br/>Fitness levels required:<br/><br/>Whilst most of the wildlife watching activities in this itinerary will be on foot (particularly when looking for mandrills, gorillas and other primates in the forest); the terrain is largely flat, however we are not in control of where wildlife is and so some trips can include undulating / steep sections. Also sometimes the gorillas in Loango National Park enter swamps which need to be tranversed. The heat and humidity is probably the only cause of concern, however in the forest you will be out of the sun and there is no rush when walking. So we take our time and bring plenty of water, so we only require people who are used to walking for more than 4-5 hours, no special physical fitness is needed for this tour other than the ability to walk in rough, tropical forest conditions.<br/><br/>Equipment list:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; but as a rule of thumb we recommend you bring along your own binoculars or spotting scope (although this is not always very useful in the forests) as well as appropriate clothing; which should be hard wearing clothing which you do not mind getting muddy. Long trousers and long sleeved shirts are a good idea as the vegetation in the forests can be spiny and there are some stinging nettles. Travelling shorts and short sleeves are also recommended. It is a rainforest so waterproofs, including ponchos, are a very good idea. Comfortable and broken in waterproof walking boots with ankle supports are a must. Insect repellent is needed. Any medication, books or other items of a personal nature is of course up to you to bring along. Oh and please bring plenty of memory cards or film for your camera. Also do not forget sun cream, sun hat and sun glasses as the sun can be very strong here during the day.<br/><br/>Minimum age: 18 years old",
