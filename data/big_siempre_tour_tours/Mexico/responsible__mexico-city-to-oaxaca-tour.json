  "generalInfo": "Enjoy a delectable taste of Mexican culture with a captivating cultural holiday. This Mexico City to Oaxaca tour dips into street food, fascinating ruins left behind by ancient civilisations, and a number of artisan handicraft demonstrations that both support local businesses and give you the chance to find some truly original Mexican souvenirs.<br/><br/>In company of a knowledgeable tour leader, who will be complimented at various stages by expert local guides, you’ll join a small group of fellow travellers to journey from the Mexican capital to Oaxaca, one of the country’s most vibrant cities. This is a fantastic trip for anyone looking to explore Mexican culture in an authentic way, with plenty of good company too. <br/><br/>Over the course of a week, a well-planned route takes you from Mexico City to Puebla, renowned for how it has preserved the architecture of the Spanish colonial era, before spending a few days exploring the region around the charming city of Oaxaca. You’ll travel at a relaxed pace that fits in a great number of interesting cultural experiences, while never feeling rushed. <br/><br/>And as you journey from place to place, you’ll have plenty of time to get to know your travelling companions as well as your tour leader, who will be happy to share their knowledge of Mexican history and culture.<br/><br/>Mexico’s present is inextricably bound up with its past, such is the prestige of the many archaeological complexes around the country. Spend a day at Teotihuacan, once the Aztec capital, strolling the Avenue of the Dead and exploring the Pyramids of the Sun and the Moon, to learn about life there 2,000 years ago. Other fascinating sites include the vast Great Pyramid of Cholula, and the Mitla ruins near Oaxaca.<br/><br/>Many traditional industries are kept alive in Mexico by the skill and dedication of artisan craftspeople. This tour not only supports a range of small locally owned businesses through organising visits, but it also gives you lots of great opportunities to find unique souvenirs of your holiday. One day might find you taking part in a Zapotec weaving demonstration, watching as a family works on rugs and clothing that can take months to complete. Another might see you visit a family that produces beautiful stonework from obsidian, a volcanic glass-like rock.<br/><br/>Another fantastic way to sample Mexican culture is of course through its diverse and delicious cuisine. And wow, does this trip deliver on that score. From street food tours in Mexico City to (optional) cookery classes in Oaxaca, sampling traditional ice cream perhaps flavoured with chilli, to dinner at an award-winning, five-star restaurant, foodies will be in paradise. And because so many of the ingredients you’ll enjoy here are seasonal and locally sourced, it’s also a great way to keep down the carbon footprint of your trip.<br/>",

      "description": "Depart Mexico City and travel to Teotihuacan. Here, you'll discover the extraordinary ruins known as the Pyramid of the Sun and the Pyramid of the Moon, which dominate the skyline. This was once the biggest city in the Americas and predates the Aztec Empire by many centuries. Join an expert local guide and stroll down The Avenue of the Dead to see fascinating clues as to what life here was like nearly 2000 years ago. After lunch continue to Puebla. Stop off on the way to visit a local family who produce beautiful stonework carved form obsidian – a naturally occurring volcanic glasslike rock. Take some time to admire their striking pieces and speak to the family about their craft. Arrive in Puebla and set out for a walk around town, visiting Calle de los Dulces (Candy Street) and the El Parian handicraft market. See the Rosary Chapel and Town Hall Palace, then head out to dinner at an award-winning restaurant, where a local chef serves up local specialties in an elegant setting – the mole here comes highly recommended."

      "description": "Today, you’ll make the journey to Oaxaca – a colourful city rich with history and culture. Arrive in the late afternoon and settle into your hotel for the next three nights – converted from a 19th-century mansion, traditional charm emanates from every corner, from its ivy-clad courtyard to original frescoes and stone fountain. Just a stone’s throw away from the city’s main Zocalo, full of cafes, musicians and artisans, there’s no better base for your time in Oaxaca. Head out for an orientation walk with your leader to get a feel for the city, stopping by the local markets of Benito Juarez and 20 de Noviembre for a classic Oaxacan lunch, then enjoy a free evening. The best way to get to the heart of Oaxaca’s culture is to taste its food, so your leader will be happy to offer up some great local recommendations for dinner."

      "description": "Today, venture out of the city and take a tour of the Oaxaca region. Visit the Mitla ruins archaeological site – once the religious centre for Zapotec communities – and the Tule Tree, considered the world’s widest tree at over 11 m in diameter. The Montezuma cypress’ gnarled trunk is over 1500 years old, roughly the same as the ruins. Stop off to try some Mexican ice cream – an important part of Mexico’s culinary history, this hand-churned ice cream is considered one of the tastiest in the world. Maybe try some traditional Beso Oaxaqueno – a fresh fruit sorbet – or a scoop seasoned with chili. Continue to a beeswax candle-making workshop, learning age-old processes passed down for generations and the intricate designs that are created. Later, take part in a Zapotec weaving demonstration, which uses only traditional techniques, tools, patterns and organic dyes. Watch as local families craft folk clothing and rugs, some taking months to complete. Here, you’ll have a mostly plant-based lunch of regional specialities. On your way back to Oaxaca, stop by an agave mezcal factory for a tasting before returning to the city in the late afternoon."
