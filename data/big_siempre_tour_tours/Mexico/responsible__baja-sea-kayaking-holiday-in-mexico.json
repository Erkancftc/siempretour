  "generalInfo": "Baja is a wild landscape where russet peaks plunge to sparkling turquoise waters and white sand beaches. Cacti and desert flowers cap colorful rockface beneath a cobalt sky. This land of endless sunshine nurtures an astonishing amount of wild creatures, for amidst the arid terrain, life prevails in multi-hued forms. Soaring osprey and desert hawks share airspace with ungainly pelicans, and surprisingly agile blue-footed boobies dot seaside outcrops. Cormorants and other sea birds parade the shoreline, while skittering Sally Lightfoot crabs plunder the tidal range for their rich feasts. <br/><br/>The real action, however, flourishes beneath the waves. Home to 1/3 of the world's marine mammal species, the Sea of Cortez is renowned for leaping dolphins and enormous whales. Even the great blue whales, the largest mammal to have ever lived on planet Earth, can be found in these azure waters. Dubbed by Jacques Cousteau as \"The World's Aquarium,\" over 800 species of fish swim these waters, including the famous \"flying\" mobula rays that leap out of the water in sheer delight. This diversity of plant and animal life is unmatched anywhere in the world, which spurred the protection of this area as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It also makes for a fantastic winter holiday!<br/><br/>Spend a sun-and-sand vacation exploring the Sea of Cortez by kayak, hiking, and snorkeling these turquoise waters. By day, delight in sunshine and warm waters while you watch the array of marine life as you paddle around the protected islands of the Loreto Bay National Marine Park &amp; Espiritu Santo. You will spend about 4 hours on the water, with a long lunch break and plenty of time to hike to breathtaking vistas, snorkel secret coves, or relax in the sand. Camp on sandy beaches and witness sunset pelican dives during happy hour. As the sky's palette turns to night, watch how Baja's lack of light pollution unveils a velvety black canvas with constellations you've never seen. Splash in the ocean's bioluminescence before bed, and wake up to another morning in wild paradise.<br/><br/>Skilled guides, many of whom are marine biologists, will enrich your experience with their knowledge of the land and wildlife. Your meals will be prepared from scratch using local flavors with fresh ingredients. Imagine waking to a sunrise on the beach with tea or coffee waiting, and the smells of a hot breakfast wafting toward your tent. While lunch is prepared, go for a hike or a snorkeling session with the warm sun on your back. Happy hour drinks and hors d'oeuvres tease the palate as the guides create a culinary delight for your dinner. But keep your eyes on the horizon, lest you miss a pod of passing dolphins or a sea turtle gliding out of the waves.<br/><br/>These Baja Sea of Cortez kayaking and camping tours range from 3-6 days of paddling, complete with all gear and guides included in the tour price. Just bring your clothing! Novices and families welcome. Use the benefit of our experience to create your best vacation!",
