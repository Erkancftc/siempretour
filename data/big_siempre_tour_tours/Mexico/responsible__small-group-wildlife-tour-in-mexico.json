      "description": "The image looks like a perfect postcard: a beautiful beach of fine white sand and turquoise waters, crowned by a wonderful and ancient Maya building built on a cliff. That image can be lived on the ninth day of this unique tour. The visit to the archaeological site of Tulum will be early, to avoid the agglomeration of visitors. Tulum, formerly called Zamá (“dawn” in Maya), was founded in the 4th century A.D. and its construction was based on the cosmological knowledge that the Mayan people had, therefore, on the concept of “the four corners” that refers to the four cardinal points, and which in turn arises from the ancient cosmic pattern of the Five Points. The city as a quadrilateral represented an orderly, rational world, made for gods and men alike. In each corner or entrance, balames (protective mythological fields and crops, which are shaped like Jaguars), guards or guardians of the town were installed. You will have free time to enjoy the beach, its warm waters and capture with your camera the unique images of this wonderful place, before making the transfer to your hotel in Cancun. Overnight will be at the hotel El Rey del Caribe (or similar)."
