As well as whale watching there are plenty of other wildlife watching experiences to be had, and other adventures too. These include kayaking in coastal mangroves, snorkelling in crystal clear coves, heading onto land to hike through coastal desert terrain, and visit traditional Mexican villages home to ‘sudcalifornianos’.

Its mangrove-lined estuaries provide a habitat for a variety of bird species, as well as uniquely adapted desert plants. January through March is the best time to observe gray whales in the area, following their 5,000+ mile migration from the Bering Strait.  <br/> <br/>After witnessing these magnificent animals breach and fluke from the comfort of our exclusive whale camp, we’ll cross the Baja Peninsula to paddle alongside dolphins and blue whales in the Sea of Cortez. Loreto Bay National Marine Park also provides a sanctuary for blue-footed boobies, fin whales, and sea lions, making it an inspiring destination for wildlife lovers.<br/><br/>*All activities are led by naturalist guides who have a wealth of knowledge about the local area. While we do our best to adhere to the schedule, changes may occur due to weather conditions and in some cases, the kayaking portion of the itinerary may precede the whale watching.

We'll drive to La Paz, go to our bodega to get snorkeling gear and wet suits, then it's on to the boats and out into the Sea of Cortez! Camp Cecil is on Isla Espiritu Santo which is in a National Marine Park, part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and is one of the best marine life viewing destinations in the world. Whales, dolphins, whale sharks, sea turtles, manta rays and plenty of beautiful tropical fish call the surrounding waters home, while a terrific range of bird species including Blue-footed Boobies, Reddish Egrets, Great Blue Herons and Yellow-footed Gulls frequent the island’s skies and shores. The island itself is stunning, with magnificent towering cliffs, spectacular sandy bays, amazing lava rock formations, and rock art left by the now-extinct Guaycura and Pericu Indians. There’s even an endemic ring-tailed cat, the babisuri. It’s a remarkable place to explore. We’ll spend the days doing exactly what pleases us - kayaking, snorkeling, hiking, swimming with sea lions, stand up paddle boarding, bird watching, and exploring hidden lagoons and desert beaches. Hanging around doing nothing, reading trashy novels and sipping margaritas also highly encouraged."

    "generalInfo": "Baja is a wild landscape where russet peaks plunge to sparkling turquoise waters and white sand beaches. Cacti and desert flowers cap colorful rockface beneath a cobalt sky. This land of endless sunshine nurtures an astonishing amount of wild creatures, for amidst the arid terrain, life prevails in multi-hued forms. Soaring osprey and desert hawks share airspace with ungainly pelicans, and surprisingly agile blue-footed boobies dot seaside outcrops. Cormorants and other sea birds parade the shoreline, while skittering Sally Lightfoot crabs plunder the tidal range for their rich feasts. <br/><br/>The real action, however, flourishes beneath the waves. Home to 1/3 of the world's marine mammal species, the Sea of Cortez is renowned for leaping dolphins and enormous whales. Even the great blue whales, the largest mammal to have ever lived on planet Earth, can be found in these azure waters. Dubbed by Jacques Cousteau as \"The World's Aquarium,\" over 800 species of fish swim these waters, including the famous \"flying\" mobula rays that leap out of the water in sheer delight. This diversity of plant and animal life is unmatched anywhere in the world, which spurred the protection of this area as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It also makes for a fantastic winter holiday!<br/><br/>Spend a sun-and-sand vacation exploring the Sea of Cortez by kayak, hiking, and snorkeling these turquoise waters. By day, delight in sunshine and warm waters while you watch the array of marine life as you paddle around the protected islands of the Loreto Bay National Marine Park &amp; Espiritu Santo. You will spend about 4 hours on the water, with a long lunch break and plenty of time to hike to breathtaking vistas, snorkel secret coves, or relax in the sand. Camp on sandy beaches and witness sunset pelican dives during happy hour. As the sky's palette turns to night, watch how Baja's lack of light pollution unveils a velvety black canvas with constellations you've never seen. Splash in the ocean's bioluminescence before bed, and wake up to another morning in wild paradise.<br/><br/>Skilled guides, many of whom are marine biologists, will enrich your experience with their knowledge of the land and wildlife. Your meals will be prepared from scratch using local flavors with fresh ingredients. Imagine waking to a sunrise on the beach with tea or coffee waiting, and the smells of a hot breakfast wafting toward your tent. While lunch is prepared, go for a hike or a snorkeling session with the warm sun on your back. Happy hour drinks and hors d'oeuvres tease the palate as the guides create a culinary delight for your dinner. But keep your eyes on the horizon, lest you miss a pod of passing dolphins or a sea turtle gliding out of the waves.<br/><br/>These Baja Sea of Cortez kayaking and camping tours range from 3-6 days of paddling, complete with all gear and guides included in the tour price. Just bring your clothing! Novices and families welcome. Use the benefit of our experience to create your best vacation!",

    "generalInfo": "Set on an island in the Pacific ocean, your stay at our exclusive gray whale safari camp will be a complete immersion into this spectacular wilderness and the world of the whales. Gray whales migrate from the Arctic circle down the Pacific coastline to Baja, where they frolic in the desert sunshine for a few short months to mate and give birth. Sand dune barrier islands form calving lagoons where the whales congregate for their springtime festivities. From mid-January through the end of March, these shallow lagoons are a haven to hundreds of whales and their newborn calves.<br/><br/>Moreover, these Baja gray whales have actually become friendly and curious toward humans. What started with a gentle rub between a lone gray whale and a young fisherman has become a breathtaking phenomenon among the entire population, as these whales now actively seek interaction with people. Mothers will often bring their calves right over to whale watching boats for an eye-to-eye encounter.<br/><br/>When you join us in Baja for a stay at our gray whale base camp, you'll have more than just whale time - though there is plenty of that! The most spectacular feature of our exclusive campsite is the proximity to the whales. Our site is located right where the lagoon meets the Pacific ocean. This is where the whales are most concentrated. Consequently, you can usually see whales right from camp throughout the day. At times, you may feel utterly surrounded by whales!<br/><br/>You'll visit the whales by motorized skiff (6 people per boat) twice per day for up-close encounters, and then will return to camp to watch whales from shore and learn about their environments from your naturalist guides. All of your guides are local, bilingual Mexicans, and many are marine biologists from the nearby University of La Paz. <br/><br/>The accommodations at our safari-style camp are as luxurious as can be found in the wild, yet still allow us to remove all trace of human presence once the whales leave. You will sleep in full-height canvas tents on sleeping cots with inflatable air pads. A solar shower stall and El Bano with a porta potty are also provided.  Your guides will prepare warm, savory meals made from fresh ingredients right in the middle of the wilderness while you relax with a drink, comb the beach, or take a walk over the dunes to watch the sun set over the Pacific ocean. This is Leave-No-Trace camping at its finest!<br/><br/>Though the whales are the stars of the tour, the desert ecosystem is fascinating to explore. Acres of mangroves flock the lagoon, which make this area a bird-watchers paradise. Dolphins frequently zip into the bay for a snack, often catching fish just feet from the waters' edge. Coyotes and desert hares skip over the dunes, and the delicate desert flora offers a startling array of colors and unique Baja beauty. <br/><br/>Tours begin in Loreto, Baja, or La Paz, Baja, making this a perfect addition to a thrilling winter escape!",

This has been said repeated times by the most adventurous persons exploring the world so what are you waiting for? Come, explore and learn with us about the Unique whale sharks, the biggest fish in the world. Mexico and the Yucatan and Cancun is known in recent years to have the biggest population of whale sharks in the world and we have been running this tip for over 20 years. <br/><br/>Our guides are very professional and provide environmental interpretation in this great trip. Besides the whale sharks we can eventually see with luck beautiful sea creatures: dolphins, manta rays, marine turtles and flying fish and even more! After a nice dive in the sea and a visit to the whale sharks, a delicious Mexican lunch is provided. You might even want to go for a swim in the blue water! Everything is possible on this magical tour!<br/><br/>A little fact about the whale sharks: <br/><br/>An average whale shark is about 8 meters, but can grow up to 15 meters long!! They have a wide flat head and has up to 3000 mini teeth. But don’t be afraid! They will not eat you! Despite having so many teeth, their esophagus is the size of a plum! So, no chance for them to eat you. Another reason why they would not eat you, is because they rather eat some nice plankton. Yes, the whale shark is vegetarian. <br/>The don’t often come up high in the water. They often swim just below the water level and seem to prefer water that has a surface temperature of between 21 and 25 degrees. <br/><br/>Maybe you think that the whale shark is comparable with the white shark, but even the opposite! Compared to other sharks, they swim very slowly. No faster than about 5 km per hour. This allows us to swim together with this beautiful animal, whale sharks are very calm and not dangerous. They are our friends!!",

Encircled by hills, Uxmal is expansive in its design with majestic palaces and pyramids, and long geometrical friezes that rank among the most splendid examples of ancient American Art. The incredible Pyramid of the Magician and the beautiful Governor's Palace are two of the finest examples of Mayan art found in MesoAmerica. Later in the day, we'll drive to Merida, famed for its Spanish-Moorish style architecture, where we'll have time to wander the narrow streets watching the horse-drawn carriages rattle past. Our total driving time today will be approximately three and a half hours."

Founded in AD432, re-founded in 987 and conquered by the Toltecs in the 10th century, the culture of the Maya and the Toltec gradually fused. The pyramids, palaces, temples and ballcourt (where death was the penalty for defeat) are adorned with astonishing sculptures. Under the pressure of the civil war, the great monuments deteriorated and the Maya civilisation collapsed. Chichen Itza remains one of the most outstanding sites in the Americas, and its main pyramid was named the Seventh New Wonder of the World in 2007. We'll have a lengthy visit here, before setting off to Playa del Carmen for our final night. Time permitting, we'll stop for a swim in one of the Yucatan's cenotes (a cenote is an underground pool naturally formed in limestone, used by the ancient Mayans as a source of water). We'll arrive in Playa del Carmen in the evening. Our total driving time for today will be approximately four and a half hours."

    "generalInfo": "The beauty of this Yucatan Peninsula tour is that it doesn’t simply tick off the key experiences, like Chichen Itza, swimming in a cenote, or exploring Merida. Instead, taking your time, you’ll be immersed in life here, sharing traditional homecooked meals with Maya farming families, meeting up with knowledgeable guides such as conservationists and historians, and staying in some charming boutique hotels. <br/><br/>Over the course of a memorable week you’ll travel from the sun-drenched Caribbean coastline of Puerto Morelos to Tulum, in the engaging company of a small group (maximum group size 12) and a dedicated tour leader, who is there to ensure the trip runs smoothly. Along the way, you’ll learn how to make an authentic tortilla, take a dip in a beautiful limestone cenote, uncover the secrets of ancient Maya civilisation at Chichen Itza and Tulum, and spend a few nights in a hotel that was once a 17th century mansion.<br/><br/>Following a guided tour of historic downtown Merida with its plazas, markets, and murals, you’ll head to the Celestun Bird Sanctuary, a biosphere reserve, with a local conservationist as your guide. Sixty-six million years ago, an asteroid strike on the Yucatan Peninsula is thought to have wiped out almost all of the dinosaurs on earth, but their winged brethren survived, and evolved into the many species inhabiting these mangroves. Visit between November and March, and you may see crowds of flamingos painting the scenery a vivid shade of pink.<br/><br/>From Merida you continue to Tulum and its vast, oceanside archaeological site – one of the most renowned in all Central America. But not before a day amid the ancient ruins of Muyil, once a Maya trading post. Here you’ll take to a boat for a river tour with members of the local community as your guides, for a relaxed and informative cruise – plus a swim, of course.<br/><br/>Arriving in Tulum you’ll take your leave of the group and your tour leader with a farewell meal – and a chance to take one final leap into Mexican cuisine – the seafood in this part of the country is divine.<br/><br/>Staying in locally owned hotels, eating at local restaurants recommended by your tour leader, and being entertained by a succession of local guides, on this trip you cannot fail to make a positive difference to the places you visit. Wondering if you can find a Mexico cultural trip with a reassuringly responsible flavour? Yes, you Yucatan!",

This area is rich in rainforests and wetlands, teeming with wildlife. The ruins span several square kilometers and include 500 structures uncovered so far. The city's name, meaning 'green-blue water,' was given thanks to its picturesque lakeside location.

Initially settled in about 600 BC, Tikal was abandoned by its rulers around 890 AD and totally deserted a hundred years later. The city covered an area of 16 square kilometres. Re-discovered in 1848, only a few of its great temples and pyramids have been excavated. The site is extensive, so we include a guided tour in the morning followed by free time to let you explore. We can appreciate the prolific birdlife in the surrounding rainforest and take in amazing views of the forest canopy from the tops of the pyramids. At 3.30pm, we'll drive back to Flores."

For the beginner, complete instruction and guidance is provided from experienced professionals, while for more advanced sea kayakers there is the thrill of exploring the island of Espiritu Santo, just off the coast of La Paz. A UNESCO Biosphere reserve, Espiritu Santo is a renowned ecotourism destination and probably one of the most desirable places on the planet for a sea kayaking expedition.<br/><br/>Explore the dramatic coastline, overlooked by volcanic cliffs and dotted with the nests of myriad seabirds; discover offshore islands with picturesque bays, and take a boat trip out to a noisy sea lion colony, where you’ll have the blissful experience of swimming with the young pups, and can snorkel among shoals of tropical fish. The colony is on the neighbouring Isla Partida, separated from Espiritu Santo by a narrow channel, and where you’ll camp beside a turquoise ‘natural swimming pool’.<br/><br/>In fact you’ll be camping amid majestic scenery every night, often on long strands of silvery beach in earshot of the lapping waves. Imagine waking up to this scenery every morning.<br/><br/>Other likely highlights of this trip: watching manta rays skip out of the sea, sipping margaritas with your fellow kayakers under a warm Baja sunset, and possibly even encountering dolphins as you paddle around the islands. This is one of those trips where you find yourself dreaming about booking a return visit even before you’ve left.<br/>",

Discovered in 1952, the sarcophagus dates back to AD683. The great pyramids of the Maya were usually used as platforms from which to worship the gods, so this pharaoh-style burial is untypical.

        "description": "From Mérida you are driven to Chichén Itzá (1.5 hrs), the grandest of all the Mayan sites, dominated by the huge, symmetrical, stepped El Castillo pyramid. The origins of the site are mysterious, and appear to have Toltec as well as Mayan influences. It has the largest and best-preserved ball court in the Americas; the venue for an ancient ritual game that was played throughout the continent, but which is still not fully understood. Archaeologists have not been able to determine whether the losers or winners were decapitated, but judging from the gory carvings along the base of the court’s walls, someone certainly came to an unpleasant end. There is also a huge sacred well, the Cenote Sagrado, which was used for ritual purposes. Offerings (jade, gold and human) have been retrieved from its depths."

Mexico is a land of extremes, with high mountains and deep canyons in the center of the country, sweeping deserts in the north, and dense rain forests in the south and east. Mountains cover much of Mexico. Between the Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range in the east and the Sierra Madre Occidental in the west lie small mountain ranges on the Central Plateau. The stretch of land called the Yucatán Peninsula juts into the Gulf of Mexico from Mexico's southeastern tip. It was once the home of the Maya civilization, an ancient culture whose amazing buildings can still be seen today.<br/><br/>Mexico is the product of a rich Indian heritage, three centuries of Spanish rule, and a shared border with the world's richest country, the United States. Today, most Mexicans are mestizos, which means they have a mix of Indian and Spanish blood. Throughout its history, Mexico has been home to great artists. The Maya and other Indians made impressive murals, sculptures, and jewelry. Modern Mexican artists include great painters, photographers, sculptors, and muralists. Mexicans take sports seriously. In ancient times, losers of a ritual ball game were once put to death. In some dangerous sports, like bullfighting and rodeo (which was invented in Mexico), competitors still put their lives on the line.<br/><br/>In northern Mexico, deserts are full of plant and animal species that have found ways to survive the harsh environment. On Mexico's west coast, gray whales swim thousands of miles each year from Alaska to breed in the waters off Baja California. The rain forests and coastal wetlands of eastern Mexico are home to thousands of tropical plant species and elusive animals like jaguars and quetzal birds.<br/><br/>The Olmec people, Mexico's first complex society, emerged in the southeastern part of the country around 1200 B.C. They were later followed by the Maya, the Toltec, and the Aztec peoples. Mexico's ancient societies built great cities and huge pyramids, created remarkable works of art that will be part of the itineries listed.<br/><br/>Explore Mexico on your own, with your family or in a guided grouptravel along this itinery.

Then, we set out to explore the bohemian side of Mexico City. We start by visiting quaint Coyoacán (meaning place of coyotes) with its pebbled streets, colonial churches, bustling little markets and quiet squares. This area was inhabited before the arrival of the Spanish, and it is said conquistador Hernán Cortés made this the first capital of New Spain. Next, we head to Casa Azul (visit subject to availability), where artist Frida Kahlo was born, grew up and, eventually, lived with her muralist husband, Diego Rivera, until she died in 1954 at the age of 47. Now a museum, the cobalt-blue colonial house, set around a luxuriant garden, showcases the collections and personal effects of the two great artists and provides a window into the life of affluent Mexican bohemians in the first half of the 20th century. Finally, enjoy a ride on a pre-Hispanic boat along the Xochimilco canals. These scenic waterways were used by the Aztecs and today see us enjoying a journey past floating gardens and kitchens selling local food. Return to our hotel in the late afternoon.

It was an important gathering place for the Aztecs, and remains so in modern Mexico, often hosting book fairs and concerts. On the north side of the Zócalo is the Cathedral Metropolitana, the largest cathedral in the Americas. It was constructed over an Aztec temple, the Templo Mayor, as a sign the Spanish were now in power. Our walking tour finishes outside the Palacio de Bellas Artes. Construction of this massive neoclassical building began in 1904, on the remains of the Santa Isabel convent, under the Italian architect Adamo Boari. It has an art nouveau style and its facade is made of marble from Carrara. Next, we visit the Museum of Anthropology, which has an impressive collection of artefacts from the many civilisations of Mexico and provides us with an in-depth insight into the country. We finish at Chapultepec Castle, home to the National Museum of History, which contains collections throughout the centuries and the declaration of independence of the Mexican empire, signed in 1821.

In 500 BCE, the Zapotecans moved into the Oaxaca region and began the monumental task of levelling the top of a 5,250ft (1,600m) high mountain that intersects and divides three valleys.

Part of an island off the coast of Baja 10 million years ago, the Reserve is one of the most biodiverse areas in the world. Reflecting it's long history of island isolation, almost 25% of plants and 10% of animals found in the Reserve are endemic to the area, i.e, they are not found anywhere else on the planet. Activities at the camp include beautiful hikes in the reserve, with opportunities to get terrific views of the Pacific ocean, swim in watering holes and picnic by waterfalls. There is fantastic birding in the early mornings, amazing star gazing at night, and plenty of opportunities to interact with the ranch family and work with them making cheese, tortillas and other products in the traditional manner.

The city is famous for its impressive architecture, which includes ancient Aztec ruins and colonial-era buildings, as well as modern skyscrapers.

Another highlight is its delicious cuisine, which ranges from tacos and tamales to haute cuisine restaurants. Today you will have a guided tour of approximately 5 hours.

Accompanied by your English-speaking guide, you will tour the museum's main collections while learning about the history of pre-Hispanic cultures and appreciating some of the most important pieces of pre-Columbian Mexico such as the Aztec Calendar, the Olmec Colossal Head, and the famous Mask of Pakal.

You will start with a walk through the forest and then start climbing up to the castle located at the top of the hill. The castle was built in 1785 as the residence of the viceroy of New Spain and was later remodeled to be the home of Emperor Maximilian and Empress Carlota. In 1939 it became the National Museum of History with a magnificent collection of historical pieces and murals with interpretations of the history of Mexico.

That image can be lived on the ninth day of this unique tour. The visit to the archaeological site of Tulum will be early, to avoid the agglomeration of visitors. Tulum, formerly called Zamá (“dawn” in Maya), was founded in the 4th century A.D. and its construction was based on the cosmological knowledge that the Mayan people had, therefore, on the concept of “the four corners” that refers to the four cardinal points, and which in turn arises from the ancient cosmic pattern of the Five Points. The city as a quadrilateral represented an orderly, rational world, made for gods and men alike. In each corner or entrance, balames (protective mythological fields and crops, which are shaped like Jaguars), guards or guardians of the town were installed. You will have free time to enjoy the beach, its warm waters and capture with your camera the unique images of this wonderful place, before making the transfer to your hotel in Cancun.

        "description": "After enjoying breakfast, we will visit the incomparable archaeological site of Tulum early in the day (we visit it in the morning to avoid the crowding). Tulum was called Zamá (“dawn” in the Mayan language) by its first inhabitants in the fourth century of our era, and later it was known as Tulum (“Wall” in the Mayan language). The strategic location of the place made it become one of the main Mayan cities of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, especially after the fall of the city of Mayapán, its closest enemy. In addition, its location in an elevated area and its efficient defensive system made it an essential scale for commercial routes established with other Maya cities and central Mexico, which was reinforced by the great exploitation of its maritime resources. It was outlined in this way, as a link between the maritime and land trade routes of the Maya world. After marveling at Tulum, we will continue to the archaeological site of Muyil (also known as Chunyaxché), which was inhabited during the classic Mesoamerican period. Its location in front of the Sian Ka’an Lagoon gave the place a strategic position on the Maya commercial route along the coast and through a network of canals in this region, which is now part of the tourist area of the Mexican Caribbean. Among the goods exchanged along this route were jade, obsidian, chocolate, honey, feathers and of course salt. We continue to have a well-deserved and necessary lunch in the typical restaurant El Faisan and Venado, in Carrillo Puerto, where you will taste delicious typical dishes of the region. We will visit the church of Balam Nah (today De la Santa Cruz), one of the oldest buildings in the town. He had a leading role during the Caste War that lasted from 1847 to 1901, in which the Maya intended to recover the territory occupied by the Spanish conquerors and that ended up costing almost 250 thousand lives. We will end the day moving to the beautiful town of Bacalar. After dinner, we will leave you at your Laguna Bacalar (or similar) hotel."

        "description": "The first thing to do on this fourth day is to have a good breakfast. Once loaded with energy, we will go to the archaeological site of Chicanná (“In the house of the Snake’s mouth” in the Mayan language). Chicanná is the site that has the largest number of “Río Bec” type buildings in good condition. The panels of masks that have some of their buildings are good examples of regional iconography and show the evolution of the representations of the Earth Monster. The abandonment of the settlement is closely linked to the fall of Becan, in the early thirteenth century, on which it was dependent throughout its development. Precisely Becan is our next stop, and its name means “Road left by the running of water” in the Mayan language, and this is verified by observing the moat that surrounds the main buildings of the site, which is also evidence of its warlike activity. Because of its importance and location, Becán is considered as a regional capital, that is to say, that it headed the territorial political organization of other minor settlements. To conclude this incredible day, we will visit the archaeological zone of Xpujil (“Cat’s Tail” in the Mayan language), another great city of the Bec River Region. With evidence of its foundation in 400 B.C., it reached the cusp between 500 and 700 A.D. and it had its decline around the year 1100. Surely you will be exhausted after touring the archeological zones of the region, therefore, we will move to rest in the Ecovilla de Chicanná (Or Similar)."

After breakfast, we will visit the enigmatic archaeological zone of Calakmul early, which in the Mayan language means “Two adjacent mounds,” and whose name refers to the two huge structures that dominate the jungle. One of the most important cities of the Classic Maya period along with Tikal and Palenque and which led the political organization of the highlands. There is evidence of wars for almost a century between Tikal and Calakmul for political control of the region and the Serpent Kingdom (Kaan). It was designated by UNESCO as Cultural Heritage of Humanity. We will continue to the last archaeological zone of the day: Hormiguero (“Ant nest”). This is the site of smaller dimensions, and that owes its name to a chiclero camp of the early twentieth century. Its characteristic element is a building with a large mask in the center that represents a huge and monstrous open mouth, which is interpreted as the threshold between the outside world and the underworld. After this long journey, it’s time to return to Chicanna’s ecovillage (Or Similar) for a well-deserved rest."

In Balam kú, there is a stucco frieze modeled and painted unique in the Mayan area, which was made between 550 and 600 a. C. The frieze shows four ascension scenes alternated with three jaguars. Each comprises an animal with its head turned back, sitting in the front slit of an Earth Monster mask; his mouth gives way to a king on his throne. In addition to illustrating in detail the opposite and complementary aspects of the underworld, the set shows that the dynastic cycle is equated with the solar cycle. In this conception, accession to the throne is illustrated by the king emerging from the jaws of the earth monster, as the sun rises from the mouth of the Earth; The death of the king is seen as a sunset when it falls into the mouth of the Earth Monster. We will continue to the city of Campeche to have lunch. After a delicious lunch, we will visit the Baluarte Campeche Museum (named World Cultural Heritage by UNESCO in December 1999). In reality, these are several walled forts to protect the population from the attacks of Pirates, whose construction began in the mid-16th century, and which consists of Baluarte of San Juan, Baluarte de San Francisco, Baluarte de Santa Rosa, Baluarte de San Carlos, Baluarte de la Soledad, Baluarte de Santiago, and Baluarte de San José.

Founded around 400 B.C. and whose name in the Mayan language means “House of the Itzáes” or “House of the Echo”, the city is admirable for its advanced system of hydraulic works: a network of canals drained the valley and the water was led to a lagoon, which was transformed into a dam, through retaining walls, while other channels served to irrigate the fields. Its squares had a magnificent drainage system and rainwater reached artificial reservoirs, called “chultunes.” We will continue our trip to Santa Rosa Xtampak. Xtampak (“Old Walls” in the Mayan language) is considered to be the most important regional capital of the Chenes route, as it has altars and steles sculpted with dates of events. It is believed that its domain radius was 400 kilometers. After admiring the archeological site, it was time for lunch in the city of Hopelchén (“Place of the Five Wells” in the Mayan language).

The “City on the edge of the well of the Itzaes” (name of the city in the Mayan language) was the capital of a large territory in the Yucatan Peninsula, headed by the Mayapán League, from 987 until 1200 AD. C. The Chichén Itzá archeological zone is famous worldwide for the play of light and shadow that occurs in each equinox on the stairway of the pyramidal basement known as El castillo. In this, the sun, as it rises above the horizon, illuminates the western basement, creating triangles of light and shadow that seem to descend to the snake’s head in the displacement of the alfarda. This event, achieved from the correct orientation and inclination of the plans of the basement, manifests the great level of astronomical and architectural knowledge that the Maya possessed, and that has resulted in being one of the most studied cultures and regions around these issues, in addition to the territorial political organization and the exploitation of resources. The guided tour also includes the passage through important buildings such as the Great Ball Game, the Jaguar Temple, the Temple of the Bearded Man, the Temple of Venus, the House of the Deer, the Observatory, among other impressive buildings. Lunch at the Mayaland Restaurant – restaurant of the only hotel built in an archeological zone in the world, which has been operating since 1923 – and then you will have the option of swimming in the refreshing waters of the impressive X´kekén cenote (“Pork” in the Mayan language, and he was baptized like this because, long time ago, a farmer´s pig escaped from a peasant, and found him inside the cenote.) After a day full of emotions and adventure, it is time to check in at the beautiful hotel Mesón del Marques – beautiful and traditional hotel located in what was a colonial mansion – and after getting settled and taking a shower, we will take a tour of the night in the colonial city of Valladolid (founded in 1543 by Francisco de Montejo, and which was a key element during the Caste War.
