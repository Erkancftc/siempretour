      "description": "Red Tsingy: Today after breakfast you will travel to Ankarana National Park en-route visiting the Red Tsingy. Red Tsingy is a miracle of nature in many ways to understand geology and erosion. The Red Tsingy is made of red laterite similar to clay and not of limestone rock like the Tsingy at Ankarana or Bemaraha. They are caused by heavy rain which is regular in these parts of Madagascar as well as the wind. As a result of erosion caused by the rain, wind and soft soil these imaginary and ravine of sharp, ancient rock formations unique to Madagascar. These turned out to be sand formations overlaid by red clay long ago. Erosion has worn the clay away, exposing the tall white (with tinges of red) columns of sand formations underneath. For those who’ve been to Bryce Canyon National Park, it’s some ways similar as both of them formed by erosion. This fragile nature’s gift can disappear quickly. Please do not touch them. Afterwards continue your journey to Ankarana National Park. Travel time 3-4 hours. Location: Ankarana ; Hotel: Ankarana Lodge; Board: Breakfast & Dinner"
