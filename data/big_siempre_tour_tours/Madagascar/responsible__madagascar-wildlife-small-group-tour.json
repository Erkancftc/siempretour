  "generalInfo": "Separated from mainland Africa for over 80 million years, Madagascar has evolved an extraordinary natural world found nowhere else on Earth. From its rainforest covered highlands to the sandstone canyons and semi arid plateaus of the south, this large island nation offers exceptional biodiversity, striking landscapes and a distinctive culture shaped by both African and Asian influences.<br/>This 11 day guided adventure explores Madagascar’s central highlands and southern national parks, revealing the country’s remarkable contrasts. Walk through Ranomafana’s montane rainforest, where tree ferns and bamboo line the trails, in search of lemurs and colourful chameleons. Hike among the granite domes and open prairies of Andringitra and Tsaranoro Valley, where ring tailed lemurs are often seen in the rocky slopes, before continuing south to Isalo National Park, a landscape of sandstone cliffs, narrow canyons and natural pools.<br/>Walks range from 3–5 hours on most days, graded introductory to moderate, with private transport throughout. Nights are spent in comfortable hotels and a semi permanent camp in Andringitra, offering walk in tents and excellent mountain views. This thoughtfully designed route offers an active yet accessible introduction to Madagascar’s landscapes, wildlife and rural life.",
