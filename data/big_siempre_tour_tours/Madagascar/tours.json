Travel the idyllic coastal zone adjacent to the azure waters of the Mozambique Channel and walk on the perfect sands of Andravona. Explore Mikea Forest, a transition zone between dry and spiny forest, and home to the Mikea hunter gatherer tribal people.  As we head North, more  incredible landscapes await with Isalo Reserve, where stunning panoramas are complimented by beautiful natural springs and remarkable rock formations. Continue to the awe-inspiring granite topography of the Andringitra massif where you will enjoy walking in this prime hiking paradise.

Along the way, watch out for chameleons and some of the many non-poisonous snakes of the island. Expect to arrive in Manja late afternoon.

The spiny forest with its distinctive bush is home to a host of natural wonders: 95 percent of plant species here are endemic and lemur, mongoose, sifaka and even the Madagascar radiated tortoise are all to be seen in the landscape, so it is well worth keeping an eye on the surroundings.

    "generalInfo": "With 80% of its species found nowhere else on earth – including birds, chameleons and of course the lemurs – Madagascar is an wildlife enthusiasts dream destination. This trip will hopefully reveal endemic mongoose like species, the enormous and fierce looking fossa, tiny quick moving mouse lemurs and you will hear the eerie, whale-like songs of the world’s largest lemur the indri.<br/><br/>Having parted ways with mainland Africa over 160 million years ago, most of Madagascar’s flora and fauna evolved independently from the wildlife elsewhere. Even the Malagasy people – descended from seafarers from Borneo and Polynesia as well as East Africans – are unique to Madagascar, a distinction that is evident in their phenomenal, French-influenced food, infectious music, and deep respect for their ancestors.<br/><br/>The most famous residents of the continent like island are the enigmatic lemurs; which were a kind of prototype primate, a “prosimian” – predating monkeys and apes, which began to evolve later on the African mainland. The lemurs that remained on the mainland were driven virtually to extinction by these new, more intelligent and adaptable species. In Madagascar, however, there was no such competition and the lemurs thrived, evolving into over a hundred different species.<br/><br/>It is important to visit Madagascar now and contribute the wonderful small scale and national level conservation projects and community run reserves. It is only by visiting these places will the local people and local governments receive enough encouragement, support and money to protect the places indefinitely.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/><br/>We are specialists in tailoring specialist mammal watching tours and holidays all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife tours in Madagascar which combine various different wildlife watching activities. In order to develop our unrivalled range of combined wildlife watching holidays, our guides and colleagues around the world have spent years searching out the world’s best wildlife watching locations as well as visiting some seldom visited areas. This dedication has led us to create this wildlife and cultural tour that explores some areas that are seldom visited by most safari goers to Madagascar. <br/><br/>This tour starts at the wonderful central capital city of Antananarivo (Tana) and explores west and east of this city; firstly visiting Andasibe followed by Ranomafana and Isalo National Parks before heading in Palmarium for the aye-aye and the heading south to the small park of Anja and then west to our final reserve Kirindy National Reserve which is well known for a couple of very special species, the largest predator on the island the fossa and the smallest primate in the world, Madame Berthe's mouse lemur.  <br/><br/>All of our tours are guided by our own professional zoologist (where available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) so you are sure to be in the best hands possible for the best sightings. We also have a great network of local guides in Madagascar who have developed a great range of wildlife watching locations where the rarest species are commonly seen. Also to try and make sure that we will see as many of the rarer and elusive animals when in the reserves we will spend many hours during the early morning and late afternoon on foot and also after dark each night we will head out with high powered spotlights and start the search for nocturnal species. <br/><br/>One of the reasons why our wildlife watching holidays are unique is that our background (as a company) is from a scientific and zoological standpoint and so have a great network of colleagues and contacts all over the world who are the people on the front line in search of the best new locations for wildlife watching. All of these reasons and many more make us experts in arranging safaris and are able to tailor a safari to any location to try to find your targeted species. All you have to do is to get in touch with your budget and your group size and where you would like to go to try and find rare and elusive species.<br/><br/>Group Tour Departure: 8th November - 20th November 2022<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including all breakfasts (except when in Tana). There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) will escort you on all your excursions and also very knowledgeable English speaking local guides who have decades of experience working and guiding throughout Madagascar. Your zoologist escort (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) is an expert in mammal biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge of where some of the most elusive Madagascan animals are; as well as having years of experience in bringing people out to see the lemurs and other species. We also include all guided walks, spotlighting walks, cultural performances, cultural activities, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the forests or some other wildlife watching activity. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour.<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>We recommend October and November for this trip which is when the fossa are breeding and they are very active and easier to see than other times of year. This is also the dry season and many lemur species are also easy to see and the weather is dry. The only downside of this time of year is that many tenrecs are difficult to find as they prefer the wet season. But we can also arrange the trip for the wet season and all other times of year.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>•\tAll of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by local naturalist guides, drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>•\tWe can offer you spotlighting trips around many forests and reserves in the Madagascar so that you can search for the rarer species and other nocturnal wildlife when they are more active. These conservancies are community projects which increase income to the local community whilst preserving the natural ecosystem.<br/>•\tWe can also bring thermal imaging and night vision equipment as well as spotting scopes (on request) to also aid in finding the nocturnal mammals after dark and scan the horizon for harder to see species.<br/>•\tWe use camera traps (where available) which will increase the chances of getting close up pictures and movies of rare animals and other rare nocturnal wildlife.<br/>•\tHike the stunning and forests and various ecosystems on the world's most unique and special island for wildlife and endemism.<br/>•\tVisit the free living rescued populations of various lemurs and even have them jumping on you in Palmarium.<br/>•\tAll the above reasons give this Madagascan safari holiday a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. <br/>•\tWe have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Africa so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the Lemurs, Big Five, gorillas, chimpanzees and hundreds of other species throughout Africa. Whether it is the Madagascar, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Gabon, Ethiopia, South Africa, Namibia, Botswana Tunisia or Rwanda or any of the other many wildlife watching locations you want to visit we can arrange it. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>•\tUnlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour travels to Andsibie, Ranomafana, Isalo, Palmarium, Anja and Kirindy with your arrival and departure point being Tana.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>A good level of psychical fitness is needed as all of the wildlife watching is done on foot, we spend between 4-10 hours a day on foot and temperatures can be very hot and humid. For the tsingy we will be exploring caves and rock climbing which require harnesses, there are alternative routes for people not wanting to do this however. So if you have experience in exploring rock faces and caves you will thoroughly enjoy it.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 16 Years Old.",

The major highlight here is the largest extant species of lemur, the wonderful and very vocal (you are likely to hear them before you see them) indri. Also found here are red-bellied lemur, common brown lemur, lesser bamboo lemur, brown mouse lemur, greater dwarf lemur, eastern woolly lemur and aye ayes (although they are incredibly hard to see).

This area is a montane forest park offering the chance to spot a variety of lemurs, reptiles and birds; including the most famous inhabitants; the Indri. But also known from here are the wonderfully coloured diademed sifaka and a range of other diurnal species. You can also arrange extra night walks with your driver / guide if you wish. There are leaf-tailed geckos, many chameleons and if you are very keen eyed the tiny brookesia chameleons can be found here. Mantadia is a little different from Andasibe and is more humid forest covered with lians, moss, fern tress and more than hundred orchids species blooming between September and January. It is a good way to compare the subtle differences between the two forested habitats. (breakfast is the only meal included today)"

You will set off east towards the Pangalanes Canals on the east coast (5-6 hours). Once you get to the coast you will have lunch and then take a boat trip along the lagoons and network of waterways until you arrive at the private reserve of Palmarium. The rest of the day is yours at leisure to relax and enjoy the lemurs that live (semi-wild) in the trees around the lodge (the lodge has various introduced species) or maybe pop down to the lake for a refreshing dip! At 17:30 you can book on a tour to the nearby island where there is a small population of reintroduced aye ayes (additional cost paid direct to the lodge – not very much). The island the aye-ayes live is called Ankanin’ny Nofy and is around 1 hour boat ride from the lodge. The history of the aye-ayes here is that a number of years ago local people found 2 aye-ayes living in the forests around their village (where the island now is) and they mentioned it to the reserve. As aye-ayes are killed for superstitious reasons by many local people in Madagascar the reserve wanted to protect them. So the reserve bought the forest that the aye-ayes were living in and cut the forest off from the rest of the mainland. The island was made with a small channel (around 2-3m wide and 1-2m deep) to that local people left them alone. Since them more and more aye-ayes were found and captured from certain deaths and brought here. They had so far rescued 4 aye-ayes in addition to the two which were here originally. This population has been living free and wild since then in their own private forest. They have bred and there is now a 7th aye-aye on the island. For tourism the aye-ayes are fed every day in the evening, coconuts and bananas (a small amount and not the total amount of food needed for them to survive) is provided so that people can see these incredible animals up close for around 1 hour before the island is deserted by all people.

This park protects a large tract of rainforest in the east of the island. It is also one of the best places in the Madagascar to see a wealth of wildlife, including many species of lemur. The park is also home to the very rare golden bamboo lemur, which is often seen here in the mornings. Rano is Malagasy for water; mafana is Malagasy for hot; around a hundred years ago a Malagasy discovered hot springs down in the valley, and the French created a spa around them. This has now become the town of Ranomafana and where you will be staying. This evening (depending on the time of your arrival this could be after getting to the accommodation and settling in, or on the way to the accommodation), we will do a night walk in search of brown mouse lemurs, greater dwarf lemurs and many species of chameleons which can be seen along the roads here after dark.

This area is a montane forest park offering the chance to spot a variety of lemurs, reptiles and birds; including the most famous inhabitants; the Indri. But also known from here are the wonderfully coloured diademed sifaka and a range of other diurnal species. You can also arrange extra night walks with your driver / guide if you wish. There are leaf-tailed geckos, many chameleons and if you are very keen eyed the tiny brookesia chameleons can be found here. Mantadia is a little different from Andasibe and is more humid forest covered with lians, moss, fern tress and more than hundred orchids species blooming between September and January. It is a good way to compare the subtle differences between the two forested habitats. (breakfast is the only meal included today)"

You will set off east towards the Pangalanes Canals on the east coast (5-6 hours). Once you get to the coast you will have lunch and then take a boat trip along the lagoons and network of waterways until you arrive at the private reserve of Palmarium. The rest of the day is yours at leisure to relax and enjoy the lemurs that live (semi-wild) in the trees around the lodge (the lodge has various introduced species) or maybe pop down to the lake for a refreshing dip! At 17:30 you can book on a tour to the nearby island where there is a small population of reintroduced aye ayes (additional cost paid direct to the lodge – not very much). The island the aye-ayes live is called Ankanin’ny Nofy and is around 1 hour boat ride from the lodge. The history of the aye-ayes here is that a number of years ago local people found 2 aye-ayes living in the forests around their village (where the island now is) and they mentioned it to the reserve. As aye-ayes are killed for superstitious reasons by many local people in Madagascar the reserve wanted to protect them. So the reserve bought the forest that the aye-ayes were living in and cut the forest off from the rest of the mainland. The island was made with a small channel (around 2-3m wide and 1-2m deep) to that local people left them alone. Since them more and more aye-ayes were found and captured from certain deaths and brought here. They had so far rescued 4 aye-ayes in addition to the two which were here originally. This population has been living free and wild since then in their own private forest. They have bred and there is now a 7th aye-aye on the island. For tourism the aye-ayes are fed every day in the evening, coconuts and bananas (a small amount and not the total amount of food needed for them to survive) is provided so that people can see these incredible animals up close for around 1 hour before the island is deserted by all people.

Antsakaviro village is a reserve initiated by a local association. Ideally located at the foot of the 'woman lying,\" it deserves our support. The ring-tailed lemurs may be waiting for you at the foot of this huge cliff face that gives its character to this spectacular site. The reserve is relatively small, being on twenty hectares and the villagers have begun restoring the site by replanting endemic species on the edge of the forest. It is a great opportunity to encourage local people to protect the natural heritage of their land and is also a beautiful walk in the shadow of the impressive mountainside of Antsakaviro. On the way, we will discover many graves, including the impressive standing stones called the vatolahy, which means locally “the male stone”, and stand as a tribute to the tumultuous past of this region. We will arrive back at camp at approximately 10:30 from here we paddle a short distance to our picnic area which is often visited by crocodiles. From here we only have a few more miles to the finish of our descent. We will arrive 400 meters away from where we met our car and driver, from which we will head back to Ambalavao.

Zombitse boasts fantastic flora as well including orchids and ficus making this a stunning national park! Facing the Mozambique Channel and the superb coral reef of Ifaty, less than 20 kms from Tuléar, you will discover the beauty of beaches not tainted by mass tourism. Ifaty is a small fishing village with palm-fringed white beaches on the south-western coast of Madagascar, and is an ideal place to relax after visiting the central highlands. The beach is relatively narrow, but the (off shore) snorkeling and diving is good. In July and August, you may see migrating whales pass nearby through the Mozambique Channel. Between May and October, the humpback whales can sometimes be seen with their whale-calves. Upon arrival in Ifaty, your driver and guide will leave you.

The spiny forests inland from Ifaty are of great interest to birdwatchers and botanical enthusiasts alike. Here you will be able to see some very large iconic Baobab trees, an abundance of birds (a true paradise for ornithologists) as well as possibly some locally endemic species such as the long-tailed ground roller and sub-desert mesite. This unique habitat is severely threatened by deforestation and by visiting these sites, you will not only enjoy some of the little remaining spiny forest in Madagascar, but also actively contribute to its conservation (the sites are currently not protected).

        "description": ": Our tour starts today in Madagascar's capital, Antananarivo (also known as Tana). Built over 12 hills, the city is a tapestry of old and new with French colonial buildings, modern offices and apartment blocks vying for space. For those arriving in time, our tour leader plans to meet you in the hotel reception at 6pm for a welcome meeting and for those that wish, there is the chance to go out for dinner. There are no activities planned today, so you're free to arrive in Antananarivo at any time. If you'd like an airport transfer today, you'll need to arrive at Ivato International Airport (TNR) which is around a 15-minute drive from the hotel. Should you miss the meeting, your leader will inform you of any essential information as soon as you catch up. If your flight arrives earlier in the day, you might like to get to know Tana at your own pace. Take a walk to soak up the capital's colourful landscape, its houses stacked one upon the other down the sloping hills of the highlands."

        "description": ": We have an early start to kick off our trip, leaving the city at around 7am this morning. We'll drive to Andasibe village, sometimes referred to by its French colonial name; Perinet. Although only eight square kilometres, Analamazoatra Reserve in Andasibe boasts nine species of Lemur, including the Indri Indri, whose morning calls can be heard piercing through the forest. After lunch, we'll trek in search of the Indri families in the area. Although the paths are often easy to follow, sometimes pushing further into the bush is required to spot these exquisite creatures in the trees, so it'll be an adventurous walk to kick off our two weeks searching for lemurs. This evening, after dinner, we'll head out again with a local national park guide in search of the smallest of the lemur species, the mouse lemurs. Although nocturnal, these creatures can often easily be spotted along the one-kilometre roadside route that we'll follow this evening. As well as spotting tiny lemurs, it's common to see colourful chameleons, frogs and exotic insects."

We'll be up early to drive to the nearby Analamazoatra reserve. Mantadia and Analamazoatra reserve are both part of the same precious forest ecosystem but due to continuous deforestation in the area, they are now separate parks. We'll spend around four hours searching for the black and white ruffed and Diademed Sifaka lemurs, as well as taking the opportunity to spot some birdlife. After a busy morning searching for wildlife, we'll return to Andasibe for lunch. Then, this afternoon, there will be an optional visit to the small sleepy village of Andasibe itself where we can walk amongst its quiet streets and drop in on its market."

Antsirabe's cool climate made it a favourite spot with European missionaries and French colonialists, and their influence is still present in the colonial architecture and churches. Set in the Central Highlands, the town is a clash of cultures with fading, ornate colonial architecture, colourful rickshaws pedalling up and down the streets and souk-like stalls selling goods to both local residents and visitors."

Their woodwork pieces - depicting Malagasy life and detailed marquetry work - are well-known for their fine standard of craftsmanship. Tonight, we'll visit a local development guest house to enjoy a traditional Malagasy meal and see a folk dance.

Towards the end of the drive, we'll head down from the highlands and into the rainforest. The Ranomafana National Park is Madagascar's third largest national park, established after a new species of lemur named the Golden Bamboo was found here in 1987. The lush forest area is also known for its hidden waterfalls and the Namorona River which flows through impressive gorges, flanked on either side by tropical rainforest.

It's the only location in Madagascar where we can see all three species of Bamboo Lemur, namely the lesser Bamboo Lemur, the greater Bamboo Lemur and the Golden Bamboo Lemur which gets its golden colour from the cyanide compounds found in the bamboo it eats. Depending on how lucky we are finding lemurs, we'll spend around three to four hours trekking along the forest trails in search of wildlife. As well as the Bamboo Lemurs, we might have the chance to see Red-Fronted Brown Lemurs, Red-Bellied Lemurs and Milne-Edwards Sifaka. Most lemur species are sadly now endangered, the last survivors of a once abundant family of primates, now confined to pockets of forest and bush throughout Madagascar. Deforestation has taken a heavy toll on these arboreal creatures - it's estimated only 80 species remain. With luck, we might also spot the Malagasy boa constrictor, chameleons, the black parrot, cuckoo roller and many other birds. The afternoon will be free to relax or to go on an additional optional walk within the park for the chance to spot the species not already seen during the morning."

Dervla Murphy, in her book Muddling through Madagascar, describes the terrain as 'Landscapes that are literally incredible. You don't believe it. You think you're hallucinating. How can wind and water have done all this?'. Natural erosion has produced fantastic canyons and bizarre outcrops of wind-blasted sandstone and we'll head out on a walk to take it all in. The walk will last around 90 minutes, along dry, dusty paths with a slight ascent to a natural oasis pool known as Piscine Naturelle where we'll stop for a picnic lunch. After eating, we'll continue exploring to see the tombs of the Bara people and the sparse, dry forest species of dwarf-like baobab. This afternoon, there'll be the opportunity to take an optional walk with a local guide to Namaza to see the Cascade des Nymphes.

We'll stop at Zombitse National Park, where we'll stretch our legs on a two-hour walk through the remarkable dry forest which is home to many birds, including black parrots, the Madagascar buzzard and the cuckoo roller. There's also the opportunity to spot the shy ring-tailed lemur here.

Antsirabe is the third largest city in Madagascar situated in the high altitude (about 1, 500 metres). The cool temperatures in the high altitude are the reason why the Norwegian Missionaries chose this city in 1872. Antsirabe is the home of one of the award winning best beers in Madagascar THB (Three Horses Beer). Its name means “where there is salt” honouring the large number of hot springs the town has, a fact that has given the city the nickname of “Malagasy Vichy”. The thermal baths had been long appreciated for their curative effects by the local population when French colonists decided to locate a thermal bath here in the 19th century. Ranomafana is a mid-altitude rainforest and spreads over 41,601 hectares. Ranomafana offers skilled nature guides and are great help in finding elusive bird species. Ranomafana National Park’s success is because of one woman’s vision and dedication to preserve the nature and wildlife. Dr. Patricia Wright is considered to be one of the world’s foremost experts on lemurs, Wright is best known for her 26-year study of social and family interactions of wild lemurs in Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar. Birds that can be found at Ranomafana include the ground-rollers such as the Pitta-Like Ground-Roller which is common. When it gets dark you will take a night walk with a guide to observe the nocturnal lemurs (active only during night time)."

It can get very hot during the day, especially in the open savannah grassland, which should be visited in the early morning hours to beat the heat. Ankarafantsika is a great place for birdwatchers, as it is home to 129 bird species (75 of which are endemic to Madagascar). Birds are easy to spot and photograph in the deciduous forest. Birds found here include Van Dam’s Vanga, the Sickled-billed Vanga and the Crested Drongo."

Lac Ravelobe is an amazing place for bird watching to see waterbirds, such as fish eagles, heron or ibises. The lake is rich in wildlife and history. As well as birds, the largest carnivorous mammal, the Fossa, is also found here. Half of its diet consists of lemurs. Fossa also feed on tenrecs and other small mammals, lizards, and birds. In addition, the park hosts a tortoise breeding program for several rare and endemic species, including the ploughshare (Geochelone yniphora), which is endemic to the Bay of Baly."

Antsirabe is a tidy, well maintained town which combines the tranquility of a small European provincial town with the exuberance of traditional Malagasy buildings. The third largest city in Madagascar, Antsirabe is known for its relatively cool climate (as the rest of the central region of the country), its industry and the high concentration of pulled rickshaws. Along the way you can choose to stop off and visit Ambatolampy (the biggest town between Tana and Antsirabe) where we may get the chance to see craftsmen building aluminium pots amongst other things. Alternatively, if time allows, you can also visit Lake Tritriva which is a 2 hour round trip to a stunning lake of volcanic origin with blue/green waters, surrounded by beautiful scenery – walking around the lake will take approximately 1 hour, during this time we will likely meet many local Malagasy people. Where we will stop and what you will do today will depend on your preferences. Today will be a great chance to experience Malagasy life on the road!"

The trip will take us trough dense forests and along a calm river (the few rapids we will encounter of the next few days are gentle and can be avoided if you don’t want the potential of a swim….. that said the first rapid tends to be the one to catch most of us out). We start by a half day train journey through scenic and interesting landscapes. The train ride takes approximately 5-6 hours. We will be travelling on reserved 1st class seats (the train can get pretty full!) and will disembark in Manampatrana, where the Faraony river winds gently between boulders, cliffs and cultivated banks. We will meet our canoe team and set off on a short canoe downstream (grade 1 and 2 rapids) before stopping on one of the beaches to setup camp (afternoon showers are not unusual in this area). Your guides and canoe team are in charge of all the logistics (food, firewood etc.) and you only have to put up your own tent.

    "generalInfo": "A distinctly unique island nation separated from the mainland millions of years ago, the biodiversity of Madagascar has developed very differently from the rest of Africa. It is home to countless species found nowhere else on earth, although sadly many are in decline. Our journey takes us to superb private reserves and  national parks where essential conservation work is aiming to save the unique flora and fauna that makes Madagascar so special. <br/><br/>The adventure commences in the eastern humid forests of Andasibe and Mantadia, one of the best places in Madagascar to see the curious indri, the largest species of lemur with its haunting cry that echoes through the forest. We will visit and take part in a forest regeneration project. Heading through the terraced emerald fields of the highlands, we arrive at the lush rainforests of Ranomafana, home to the rare bamboo lemur, only relatively recently discovered to science.  Visit the community run reserve of Anja where your visit helps to secure the salary of local teachers. The soaring granite domes of Andringitra and curiously carved rock formations of Isalo are next up, before we arrive at the azure waters of the Mozambique channel in the far south west.  <br/><br/>After some time to relax by the idyllic coast, a final wildlife treat awaits with a a visit to Berenty Reserve, an important private habitat which for decades has been instrumental in the knowledge, understanding and conservation of lemurs. Here you should in particular enjoy excellent observation of the Ring Tailed Lemur amongst other species. <br/><br/>Join us on this superb adventure showcasing the very best of Madagascar's truly unique biodiversity. We believe that by visiting the protected areas of Madagascar, we can help authorities to understand that it is vital that what remains should be preserved and what has been lost can be perhaps to some extent regenerated.",

Yet in Baobab Alley, they cluster together forming an avenue of columns that border the dirty road. The Baobabs are tall trees with its massive trucks, crooked branches and furry fruit. Baobabs have adapted to the dry and hostile environment. The secret of the baobab's success in surviving in harsh environments and the reason for its massive trunk is that it has little wood fibre but a large water storage capacity. Each tree can hold up to 300 litres of water, enabling it to live through long periods without rain. The life-cycle of these unique natural oddities is as impressive as their bulk - most live over 500 years. The best time for photography is in the twilight hours.

You will meet with Malagasy historian Chez Haga to learn about the history. As you have lunch you will look at the beautiful blue hills that united modern day Madagascar. The Royal Hill of Ambohimanga is the cradle of the kingdom and the dynasty that has made Madagascar a modern state, internationally acknowledged since 1817.

Located at the heart of the Ambodifotatra bay, “l’île aux Forbans” (pirates’ island) hosted legendary figures of piracy such as Robert Cullford, John Avery, Christophe Condent, Thomas Tew, William Kidd and Olivier Le Vasseur. The pirates were accepted by the local population and this cultural melting pot gave birth to a new ethnic group which is known as Zana- Malata. Several historical wrecks remain in Sainte-Marie, especially around the seas of “L’île aux Forbans”. Captain Kidd’s story has been told for several hundred years.

This tour is a specialist mammal watching holiday of this wonderful island, full of endemics and rarities such as Aye-ayes, Fossa and Indri are all highly targeted on this specialist wildlife safari holiday of Madagascar.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/><br/>We are specialists in tailoring specialist mammal watching tours and holidays all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife tours in Madagascar which combine various different wildlife watching activities. In order to develop our unrivalled range of combined wildlife watching holidays, our guides and colleagues around the world have spent years searching out the world’s best wildlife watching locations as well as visiting some seldom visited areas. This dedication has led us to create this wildlife and cultural tour that explores some areas that are seldom visited by most safari goers to Madagascar. <br/><br/>This tour starts at the wonderful central capital city of Antananarivo (Tana) and explores west and east of this city; firstly visiting Kirindy National Reserve which is well known for a couple of very special species, the largest predator on the island the fossa and the smallest primate in the world, Madame Berthe's mouse lemur. Along with these two species we will target various other animals in this dry scrub forest reserve, before heading to Tsingy de Bemaraha National Park and exploring the incredible limestone karst formations and caves here looking for more rare and highly localised species. From these very dry and rocky areas you will head back east and to the wetter and more forested reserves of Ranomafana, Anja, Andasibe and Palmarium which host a wealth of species including the iconic Indri, Bamboo lemurs, Ring-tailed lemurs and of course the Aye-aye. This is the first and only dedicated mammal focused tour of Madagascar and aims to see most of the island's most iconic and rarest species. <br/><br/>All of our tours are guided by our own professional local guides so you are sure to be in the best hands possible for the best sightings. We also have a great network of local guides in Madagascar who have developed a great range of wildlife watching locations where the rarest species are commonly seen. Also to try and make sure that we will see as many of the rarer and elusive animals when in the reserves we will spend many hours during the early morning and late afternoon on foot and also after dark each night we will head out with high powered spotlights and start the search for nocturnal species. <br/><br/>One of the reasons why our wildlife watching holidays are unique is that our background (as a company) is from a scientific and zoological standpoint and so have a great network of colleagues and contacts all over the world who are the people on the front line in search of the best new locations for wildlife watching. All of these reasons and many more make us experts in arranging safaris and are able to tailor a safari to any location to try to find your targeted species. All you have to do is to get in touch with your budget and your group size and where you would like to go to try and find rare and elusive species.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including all breakfasts (except when in Tana). There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) will escort you on all your excursions and also very knowledgeable English speaking local guides who have decades of experience working and guiding throughout Madagascar. Your zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) escort is an expert in mammal biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge of where some of the most elusive Madagascan animals are; as well as having years of experience in bringing people out to see the lemurs and other species. We also include all guided walks, spotlighting walks, cultural performances, cultural activities, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the forests or some other wildlife watching activity. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour.<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>We recommend October and November for this trip which is when the fossa are breeding and they are very active and easier to see than other times of year. This is also the dry season and many lemur species are also easy to see and the weather is dry. The only downside of this time of year is that many tenrecs are difficult to find as they prefer the wet season. But we can also arrange the trip for the wet season and all other times of year.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>•\tAll of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by a local naturalist guides, drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>•\tWe can offer you spotlighting trips around many forests and reserves in the Madagascar so that you can search for the rarer species and other nocturnal wildlife when they are more active. These conservancies are community projects which increase income to the local community whilst preserving the natural ecosystem.<br/>•\tWe can also bring thermal imaging and night vision equipment as well as spotting scopes (on request) to also aid in finding the nocturnal mammals after dark and scan the horizon for harder to see species.<br/>•\tWe use camera traps (where available) which will increase the chances of getting close up pictures and movies of rare animals and other rare nocturnal wildlife.<br/>•\tHike the stunning and forests and various ecosystems on the world's most unique and special island for wildlife and endemism.<br/>•\tVisit the free living rescued populations of various lemurs and even have them jumping on you in Palmarium.<br/>•\tExplore the amazing limestone rock formations and caves in search of lemurs, bats, geckos and endemic rodents in the Tsingy.<br/>•\tAll the above reasons give this Madagascan safari holiday a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. <br/>•\tWe have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Africa so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the Lemurs, Big Five, gorillas, chimpanzees and hundreds of other species throughout Africa. Whether it is the Madagascar, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Gabon, Ethiopia, South Africa, Namibia, Botswana Tunisia or Rwanda or any of the other many wildlife watching locations you want to visit we can arrange it. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>•\tUnlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour travels to Kirindy, Morondava, Antananarivo, Tsingy de Bemerhara, Ranomafana, Andisibe, Antsirabe, Anja, Mantadia and Palmarium which form a kind of belt from west to east across the middle of Madagascar.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>A good level of psychical fitness is needed as all of the wildlife watching is done on foot, we spend between 4-10 hours a day on foot and temperatures can be very hot and humid.

Baobabs are distinctive trees adapted to thrive in harsh conditions. Six of the nine species of baobabs are found only in Madagascar so it's no surprise that this is the national tree.

The park is also home to the very rare golden bamboo lemur, which is often seen here in the mornings. Rano is Malagasy for water; mafana is Malagasy for hot; around a hundred years ago a Malagasy discovered hot springs down in the valley, and the French created a spa around them. This has now become the town of Ranomafana and where you will be staying. This evening (depending on the time of your arrival this could be after getting to the accommodation and settling in, or on the way to the accommodation), we will do a night walk in search of brown mouse lemurs, greater dwarf lemurs and many species of chameleons which can be seen along the roads here after dark.

Once you get to the coast you will have lunch and then take a boat trip along the lagoons and network of waterways until you arrive at the private reserve of Palmarium. The rest of the day is yours at leisure to relax and enjoy the lemurs that live (semi-wild) in the trees around the lodge (the lodge has various introduced species) or maybe pop down to the lake for a refreshing dip! At 17:30 (if we arrive in time) you can book on a tour to the nearby island where there is a small population of reintroduced aye ayes (additional cost to the lodge – not very much). You can also arrange another aye-aye excursion for tomorrow if you wish – or if you arrive too late to make this evening’s departure. The island the aye-ayes live is called Ankanin’ny Nofy and is around 1 hour boat ride from the lodge. The history of the aye-ayes here is that a number of years ago local people found 2 aye-ayes living in the forests around their village (where the island now is) and they mentioned it to the reserve. As aye-ayes are killed for superstitious reasons by many local people in Madagascar the reserve wanted to protect them. So the reserve bought the forest that the aye-ayes were living in and cut the forest off from the rest of the mainland. The island was made with a small channel (around 2-3m wide and 1-2m deep) to that local people left them alone. Since them more and more aye-ayes were found and captured from certain deaths and brought here. They had so far rescued 4 aye-ayes in addition to the two which were here originally. This population has been living free and wild since then in their own private forest. They have bred and there is now a 7th aye-aye on the island. For tourism the aye-ayes are fed every day in the evening, coconuts and bananas (a small amount and not the total amount of food needed for them to survive) is provided so that people can see these incredible animals up close for around 1 hour before the island is deserted by all people.

Head out on a walk along the ‘Chemin des Crabes’ (Path of the Crabs) to see the vibrant birdlife, beautiful baobabs and the famous hairy crab. You’ll be enchanted by the kaleidoscope of colours and shapes of the reserve’s common birds, from the vibrant red fody and Souimanga sunbird, to the exotic paradise flycatcher and sickle-billed vanga. It’s also one of the best places to spot the regal Madagascar fish eagle, shy crested ibis, or rare Madagascar sacred ibis. At the end of the walk, you’ll visit a small cave where you will find a fossilized lemur skull, stalactites and sharks’ teeth. You’ll return to the lodge for lunch and a leisurely afternoon. Take a dip in the infinity pool filled with seawater, or discover the private coves surrounding the lodge and marine reserve. Another day, enjoy a long walk along the Giant’s Causeway and King’s Alley. You’ll discover extremely ancient baobab trees, tsingy rock formations found only in Madagascar, and a variety of lemurs including the Coquerel’s sifakas. These remarkable animals live in family groups of up to 10 individuals, and although they are perfectly adapted to life in the trees, they often descend to the ground. Unlike the famous Verreaux’s sifaka from southern Madagascar with its characteristic sideways dance, the Coquerel’s sifaka bounces across the ground like a miniature kangaroo. The sifakas, along with troops of common brown lemurs, roam freely in the gardens and surrounding reserve. Anjajavy Lodge can also arrange customised excursions to neighbouring islands and nature reserves, where you can tour the island, and go scuba diving, snorkelling, fishing or quad biking. Visit the cave of the Sakalava, where you’ll discover an underworld of stalagmites and stalactites and meet the Madagascar bats, or enjoy a romantic picnic on one of the deserted beaches along the Anjajavy peninsula. Venture to Antafiamoara, where you’ll meet the Giant tortoises who were reintroduced to the Anjajavy Reserve in 2018, after 750 years of extinction, or visit the villages of Anjajavy and Ambodro Ampasy, where you can explore markets filled with crafts made by the villagers."

Culturally, too, the island has evolved in a particularly unique way, fusing different cultures, cuisines and languages. This small group holiday to Madagascar explores the centre and south of this island in just over two weeks, taking in some of its most extraordinary landscapes including the rock pinnacles of the Tsingy de Bemaraha, and the lunar-like landscape of Isalo National Park. Ranomafana National Park, with its lush rainforests, is a complete contrast; here you will find numerous lemur species including the endangered golden bamboo lemur.<br/><br/>Look out for indris in Andasibe, and listen out for their eerie, whale-like calls. This small group holiday in Madagascar ends on the coast at Ifaty, allowing for a couple of beach days to relax and reflect over the past two weeks of adventure on an island quite unlike anywhere else on earth.",

This really feels like frontier-land, as the road snakes through arid landscapes of thorn, lush savannah and passes typical west Madagascar villages consisting of tiny wooden huts. The locals will greet you with warmth and genuine interest, and children love to run alongside the vehicles, as their mothers stride on, carrying unfeasibly heavy loads to and from local markets, atop their heads. Some of today’s most memorable features are the water crossings as you ford your way across saline flats and through rivers, the most substantial of which is the Kabatomena. Along the way, watch out for chameleons and some of the many non-poisonous snakes of the island. Expect to arrive in Manja late afternoon. A former colonial hub, as evidenced by the exquisite, but faded grandeur of its more substantial buildings, nowadays, the locality is characterised by its fertility – corn, rice and beans all fill the region’s fields, making Manja a small, but bustling market town.

The spiny forest with its distinctive bush is home to a host of natural wonders: 95 percent of plant species here are endemic and lemur, mongoose, sifaka and even the Madagascar radiated tortoise are all to be seen in the landscape, so it is well worth keeping an eye on the surroundings. For those keen on birding, several coua and vanga species are to be seen and Madagascar buzzards and Madagascar kestrels are regular companions in the skies above. The drive includes a ferry across the Mangoky River to reach the town of Bevoa and the crossing of two further rivers. The road then sweeps west towards the coast and you will stop on several occasions too before your arrival by the end of the afternoon at Andavadoaka’s stunning coastal location.

At Tuléar, you will move onto the luxury of Madagascar’s premium highway, National Road 7! This stretches as far as the capital, but today your goal is Isalo.

The drive is through the huge savannah region of Plateaux de Horombe, with its vivid red soil, until arrival in Ihosy the capital of Bara tribes, the proudly independent shepherd tribe who herd the idiosyncratic Zebu cattle. The tribal culture is wound closely around the Zebu: to be allowed to marry a wife, a man has to steal several zebus as a badge of his strength and virility. The death of a Bara hunter is similarly marked by the sacrifice of the cattle. The next phase of the trip heads towards the spectacular mountain chain of Andrigitra National Park: the landscape changes dramatically, with huge domes of granite searing out of the flower-carpeted grassy plains, with Varavarana (“The gateway to the South”) and the imposing and locally sacred Bonnet de l’Evêque (“Bishop’s Mitre”) being especially dramatic examples. The latter is held locally to be a sacred spot, where few traditionally ventured. You pause for a visit to the thriving community-run park at Anja: this is a place for excellent, close-up encounters with many of the extremely tame 300 ring-tailed lemurs; beyond this, a local trek or hike up to the seemingly unassailable cliff tomb. Beyond the lemur, reptiles and insects here include the idiosyncratic trio of Barbour's day gecko, Dangalia lizard and planthoppers, as well as beautiful species of bird such as Grey-headed lovebird and Souimanga sunbird. The income from your visit will go towards the salaries of teachers in the local school. From here, transfer to 4WD: your route heads down an exhilarating dirt track for around 35 km through some of the most spectacular views that Madagascar has to offer, until you reach your destination in the heart of the Tsaranoro Valley, close to the gates of the National Park.
