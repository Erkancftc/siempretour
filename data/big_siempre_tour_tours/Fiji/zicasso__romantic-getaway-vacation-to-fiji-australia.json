      "title": "Davui Island - Lavish Tropical Romance",
      "description": "Fiji conjures images of exotic trees, crystal clear waters, friendly people, and soft sandy beaches. Upon your arrival at Nadi International Airport, you will quickly realize there is so much more to the island country. Your private transfer will be waiting at the airport to take you to the port for your ferry ride to Davui Island. Viti Levu, the largest of the archipelagic islands, has a sweet aroma of hibiscus that emanates from the tall grass. You will soon board a private shuttle boat that whisks you across the indigo water. The cool morning air becomes misted with the slightly salty aroma of the South Pacific. Davui Island will come into view where your secluded resort awaits with what is known as barefoot luxury. You step onto the island to find luxuriant accommodation as your room opens up to a view of the water and the nearby rolling hills covered in lush foliage. The water laps quietly at the shore as the marble floors provide an extra gloss to the already gleaming resort as people pass you with bright, wide smiles, each person quick to say, “Bula!”"

      "title": "Davui Island - Exotic Romance",
      "description": "In the morning, you will wake up to a beautiful view of the open water. You can step off your balcony and dip your toes into the cool morning sand. The white, powdery layer rushes into the ocean. At breakfast, the colors of the islands continue to shine brightly, filled with local flavors found around the archipelago - from great coconut to lively pineapple, even succulent pomelo, a fruit similar in looks to a grapefruit but with a more citrusy orange flavor. The day will yours to indulge in the island as you wish, allowing you to absorb the “barefoot luxury” connotation. You can sit in the shade of your balcony listening to the breeze ruffling the palm leaves or lay out on the hot sand of midmorning, dipping your toes into the water now and again to feel the cool ocean refresh your skin. Take out a sea kayak and venture out into the water. The paddles drip onto your seat when you lift them, splashing against the kayak. The current is gentle allowing you to paddle at your own pace. When you look back towards the island you find a panorama of white sand, emerald trees, and indigo ocean settled around your partner for the best view you have ever seen."

      "title": "Davui Island - Enchanting Lagoon",
      "description": "At breakfast, you will enjoy both the scenery and the company as you bite into a succulent rambutan underneath the banyan tree canopy. The aroma of sweet fruit blends into the soft sea breeze and the view only gets better each day you are on the private island. After breakfast, you will meet your guide for a daylong excursion to Beqa Lagoon nearly eight miles off the coast of Viti Levu. You will pull on your wetsuit and let the tight fit layer your body like a second skin. Then, you put on the tanks, splash into the water, and follow your guide down below. The sunlight can shine to a depth of 120 feet below the water’s surface, spotlighting florescent fish and equally stunning coral. Coral reefs protect the lagoon from inclement weather, flaking the outer reaches of the bay with up to 18 miles of firm calcite. You will reach a site called Sea Fan Alley, where two rocks form a dramatic corridor opening to a view of gigantic sea fans. The soft coral shimmers with purple, red, and yellow, with over 500 species found around the world that wave up and down in the current."

      "title": "Davui Island - Wild Day Trip",
      "description": "The next day, you will spend the morning lounging on your seaside balcony with a private breakfast for you and your partner to share. Listen to waves gently break against the sand with no unnecessary distractions from the beauty in front of you. Following your meal, you will have a private transfer back to Viti Levu for a daytrip along the Navua River. The Rive begins at Mount Gordon and flows around 40 miles through the dense jungle before reaching the ocean. The Upper Navua River meanders around the rainforest highlands, carving the hills into gorges. You and your partner will step onto an inflatable raft and begin to paddle. The water is cool and fresh, unlike the temperate saltwater on the beach. The current will carry you along the river, beside lush hills that turn into limestone walls. Waterfalls brush down the earthen walls and splash into the river creating ripples in the sounds of aquatic thunder. The water turns shades of turquoise against the dense overhanging emerald foliage. Even when paddling through the rush of small rapids you can look around the riverbanks with your partner and notice unparalleled island luxury."

      "description": "You wake up to breakfast and decide to picnic on the beach, where you can pull fresh grapes off of a vine with one hand and dig your other hand into the warming indulgent sand. The seaside paradise heightens the already romantic ambiance between you and your partner. You will spend today pampering each other, truly relaxing with a couple’s spa treatment that combines modern methods with ancient care for a refreshing day. The scent of fresh coconut milk mixes with the sea breeze. The small breaking waves will become the soundtrack to your massage. You will embrace the sweet, captivating coconut aroma, as you settle into the soothing touch of your masseuse. At night, you and your partner can sit under the stars at a private table near the water and enjoy a specially prepared menu."

      "title": "Davui Island - Sensuality of Cuisine",
      "description": "Over the past few days, you will have discovered the sensual nature of food, enjoying the flavors of the local traditional fruits and cuisine of the island, and taking pleasure in your partner’s company at each meal. After breakfast, you will spend time with a cooking demonstration where you will learn how to prepare one, or a number of Fiji’s succulent dishes. The fresh seafood caught around the islands can’t be beat. Your chef will show you how to create a decadent lolo , coconut cream, to help steep prawns caught earlier that morning. You add onions and tomatoes and let the ingredients slowly simmer until the decadent dish is complete and ready to taste. The sweet and savory flavors marry perfectly in every bite, making the dish rich but not heavy. The demonstration will bring you and your partner closer together as you agree that you should make the dish at home at the first opportunity."

      "description": "Each morning you will wake up to the swaying palm trees and sweeping white sand of the island and have to remind yourself that this tropical paradise is real, and the person you are sharing the luxuries of the island lifestyle with is just as real. Your last full day in Fiji will be at your whim and pleasure, allowing you to bask by the pool or sip an ice cold drink while you are knee deep in the ocean. For an adventurous day, you can venture back to the rainforest of Viti Levu where you will meet your guide at the port and head up into the rainforest canopy. The dense emerald leaves are brighter the higher up in the trees you climb. You step out onto a platform with your partner, dressed in a helmet and industrial harness. Your guide will clip you to the line and count down from three before you suddenly soar through treetops. The wind will blow against your cheeks and you will feel the rush as you speed through the air. The leaves will turn a blurry green and you will hear the river rushing below you as it winds along the rocky banks. You will arrive at the platform across the canopy, with 16 total lines to glide down. Then watch as your partner cries out with excitement as they fly across the rainforest."

      "description": "When you wake up in the morning, you opt for one more private balcony breakfast overlooking the pristine beach. The music of the breeze and breaking waves creates the charming atmosphere you have celebrated since your arrival in Fiji. After your meal, the resort boat will take you back to the marina on Viti Levu where a private transfer escorts you to the airport for your flight to Sydney, Australia. The city maintains a relaxed beachside energy with a lush edge, where people enjoy the surf and sand along with elegant outfits and opulent dining. Your private transfer will meet you at the airport and escorts you to a luxurious hotel with a view overlooking Darling Harbour, home to the charming rooftop sails of the Sydney Opera House."

      "description": "On your first morning in Sydney, the sunrise hovers over the horizon and casts layers of orange and purple along the white ceramic tiles of the opera house. The light glints off of the pristine arching design to mirror the morning hues. At breakfast, you will enjoy the refreshing coastal breeze with a romantic view of the boats that venture away from the harbor. After your meal, ride a bicycle to explore the cityscape away from the main streets, where you can enjoy a different view of the city. You and your partner will ride side by side through the Royal Botanic Gardens, where the aroma of blossoming lilies and roses has braced the lush greenery since the early 19th century. The skyline begins to shape, overlooking the gardens. You ride over to the Manly Beach’s Scenic Walkway, a 7-mile stretch of that connects Manly to Spit Bridge. The views that overlook the harbor are immaculate as they open up the surrounding sub-tropical rainforest, which is juxtaposed by shimmering coastal waters and the modern, luxurious suburbs situated near the harbor. Birds twitter in the trees, the fertile landscape emanates a piney aroma, and you will watch as sailboats glide underneath the bridge."

      "description": "Bondi Beach is known for its spectacular surf, joyfully relaxed atmosphere, and the combination of boardwalk fish and chips with elegant modern dining establishments that overlook the water. After breakfast, you will make the quick journey to the far reaches of the beach along the inviting golden sands. Waves break near the edges of the bay but the current pushes the water into the sides of the Olympic sized swimming pool underneath the Bondi Icebergs swimming club. The club was established in 1929 and remains a place for people to practice swimming in the winter. The beach has been featured in American and Australian pop culture including the hit reality series, Bondi Rescue. The sand soaks up the heat from the sun and the water is refreshingly cold, as it will cool down your skin after the sun washes over it. The sea mist splashes through the air and blends in with the enticing aroma of fresh fish and chips situated on the esplanade. For classic fare overlooking the water, you can enjoy a meal in the Icebergs Swimming Club dining room."

      "description": "You wake up to the bustling energy along the harbor, where ferries cross to the suburb-lined shores opposite the city center. After breakfast, you and your partner will enjoy Sydney and its surroundings at your leisure. Venture outside of the city to witness the natural majesty of the Blue Mountains National Park or stroll the neighborhood of Gleve, filled with young professionals, local cafes, and a charming park. Near your hotel you will find the Rocks, situated at the protruding tongue of the natural harbor. The area is the first home of the Gadigal aboriginal tribe and it became the first European settlement on the continent. Over 100 heritage sites commemorate the city and Australia’s history, including the oldest surviving house in the city, Cadman’s Cottage, which was constructed in 1816. Restaurants and cafes line the narrow cobbled streets and market stalls situate themselves inside historic facades while aboriginal art galleries display traditional styles of cultural art. The aroma of freshly baked pretzels mixes with the sweet cream of a local ice cream shop, making it the perfect place to stroll hand in hand with your partner and meld into the city like a local."
