Luxurious, secluded resorts offer the best of island life and modern comforts. Your private transfer awaits your arrival at the airport, taking you to Denarau Marina. Step aboard a private catamaran destined for your resort on Malolo Island. The morning light spreads across the water and sparkles against the turquoise surface. When the boat weighs anchor representatives from your resort are already waiting, eager to greet you with a warm a “Bula!” You walk along the jetty and take in the view of the island. White beach surrounds dense tropical jungle. Thatched hut buildings stand where the sand meets the trees. Your room is equally marvelous, situated on stilts and overlooking the water offering seclusion and enchantment.

      "description": "Your balcony opens up to an unparalleled vista overlooking the indigo ocean with a small island on the horizon. Indulge in your first breakfast on the island. Sit with your partner underneath the palm tree canopy with sounds of gentle breaking waves creating a unique soundtrack to the morning. An array of tropical fruits creates a colorful addition to your meal, filled ruby rambutan, and canary yellow pineapple. You have the rest of the day to embrace the island life as you wish. The island contains a collection of trails that allow you to explore the beauty of the rainforest and offers a panorama of the shores. You take the trail marked for Jonas Lookout and begin to wind your way through the trees. The canopy shades you from the island sunlight. The path meanders upwards towards Uluisolo, the highest point of the island at 719 feet above sea level. It was once used for fortification purposes during World War II. When you reach the lookout, you can see your overwater bungalow in the distance. The rings of color on the water are more apparent than ever, ranging from turquoise near the shore to indigo when the seafloor deepens, to azure in the distance. Your place on the trail offers beauty and tranquil seclusion for you and your partner to enjoy."

      "title": "Malolo Island – Wandering Reefs",
      "description": "The morning begins another perfect day in paradise. You can hear the water gently brush against your bungalow’s stilts. You look down and see a collection of fish moving gracefully, unperturbed by the water’s current. At breakfast, you take a bite of a succulent coconut and realize the sensual fragrance you have noticed around the island emanates from the natural coconut in the trees. The oil lingers on your fingertips making your skin silky. The day offers perfect light to venture out into the water to enjoy the majestic marine life. The sun can shine to a depth of 120 feet in the clear water, illuminating a stunning assortment of fish and coral. Your resort provides you with snorkel and goggles, so you can grab your partner’s hand, wade into the temperate South Pacific waters, and move with the current overlooking the stunning coral reefs. You let the water embrace you as you swim just off shore to the jutting reefs. Coral trout and zebrafish glide in schools above the vivacious layers of hard coral. Blue Damselfish can grow up to 14 inches and have a particular iridescent top fin. They swim in and out of open coral pockets but are hard to stop staring at."

      "title": "Monuriki – Enjoying the Breeze",
      "description": "Enjoy an early morning breakfast when the breeze calm. After your meal, you step aboard a catamaran and watch the sails catch the increasing wind for a tremendous island hopping tour around the Mamanuca Islands. The water mists into the air and you feel the cooling spritz on your skin. The sun shines bright and warm. You pass the resort beaches of Castaway Island and the tall lush hill of Matamanoa Island. You reach the uninhabited shores of Monuriki, known as the location of the Tom Hanks film, Castaway, and the boat anchors. The rainforest coats the island’s interior, climbing the hillside to an elevation of 584 feet. The volcanic islet blends powder-white sand, dense tropical jungle, and rugged mountain landscape all the while surrounded by gentle turquoise sea and reaching coral reefs. Coastal forests provide shade from the midmorning light. Screw pines resemble palm trees and carry heavy fruit dangling from the canopy. The fruit has a large spiked exterior with a succulent interior. The beauty of Monuriki comes as much from its natural splendor as from its unique uninhabited serenity, providing tranquility and seclusion."

      "description": "In the morning, you watch the fish scurry beneath the lapping water once before breakfast. You are equally torn about leaving your tropical paradise but excited about the coming wonders on your New Zealand vacation . After breakfast, your catamaran escorts you back to Port Denarau where you will continue onwards to Nadi International Airport. New Zealand is known for its natural lush, verdant hillsides, graceful alpine landscape, and sensational coastline created by millions of years of volcanic activity.

      "title": "Waiheke Island – Art Walk",
      "description": "Waiheke Island could be dubbed a natural art walk, where you can stroll along serene beachside paths and take in the fertile volcanic soil near rugged bays and crashing waves. After breakfast, the day is yours to experience and explore the island as you please. The island contains multi-million dollar homes, a bohemian artist ambiance, and plenty of splendors for everyone to enjoy. Connells Bay is a sculpture park featuring numerous New Zealand artists. Each piece represents a deeper expression of the artist’s connection to the landscape and their history, always open to interpretation. The Dark One by Bob Stewart is a large, reflective boulder that looks both prehistoric and futuristic. It was made from greenstone and andesite to create the shimmering façade. Wen you stroll around the different art pieces it is not just the art that makes the impact, but the sculptures surrounded by the island. From the swaying trees to crashing waves manicured grass to the aroma of nearby grape vines; when compiled these components offer an unforgettable, passionate experience."

      "title": "Queenstown – Island Beaches to South Island Mountains",
      "description": "You watch the waves crash against the rugged island outcropping and can see the mist splash into the air. A slight breeze carries the sea’s aroma over an expanse of the island. After breakfast, you board a ferry back to Auckland for your flight to the alpine city of Queenstown, located on the South Island. When you arrive your private transfer greets you at the airport and escorts you to your lavish lakeside hotel. Queenstown has an active energy at all times of the year, filled with winter and summer thrills, along with pristine mountain landscape encompassing the entire cityscape. On the far side of Lake Wakatipu is the rolling, rugged Remarkables Mountains. The foothills of Bob’s Peak slope down into the city’s edge. You settle into your villa accommodation where you can see the reflective waters of the lake from your private balcony. The elegant hotel was constructed with beechwood and stone to bring an alpine ambiance to the already spacious atmosphere."

      "title": "Queenstown – Over the Mountains",
      "description": "In the morning, you hear birds chirping in the forest trees. Early thrill seekers are already soaring through the sky on hang gliders, having jumped from a designated area atop Bob’s Peak. You spend the morning with your partner cozying up to one another in the crisp mountain air. The nearby trees and mountain peaks make every warm cup of freshly brewed coffee taste that much more special. After breakfast, you can make your way to the gondola station located just outside of the city center. Bob’s Peak stands at 5,735 feet above sea level, towering over the city with Douglas fir and beech clad forests. The piney aroma filters through the cool air. Midway up the mountain you look out of the surrounding glass windows for a 220-degree epic panorama of Queenstown and the landscape beyond. You notice the size of the city, thinking about its energetic atmosphere, and realize it is more of a town. At the top of the summit, the rugged mountaintop shows through the tufts of high altitude grass. You can wander through the stretch of tracks winding along the mountains, strolling along a cold-water stream and crisscrossing the terrain."

      "title": "Queenstown – Embracing Doubtful Sound",
      "description": "The alpine breeze ripples the lake and brings a refreshing chill to the morning. After breakfast, your guide meets you in the hotel lobby and takes you out of Queenstown for the day. You journey over Wilmot Pass; dense rainforest lines the roadway. When the road begins to slope downward, you have a brief panorama of Doubtful sound glistening below. It is hard to take in all of the ardent beauty around the sound, which was shaped by ancient melting glaciers. You board a spacious catamaran begin to cruise the waters. Your guide points out the trees climbing the rocky foothills. The water is cold and serene. The aroma of beech trees drifts across the water. You find Deep Cove, one of the deepest and most remote parts of the Tasman Sea. The area receives around 25 feet of rainfall each year, combining a large amount of freshwater to the saltwater inroads. Bottlenose dolphins poke their curious noses out of the waters before leaping near the boat. They can grow to an average of 13 feet long and maintain a playful personality throughout their lives. In the distance, you see a large waterfall casting a veil of freshwater down the cliff into the sound below."

      "title": "Queenstown – Together Tasting the Mountains",
      "description": "Your last full day in Queenstown can be spent however you prefer. You can stroll through the botanical Queenstown Gardens to see the charming stone bridge and lily pads, or spend a rush-filled afternoon on a Dar River jetboat excursion. For a more romantic tour, your guide meets you at the hotel and takes you to into the Central Otago region to visit some local wineries, many having won awards for their Pinot Noir. The region basks in its motto, “A World of Difference,” where the mountain ranges turn into wide, barren plateaus. The tremendous array of the landscape creates defining characteristics for each vineyard. When you reach the Rockburn Winery, you find acres of golden leaved vines stretching to the rolling foothills. The sunlight glints off the grapes after the fields have been watered, shimmering off of golden and purple fruit. The aromas of the fertile and rugged earth combine around cool storehouse where oak barrels storage barrels are stacked. In the tasting room, your guide pours you a sample of the Gold Medal winning 2013 Pinot Noir. You find a hint of black cherry and mocha on the nose with silky tannins on the body. The balance of nature and indulgent flavors is always soothing, especially when shared with someone you love."

      "title": "Queenstown – Non-Stop Splendor",
      "description": "The Z-shaped waters of Lake Wakatipu span 113 square miles. The odd shape creates a small tide that laps at the shores throughout the day. An old paddle steamer from 1912 continues to cross the lake, a remnant of the region’s gold mining era. You wake up with the hot, refreshing flavors of a freshly brewed coffee. After breakfast, your private transfer meets you at the hotel and escorts you to the Queenstown Airport for your flight home. You have seen opulent sounds and dug your feet into the pristine sand. You have traversed mountains and rainforests with your partner, creating everlasting memories in unforgettable locations."
