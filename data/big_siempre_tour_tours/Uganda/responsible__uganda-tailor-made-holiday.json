  "generalInfo": "Trekking to see mountain gorillas in Uganda is an unforgettable and often humbling experience. These endangered animals have long made Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park their home and being invited into their natural habitat is an absolute privilege, not to be taken lightly.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, Queen Elizabeth National Park provides further examples of Uganda’s wild appeal. This ten day holiday also allows access to a series of national park game drives where tree climbing lions, hippos and elephants can all be found, especially whilst cruising on the Kazinga Channel.<br/><br/>From the chimpanzee sanctuary on Lake Victoria’s Ngamba Island to tracking wild chimps in Kibale Forest National Park, although gorillas are the main draw for wildlife enthusiasts in Uganda their not too distant cousins are never far behind.<br/><br/>Uganda is an incredible location to watch wildlife and this ten day tailor made tour places you in luxury accommodation and with knowledgeable safari guides to ensure your time in Africa is certainly well spent.   <br/><br/>One last point: it’s important to understand that this tailor made holiday has a couple of gorilla tracking options to suit this particular itinerary, pending availability. Basically, Volcanoes National Park in Rwanda makes for a worthy substitute if Bwindi is fully booked. Please get in touch for more details.<br/>",

      "description": "Depart your lodge, for the short drive to the Entebbe domestic airport for your scheduled flight to Kihihi airstrip, near Bwindi/Queen Elizabeth National parks. The flight takes just over an hour (depending on the plane used) and on arrival you will be met and driven to Buhoma Lodge, located at Bwindi Impenetrable Forest. The drive to the lodge is through local villages and mountain roads – lovely scenery and very interesting en route! Guests will have the opportunity for two days of gorilla tracking (pre-booking essential). Other activities that can be enjoyed in and around the park include forest walks, visits to a local school or orphanage or Batwa pygmy village, and curio shopping. Bwindi National Park, located in south western Uganda on the edge of the Great Rift Valley, is considered the most diverse forest in Uganda. The area, one of the few large expanses of forest in East Africa, where lowland and mountain habitats meet, contains a dense ground cover of herbs, vines, and shrubs. Home to over 120 mammals, 345 species of birds, 200 species of butterflies, and 160 species of trees, Bwindi is one of the richest ecosystems in East Africa. The park contains almost one half of the world’s population of the endangered Mountain Gorilla, making it an extremely valuable conservation site. Bwindi is also home to several endangered bird species with very limited ranges, and acts as an important catchment area for many rivers, supplying water for agriculture in the surrounding region. Overnight: Buhoma Lodge"

      "description": "Following breakfast at the lodge, travel to National Park Headquarters to meet your guides for the day and begin your gorilla tracking experience. Experienced guides and trackers will accompany your party on an early morning trek into the dense rain forest on the mountain slopes. The journey, through dense foliage and up steep climbs, is abundantly rewarded with the lifetime experience of viewing mountain gorillas in their natural habitat. You will have an opportunity to be within meters of these magnificent apes, sharing in their daily lives and experiencing their day-to-day activities. Mountain gorillas are extremely rare with only an estimated 850 remaining in the wild. This is an experience you won’t soon forget! Following the trek, return to your accommodation and, if time allows, take a guided afternoon forest or community walk. Please note: tracking may be fairly strenuous with treks up to six hours or longer, at high altitudes, not uncommon. Also, mountain gorillas are wild animals and, as such, sightings cannot be guaranteed. However viewing success rates are over 90%. Overnight: Buhoma Lodge"

      "description": "Those with pre-purchased permits will depart for a second gorilla tracking experience following breakfast at the lodge. Guests not tracking gorillas may wish to enjoy other activities available in the area such as a forest walk, a visit to a local school/orphanage or Batwa pygmy village, and curio shopping. In the afternoon depart Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park and travel (2-3 hours) to Ishasha in the southern part of Queen Elizabeth National Park. Time permitting, during our drive from Bwindi to Ishasha, we may visit a Community Project on the border of Queen Elizabeth National Park. Here the local people allow you to enjoy some time in their homesteads, as well as see some of the crops and curios they produce, and visit the local elephant trench project – which stops elephants coming into the village and raiding crops.

      "description": "Spend the day enjoying game drives in the Ishasha sector of Queen Elizabeth National Park. Queen Elizabeth National Park spreads over 1,978 sq km in the western arm of the Great Rift Valley and is home to a wide variety of wildlife including elephants, lions, hippos, buffalo, Uganda kob, baboon, and many species of birds. With both a riverine and savannah habitat, the park includes the southern Ishasha area with its tree climbing lions and Maramagambo, one of the largest surviving natural forests in Uganda. The northern Mweya area, traversed by the equator and dominated by the scenery of crater lakes, is often occupied by large flocks of flamingos. A boat trip from Mweya along the Kazinga Channel, which joins Lakes Edward and George, provides one of the most memorable experiences offered by the park. Overnight at Ishasha Wilderness Camp"

The many nearby crater lakes and mountain ranges provide a beautiful backdrop for your journey. Enjoy a leisurely boat cruise along the Kazinga Channel in Queen Elizabeth National Park. You may encounter herds of elephant, buffalos and antelopes, families of warthogs, large groups of hippos, and crocodiles basking on the shore. Kazinga’s shores are a haven for numerous birds, including many migratory species as they make their way south to warmer climates. The cruise also provides a spectacular view of the beautiful Mweya Peninsula and life in local fishing villages set along the banks. Overnight at Mweya Safari Lodge"

      "description": "On this day drive to Kibale Forest – a 2-3 hour drive from QENP (north) on good roads. On a clear day you may get views of the Rwenzoris in the distance. Two nights spent in the area to allow time for chimpanzee tracking in the forest, (permits must be pre purchased). You can also do a forest walk (guided) during your stay, or simply enjoy the area and perhaps visit the Bigodi Swamps, or the Vanilla Farm close to Ndali. All meals included. Kibale is one of Uganda’s enchanting forested parks. Here, you can hike in the park for hours observing the drama of life in a rain forest. The park contains pristine lowland tropical rain forest, montane forest, and mixed tropical deciduous forest. In addition to forest, you will also notice areas of grassland and of swamp. The forest is rich in wildlife. It is most noted for its primate population. Some of these are red-tailed monkey, diademed monkey, olive baboon, chimpanzee, black and white colobus. Some of the other mammals you might see are bushbuck, Harvey’s red duiker, blue duiker, bush pig, and African civet. More difficult to spot are buffalo, waterbuck, hippo, warthog, and giant forest hog. Herds of elephant once travelled back and forth through the area. These elephants have become more and more rare, and now are seldom seen. The birdlike in the forest and grasslands of the forest is abundant. There are almost 300 species, which have been identified here. One particularly worth noting is the endemic to Kibale forest. Overnight at Primate Lodge:"
