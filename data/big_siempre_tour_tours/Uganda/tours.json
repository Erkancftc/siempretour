After an early breakfast you will join your transfer to the offices of the National Park where upon arrival you will be allocated a gorilla family, an 8-person group and a gorilla trekking guide. After a briefing into what lies ahead, including safety precautions and an introduction to the behaviour of the gorillas, you will be driven to the trailhead for the start of your thrilling adventure. Depending on the gorilla family that you have been allocated the trek to see them can take anywhere from 15 minutes to 6 hours so patience and an average fitness level are required. The terrain can be muddy, and rainy weather is likely, but as you trek through the jungle the anticipation of seeing these gentle giants in the wild, along with the spectacular views and likely bird sightings on offer, is likely to be more than enough distraction from that. And we can almost guarantee that when you come face to face with these majestic animals the trek will soon become a distant memory! Upon sighting the gorillas your group will be allowed one hour with them to watch them as they go about their daily lives; feeding, moving, playing, wrestling and feeding their young – this will be a totally unique and unforgettable experience! Gorilla trekking experiences in Bwindi have been designed to ensure that numbers are kept to a minimum whilst still offering the experience of seeing these animals in the wild so that more can be done to protect them and ensure the species’ ongoing survival. The vast majority of your gorilla permit cost goes to protecting these vulnerable animals and ensuring that their population thrives. Without tourist visits there would be substantially less funds available to do this. Each of the habituated families of mountain gorillas are only allowed to be visited by one group of eight people per day, and only 72 visitors are allowed each day. After your thrilling experience of witnessing the famous mountain gorillas up-close, your guide will lead you back to base where you will be transferred back to the lodge for a delicious dinner and the chance to reflect on what may well have been the greatest wildlife experience of your life."

The area, one of the few large expanses of forest in East Africa, where lowland and mountain habitats meet, contains a dense ground cover of herbs, vines, and shrubs. Home to over 120 mammals, 345 species of birds, 200 species of butterflies, and 160 species of trees, Bwindi is one of the richest ecosystems in East Africa. The park contains almost one half of the world’s population of the endangered Mountain Gorilla, making it an extremely valuable conservation site. Bwindi is also home to several endangered bird species with very limited ranges, and acts as an important catchment area for many rivers, supplying water for agriculture in the surrounding region"

Please note: tracking may be fairly strenuous with treks up to six hours or longer, at high altitudes, not uncommon.

With both a riverine and savannah habitat, the park includes the southern Ishasha area with its tree climbing lions and Maramagambo, one of the largest surviving natural forests in Uganda. The northern Mweya area, traversed by the equator and dominated by the scenery of crater lakes, is often occupied by large flocks of flamingos. A boat trip from Mweya along the Kazinga Channel, which joins Lakes Edward and George, provides one of the most memorable experiences offered by the park."

The many nearby crater lakes and mountain ranges provide a beautiful backdrop for your journey. Enjoy a leisurely boat cruise along the Kazinga Channel in Queen Elizabeth National Park. You may encounter herds of elephant, buffalos and antelopes, families of warthogs, large groups of hippos, and crocodiles basking on the shore. Kazinga’s shores are a haven for numerous birds, including many migratory species as they make their way south to warmer climates. The cruise also provides a spectacular view of the beautiful Mweya Peninsula and life in local fishing villages set along the banks."

Two nights spent in the area to allow time for chimpanzee tracking in the forest, (permits must be pre purchased). You can also do a forest walk (guided) during your stay, or simply enjoy the area and perhaps visit the Bigodi Swamps, or the Vanilla Farm close to Ndali. All meals included. Kibale is one of Uganda’s enchanting forested parks. Here, you can hike in the park for hours observing the drama of life in a rain forest. The park contains pristine lowland tropical rain forest, montane forest, and mixed tropical deciduous forest. In addition to forest, you will also notice areas of grassland and of swamp. The forest is rich in wildlife. It is most noted for its primate population. Some of these are red-tailed monkey, diademed monkey, olive baboon, chimpanzee, black and white colobus. Some of the other mammals you might see are bushbuck, Harvey’s red duiker, blue duiker, bush pig, and African civet. More difficult to spot are buffalo, waterbuck, hippo, warthog, and giant forest hog. Herds of elephant once travelled back and forth through the area. These elephants have become more and more rare, and now are seldom seen. The birdlike in the forest and grasslands of the forest is abundant. There are almost 300 species, which have been identified here. One particularly worth noting is the endemic to Kibale forest."

You then have time to relax at the lakeside restaurant or back at your lodge before taking another game drive, after dark this time, to see some of the park’s nightlife including, if you are lucky, aardvark and pangolin."

The lake has a total surface area of 60sq km and is surrounded with 20 small islands encircled by steep terraced hills.

These include mangabey, colobus and L’Hoest’s monkeys and we will also dedicate a day to chimp tracking. <br/><br/>This itinerary is created in a way that brings more and more excitement for wildlife lovers every day. Next stop is, therefore, Queen Elizabeth National Park, where two game drives will hopefully bring you in sight of four of the Big Five along with thousands of hippos and over 600 species of birds. The latter are best seen on your cruise along the Kazinga Channel, leading into Lake Edward. <br/><br/>Then, last but not least, the fauna finale of this holiday is the gorilla safari and trekking expedition that takes place in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, home to over half of the earth’s 800 or so mountain gorillas. Travelling in a small group means that we are able to organise the much sought after gorillas safari permits in advance, staying in a nearby mountain lodge that is at the heart of the small rural community here.<br/><br/>And for one more treat before you go, this trip also includes a visit to Lake Mburo National Park, which is conveniently close to Kampala  for your departure, but also famous for its zebra, hippo and buffalo residents. This is a wonderful place to not only take a boat trip, given that there are five lakes in the park, but also a walking safari, following in the footsteps of expert park rangers and guides.<br/>",

On top of this, we’ll have a true African safari experience at two stunning national parks, where you'll have a chance to photograph the Big Five – lions, leopards, elephants, and buffalo – as well as many small mammal and bird species. Get ready for some incredible wildlife photography opportunities! <br/><br/>During this Uganda photo tour, you’ll be guided by award-winning wildlife photographer Emil Von Maltitz. He’ll provide photographic tutoring, both during theory sessions and in the field, and will be able to offer assistance with technical issues, composition, and post-production. Since we’re traveling in a small group, there will be plenty of time for individual tutoring.",

En route, you will visit Ziwa Rhino Sanctuary where you will go for a game walk with an experienced ranger, which gives you a unique opportunity to view the rhinos from a close distance. Murchison Falls and Kidepo Valley National Parks once had both black and white rhinos; however, widespread poaching during the Idi Amin era resulted in the disappearance of these majestic animals from the wild. Founded in 1998, Rhino Fund Uganda works to reintroduce black and white rhinos into Uganda and runs a breeding programme. Murchison Falls National Park is the largest conservation area in Uganda, covering an area of over 3,840 km². The park’s name derives from its famous waterfall: the mighty Murchison Falls, which are formed where the Victoria Nile powerfully forces its way through a narrow cleft before plunging 43m down with a thunderous roar The mighty Nile River divides the park into its north and south sections. At the spectacular Murchison Falls the world's longest river explodes violently through a narrow cleft in the Rift Valley escarpment to plunge into a frothing pool 43m below. As the river attracts large numbers of game, a boat safari up the Nile provides the perfect opportunity to see and photograph the animals. Carefully watched by crocodiles, hundreds of hippos, buffaloes, water birds, apes and all the other thirsty wildlife that the Nile attracts; you go to the bottom of the Murchison Falls, which approaches you with a thunderous sound. By car or after a short hike you can reach the “Top of the falls” from where you have a perfect view of the impressive falls and the river snaking below. You will be staying at a great mid range lodge. Here you can relax during the rest of your day. Journey Time: 7 hours Accommodation: Pakuba Safari Lodge Meal Plan: All meals"

En route, you will visit Ziwa Rhino Sanctuary where you will go for guided rhino tracking with an experienced ranger, which gives you a unique opportunity to view the rhinos from a close distance. Kidepo Valley and Murchison Falls National Parks once had both black and white rhinos; however, widespread poaching during the Idi Amin era resulted in the disappearance of these majestic animals from the wild. Founded in 1998, Rhino Fund Uganda works to reintroduce black and white rhinos into Uganda and runs a breeding programme. Murchison Falls National Park is the largest conservation area in Uganda covering an area of over 3,840 km², The Park’s name derives from its famous waterfall: the mighty Murchison Falls, which are formed where the Victoria Nile powerfully forces its way through a narrow cleft before plunging 43m down with a thunderous roar The mighty Nile River divides the park into its north and south sections. At the spectacular Murchison Falls the world's longest river explodes violently through a narrow cleft in the Rift Valley escarpment to plunge into a frothing pool 43m below. As the river attracts large numbers of game, a boat safari up the Nile provides the perfect opportunity to see and photograph the animals. You will be watched by crocodiles, hundreds of hippos, buffaloes, water birds, monkeys and all the other thirsty wildlife that the Nile attracts, you go to the bottom of the Murchison Falls, which approaches you with a thunderous sound. By car or after a short hike you can reach the “Top of the falls” from where you have a perfect view of the extraordinary falls and the river snaking below. You will be staying at a great mid-range lodge, overlooking the River Nile. Journey Time: 6 Hours Accommodation: Murchison River Lodge Meal plan: All meals"

The forest is rich in wildlife. It is most noted for its primate population. Some of these are red-tailed monkey, diademed monkey, olive baboon, chimpanzee, black and white colobus. Some of the other mammals you might see are bushbuck, Harvey’s red duiker, blue duiker, bush pig, and African civet. More difficult to spot are buffalo, waterbuck, hippo, warthog, and giant forest hog. Herds of elephant once travelled back and forth through the area.

With a few days in each of Lake Mburo National Park, Queen Elizabeth National Park and Murchison Falls National Park you will discover not only wildlife spectacles but landscape ones as well. The wildlife spots are also a lot quieter than other safari destinations as Uganda is still very much undiscovered in terms of tourists, and local people will welcome you with open arms. <br/><br/>Highlights include taking a boat along Kazinga Channel which is lined with elephants, buffalo, marabou storks and Nile crocodiles. The vast Murchison Falls National Park is bisected by the River Nile and wildlife cruises here are also unforgettable experiences. You can trek to the top of the Falls too if you like. This is a tailor made trip and so we can fine tune any details to suit your timeframe and interests. <br/><br/>Travelling with your own driver guide and staying at safari lodges or tented camps, you will wake up to the sound of wildlife and birds, and no better place for the latter than at Lake Mburo National Park, the last stop on this Ugandan trip. Because its wetlands and savannah are home to over 350 bird species as well as hippo, buffalo and zebra. <br/>",

We are by no means winding down from your experience yet though - we drive this morning, until lunch, before entering Lake Mburo National Park for a wonderful game drive this afternoon. Although one of Uganda's smaller National Parks, it has a wonderful selection of African birds and mammals to spot: impala, warthog, zebra, buffalo and is particularly known for its hippos and African fish eagles. Tonight you stay in an eco-friendly hotel/restaurant nestled on a scenic outcrop at the edge of the park: a secluded retreat in the Ankole ranch lands where we stay in comfortable and spacious 'cottages' dotted around the hill. During dinner the game spotting continues as herbivores often congregate at the water hole beneath the dining area. Overnight: Hyena Hill Lodge"

While they have been habituated to human presence, these are wild apes in their remote natural habitat. Nothing can be predicated, other than that you will see the gorillas. Park rules allow you to come within seven meters of the gorillas, except nobody told the giant apes and inquisitive youngsters often approach you. Babies take tree climbing lessons beneath mothers' proud stare, while large silverbacks send shudders through the earth as they walk along on knuckles. Sometimes the gorillas are in a playful mood, chomping at fruit and teasing their younger cousins with tongue-in-cheek antics. At other times you find a stern scene, the troop settling scores and arguments amidst an atmosphere of tension. Only around 1,000 mountain gorillas remain in the wild, and the Nkuringo troop are one of the most remarkable. Of the 19 individuals, there are four silverbacks, powerful males that will one day try and lead their own family. Such a profusion of testosterone often means elaborate shows of power and heart-racing encounters. Five infants provide the cutest memories, including a very rare set of gorilla twins. They're easily recognizable, crisscrossing above your head as they explore the higher branches of the canopy; watch the brief moment of fear in their eyes as a branch snaps and they tumble down to the forest floor. You'll spend an hour with the Nkuringo troop before returning by foot through the forest, where the lodge offers a serene place to relax and recount the experience."

The hike isn't easy, with the trail cleared by machete and the steep muddy hills making for slow progress. Yet it's always rewarding, between one to three hours spent in a primitive rainforest that's as dense and green as the imagination can allow. Eight different troops can be tracked from the Rushaga trailhead so you can ask for a shorter or longer hike dependent on where the troop can be located. You've seen them before but the nerves still jangle a little as you approach the gorillas, the troop greeting you with an inquisitive stare. A mother bounds out on her knuckles, then rises high to showcase her power; there's no denying who is the boss here. The hour spent with the troop is generously observed, and it's ample time to take photos, then put the camera away and enjoy the enchantment of the experience. Return to the trailhead and it's a short journey up the hill to the lodge, where the intimacy of gorilla trekking is complemented by the open grandeur of the forest view."

Ugandan kobs are the abundant prey, small antelopes that graze in herds with sentinels gazing upwards as the others feed. Elephants march along the savanna, large herds a compelling counterpoint to the fearful menace of the resident lions.

Higher slopes are raw and scarred, pockmarked by holes as they live up to their local name, translated into English as the Mountains of the Moon. Today's drive brings you north, winding beneath the resplendent summits before dipping beneath the canopy of Kibale Forest. You should arrive in time for a guided tour of Crater Lake, where hundreds of colorful bird species reside and the sound of resident primates echoes across the water.

Up ahead you can hear the chimps, the playful tones suggesting that the troop is in an excited mood. The guide slices through the undergrowth, and you come to a forest clearing, where over 50 chimpanzees stop what they're doing and inspect your arrival; much like the gorillas, they can be as interested in you as you are in them. Three swing past, taking a keen interest in the camera. Another ten stop their playing to say hello with curious eyes. There are too many to count, yet you easily get lost in the individual details; a human-like hand grabbing a sharp stone, communication made with facial expressions, a sudden call that brings a dozen chimpanzees towards a patriarch. These rare primates can only be seen in a small handful of places across Africa and Kibale is one of the finest, both for the authenticity of the experience and the number of chimpanzees that can be encountered."

        "description": "Spend an hour in Kidepo Valley National Park, and you immediately wonder why nobody has heard of it before. Lions stand majestic on the scorched snippets of grass, their manes blending into the savannah’s color. Buffalos gather in huge herds, imposing and inspiring in equal measure. Elephants roam, giraffe grace the horizon, and it is easy to see a dozen different species on the first hour of a game drive. Yet the park receives less than 5,000 visitors a year (for perspective, Ngorongoro Conservation Area in Tanzania gets more than 600,000). Inaccessibility is both its challenge and charm. Butting up against the border with South Sudan in a vast area of almost uninhabited desert, the park is a two-day drive from Entebbe, and at least a full-day journey from the nearest main town. You need a lot of time and patience to get here on the dirt roads. Or you will need to fly, which is exactly what you will do this morning. Touch down, and the game drives provide fascinating first impressions. The landscape is incredibly open with very little in the way of trees or features that interrupt the view. This visibility makes it wonderfully easy to spot wildlife from afar. Tension dominates the atmosphere, stemming from the relative lack of resources. There is not enough to eat, nor enough to drink, so animals compete wildly, creating drama on a vast scale. You do not just see lions and buffalos here; you witness viscous daily battles between pride and herds. Elephants or giraffe aren’t always the friendly giants you would expect; the males are constantly quarreling on the savannah. Best of all, none of the wildlife is particularly used to seeing a safari vehicle. So, animals react naturally with some running, some turning aggressive and both scenarios leading to lesser-seen safari moments."

Game drives respond to what is happening, from the distant echo of an angry male lion to the prints left behind by an old elephant bull searching for water. You follow the herds to the waterholes, sometimes finding scenes of hostility, other times finding ungulates bunched together for strength in numbers. Dawn and dusk should be maximized, a time when lions and cheetahs are on the prowl, camouflaged into the rustic colors of the savannah. There may be some opportunities for walking safari around the lodge, although this is really dependent on recent animal sightings; sometimes the predators and giants can be seen directly from your veranda. Over these three days, you settle into the rhythm of the wilderness. Exotic sounds travel on the breeze, alerting you to a zebra grazing nearby, or a flustered herd of Ugandan kob. It often seems like you smell the tension in the air, especially when a drumbeat of hoofs is followed by the menacing eyes of four lionesses. The park is vast and to get the most from its diversity, you will need to go on full-day game drives, taking a picnic lunch to eat beside a waterhole. On these journeys, it is rare that you see another vehicle or tourist; in fact, it can be a good thing to see one, as the guides share information on what has just been witnessed in the surrounding area. Few parks are as remote as this one, and spending three days here provides an immersion into a world that has yet to be featured on wildlife documentaries."

More than that, it’s the epitome of the Ugandan wildlife experience, this rare opportunity to get incredibly close to one of the world’s most endangered creatures. There are no fences or barriers. Just a thick untrammeled forest, where two-thirds of the planet’s wild mountain gorillas find refuge. They are surprisingly bashful creatures, the troops preferring a life of solitude in deep parts of the forest. Yet they are also big and powerful, proudly standing on two legs and facing visitors with steely eyes. On a gorilla trek, you witness both the shyness and the power, particularly when you first reach the troop. Two or three are likely to greet you, waving arms and commanding respect, before retreating towards the rest of the troop. Creep closer, coming within just seven meters from the gorillas. Two juveniles play in the branches throwing fruit at each other. A blackback male seems inquisitive, slowly moving on four knuckles, getting a little closer to your camera. The silverback seems peaceful, broad arms pulling at thick tree branches. Two more gorillas are gnawing at tree bark while three more start climbing amongst the branches in the canopy, directly above your head. You have a full hour with this wild troop, watching them go about their day, feeding, foraging, nurturing, sharing expressions and silent communication. Gorilla trekking usually takes a full day, and you take a picnic to eat in the forest. Later in the day, the luxury lodge provides a space to rest and recount the experience."

But when the chimpanzee turns, you see that it’s old, eyes and face cast in a show of melancholy. Another chimp crosses the clearing, also walking on two legs. Researchers have long known about this behavior, one that makes chimpanzees seem more human than ever. Yet it is only really in Semuliki National Park that there is a chance of witnessing it. The forest is sparser, and the troops live closer to the ground, creating a phenomenon that is as compelling as it is confounding. You trek into the rainforest and spend an hour with a troop, the journey often taking you to remote tracts of the Congo Basin. As the chimpanzees are closer to the ground than normal, there’s so much more detail you can take in. Fingers curl, foreheads frown, the troop looks at you with intense curiosity. And then you’re engulfed in the atmosphere, surrounded by the whole troop of chimpanzees. They’re looking at you as much as you are looking at them, and it’s this feeling that makes chimpanzee trekking so delightful.

Buildings rise high in the distance, and wild mammals are spotted roaming the grasslands, buffalo among those juxtaposed with the lights of the city. It is an indication of the land’s history when rhinos and lions were sometimes spotted in the streets. It is also an introduction to how wildlife is integral to everything in Kenya. No other country has preserved its landscape so well, more than a million large wild mammals freely roaming across plains and forests. Your hotel has the legendary Nairobi view, the contrast between wild and urban seen directly from your balcony. You will be greeted at the airport for the transfer, and dinner at the hotel will be included. The hotel is also ideally situated for tomorrow’s departure, just a five-minute transfer to the domestic airport."

A herd of trunk-swinging pachyderms is cast against the volcanic cone of Africa’s highest mountain. You glimpse the scene from the air, then find yourself watching the vista from the camp, such iconicity and inimitability in a single glance. Amboseli reveals so much more about safari than these famous three sights. Lions lounge on open and scorched grass, panting in the morning sun. Zebras and impalas skip past, watching you for a moment before continuing their journey. Buffalos skirt the edge of the camp, close enough for you to hear them huffing and puffing. Touch down, and combine a game drive with a short game walk, two activities that focus on different animals, and help gather an alluring first impression of wild Kenya."

A leopard descends from a tree, then disappears into the grass as tension enlivens the atmosphere. A cheetah is stalking slowly and softly with her cub in attendance. You can hear the crunches and cracks that accompany a big male lion biting into a carcass, smearing blood around his mane. Around lunchtime, you will return to the camp for a leisurely few hours before an afternoon safari activity. You can choose between a game drive or a game walk. The drive takes you into the land of the giants, while the walk creates personal moments with the contrasting antelopes which rumble past as you step across the plains of Kenya."

        "description": "Flying west, you connect the two great highlights of Kenya, soaring past Mount Kilimanjaro before the grasslands of the Masai Mara stretch out beneath the wingtips. Hyenas greet you, a whole cackle of them inhabiting the dusty path to the camp. Wildebeest are scattered with the zebra. Thousands of them can be spotted in a single panorama even when it is not the Great Migration season (late July to October in the Masai Mara). The wilderness envelops you, and when you look out from the camp, the scene could not be more iconic. All around you can witness buffalos, elephants, giraffes, and large herds of Thomson’s gazelle with their ears sensing for danger. Over these two days, your program is flexible and private, game drives following the dramatic predatory scenes, and game walks accompanied by Masai warrior guides, the gatekeepers to this pristine landscape. Find a wildebeest herd and watch them multiply, hundreds more arriving over the rise, the males galloping in a show of virility. From a distance, the zebra herd resembles a gray ball. Get closer, and it is a black and white mass, their clever tactic for deceiving the lions. Take a step closer still, and you admire the individuals, every set of stripes unique, and every face filled with emotion. These great herds are often a highlight of the walks, which are only possible in the private conservancies like Mara North. Access is restricted to Mara North Conservancy, so your photos are not interrupted by other vehicles. On the game drives, you can veer off the trail, getting even closer to the legendary big cats. Lions basking on the rocks, the pride illuminated as if being cast for a movie. Hyenas return your stare, somewhat ugly at first, but entertaining when you follow their movements. Then you spot a leopard prowling. Dipping her neck with a solemn precision, she sets off towards the gazelle, keeping so low to the ground you lose her in the grass. From the elevated vantage point of the vehicle, you see her appear and disappear. Baboons start hooting from the trees, their shouts followed by a flock of rowdy storks. The gazelles are alerted, and they disappear, the hunted helping each other out on grasslands where only the fittest survive. You follow the leopard, watching her return to the trees where a small cub makes for adorable images."

Hot air ballooning at sunrise is followed by a champagne brunch and insight into the Mara River, a game drive following the curves past the waiting predators. While the river is famous for the wildebeest crossing, animals come to drink here all year round. And when zebra or wildebeest are drinking, you can guess that big cats and crocodiles will be lurking very close by. Spending a day on the river always brings drama, and you will enjoy a camp that has enviable views over the water."

Spend the afternoon exploring the old Colonial capital, the charms of its past found in both the architecture and the stories. Quiet and quaint, Entebbe has retained the feel of a century ago. Uganda moved the capital city to nearby Kampala upon independence, and not much has happened in Entebbe since. After the city tour, you relax at the city’s finest hotel along the banks of Lake Victoria with the option of a sunset boat cruise on this most famous of African waters.

In the Masai Mara, you were immersed in the grasslands. Queen Elizabeth National Park is a celebration of diversity, the landscapes blurring into each other as they support a huge variety of life. Fly here from Entebbe, and an initial game drive reveals up to a dozen animals you will not have spotted in Kenya. Then an afternoon boat cruise brings the safari to you.

Setting off on foot, you track these mysterious creatures, spending an hour with a troop that has recently been habituated. Strange faces stare back at you, emotion read into each of their expressions. Fingers and toes curl around branches as the chimps break open seeds and dig with sticks. Sometimes, they hoot, surreal communication that has the troop scurrying and swinging. Other times, they are silently animated, playful, and mischievous as they go about their day. While single scenes are impressive, the experience tracking chimpanzees is made special by following the interaction between the primates. Spend an hour with them, and you will realize just how similar they are to you."

Now the whole troop emerges, a dozen wild mountain gorillas resting in a forest clearing, all turning to greet you. They have been habituated to human presence and are typically bashful creatures, staying clear of conflict despite their power. They are quick to show that, while you are welcome, you are only guests in their land. Two females wave their arms and the silverback bounds past on four knuckles, a hush descending as this majestic giant comes into view. Like the chimpanzees, you don’t know where to look. Two playful blackback males are jumping through the canopy, a mother stares adoringly at her infant in the bushes, and so much can be interpreted in the mouthed expressions amongst the troop. You spend a whole hour with the gorillas, following what can be a challenging trek into the dense and untamed forest. It is always worth the effort, as such inimitability can be found when you are nearly alone with the world’s largest and critically endangered primates. Gorilla trekking is the premier highlight of Uganda, and as you are lounging back at the lodge during the evening, you will know why."

Hippos dominate the shallows where they continually battle for a cool space to bathe. Elephants regularly patrol the banks, and they force antelope to drink elsewhere. Water crashes through rapids, and you will get a sense of the power of Mother Nature. After lunch at the camp, you will spend the afternoon on the river, a safari activity that helps you quickly succumb to the rhythm of the landscape. Every animal must come to drink, and by cruising along the Nile, you will enjoy unforgettable views of a wide variety of species. Travel at a gentle pace while an elephant uses his trunk as a snorkel to swim past, and your boat gives a wide berth to a pod of hippos when they start getting tetchy. Up ahead you will see Murchison Falls. This dramatic cascade of water provides the park with its name, a place to further reflect on the power of nature and the colors that Uganda creates."

Most animals will not be afraid of you, but they aren’t adjusted to the size of a safari vehicle. So on foot, you will get closer, just a few steps from a herd of zebra or a cluster of Ugandan kob. Look up to see the monkeys and across the plains to see an elephant herd, which seems far larger when you are exploring on two feet. Like most activities on this itinerary, you will explore in a small group with two to five other camp guests. This solo traveler’s safari can also be customized to meet specific interests as the camps offer a range of activities each day. A skilled guide will lead the way, and a couple of trackers will help to keep you safe as their knowledge of the bush ensures that you sidestep any dangerous animals. After lunch back at the camp, you can choose from a range of afternoon safari activities, including another Nile cruise, a game drive, or a walking safari focused on the techniques of animal tracking."

First, you will fly to Queen Elizabeth National Park before you head straight for a fragrant journey through the coffee plants. Green vistas seem to extend for eternity, and there’s a real charm to this rural corner of Africa. As you travel down into the park, you will pass the roaming herds, a game drive to camp that’s followed by another new safari experience. Nighttime game drives have only recently been introduced in Queen Elizabeth National Park. After dark, you will see an entirely new animal cast, as nocturnal characters emerge from their hideouts. There’s also drama since the cooler evening hours are perfect for the cats to hunt. You’ll travel slowly, and your vehicle will create a roving spotlight that illuminates the animals. When the driver cuts the engine, you will be guided by sounds, and the experience will help to tune your senses further. Sometimes the light will shine on the spots of a leopard. A herd of buffalo might slowly march past the vehicle, or an elephant may be hooting hello from a distance."

Their fingers have adapted to open peculiar nuts and fruit, while shards of rock are used to cut and forage. Sometimes the primates come down to the forest floor and lean back against a tree trunk, a state of repose similar to the way humans lounge on their couches. It can be a tough walk and today will be the most active of all the days on your safari. The rewards will be spellbinding. When you reach the chimpanzees, you will glimpse at the troop while they stare back, with almost a dozen curious eyes checking you out. Noises from the chimpanzees ripple through the trees, and over your hour with these primates, you will start to make sense of the communication. Their gestures are evocative as they say so much in just a frown or smile. When you spend up to an hour with the troop, you will start to gain an understanding of your closest cousins.

In a single vista, you can see hundreds, potentially thousands of wild mammals since the open plains are ideal for grazers. Today’s game drive will focus on the predators, who make this Ishasha Sector of the park so unique. Tree-climbing lions are the most famous, but where there is food, there is also other life, with hyenas and leopards among the grassland animals that enchant you. During the tour, your driver will stop and point toward a tree. At first, you may not see anything, and more pointing will ensue. Even with the use of binoculars you still may not distinguish the camouflage. Then, something will move, and a tail flicks as you find the lion. The cat stares straight at you, and you realize that it probably has been for a few minutes now with the unambiguous eyes of a hunter that sleeps with a view onto its realm. Once you adjust to the lion’s hiding place, there will be more eyes to find. When the driver takes you around the other side of the tree, there’ll be a whole pride draped across the branches.

There’ll be a hint of apprehension as you get close. The first meeting with a wild mountain gorilla is something you may have imagined a thousand times, but can’t possibly predict. It will be so raw and real to watch the great apes stand to greet you in an inspiring show of power. While the gorillas have been habituated to human presence, they are quick to assert authority. They don’t hide away at first and return your gaze. During the first few moments, most people may be on their cameras, but you should put the camera away at first because these few moments will be an intimate experience.

The troop might be moving, so you must keep walking, following them until they halt and feed. Approach the gorillas slowly, showing respect to their space. One or two will provide a greeting, perhaps a wave of the arms or an imposing stare, an action that’s both a welcome and a warning about respecting their territory. Walk a little farther, and you see the whole troop, over a dozen gorillas bounding in and around the trees. Inquisitive infants, boisterous blackback males, a sublime silverback with thickset arms and an almost impossibly wide chest. Spend an hour from seven meters away, analyzing their many behaviors and expressions. It is widely recommended that you take your photos at the start, and then put the camera down and fully absorb what is probably the world’s most intimate wild animal encounter."

        "description": "Even if your legs are a little tired from yesterday’s trek, you will be eager to return to the gorillas in the mist. Today you will visit a different habituated troop, with its own style and social interactions. Less than 1000 mountain gorillas can be found in the wild, and over these two days you will be seeing around 30 of them; each is absolutely unique. Some juveniles feed close to their mothers, continually looking for affection. Others want to explore, jumping between the branches, playfully throwing nuts at their siblings. They move primarily on four knuckles, but occasionally the gorillas rise onto stout legs, imposing their power. Sometimes they crash from the trees, too heavy for the branches. With each gorilla trek, you get to spend an hour with a troop, in a maximum group size of eight trekkers. You don’t watch them from a distance. There are no fences or ropes. On some occasions, you are fully surrounded by the troop, gorillas on each side of you. Officially you are allowed within seven meters, and it is the gorillas that are most effective in maintaining this distance. If you come too close, they’ll be quick to remind you how powerful they can be. After the hour, you will trek back towards the trailhead, enjoying a packed lunch en route. Then it’s back to Sanctuary Gorilla Forest Camp, where the outdoor bathtub is perfect for reenergizing your muscles."

Fly north from Bwindi, passing over the volcanic peaks en route to the golden savannah of Queen Elizabeth National Park. Touch down, and the atmospheric difference from Bwindi comes from the openness of this habitat. Such vast plains provide seemingly endless visibility, making it relatively easy to find the landscape’s giants. Thousands of Ugandan kob are scattered across your vista, their impressive hooped horns rising above agile, fragile bodies. Nomadic elephants wander onwards, leaving their giant footprints in the dust. Lionesses poke their heads up from the grass and then roll over into a state of repose. After the flight, you will spend the rest of the morning on a game drive. The lions climb trees here, and you will be seeking them out amongst the fig fruit, the beautiful hunters’ frames draped over high branches. From here, they have an expert view over their prey. Leopards can also be seen in the trees and the next two days create an opportunity to see some of the cats hunting. It is around the river where many ambushes take place, so spend the afternoon on a Kazinga Channel boat safari, enjoying wildlife along the banks and cruising through the hippos. It is not long before one yawns, and you are staring into the gaping jaw of a huge male hippo."

Ishasha Wilderness Camp is in the heart of the bush, providing a luxury safari-under-canvas experience that lets you feel the wilds of Africa. This is not camping, but a boutique suite that’s open to all the sounds and smells of the park. Today’s program is flexible, but it is highly recommended that you take advantage of the unique safari activities on offer. Private game drives focus on the more mammals, particularly tree-climbing lions and elephants. Boat safaris are more relaxed and are an easy way to sit back and watch the wildlife unfurl. Walking safaris are legendary, an exclusive chance to wander across the big-game landscape. Guides keep you clear of the predators, but you may come astonishingly close to elephants, giraffe, zebra, and buffalo, along with the varied collection of antelope species."

This is a Central African-style forest, with primates seen mostly in the Congo Basin.

Watch the primate’s face, and it is hard to discount the idea that some form of formal greeting is being made. Walk a little closer, and you make eye contact with more of the troop, although it’s hard to keep track when there are 60 or more chimpanzees in the vicinity. You spend an hour with a habituated troop, immersed in their social interactions and communicative behavior. Their hands and feet are remarkably similar, along with their ingenious use of gestures used to communicate. When they start to shout, the noise is deafening, each call echoing off the trees. It is strange and sublime at the same time, the chimpanzees inviting you into their peculiar forest realm. Sometimes you are treated to a family clique, perhaps 8 – 12 chimps split off from the main troop. On other treks, you might see them all, dozens of primates filling the trees with their antics. Both experiences are wonderfully enchanting, such rare mammals that have so much in common with you."

It was the Colonial capital along the shores of Lake Victoria, mostly ignored since Kampala became capital upon independence. It is now a relaxed place to start an experience in East Africa, easy on the eye and home to an easy-going ambiance. You are greeted at the airport, and it is a short transfer to a five-star hotel on the lakeshore where there is time for lunch on the terrace and a couple of leisurely hours before the afternoon activities. Take a walk along the streets, coated in the ochre and orange hues that distinguish Uganda from its neighboring countries. An expert historical guide gains access to various buildings closed to the public, most of the city constructed in the early 20th century and now standing in a somewhat redolent state of ruin. Wandering back to the water, you embark on a private boat for a cruise on Lake Victoria, passing a handful of lush islets on Africa’s largest body of water. African sunsets are always special, and the one on Lake Victoria is amongst the best, a flaming red ball flanked by vibrant lines of rainbow colors. As the waters reflect these hues, you get a sense for how Ugandan and African landscapes contain a vitality that is difficult to rival on another continent. Dinner at your hotel is included, and the lakeshore is just a few steps away."

And not long after touching down, you are setting off into the foothills of these volcanic mountains, following a trekking route that winds through the dense and mysterious forest. Monkeys watch you pass, looking down from the trees with mischievous faces. The birdlife is outstanding, colorful and rare wings fluttering around the trail. You may even encounter forest elephants, and you will almost certainly get a glimpse of an antelope herd, probably the ubiquitous Ugandan kob. Various trails are possible, ranging from two to six hours, depending on your energy and adventure levels. All of the routes take you through the national park forests, up towards the strange crater lakes, volcanic holes that make it feel like you are on the top of Africa. An invite into a local village can be arranged, a laid-back opportunity to spend time with the people and explore their traditions. This is wild Africa, and you sense the remoteness, nothing artificial breaking the panorama even when you are in a village. The trails and tracks are a scorched red, the forests envelop and overhang, the crater lakes are on the edge of nowhere, and there is an encompassing silence that hangs in the air. Spend the night deep in the national park at a luxury lodge that is regularly visited by monkey troops."

Their fingers resemble your own, curling around branches and sticks with dexterity. Mouths are very similar, able to convey meaning without making a sound. Eyes are thoughtful and contemplative, emanating emotion that can be read in a single glance. But the chimpanzees’ feet are a little different, more nimble and suited to life in the trees. Kibale has long been regarded as the premier place in Uganda, probably in the whole of Africa, to get acquainted with wild chimpanzees. More than 500 live here, a huge population given their dwindling numbers elsewhere. You trek to a troop that has been habituated by researchers. They are accustomed to human presence, and by staying quiet. you can stand amid their intimacies and intricacies. At first, you are photographing and admiring the size of the troop. Then your heartbeat slows a little, and the experience is all about enjoying the interactions of the troop.

As the canopy opens, the savannah starts to expand, populated by large herds of Ugandan kob. Zebras become more abundant, their black and white stripes a regular charm as the drive continues. Topis skip past, along with duiker and other small antelope. The morning involves both a transfer and a game drive rolled into one, taking you into the heart of the savannah and a luxury camp along the banks of the Kazinga Channel. Even as you have lunch, you cannot escape the animals, a whole host of mammals scattered across the plains on either side of the water. Into the afternoon, and you enjoy the easiest of safari activities. Sit back in the boat and cruise along the channel, a slow and elegant journey that brings the animals to you. Everything must come to drink, and along the banks, you see the tentative sipping of the small mammals, plus the trunk-snorkeling antics of elephant herds. The hippos are everywhere, a constant on this boat safari. Grunting and groaning, these giants may be loveable, but they are hugely powerful, quick to give you a fierce stare if the boat gets too close."

Large herds of bushbuck suddenly surround the vehicle, strange white markings on their legs and beautiful horns pointing skywards. Not far away, you see the hyena, another animal that returns your gaze with a spooky intentness. You spend the whole of today on the savannah, discovering a subtle variety of ecosystems that exist in the west of Uganda. While the chimpanzee and gorilla experiences are about the interactions amongst a species, this game drive explores the interactions between different species. Follow the lions as they trail Ugandan kob, beautiful and graceful as they roam through the grass. Surround yourself with the drama of an old kill, hyenas battling amongst each other as mongoose seek to steal scraps and vultures circle overhead. The early-morning and late-afternoon hours are the best times to spot the cats on the move, including rare leopards. During the heat of the day, you make a stop for a picnic lunch, with a view over the abundance of the savannah.

But they were on the move, and you have been tracking them, waiting for them to stop. The troop is habituated and the silverback is making a greeting, one that shows how wild these animals are. They are certainly not for touching, but you are allowed to share this precious space with them. An infant gorilla grabs your attention, learning to climb with eyes that convey fear and miscalculation, as well as the joy of discovery. Suddenly there is a loud crack, and you find a junior male that has fallen out of the trees. His eyes and face show a little embarrassment and confusion, wondering just how he ended up on the ground. You admire tenderness in mothers, the conflict between two of the gorillas, and togetherness between the others. Spending an hour with a troop will obviously provide inspiring photos of different gorillas. But like all the experiences on this one-week Uganda adventure, you remember the intricacies and interactions. There is also a form of silent communication between you and them, something passing between you in the respectful nod or glance of recognition.

Perhaps it will be the subtle change in smell or the unexplainable shift in the atmosphere. Take a few more steps, and you will hear their calls. Keep walking, and you will stop before one chimpanzee, an old female foraging peacefully in the canopy. Creep a little closer, and more of the troop will come into view with a dozen chimps scattered across the trees. This troop has been habituated, and they are used to this daily hour of human contact. For the first few minutes, the chimpanzees will inspect you with curiosity as if wondering aloud at their visitors. They will soon settle back into their regular daily life with hands that grasp sharpened branches and use them as tools. Peculiar expressions will showcase their delight, confusion, amazement and annoyance. Communication is done with the whole body, from their open, expressive mouths to waving arms.

There are only a few places in Africa to see tree-climbing lions, and there is a real enchantment to the scene. In the safari vehicle, you can approach an elephant herd and admire the curled tusks of a large bull and the cheerful demeanor of the younger pachyderms.

The canopy will envelop you completely with rare and exotic flora found on every side. Vehicles have never penetrated this forest, and the going can be challenging with steep ascents and tangled trails. Gorilla trekking groups are assigned on fitness levels, so you can request a shorter or longer hike dependent on your preferences. For many, the chance to travel in such exotic forest makes a longer hike worthwhile, with some troops four hours away from the trailhead. Others will prefer to meet the gorilla troop closest to the trailhead. Trackers radio the troop’s position, and the excitement will build as you close in, the last part of the trek hacking through the thickest part of the jungle. Two gorillas will likely greet you, standing upright for an immediate show of power that will command your respect. Three juveniles are usually close by, foraging with enthusiasm, their black eyes radiant in the shade. Soon the whole troop will come into view, the females scattered across a wide area, the youngsters and males feasting from two trees. Without warning, the silverback might stir, beating a rolling rhythm on his chest before wandering onwards on four knuckles. The troop follows slowly and so do you, savoring the rest of your hour with these wild gorillas. You are allowed within seven meters of the gorillas, and this is more than close enough as there are incredible feelings of intimacy felt from even 30 or 40 meters away. You are allowed an hour with the troop, and the guides are usually very generous when it comes to timing."

        "title": "Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park – An Hour With a Different Gorilla Troop",
        "description": "Set off from the same trailhead this morning, but walk towards a different habituated gorilla troop. Every family troop is unique, from the number and makeup of individuals to their behavior and social structure. Today’s troop has an aging silverback, a slow, languid fellow who tears down branches with bare hands, yet there are three blackback males, imposing figures starting to reach the age of maturity. They are not as big nor as strong, but they are much louder and boisterously jumping on two legs and staring with a degree of menace. Two clusters of females suggest a potential split in the troop, three feeding on one side of the clearing, another two with infants on the other. Meeting a gorilla troop is so much more than getting incredible photos as you are witnessing a family unit in all its glory, from the confrontations to the charms. An infant climbs into the trees above your head, snapping branches and throwing them towards his brother. Two females might retreat into the undergrowth, seeking solace, while yet another bounds around ebulliently, searching for new bark to gnaw. With a second gorilla trek, you witness completely new behavior, and you will also have time to really relax and savor the experience knowing that you already have plenty of great photos with the gorillas. The hour moves much slower and you can really hone in on the details as a juvenile who seems to communicate with you passes by, or as you gaze at the silverback who appears cast in melancholy. Return to the lodge after a picnic on the trail, where a final night of fine dining ushers in your last evening amongst the mist."

There is an opportunity to stop at local villages en route. The villages have retained a tradition that stretches back for centuries. While Bwindi is Uganda’s most famous destination, this western side of Uganda continues to be a rural backwater, where the locals are keen to share stories as you stop along the way.

These are the primates that helped to give the country fame and to place it number one in Lonely Planet’s list of destinations for 2012. They were visited by eight trekkers a day for a few years before authorities sought to habituate other gorilla troops. This has increased capacity and maintained an authenticity, as the same gorillas are not visited every day. Today, you go gorilla trekking in Bwindi, making a journey through thick forests to spend an hour with one of the troops. So much of the iconic behavior can be observed in an hour. A silverback is all brawn, muscle, and fearsome stares. Old females give a look of melancholy and juveniles display a playful demeanor, often getting impishly closer to you. A blackback is marching around on four knuckles, and there is usually some antics in the trees as the gorillas are not always the best climbers. From just seven meters away, there is a chance to get to know this troop, so much going on in all directions. It is the classic Ugandan experience. For over a decade, it has been the premier reason to visit the country, and it never disappoints."

        "description": "Now there are new encounters with wild mountain gorillas. Bwindi has recently piloted a gorilla habituation experience where you can become part of the process, fulfilling the role of gorilla researcher. It is the first time that non-researchers have had the opportunity to spend more than an hour with a troop. You stay for up to four hours, observing and analyzing the behavior. Finding a comfortable position, you sit silently, partially hidden by the foliage so as to not impact the gorillas. Group-size is capped at four, rather than eight that is usual for gorilla trekking. These are the gorillas that are not yet known to the world, the troops that are slowly getting accustomed to human presence, a process that takes at least three years. The intimacy and exclusivity of the experience is reflected in the permit price, which is more than double that of gorilla trekking. It is the first time in Uganda or Rwanda that non-researchers have been afforded such time with wild mountain gorillas. The gorillas you visit are partially habituated, which does add a strong element of surprise. They may not behave completely naturally, and some of the troop could decide to hide. This unpredictability is to be expected and makes this habituation a good complement to classic gorilla trekking. Typically, you get comfy and admire, an exclusive experience for those who want to be fully immersed in the social structures of a troop, rather than simply take photos and witness the trademark behavior."

The forest is sparser, and the primates must come down from the trees regularly, spending a large proportion of their time in the clearings. And when they walk on two feet, the comparisons with humans are almost complete. This rare behavior is the highlight of chimpanzee trekking in Semuliki, complemented by the classic behaviors so unmissable on any chimpanzee trek, Peculiar expressions, curled fingers and toes, emotive eyes, and evocative gestures and communication highlight the thrill of the chimpanzees starting straight back at you."

An elephant hoots, huge horns protruding as he continues his long walk to the water. Across the savannah, there is an echo, the haunting crack of two buffalo males clashing heads in a battle for survival, the harem watching on intently from 20 meters away. At the water, you can smell the change in atmosphere, the joyous slurping replaced by fear and tension when a cackle of hyenas approaches. Bumping across the savannah, you follow the sounds until the sights take over, such intensity to every encounter in Kidepo Valley National Park. Raw and redolent, Kidepo Valley is one of Africa’s most untouched savannahs. It is vast, bordering South Sudan, with the ecosystem continuing into a reserve on the northern side of the international border. Only around 5,000 annual visitors make it out here, so it is rare that you see another person or vehicle on the game drives. Drama is heightened, and the ferocity of the wildlife makes Kidepo Valley a very different experience than East Africa’s most celebrated parks and reserves. You are surrounded by the battle for survival, and the animals often react aggressively, ears flapping and feet stamping as they assert their authority in a harsh land that only supports the fittest. Fly here on a chartered flight, a fantastic alternative to a two-day drive. Spend three days at a luxurious lodge in the heart of the savannah, a semblance of contemporary comfort amid this rustic wilderness. The program is relaxed, and the park offers an unrivaled level of adventure, Full-day drives visit corners that see few human eyes, and you take a picnic to watch the battles between herds. Morning drives immerse you in the movement of the predators, while afternoon drives follow those on their journey to the water, hyenas usually very close behind. Then back at the lodge, you keep experiencing with all the senses, so much going on in all directions."

Batwa pygmies have inhabited the Congo Basin trees for centuries, a tribe of hunter-gatherers that have never had a need for money. For centuries, they traded and only took what they needed from the forest they inhabited. You meet a whole community, sharing stories with people who have a culture so different from your own. Learn the basics of tracking and hunting in the forest, discover survival skills, find out about what and how they traded, and explore the customs that have been passed down from the ancestors. While there are opportunities for photos, the experience is centered around connections with the tribe, rather than taking snapshots for home.

Up ahead, you see one of the gorillas, and it starts coming toward you. Arms waving and eyes staring, an adult female comes to say hello. It is a powerful first impression, one that shows that you are welcomed, but indicates that you are merely a visitor. The guide pushes you closer. It is not good to back away from gorillas, and you start counting the rest of the troop. You count 11, then 12 and then, wait, there are another two behind that tree. Suddenly a cracked branch comes down, and you see three more in the trees above you. Then a giant silverback barrels out on his knuckles, He has a look around, then keeps going.

Fingers and toes curl around the branches, eyes seem to speak through silence, and mouths have an expression that is impossible to replicate. Chimpanzees live in large troops, sometimes 70 or more in a single troop. But like most extended primate families, they regularly separate, splintering into smaller family troops. It is impossible to predict how many chimps you will see on this habituation experience. With the entire troop, there are obviously more animals to admire and observe, but when there are less, their heightened sense of curiosity adds another dimension to the experience. Like the gorillas, you go on an inspiring trek through the untouched forest, a tracker radioing in the location of the troop. Then, you have an hour, watching but also listening and smelling and delighting in the movements of the chimpanzees. They occupy the trees above you, but some come down to the forest floor, standing upright to create an image that is almost impossibly human.

        "description": "Fly to the Masai Mara, and when you touch down all you see is grass. But look closer. Elephants are marauding across the grass, Thomson’s gazelles are blurring into the landscape, and a hyena is poking its head up from its hiding place. Sometimes it seems that all the angles are the same, such is the enormity and conformity of the ecosystem. However, no two moments are ever the same in the Masai Mara. Spend the day on game drives in the Mara North, a private safari playground that borders the Masai Mara National Reserve yet restricts visitor access. A pride of lions basks on rocky outcroppings, herds of buffalo surround your vehicle, and you quickly learn that the idea of the Big Five is far too simple for a Mara safari. You are surrounded, engulfed by the atmosphere and rhythm of this world-famous ecosystem. The only thing that is missing is other tourists, this private conservancy enabling you to explore a personal piece of the Mara."

        "description": "Big cats prowl beneath the cloak of dawn. You spot a leopard descending into the grass with the solemnity of the hunter. Hyenas aren’t hiding, they are on the move, running towards the waterholes in search of breakfast. Lionesses look tired, perhaps after spending a whole night hunting. But they are hungry, and they swap stealth for displays of raw power. On a private game drive, you watch the hunts unfold, from the long, drawn-out attempt to get closer, to the thrilling few seconds of a chase and a kill. The action is far from over. Jaws crunch into carcasses and scavengers arrive while the meat is fresh before a large male lion roars for them to leave. Vultures circle and you see the hunt from another angle, mournful looks are shown in the faces of the rest of the herd. The Masai Mara and Serengeti are two of Africa’s greatest places to see the big cats on a hunt. However, unlike the main national reserves, the Mara North Conservancy allows you to drive off the trail. This means you can get much closer to the hunt; close enough to hear the lions eating and the scavengers quarreling. Spend this day on private game drives in the conservancy, following these thrilling battles between predators and prey."

A hot air balloon safari is an entirely different perspective, an impression onto the scale of the grasslands and the migratory movements of the herds. You will see different colors, indicating which areas have and have not been grazed, along with nomadic elephant and buffalo herds on their own long journeys. Touch down, and spend the day in the Masai Mara National Reserve, game driving along the Mara River, watching the crocodiles that wait on the banks. As this Mara safari continues, you also find new animals, like roan antelopes, topi, and elands.

It is even more open here, even more expressive, the landscapes completely uninterrupted for hundreds of miles.

Spend the day on a game drive on this side of the river, following hyenas on the move, buffalo herds starting a fight, and cheetahs nurturing their cubs in the grass. Trees rise randomly, silent sentinels of the landscape, and great places to find leopards. Deep within this ecosystem, miles from other people or camps, you spend the night at a mobile camp that is surrounded by the herds.

        "description": "For nine months of the year, the great wildebeest migration is in the Serengeti. These two days will track the herds, following the largest population of wild mammals anywhere on the planet. Wildebeest are scattered loosely, mile after mile of animals on their journey. Males with wispy beards gallop, their enthusiasm aimed at impressing the females. Young calves struggle to keep pace, watched over by lion prides that lounge on the kopjes , rocky outcrops. Zebras move in tighter formation, a thick line of black and white, upwards of 50,000 huddled closely together. Every year, this phenomenon plays out, and the abundance is breathtaking, an impossible number of animals surrounding the vehicle. There is no wrong time to see the great wildebeest migration. The animals are always there, but they occupy different parts of the park dependent on the time of year, and more accurately, dependent on the rains. These two days will take you to the herds, likely to be in the southeast areas from January to March, the central and western areas in April and May, the northern plains in June and July, and then a private concession to the east from October through December. Most of the migration is in the Masai Mara in August and September. It is an immersive experience, and there’s no end to the encounters with predators. Lions and leopards don’t follow, but feast when the migration reaches their territory. Hyenas are on the move, hunting as well as scavenging. You wake up to wildebeest and zebra and spend the day tracking the intricacies of the migration. Then fall asleep as these same two species are illuminated by the moon."

Thousands of Ugandan kob dominate the savannah, while lions blur hypnotically into the color of the grass.

Murchison Falls is relatively unique in combining big-game and primate safari highlights in one park. Antelopes are seen at the start of your journey, but as the canopy closes in, it is mostly vervet monkeys and baboons, along with an exotic assortment of birdlife. Your focus is a habituated chimpanzee troop, the members of which swing effortlessly through the trees, and scamper across small forest clearings. Their eyes meet yours, and their faces reveal emotion, from joy to sorrow, excitement to mischief. It does not take long to notice the genetic similarities. But an hour with a chimpanzee troop also introduces you to the contrasts, showing how these creatures are as unique as any on the planet. Return to the lodge for lunch, then rest your legs in the afternoon, taking a boat along the River Nile towards Murchison Falls. Hippos fill the water, and you admire their quarrels and their enormous jaws. The famous river narrows to just seven meters across, cascading some 40 meters down into the water below. You view these falls from below, then take a shorting walking trail to viewpoints above the spectacle. Return to the lodge, and the safari continues, so many animals seen from water level, including predators lurking in the high reeds."

There are 15 in total, including an infant that shows some baffling facial features as it jumps enthusiastically between the trees. The silverback keeps his distance, feasting in the green, arms powerfully pulling at the fruit. Some gorillas are more inquisitive, getting closer than the seven-meter allowed distance, knowing nothing about the rule on proximity. Others, like two older females, disappear into the forest, away from your camera. You get a whole hour with this troop, exploring how it works, admiring all the different individuals. It is an experience unlike any other on safari, this chance to be amongst the giants; less than 1,000 wild mountain gorillas remain in the world, and you are spending an hour with a whole troop of them."

Everything must come to drink at some point, so a boat safari is a great way to start the exploration. Giraffes stand wide-legged as they take a drink, while herds of Ugandan kob approach the water timidly, fearful of lions lurking in the reeds. You will see it all without having to move.

Like the other two accommodation choices on this safari, your hotel is one of the finest in East Africa, blending contemporary Western service with a spellbinding location amid nature."

        "description": "Fresh hues mingle beneath the wingtips on the flight to Bwindi, the red of the dirt juxtaposed with the emerald of the forest. Touch down and transfer to Uganda’s most iconic lodge, a majestic place to stay on a ridge above the canopy. Uninterrupted views come from your cottage windows, across the Virunga Mountains to a volcano that often shimmers beneath the moon. All meals are included, the lodge has some of the best food in Africa, decadent fare that combines the bounty of the forest with a strong international influence. After lunch, you get your first taste of Bwindi’s magic. The trails have been cleared by gorillas and forest elephants, twisting distinctive routes through the tangled trees. One winding road leads to Munyaga Waterfall, every meter framed by the exoticism of the vegetation. A cacophony of tweets adds to the sound of cascading water, more than 350 bird species enjoy shelter here. A suave francolin flutters past, African sooty flycatchers cluster around the bamboo, short-tailed warblers and blue-headed sunbirds are among those in the canopy. Today’s three-hour hike is at a relaxed pace and is also a great introduction to the conditions for tomorrow’s gorilla trekking."

        "title": "Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park – Gorilla Trekking",
        "description": "It does not matter how many times you have dreamt it, the first encounter with a gorilla is impossible to fully preconceive. You have an idea about how they will look, perhaps even what they will be doing, but it is hard to imagine the setting. You are standing in a thick, untouched forest with a small path to the gorillas cleared by the guides’ machetes. There are no artificial sounds for many miles. You can smell the great apes. Or is it your own excitement and fear that can be inhaled? Walk a little closer. There she is, a gorilla bounding around on two legs, waving her arms in an indisputable show of power. With the arm waving and ferocious stare, it is easy to take a few steps backward. The guides grab you and push you onwards, goosebumps fill your arm as the tension rises. Most of the troop is now on view, and most of them have eyes fixated in your direction. The silverback emerges, double the size of the rest, muscles rippling beneath thick black and silver hair. There are no barriers and no fences. The gorillas are communicating directly with you, ensuring you realize that this is their realm and you are just a visitor. For a first impression, few experiences in the world can rival the sense of intimacy and exclusivity. While you will spend four hours with a troop tomorrow, starting with a gorilla trek is widely recommended. They are complementary rather than competing experiences. With the trek you are impossibly close – officially the distance is seven meters, but the gorillas do not follow human rules and may get closer to you. There is a lot to take in, and you slowly focus on the individuals, distinguishing between male and female, following the gestures that link the family together. Proximity helps you snap the postcard photographs, and the habituated troop can display a vast range of behavior over the hour. Returning to the trailhead, you will realize why this is one of the great wildlife experiences: it’s not just the gorillas and their habitat; it is this silent communication that exists at all times."

        "title": "Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park – Full-Day Gorilla Habituation Experience",
        "description": "A new morning and you set off towards another troop, the tracker radioing a location for your guide to follow. When gorilla trekking, the group is capped at eight trekkers (the actual figure is usually less). Only four people can set off on each day’s gorilla habituation, joined by scientists and researchers who have been leading the process. Habituated gorillas are adjusted to human contact, allowing you to get relatively close to them without interrupting their behavior. A partially habituated gorilla troop is more unpredictable. These are bashful creatures that value privacy, and it takes many years for them to accept human presence. You will not get as close as yesterday. Perhaps the gorillas initially bound off to a hiding place, maybe they park themselves amid the thickest vegetation, or guard their infant fervently. What you do have now is time. Allow the gorillas to settle. Find your own hideout and wait. As the initial shock subsides, the gorillas emerge. You stay tucked into the forest, silently watching the troop. Gradually you blend into the forest, and the gorillas are no longer worried about your presence. You recognize individuals and notice distinguishing features, a part of the research process. Gestures are shared as you watch in awe, interpreting the communication. Over four hours you become invisible. From the hideout, you enjoy a complete insight into gorilla behavior, one that is normally only reserved for qualified researchers. An infant is nurtured lovingly but escapes her mother’s clutches to playfully climb through the trees. Two blackback males avoid each other at first but start feeding together in a show of affection. The silverback remains silent yet powerful, an imposing figure that leads the troop on its day. Distant sounds create tiny changes; an ear-pricking up, eyes scanning for danger, a frown or grin crossing each face. With four hours you do not just admire an entire troop of gorillas in their natural habitat, but come closer to understanding the world of the greatest apes on earth."

        "description": "Walk a different route through the forest, and an equally endangered group of primates can be found. Their culture and behavior are just as rare, and just as old. They are the Batwa pygmies, gatekeepers of the forest and proud preservers of the land. For many centuries the Batwa have forged a symbiotic relationship with the landscape. It is a relationship that is under threat, a lifestyle getting lost to the modern day. Walking to the tribe’s settlement takes around two hours and you are welcomed in the traditional manner. Then you settle into their way of life, learning about every day in the forest. Wander beneath the canopy and learn the use of the distinctive flora, with a medicine man showing the benefits of different plants. Join the women in cooking a meal over the stove then discover the hunting techniques practiced for centuries. Ancient legends are told, and traditional songs are sung. Discussions vary, from food gathering to religion and the Batwa’s survival in the 21st century. This is a rare chance to feel and understand a part of Africa that is mostly confined to stereotypes."

        "description": "After four days spent in Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, your legs may be tired. There have been long but rewarding hikes, another great highlight of Bwindi is that it’s inaccessible to vehicles. After a 25-minute flight north to Queen Elizabeth National Park, you sit back and wait for the animals to come to you. You will spend the afternoon on a river safari, cruising along the Kazinga Channel as hippos look on. Some yawn, enormous jaws revealed for a couple of seconds. Others stare and grunt. One waddles out of the water, and you see just how big these animals can be. This is Uganda’s premier big-game park, and there are many other giants. Elephants dot the banks, especially as it gets closer to sunset. Ugandan kob cluster in large numbers, fearful of the lions that lurk nearby. A herd of buffalo tumbles into the channel. All you have to do is sit back in the boat and watch the show, every mile of river home to another collection of animals. The experience does not stop when you are back at the lodge as many of the giants can be spotted from your private terrace. After four days of adventure in Bwindi, there is also a calmness that helps you reflect on the previous day’s experiences."

        "title": "Entebbe – More Big-Game Safari and Back to Entebbe",
        "description": "In your final morning in Uganda, you wake to a racket down by the water. Two male hippos are arguing, vociferously voicing their points with grunts and clashes of heads. This is not unusual in the wild, nor is the sight of a lone elephant with massive tusks coming for a sunrise drink. You have the full morning on safari, and a game drive takes you onto the savannah, tracing the giants while searching for the iconic big cats. Lions climb trees here and the cool morning hours are a great time to see them on the move. Buffalo block the trail and the differences between antelope species are more apparent when there are so many of them. Return to the lodge for lunch and a chance to freshen up before a mid-afternoon flight back to Entebbe, where the lakefront hotel provides a peaceful place to reflect on the last seven days."
