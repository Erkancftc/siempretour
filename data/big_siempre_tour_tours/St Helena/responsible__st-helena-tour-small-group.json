  "generalInfo": "For those travellers who enjoy getting off the beaten track, the British overseas territory of Saint Helena – one of the remotest places on earth and now reached via a weekly flight from South Africa, is a must visit destination.<br/><br/>The tropical island of Saint Helena, secluded in the Atlantic Ocean, offers a pristine paradise steeped in history. Despite its remote location, recent accessibility has opened it to tourism. Visitors can trace the paths of famous figures like Darwin and Napoleon, explore its rugged terrain and diverse wildlife, including rare bird species and the famed Jonathan, a 190-year-old giant tortoise. Saint Helena's rich history, from Boer prisoners to Napoleon's exile, adds depth to its allure. During our week on the island, we will uncover Saint Helena’s extraordinary sights and natural wonders, and we will experience the genuine hospitality of the local people as we embark on a journey filled with intrigue and wonder.",

      "description": "Johannesburg to Saint Helena - Check-in at Johannesburg’s O.R. Tambo International Airport for our Airlink flight to Saint Helena, which enroute includes a refuelling stop in Walvis Bay, Namibia. Including the stop the flight will take about 6.5hrs and we will land at Saint Helena’s airport which opened in 2017 at around 1.30pm local time. We will be met on arrival and transferred the 10 miles from the airport located on the eastern side of the island to our hotel in Jamestown on the northern and leeward side of the island. Check-in at our centrally located hotel and our home for the next 7 nights. This afternoon, if time allows, we will meet our local guide and enjoy a walk through the island’s capital, Jamestown and discover the stories that this historically rich Georgian styled town has to offer. Visit the Castle with its tropical gardens, St James Church (the oldest Anglican Church in the Southern Hemisphere), the famous Jacob’s ladder which ascends 699 steps above the town and the Court House.

      "description": "Saint Helena – Island Tour - After breakfast we will be collected for a full day tour including a packed lunch. Discover the island by 4x4 vehicle or depending on group size, by minibus. Stop at Deadwood Plain which was the campsite of Boer prisoners of war during the Anglo Boer War of 1900-1902, then to Flagg Staff which gives us wonderful panoramic views across the island. Later we visit Levelwood, home to the Bell Stone – a rock which when struck rings like a bell. We wind our way to the southwest point of the island for incredible views over the Atlantic Ocean, which stretches unbroken for 2,700 kilometers in every direction. Learn about and see the island’s natural and historical attractions along the way. Overnight Mantis St Helena. (BL)"

      "description": "Saint Helena – Plantation House - This morning a private tour of the Governor’s residence, Plantation House, awaits. Built in 1792, it has been the home to the island’s governors. Perhaps an even more famous inhabitant though is Jonathan, a giant tortoise who approaching 200 years old, lives in the grounds and is said to be the world’s oldest living land animal. After a packed lunch we visit St Paul’s Cathedral, High Knoll Fort, and the Boer War cemetery before returning to the hotel. Overnight Mantis St Helena. (BL)"

      "description": "Saint Helena – Free Day - Today is at leisure to explore at your own pace. Highly recommended is the very well curated Museum of Saint Helena which not only traces the varied history of the island, but also has artefacts from the number of wrecks that dot the coastline over the last 500 years. You may also like to book another optional boat cruise, or swim in the Atlantic – or in the large public swimming pool that sits near the harbour and is a great place to meet local islanders.
