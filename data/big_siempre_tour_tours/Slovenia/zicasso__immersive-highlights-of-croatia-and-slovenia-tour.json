The area around the present city of Ljubljana has been populated since the Bronze Age, when the earliest known settlement consisted of wooden houses on stakes. In 1335, Ljubljana came under Austrian Habsburg rule, which lasted until 1918. Touches of the opulent design from the Habsburg rule remain in the guise of the Ljubljana Castle, which crowns the eastern hill at 1,230 feet above sea level. A wrought-iron staircase winds to the top of the watchtower, offering marvelous views across Old Town and the soothing water of the river."
