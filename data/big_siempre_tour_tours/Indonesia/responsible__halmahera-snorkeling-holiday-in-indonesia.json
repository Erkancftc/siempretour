  "generalInfo": "Be some of the first to experience the remote reefs of Halmahera in northern Indonesia. On this snorkeling tour we will spend our time gliding over the vibrant shallow coral reefs of this secluded corner of Indonesia while we indulge in all the amenities and comforts of our boutique tropical island resort.<br/><br/>Halmahera is the large odd-shaped island just west of the Raja Ampat area. The area we’ll be exploring is in the south around a small island called Kusu Island. This area is fantastic for snorkeling, offering us unlimited access to a truly amazing house reef and of course all the other nearby reefs which are only 5-20 minutes by boat. Halmahera is relatively new on the snorkeling scene as the area just didn’t have the infrastructure to support tourism really at any level. Now, with several small airports and this one brand-new resort, we can indulge in the endless reefs, clouds of colorful reef fish, the lush tropical environment, and delicious food day after day.",

      "description": "Each day begins with coffee, tea, or juice as well as a breakfast cookie being delivered to your front porch, followed by a delicious breakfast in the main restaurant before our first snorkel session of the day. Each snorkel session will run for 60 – 75 minutes. With the exception of the house reef, all the snorkel sites are accessed by the resort’s quick and comfortable speedboats. Snorkel sites are close, with the furthest sites being a maximum of 30 minutes away. Nearly all the sites though are 5-10 minutes from the resort. All the snorkel sessions have surface boat support, allowing you to jump in the boat whenever you feel like it. There will be local guides and your tour leader in the water on all snorkels, pointing out interesting things to see and assisting with whatever you may need. They will also enter the water to do a current check and decide if our plan should be altered slightly or if we will snorkel in that spot. If there is current, we will always drift with it. The snorkel boats can always pick us up down current at the end of the snorkel. After our snorkel, we return to the resort for a delicious lunch. After a little post-lunch siesta we’ll prepare for the second snorkel session of the day, followed by more snacks! You will not go hungry on this safari. For those who are keen, we can also organize a sunset or night snorkel on the house reef or one of the other nearby reefs. We will offer 2 guided boat snorkel sessions a day. You are not obliged to participate in them all. Throughout our time at Kusu Island Resort the house reef is open for snorkeling any time you choose. Dinner is a 3-course meal. Evenings are spent looking through fish ID books, reviewing the day’s photos and sightings, chatting in the spacious lounge, or enjoying the night sky from your giant porch."
