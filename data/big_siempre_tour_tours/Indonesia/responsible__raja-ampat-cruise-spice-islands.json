A beautiful group of 10 lushly vegetated volcanic islands, Banda has attracted merchants and traders for over 2,000 years owing to its highly sought-after goods such as cloves, textiles, batik and rice. Yet its not only its goods that have attracted visitors here over the years. Its tropical flora, enchanting underwater lava flow reefs and beautiful landscapes are equally impressive. As we approach Banda Neira, the archipelago’s administrative capital, on the morning of day 4, make sure to be on deck to savour the view of the outline of Gunung Api volcano with its thin plume of smoke often rising from the summit, and watch the Moluccan paddlers propelling kora kora canoes with their elaborately carved figureheads. Your first morning here can be spent exploring ashore enjoying local tea and snacks on the waterfront. Or you may wish to take a snorkel or dive over the fascinating lava flow reef system. In the afternoon, we can explore the famous and extremely well-preserved Fort Belgica whilst gaining an interesting insight into the area’s Dutch colonisation and joining the locals for a traditional dance and music performance. The day will conclude with a refreshing glass of sparkling wine as we watch the sun setting over the fort.
