  "generalInfo": "This wildlife watching holiday across Indonesia’s Tanjung Puting National Park and Komodo National Park is absolutely thrilling, packed with memorable animal encounters and immersing you in the natural world. Join a fully escorted small group as you travel from Kalimantan to Komodo via Bali, to see orangutans, Komodo dragons, bats, manta rays and more. <br/><br/>Indonesian Kalimantan is the larger, wilder portion of Borneo. Its forests have been depleted by logging and palm oil plantations, putting wildlife such as orangutans and probiscis monkeys at risk of extinction. Our holiday makes a financial donation to an organisation fighting deforestation and poaching, and you’ll be able to spend a day volunteering at a reforestation project. <br/><br/>Spend two nights in Tanjung Puting on a traditional riverboat known as a klotok. The amenities are basic but comfortable, and if you choose you can sleep on deck surrounded by the sounds of the rainforest. You’ll enjoy multiple opportunities to see wild orangutans as they swing down from the trees to their feeding stations – and just your presence here as tourists proves to authorities that there is value in protecting this endangered habitat.<br/><br/>Next, fly via Bali to Labuan Bajo where you’ll board a private boat to spend a few days touring the legendary Komodo National Park. Walk with a park ranger to learn about the giant lizards that call this place home. You’ll also share a meal with a local family here, finding out about how they manage life in close proximity to these fearsome creatures. Other absorbing experiences during this portion of your trip include the chance to snorkel with manta rays, and watch as thousands of bats swoop into the evening sky to feed. If you’re a wildlife lover, Indonesia will captivate you.<br/>",
