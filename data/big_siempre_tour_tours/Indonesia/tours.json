The walk ends in central Ubud, where you'll have time to explore the many cafes, galleries and shops on your own. In the evening, sit down and enjoy a traditional Kecak dance performance. Driven not by musical instruments, but by human chanting, this fascinating theatrical performance is considered a highlight by many of our travellers."

You’ll also stop to check out some small, intricately carved temples, before concluding your bike tour back in Ubud. After refuelling with lunch, head for the hills to the village of Undisan.

You’ll tuck into Tipat Blayag (Rhombus) for lunch (rice wrapped in young coconut leaves), combined with side dishes of chicken and vegetables. After exploring the village, you’ll continue by car for a journey higher into the mountains, driving along the crater rim road to a fishing village on the edge of Lake Batur. Volcanic Mt Batur (1717 m) sits inside a stark and spectacular caldera and with Lake Batur below, it's a stunning sight. The lake supports the local fishing industry, while many of the villagers work as guides for the volcano climb. Your accommodation for the evening is in a great location to start tomorrow's early morning trek without extra travelling time."

The view of the gorgeous sunrise over the valleys of Bali may well be the most memorable part of your trip. Do keep in mind, however, that the weather can be unpredictable and sometimes the view is obscured by clouds. After descending the volcano, there's an option to soak in hot springs with fantastic views over the lake and caldera. Then make the journey from the mountains to the small coastal town of Lovina, made famous by its dolphins that patrol the coast.

Situated almost exactly halfway along the length of Java, in an area considered to be the heartland of the Javanese, Yogyakarta is home to some of the island's oldest traditions and blessed with rich, fertile soil from volcanic ash. It is the cultural capital of Java, with a real mixture of cultural influences, including Hindu and Buddhist temples, dating from the 8th century, Islamic Palaces from the 18th century and Dutch colonial architecture that harks back to the days when the Netherlands held much of Java in its imperialistic grip. For those arriving on time, our tour leader plans to meet you in the hotel reception at 6pm for the welcome meeting and for those that wish, there is the chance to go out for dinner. There are no other activities planned today, so you're free to arrive in Yogyakarta at any time. If you'd like an airport transfer today, you'll need to arrive into Yogyakarta International Airport, approximately 90 minutes from our hotel. Should you miss the welcome meeting, your tour leader will inform you of any essential information over breakfast on day two. If your flight arrives earlier in the day, perhaps you might choose to take a motorised rickshaw to visit Kraton Palace and Taman Sari Water Castle. A Ramayana ballet performance is also a great way to learn about local traditions and culture. If you'd like to add on extra days in Yogyakarta before our tour starts, contact us to book accommodation."

The many shops, local restaurants and vibrant markets will set the scene for our street food tour.

        "description": ": This morning, we'll head west to Borobudur, the largest and most impressive Buddhist monument in the southern hemisphere. Constructed in the 8th century this incredible monument, a petrified vision of the Buddhist cosmos, was lost for 900 years when Mount Merapi erupted and covered Borobudur in a layer of volcanic ash. The structure itself is immense, a gigantic Buddhist stupa constructed from two million blocks that covers an area of 200 square metres and rises some 34.5 metres/113 feet above the Kedu Plain. Older by nearly half a century than the site at Prambanan, Borobudur is believed to have been built on the top of the foundations for what was originally a temple dedicated to Shiva, abandoned by the Hindu Sanjayas when their Buddhist rivals the Saliendras swept through the Malay peninsula during the 8th century. A combination of earthquakes, subsidence, and the mass migration of the Javanese to the east of the island saw the temple abandoned sometime during the 9th century, to be rediscovered again later by the British. Substantial work has been carried out to salvage the exquisite carvings and designs that adorn the structure, and we can wander through the site today and marvel at the incredible detail of its narrative panels, which detail everything from Buddhist doctrines to the daily life of the Javanese. Later, we'll drive out of the city, heading for the Hindu temple complex of the Prambanan Plain. This remarkable area is home to an incredible array of temples and palaces from the 8th and 9th centuries. We'll stay here to watch the sunset before heading back to the city for our last night in Yogyakarta. Please note that the order in which we'll visit the two sites is subject to change due to seasonality and availability. This will be confirmed on spot by your tour leader."

Depending on the time of the year, we may choose another peak as a viewpoint to avoid the crowds. Regardless of the season, it can get quite cold while we wait for the sun to rise so warm layers are highly reccommended.

Its lack of surf means it's not a popular haunt for surfers either, but instead, it's a perfect secluded spot for swimming and snorkelling. Pemuteran and its villagers have witnessed the effect of over-tourism in other resorts in Bali and are taking active steps to avoid the same pitfalls. They have set up a community-wide initiative which tightly controls any building and development, and they operate a fascinating environmental project they call 'Bio Rocks'. Before being made illegal, vast swathes of the local coral had been destroyed by dynamite fishing, so the coral is now being grown back with the aid of a low-voltage electricity supply, returning at a rate estimated to be five times faster. Today has been left free to explore the village or to relax on the beach and soak up Pemuteran's laid-back atmosphere.

After lunch, we'll continue along the scenic coastal road before turning inland. The road begins to twist and turn through the forest until we reach the small farming community of Munduk. The town enjoys an enviable position sitting higher in altitude than most of the island, and the cooler climes offer some respite from Bali's humidity. Munduk is home to a community of farmers that serve the myriad of surrounding plantations and rice paddies, and we hope to arrive in time for a sundowner as we climb to a viewpoint to watch the day turn to night and the sun dip into the forests below"

Although it is slowly growing in popularity, Flores is still very much off mainstream tourism flows. Its stunning natural beauties and the good-hearted people are just a few of the multiple reasons to visit. The name means Flowers and the mostly Catholic population is its inheritance stemming from Portuguese colonialism which started in the 16th century. As mass tourism has fortunately not reached Flores Island yet, services and facilities are limited especially in remote areas like Bajawa. On arrival, we'll head to a local hot spring to refresh ourselves after our flight. The warm water flows from a river under the shade of coconut trees and it's believed to be beneficial for skin conditions. A bathing costume and a change of clothes in your day pack are recommended for a fully enjoyable experience, however, you can also choose to simply dip your feet and legs in the curative waters. A 30-minute drive will then take us to our final stop for the day - the town of Bajawa. This is the spiritual heartland of the Ngada tribal people, who are made up of five tribal groups living in the surrounding area, each with their own customs, language, beliefs, and traditional dress. Please note that our hotel for the next two nights is a simple property with twin rooms and en-suite facilities.

At the foot of Inerie, we'll meet our local guide for an walk through several small traditional Ngada villages to learn more about these people. Starting in Bena, the largest village, we find megalithic stones along with offering and meeting places in between rows of stilt houses with steep thatched grass roofs. The approximate distance covered is 8 kilometres/5 miles with about 100m/328ft descent and 300m/984feet ascent. We'll walk on a mix of dirt roads, tarmac, narrow paths and some tall steps for approximately four hours. Walking through the villages gives a sense of going back in time. The Ngada retain their animist beliefs after having been essentially forced to convert to Catholicism by Dutch missionaries in the 1920s, hence images of Jesus and Mary feature amidst pig jaws, buffalo horns and tribal art! After lunch, we'll head to visit a local self-made craftsman who over the years has specialised in using bamboo to produce a multitude of objects from carpets to baskets, and necklaces to lampshades. This workshop is a great opportunity to learn about how such projects support the livelihoods of the younger local villagers who may struggle to fit in with the more traditional life. And should you wish to, you could also take a unique souvenir home with you. Later in the afternoon, we'll head back to the hotel for our second and last night in Bajawa."

After lunch, we'll visit a coffee-producing community project run by nuns. Their aim is to empower local women and allow them to have their own source of income. This is also a great opportunity to sample the excellent quality of the coffee in Flores, known for its floral, sweet chocolate and woody flavour. Finally, we'll reach our hotel in Ruteng in the district of Mangarai. This mainly Catholic city, located at an altitude of 1170 metres/3,838 feet above sea level and surrounded by paddy fields, enjoys a cooler climate. We'll stay here for one night before heading to the coast tomorrow. Our overall driving time today is approximately six hours."

The first remains were found in the early 2000s and archaeologists immediately noticed how the frame of fully grown adults was actually much smaller than any other known specimens. This posthumously gained them the nickname of hobbits. As we continue on our journey to Labuan Bajo, we'll stop at the spiderweb rice fields of Cancar and take in the impressive views of these unique paddies. Their design was thought to allow a clear separation of property among local families and to allow for crop rotation. Depending on the time you are visiting the fields change from a bright green right after the rainy season to different shades of gold as the drier season sets in. On arrival, we'll check in to our hotel by the beach to relax and prepare for our boat adventure tomorrow. Our total driving time today is around five hours."

The first remains were found in the early 2000s and archaeologists immediately noticed how the frame of fully grown adults was actually much smaller than any other known specimens. This posthumously gained them the nickname of hobbits. Komodo National Park was listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 1986 and includes the islands of Komodo, Rinca, Gili Mota, Nusa Kode and Padar. Our first stop allows us to meet the Komodo dragons for the first time. We'll disembark on Rinca Island and meet with some of the national park's rangers (one ranger per group of five), who will lead us carefully along a trail into Komodo dragon territory to see if we can spot them. The dragons, known locally as 'ora', are highly dangerous giant lizards reaching up to lengths of over 3.5 metres/11.5 feet and weighing up to 150 kilos, though usually they are around 2.5 metres/8.2 feet in length. Hidden in the undergrowth, the Komodo dragons wait patiently for their prey, such as deer and water buffalo - which we're likely to see in the national park - and when the time is right, they ambush their victim and bite into them releasing a toxic venom from glands within their lower jaw causing a slow death. We walk for around two hours across a relatively flat terrain covering around 3 miles/5 kilometres. Komodo dragons are likely to be seen in greater numbers before and after the mating season which takes place between June and August. We'll stay overnight on our private boat in simple shared accommodation, made up of double and single bunk beds in two mixed-sex cabins. Facilities include two toilets and there is a saltwater shower as well as a limited amount of fresh water for bathing."

        "description": ": This morning, we'll continue our cruise to Padar Island. After a short walk uphill, we'll start making our way to the top walking on wooden stairs first and on wide stone steps towards the end. There are approximately 800 steps to reach the top and walk back down again. Bring plenty of water with you as it can get pretty hot, even in the morning. Finally, enjoy a once-in-a-lifetime view of the iconic panorama! Afterwards, we'll make a short cruise to the beautiful Pink Beach, which takes its name from the pink sand created from red coral. The beach itself is small but very picturesque and sees relatively few visitors. There are pockets of shade under some trees to chill out when not taking a dip in the inviting shallow waters. Not to be missed, however, is the snorkelling on the spectacularly colourful coral reef a short swim from the beach. This diverse marine area also forms part of the UNESCO-listed Komodo National Park and boasts over 1,000 species of fish, 260 species of reef-building coral as well as a significant amount of other marine life. For those without their own snorkelling equipment, this can be hired in advance from Labuan Bajo. Finally, we'll head to Komodo Island where we take another safari walk with national park rangers to hopefully spot more Komodo dragons and learn a little more about these imposing beasts. And last but not least, with a little bit of luck, we'll have the chance to swim with Manta Rays during our stopover at Manta Point. Later in the afternoon, we'll cruise back to Labuan Bajo for the night before our return to Bali. As a way of celebrating the time we spent out at sea, we'll have a fish dinner at SO Bajo Night Market (included). The market features a long row of stalls selling the catch of the day and cooking it for you - it doesn't get more local or fresher than this! If fish is not your vibe, meat, vegetarian and some vegan options are available too."

    "generalInfo": "This Bali holiday is a tailor made trip, following a carefully crafted itinerary that combines both the cultural wonders of inland Bali, at Ubud, with plenty of relaxing beach time at Sanur. <br/><br/>Starting at Ubud, considered by many to be the cultural hub of the island, it is a wonderful location for discovering local artisans’ work, visiting ancient temples and savouring Balinese cuisine. We can arrange hiking or cycling trips into the region’s rural villages and terraced paddies, the highlight for many of our guests being the temples at Mount Agung. Bali is a place to go at your own pace, cycling here and there, stopping to enjoy some hot springs, or just sitting outside a local ‘warung’ or café and watching this beautiful Balinese world go by. <br/><br/>In Ubud you will stay at an elegant boutique hotel, Tepi Sawah, just on the outskirts of the town, with only 25 bedrooms overlooking the typical Balinese rural landscape of luscious green paddies. It also has a swimming pool and stunning gardens.<br/><br/>Your accommodation in Sanur, where you will be based for the rest of your trip, is not only equally beautiful but, like all properties in Bali, adheres to local law that says nothing can be taller than a palm tree. You will have plenty of palm trees, however, at this beachfront boutique hotel, Tandjung Sari. A family run hotel, it is one of the oldest accommodations on the island and with that comes years of superb hospitality, having welcomed guests for over fifty years. Located on a beach that has a quiet atmosphere, visit the beach front temple, fine seafood restaurants and shops or galleries nearby. <br/><br/>Tandjung Sari has 27 traditional beach bungalows, which are fully equipped and yet decorated with understated Balinese style. They are within easy reach of the both the beach and the hotel’s saltwater infinity pool. Indeed, the hotel bar overlooks a tranquil lagoon with views across to the island of Nusa Penida. There is also a traditional Balinese spa at the hotel. <br/><br/>The Balinese are very proud of their local culture and Hindu Heritage. Tandjung Sari, therefore, hosts musical entertainment, as well as traditional dance accompanied by a gamelan orchestra, twice a month. <br/><br/><br/>",

The snorkel boats can always pick us up down current at the end of the snorkel. After our snorkel, we return to the resort for a delicious lunch. After a little post-lunch siesta we’ll prepare for the second snorkel session of the day, followed by more snacks! You will not go hungry on this safari. For those who are keen, we can also organize a sunset or night snorkel on the house reef or one of the other nearby reefs. We will offer 2 guided boat snorkel sessions a day. You are not obliged to participate in them all. Throughout our time at Kusu Island Resort the house reef is open for snorkeling any time you choose. Dinner is a 3-course meal. Evenings are spent looking through fish ID books, reviewing the day’s photos and sightings, chatting in the spacious lounge, or enjoying the night sky from your giant porch."

Over two thirds of the entire population live on this island and it is hugely rich in culture and scenery. You will spend three nights in the city of Yogyakarta in Central Java.<br/><br/>Here you will witness the beautiful Buddhist relic of Borobudur at sunrise and have a chance to explore the Hindu temples of Prambanan. ‘Jogja’ as it is locally known is renowned as a centre of education, fine arts and craftwork, including batik printing, shadow puppets, drama, music and poetry. A local ballet troupe perform an excellent adaptation of the Ramayana in the grounds of the Prambanan temple complex which we highly recommend visiting.<br/><br/>From Yogyakarta you will fly to Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo) where you will head into Tanjung Puting National Park. This is one of the most remote places to see orang-utan in their natural habitat and is one of the most rewarding wildlife experiences there is. You can relax on the deck of your own private Klotok river boat by day as you journey up the Sekonyer River to each feeding station whilst returning to the Rimba Eco Lodge in the evening. <br/><br/>Continue your journey through Indonesia with time on the Hindu island of Bali enjoying several excursions that introduce you to the local Balinese culture and cuisine before heading to the less developed and quieter east coast for a few days at the charming Alila Manggis in Candidasa.",

    "generalInfo": "This Indonesia holiday is a tailor made scenic and cultural tour, travelling with local driver guides and staying at a mix of boutique hotels and comfortable eco-lodges, so that you get an insight into many different aspects of Bali. Our itinerary below is just under two weeks although we can adapt it to suit your timeframe and budget. <br/><br/>Your trip will start in Ubud, the cultural capital of the beautiful island of Bali. Here you can enjoy the unique surroundings of a boutique hotel, as well as the hive of traditional creativity that Ubud is famous for. It is the perfect place to go shopping for artisan work, visit art galleries and museums, and see traditional cultural performances. All set amongst green rice terraces and dreamy tropical terrain, where we can also organize some adventures for you such as white water rafting, mountain biking or hiking. <br/><br/>After a drive through lush green landscapes, your next Indonesian experience is at De Klumpu eco-resort which sits outside of a traditional village northeast of Ubud. The eco-resort focuses on local experiences which can be arranged during your time at leisure such as waterfall walks, cycling tours, learning about local plants and herbs, and traditional wedding blessings. You will also have the opportunity to travel with your guide to Mount Batur, one of the most famous volcanos on the island for a trek.<br/>Finish the trip in Candidasa, a small beach town on the eastern coast of Bali. While here there will be plenty of time to relax and explore, and we would suggest trying a snorkeling excursion. A local guide will be arranged to show you around some of the area’s important sights including the royal water palace. There is also the opportunity to visit a local village for a Balinese cooking course, an important and delicious taste of local life.<br/><br/>We feel that the best time to go to Indonesia is outside the very rainy season which is between December and February, however Indonesia is a wonderful place to visit all year round, and we can adapt your itinerary according to the season. It is worth noting that the different islands will have slightly varying weather so adjusting where you visit can make the most of your time throughout the year.<br/>",

Join a fully escorted small group as you travel from Kalimantan to Komodo via Bali, to see orangutans, Komodo dragons, bats, manta rays and more. <br/><br/>Indonesian Kalimantan is the larger, wilder portion of Borneo. Its forests have been depleted by logging and palm oil plantations, putting wildlife such as orangutans and probiscis monkeys at risk of extinction. Our holiday makes a financial donation to an organisation fighting deforestation and poaching, and you’ll be able to spend a day volunteering at a reforestation project. <br/><br/>Spend two nights in Tanjung Puting on a traditional riverboat known as a klotok. The amenities are basic but comfortable, and if you choose you can sleep on deck surrounded by the sounds of the rainforest. You’ll enjoy multiple opportunities to see wild orangutans as they swing down from the trees to their feeding stations – and just your presence here as tourists proves to authorities that there is value in protecting this endangered habitat.<br/><br/>Next, fly via Bali to Labuan Bajo where you’ll board a private boat to spend a few days touring the legendary Komodo National Park. Walk with a park ranger to learn about the giant lizards that call this place home. You’ll also share a meal with a local family here, finding out about how they manage life in close proximity to these fearsome creatures. Other absorbing experiences during this portion of your trip include the chance to snorkel with manta rays, and watch as thousands of bats swoop into the evening sky to feed. If you’re a wildlife lover, Indonesia will captivate you.<br/>",

We then fly to Sulawesi and Tangkoko National Park, to look for wildlife including the tiny tarsier, and continue on, to discover the traditional ways of living in the Minhasa Highlands and the villages around Makassar. <br/><br/>Perhaps the most intriguing part of our time in Sulawesi, will be our visit to Tanah Toraja, where we spend time among the rice terraces and bamboo forests of this beautiful region with the Toraja people, learning about their unusual death and burial rituals. The eastern part of the archipelago and the island of Flores, brings us to a fascinating place where only ten years ago the remains of a separate human species were found. We visit tribal villages where the supernatural is still part of everyday life, and discover the amazing crater lakes of the Keli Mutu volcano. In bustling markets we rub shoulders with traders and farmers, and journey through stunning landscapes to find pristine beaches where fishermen haul in their daily catch. <br/><br/>The trip finishes with a real highlight – a boat trip to the adjacent islands of Komodo and Rinca, where we search on foot for the near mythical komodo dragons, incredible creatures that can grow up to three metres and were only discovered by western science a hundred years ago. Many people visit Indonesia each year, but few make it this far, to the far-flung outposts of the islands, and those that do are rewarded with a sense of discovery that is often lacking elsewhere.",

This trip focuses on one of the largest islands in Indonesia. In fact it is the most populated island in the world; Java. As a result of booming human population there is a not extensive wilderness areas left on the island, but there are still many places were a large diversity of wildlife can be seen. This tour takes you to some of these locations as we go in search of some of Java's endemic mammals.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>Java is also home to many endemic species of mammals and like many parts of South East Asia the forests and other protected areas here are under huge pressure from increasing human populations. This is not a good combination and we aim to showcase some of the lesser visited forests on Java to increase eco-tourism and try and provide a means for these species and forests to be protected. <br/><br/>This trip is run in conjunction with our popular and unique Javan Rhino Expedition, combining these two trips can result (with a little good luck) in a 2 week trip that could produce all of the endemic mammals of the island. Our Javan rhino tour will focus on the rhino obviously and will be based solely in Ujong Kulon National Park. Our Endemic Mammals of Java tour is run at the start and finish of the Javan Rhino tour and so are easily combined. This trip will explore forests in and around two other national parks, the mountainous and rugged Gunung Gede Pangrango National Park. Here many of the species we are targeting are present. We also have some other locations nearby for other animals which may prove a little hard inside the thickly forested park (such as the Javan slow loris), so we remain flexible on this trip so we can move from location to location and get to the best and most reliable locations for the endemic mammals based on recent movements. <br/><br/>This is a short extension trip that focuses on the wonderful and endemic species to Java, these include the Javan lutung, Javan gibbon, Javan warty-pig, Javan slow loris, Javan small-toothed civet, Javan mongoose, Javan ferret-badger, Javan treeshrew and Grizzled leaf monkey. Of course we cannot guarantee any or all of these species but we will do our very best to get all of them and other species<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Jakarta. There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Java and other parts of Indonesia. Your naturalist escort is an expert in mammals including their conservation and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. <br/><br/>The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, river safaris, spotlighting, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the park. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>We visit Java on this tour during the dry season months of June and July. This increases our chances of seeing targeted species. This trip has scheduled dates for the start and end of our Javan Rhino Expedition tour which can be added onto this tour as a extension easily.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• Our local Indonesian guides in Java have a good relationship with the park officials and because of this we get a heads up when animals are sighted and this can guide us in where to focus and thus increasing our chances of seeing our targeted species. In fact some of the places we will be visiting are community run reserves and only with our local guides are we able to explore them.<br/>• All of the wildlife watching activities are done on your own (or in your own group) with your own private guide only.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our wildlife tours and specialist mammal watching tours of Indonesia a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Indonesia so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the all of the Javan endemic mammals. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Indonesia at other times of year and focusing on other species such as Javan rhinos, babirusas, cuscuses, orangutans, Asiatic elephants, clouded leopards, manta rays, komodo dragons as well as the range of endemic and wonderful bird species in Indonesia. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour is based solely on the island of Java, Indonesia. But more specifically the western section of Java.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from a vehicle. So no physical fitness for hiking or anything like that is needed. This is a very easy trip to undertake.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 16 Years Old",

The rest of the afternoon is free to relax and explore. Bukit Lawang is one of the most accessible places to spot orangutans, thanks to an orangutan conservation programme that has been operating on the eastern edge of the park since the 1970s. The village is attractive, built along one side of the river; relaxing by the river, it is not uncommon to see wild orangutans come to the water to drink. Around 6pm, say selamat sore to your tour leader and fellow travellers, when we gather as a group for the first time to get to know each other and learn more about the adventures ahead.

    "generalInfo": "‘Here be dragons…’ as quoted on many antique maps when Europeans were describing the unexplored countries and islands of Asia. But it was not all make-believe and fantasy as this phrase probably stems from the tales heard by pirates, buccaneers and early explorers from local people in relation to the large lizards that inhabited the islands of Eastern Indonesia. <br/><br/>We now know these lizards to be Komodo dragons, not fire-breathing but venomous, not winged but social and intelligent and not gigantic but still over 3m long. However the Komodo dragons are not the only giant we will be focusing on during this trip. We will also be visiting some hot spots for the gentle giant of the seas, the wonderful Manta ray. <br/><br/>Snorkelling with these beautiful animals is one of the greatest wildlife experiences you can have. This tour is a great tour on its own or to be combined with a longer tour of Indonesia such as our other wildlife watching holidays of this incredible archipelago.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife tours which focus on some of the world’s rarest wildlife. These trips are specialist and are run more like expeditions than your conventional wildlife holiday. <br/><br/>This particular trip heads to the lesser Sundas which are a group of islands east of Bali in the Indonesian archipelago and include the famous island of Komodo. The dragons of course grab all of the headlines here but there are more species found on these islands but the real wealth of life lies under the surface. <br/><br/>The dry rocky scrub habitat of the islands gives way to rich coral reefs and incredibly diverse marine ecosystems just offshore and this trip combines the best of land based wildlife watching as well as snorkelling around the wonderful Komodo Islands National Park.<br/><br/>Throughout the trip you will be guided by local park rangers and a zoologist guide (where available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us), and people with an intimate knowledge of the wildlife and habitats you will be visiting. For anyone who wants a chance of seeing this incredibly rare species you have to get in touch with us and we can provide more information about our group tour.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned. There will be boiled or bottled water available for each guest each day.

The sea temperatures remain constant and between 27-30C throughout the year which is excellent for snorkelling.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local rangers, drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it. <br/>• We will bring some specialist equipment with us to help us find wildlife, including thermal imaging equipment which help find nocturnal mammals.<br/>• Spend as much time as you wish to looking for wildlife throughout the day, with special focus in the early morning and late afternoon as these are the peak activity periods for many mammals - we will also head out after dark for spotlighting at every possible opportunity as many mammals are nocturnal.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our expedition for the endemic mammals of Sulawesi a great success rate in seeing many unique species. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Indonesia so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the Komodo dragons, manta rays and spinner dolphins and other terrestrial and marine wildlife as well as many more species throughout the rest of the Indonesian archipelago. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Indonesia at other times of year and focusing on other species such as orangutans, gibbons, clouded leopards, Javan rhinos, babirusas, birds of paradise and many incredible species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour visits no less than 7 islands of the Indonesian archipelago, with the majority of the trip spend around the Lesser Sundas. Islands such as Bali, Flores, Komodo and Rinca are the main islands with smaller islands such as Sebayur and Kanawa providing the snorkelling locations. The trip will start and end in Jakarta on the island of Java.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The activities on this trip are split between walking (mostly on flat ground) and snorkelling, so being able to swim is essential. <br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 Years Old<br/><br/>Photo Credits:<br/><br/>Siharaditia, CC BY-SA 4.0 <br/>Gordon Flood from Trim, Ireland, CC BY 2.0 <br/>Charles J.

Komodo dragons are the largest extant species of lizard and growing up to 3m long they are the top predator on Rinca and the other 5 islands they still inhabit. They once ranged over a larger area but they have been hunted to extinction on all but the 5 islands (Komodo, Rinca, Flores (only small pockets), Gili Motang and Padar) that make up the Komodo Islands National Park. Rinca differs from Komodo Island in being a small island with a small human population, it is less busy and shows you the pristine dry scrub ecosystem that used to cover most of the islands in the Lesser Sunda Archipelago. As well as the iconic Komodo dragons we will also search for water buffalo, wild boar, Timor rusa deer, long-tailed macaques, orange-footed scrubfowl, zebra doves, green imperial pigeons, Javan spitting cobras, Asian bullfrogs and the endemic (to Rinca Island only) Rinca rat. We will explore the island in full today and then in the afternoon we will head to a small nearby island that has a large colony of flying foxes. As the flying foxes begin to leave their roosts to feed the sight is spectacular. There are three species here including Sunda flying fox, Island flying fox and the large flying fox. We will then have dinner on board the boat and sleep offshore. Tomorrow we will explore the iconic island of Komodo where the truly huge dragons can be found. (all meals included)."

Obviously the main target of today will be to find and get close up views of the island’s most incredible and famous residents the Komodo dragon. We will meet a National Park Ranger and be escorted on our quest to find large Komodo dragons. But whilst here we have a chance to see water buffalo, rusa deer, wild pigs and many bird species. The ecosystem of this island and the other Lesser Sundas is significantly different to nearby islands so many of the species found here will not be found in other islands we visit on this tour. We will spend the morning on the island and also visit the ranger station and local villages along the coast, here the dragons have got very used to people and more importantly food that is left for them and it is here that we are most likely to see many dragons together and interacting with each-other. The only other occasions when large numbers of adult Komodo dragons are found together are when they are in the breeding season (which is January) and at a large carcass such as a water buffalo, horse or deer, however these are very rare and hard to come across as they tend to occur deep in the interior of the island. On your return to your boat after hiking around Komodo Island and seeing the plentiful Komodo dragon here you will sail to Sabita Bay near Karang Makassar (Manta Point) for tomorrow’s snorkelling.

    "generalInfo": "This wildlife tour explores some of Indonesia’s most iconic wildlife destinations, first heading to both north and south Sumatra and then onto the famous Komodo National Park. <br/><br/>By visiting the national parks of Gunung Leuser, Way Kambas and Komodo Islands you will experience a wide range of ecosystems, as well as having the chance to see a huge range of wildlife. Many species will be endemic to the islands we see them on. <br/><br/>The first port of call will be the Sumatran orangutan’s last stronghold in the north of Sumatra, Gunung Leuser National Park. Next is a trip around Komodo and Rinca Islands where we go in search of the world’s largest lizard and aptly named Komodo dragon. Your final stop will be to head to the southern tip of Sumatra and to the mammal rich forests of Way Kambas National Park, this is the only place left in Indonesia where rhinos, elephants, tigers, sun bears and tapirs all still coexist. <br/><br/>Add to these species a vast range of smaller mammals and you have one of the world’s most mammal diverse forests. As well as spending most of your time on Sumatra, Komodo and Rinca you will also visit the islands of Java, Flores and Bali making this a great overview of some of Indonesia’s most iconic islands.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife tours which focus on some of the world’s rarest wildlife. These trips are specialist and are run more like expeditions than your conventional wildlife holiday. <br/><br/>This particular trip heads to the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Komodo as well as also visiting Java, Flores, Bali and Rinca along the way. This is a unique trip that aims to showcase a vast range of wildlife known from the amazing island nation of Indonesia including some of its most iconic and world famous such as the Sumatran orangutan and Komodo dragon. <br/><br/>From hiking the steep, dense and wonderful forests of Gunung Leuser in search of orangutans to cruising along the Way Kanan river in Way Kambas checking the river banks for signs of wildlife including the incredibly rare Sumatran rhino and walking among the giant dinosaur like Komodo dragons. This is a unique wildlife watching tour of one of the best wildlife watching destinations in the world.<br/><br/>Throughout the trip you will be guided by local park rangers and a zoologist guide (where available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us), and people with an intimate knowledge of the wildlife and habitats you will be visiting. This is a ground breaking tour that is unique in the world, we have negotiated special rates for the scientific permits that are needed to access the core area of the forest. For anyone who wants a chance of seeing this incredibly rare species you have to get in touch with us and we can provide more information about our group tour.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned. There will be boiled or bottled water available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable local rangers who have many years of experience working and guiding in Sumatra. Your naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local rangers have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit in order to maximise our chances of seeing all of our targeted species. We also include all park entrance fees and the special permits needed to enter the core area of the park. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us). We will also bring thermal imaging equipment to help us find wildlife after dark and go spotlighting as often as the local conditions allow.<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>There are two drier parts of the year when visiting Sumatra for wildlife, the first being December - April and the second being June - September. However rain is expected in nearly every moth of year. so There is no real bad time visit. This is also a good time of year to visit Komodo.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local rangers, drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it. The main wildlife activities on this trip will be early morning and evening trips into the forests as well as spotlighting after dark (in Way Kambas) looking for nocturnal wildlife.<br/>• We will bring some specialist equipment with us to help us find wildlife, including thermal imaging equipment which help find nocturnal mammals.<br/>• Spend as much time as you wish to looking for wildlife throughout the day, with special focus in the early morning and late afternoon as these are the peak activity periods for many mammals - we will also head out after dark for spotlighting at every possible opportunity as many mammals are nocturnal.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our expedition for the wildlife of Sumatra and Komodo a great success rate in seeing many unique species. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Indonesia so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the Sumatran orangutans, Siamang, Sunda leopard cat and banded civets and other endemics on the island as well as many more species throughout the rest of the Indonesian archipelago. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Indonesia at other times of year and focusing on other species such as Javan rhinos, babirusa, cuscus, crested macaques, birds of paradise and many incredible species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour starts and ends in Jakarta on the island of Java as well as visiting Sumatra and in particular the northern and southern parks of Gunung Leuser and Way Kambas and also visiting the Lesser Sundas of Bali, Flores, Komodo and Rinca.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>Whilst most of this trip is done with hiking in the forests you will need to be used to hiking. The terrain in Gunung Leuser can be very steep in places as the park is mountainous.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 Years Old<br/><br/>Photo Credits:<br/><br/>Charles J.

Once we arrive in Medan we will be met by a local driver and transferred inland towards the forests of Gunung Leuser National Park (4.5 hours). Gunung Leuser National Park is a mountainous area of protected forest that is home to the largest population of wild Sumatran orangutans remaining in the world. Over the next 2.5 days we will explore the park and hope to come across some of these orangutans. We have a great chance as the Ketambe Research Station was set up in 1971 (which in 1973 led to the establishment of Bohorok Orangutan Centre) to specifically help protect, rehabilitate and research orangutan. This has lead to numerous orangutans being re-wilded and reintroduced to the forest, for newly introduced individuals food is left on platforms to help supplement their diet. This is also utilised by older orangutans and completely wild (never been hand reared) orangutans also come to take advantage of the free food. The forest is also home to Sumatran rhinos, Sumatran tigers, Asiatic elephants, Sumatran serow, leopard cats, saimangs and sambar deer however most of these species are very elusive here. We will however have a good chance of seeing orangutans, Thomas’s langur, white-handed gibbons, long-tailed macaques, southern pig-tailed macaques as well as a variety of birds, reptiles and insects. This morning we will be driven to our accommodation in the village of Bukit Lawang, since 1987 the Jungle Inn here has welcomed people who wish to explore the forest and whilst the rooms may lack AC they have fans and a great view out over the river and the national park beyond. After settling into the lodge we will have some lunch. You can discuss with your local guide if you wish to have an afternoon hike around the forest here or just rest this afternoon (that is your decision). (breakfast and dinner are included today)."

Although a trip designed for the adventure traveller, you will be staying at some of Indonesia’s finest hotels, many dating back to the Dutch colonial period, including the luxurious Hermitage in Jakarta and the venerable Phoenix Hotel -, the place to stay in Yogyakarta.<br/><br/>After exploring Jakarta, one of the world’s greatest megalopolises, we head east by first class train to Yogyakarta, the country's cultural capital. Along the way the train crosses sweeping viaducts, snakes through gentle hills and past rice paddies nestling in narrow valleys amongst the jungle. From Yogyakarta (commonly known as Yogya), we will visit one of Java’s must-see sights. Comprising the remains of some 244 temples, World Heritage–listed Prambanan is Indonesia's largest Hindu site and one of Southeast Asia's major attractions.<br/><br/>We continue our journey east to Malang, a colonial city built by the Dutch to escape the heat of the coastal plains. After a very early start, we will travel to Mount Bromo where if the conditions are right, you will be rewarded with a dazzling view over mist-laden volcanoes.<br/><br/>As our adventure comes to an end, we take the short ferry crossing linking Java and Bali where we spend two nights away from the crowds at the beachside paradise of Pemuteran on the island’s less-visited north coast.<br/><br/>A remarkable trip that combines adventure and a chance to experience this huge country ‘flight free’, whilst staying at some of the finest hotels that you will find in this part of Asia.",

Colonial Dutch structures have been transformed into museums, cafes, and galleries. Your first visit will be the lively old harbour of Sunda Kelapa, which once housed a range of Buganese Phinisi Schooners responsible for transporting goods from across the archipelago. Thought to be operational since before the 13th-century, the harbour is a fascinating location that preserves the history of Jakarta.

Sunrise is the most magical time to view the entire Bromo landscape but this does involve a very early morning start. Firstly travel by normal vehicle to Wonotoro, a small village 2,000 metres above sea level and the gateway to the region. Then continue by private jeep to the rim of Mount Penanjakan in time for dawn. From this vantage poi t you will have the best views not only of Mount Bromo, but also Mount Batok and Mount Semeru. After (hopefully) witnessing a spectacular sunrise, you will return to your jeep and make the steep descent back down to the bottom of the volcano and then cross the Lautan Pasir (Sand Sea) to the base of Mount Bromo itself. The climb of approximately 250 steps (*) to the rim of the crater is definitely worth the effort and you will be rewarded with yet more incredible vistas. After your visit, return to your hotel. *For an additional cost (payable locally), it is possible to cross the sea of sand by horseback. Note: This excursion is only available from Surabaya, Tosari or Malang and advance booking is essential. Please ensure you wear suitable attire with you, as the viewpoint can become quite cold. The hike to the crater lasts approximately 20-30 minutes and primarily follows sandy trails, concluding with a climb of 250 steps to reach the summit."

This is a stunning starting point, with views (weather permitting) over the active volcano Mount Batur, which sits alongside Lake Batur, and the surrounding landscape of Central Bali. A short drive will bring you to the cycling starting point in Abuan village, from where you will wind your way downhill through the colourful tapestry that is the Balinese countryside. You will do several stops en route, taking in key sights and interesting highlights. You will pass scenic traditional Balinese villages and housing compounds, as well as lovely local temples. Say hello to the local children and villagers and revel in a life unchanged for centuries. Pass by blazing green rice paddies, lush and verdant and full of life. Change back into a car and continue to the amazing rice terraces of Tegalalang, where you will also visit the local village market. This colourful marketplace has a wide range of items on display including clothing, textiles, leather goods and locally crafted souvenirs. Have fun wandering around and making the odd purchase, but keep in mind prices are negotiable so remember to bargain for a fair one. Wind your way back to Ubud and arrive at the amazing art and cultural centre of Arma Kafe for lunch. Here you will savour either a crispy duck menu with Balinese side dishes, or a 3-course Indonesian meal, whichever you prefer. After lunch, begin your exploration of the scenery of Ubud by foot. Your ramble will pass over the lush river valley of Tukad Wos, commonly known as the Campuhan Ridge, offering views of Gunung Agung and glimpses of small village communities and rice fields. This is a light trek, lasting around 2 hours. You will have an orientation as you begin at the beautiful Gunung Lebah Temple, which means ‘small hill’ in the Indonesian language. This temple was built in the 8th century, and has become synonymous with Ubud and Balinese history. From here, you will amble gently north, walking up onto the valley ridge between the two rivers. Continue north along the Campuhan ridge, arguably the finest trek in Ubud with spectacular views. This place has been regarded as holy for centuries and the peace of this landscape is guaranteed to soothe, as you walk between the tall green grasses. Afterwards return to your hotel in Ubud and spend the remainder of your day at your leisure. Note: This activity falls into moderate category, as it requires prior bike riding experience and includes cycling up and down hills, which demands a certain level of fitness."

    "generalInfo": "Explore the rugged forest of Ujong Kulon NP in Java and become some of the first people ever to specifically look for the critically endangered Javan Rhino<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife tours which focus on some of the world’s rarest wildlife. These trips are specialist and are run more like expeditions than your conventional wildlife holiday. <br/><br/>This particular trip heads to the far western tip of Java, Indonesia and the forested park of Ujong Kulon. This is the last home of the critically endangered Javan Rhino, which is the rarest large mammal anywhere in the world. <br/><br/>The park is very dense and we will hike from the entrance to a little known river deep inside the park. The rhinos are mostly seen in this river and so most of the wildlife activities will be canoeing silently up and down this river in the early morning and late evening. We head into the park with a team of porters and spend the entire time camping in the forest. <br/><br/>Throughout the trip you will be guided by local park rangers and a zoologist guide (where available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us), and people with an intimate knowledge of the wildlife and habitats you will be visiting. This is a ground breaking tour that is unique in the world, we have negotiated special rates for the scientific permits that are needed to access the core area of the forest. For anyone who wants a chance of seeing this incredibly rare species you have to get in touch with us and we can provide more information about our group tour.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned (all cooked in our camp in the forest). There will be boiled or bottled water available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers and porters to carry our food, camping equipment and personal baggage to and from the campsite and entrance to the park. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable local rangers who have many years of experience working and guiding in Ujong Kulon National Park. Your naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local rangers have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit in order to maximise our chances of seeing Javan Rhinos. We also include all park entrance fees and the special Simaksi permit needed to enter the core area of the park. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>We focus this trip during the dry season (June – August) each year as this is when the rhinos spend more time around the river and any of their mud wallows are easier to find and more commonly used.<br/>The weather at this time of year will be hot and humid, with temperatures around 22-32oC in the day and night. There should be little rainfall at this time of year, however being a rainforest there is always the chance of rain at any time of year. <br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local rangers, drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it. The main wildlife activities on this trip will be early morning and evening canoe trips up and down a commonly used river by rhinos. We will also have a hide where we can set this up nearby a mud wallow or along a trail and see if a rhino comes by.<br/>• Other than a basic forest guest house on the final day of the trip as we have left the forest and where you can shower and freshen up before the journey back to the city of Jakarta; we will be camping throughout the rest of the trip.<br/>• Spend as much time as you wish to looking for Javan rhinos throughout the day, with special focus in the early morning and late afternoon as these are the peak activity periods for Javan rhinos.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our expedition for Javan Rhinos a great success rate. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Indonesia so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the Javan Rhinos and other endemics on the island as well as many more species throughout the rest of the Indonesian archipelago. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Indonesia at other times of year and focusing on other species such as orangutans, gibbons, clouded leopards, tarsiers, komodo dragons, black macaques and many incredible species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour starts and finishes in Jakarta but the majority of the trip is located inside the core-zone of Ujong Kulon National Park, which is a national park in the far west of Java, Indonesia.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>Whilst the long hike to and from the campsite in the forest will be with porters who will carry the bulk of our food, camping equipment and personal baggage and therefore is not overly strenuous; the temperature and humidity can make hiking hard for people who are not used to walking in the heat. The forest is very thick and the trails are poor or non-existent. We also require some canoeing, which is done at a slow and steady pace along a still and calm river. All in all we would require a reasonable level of fitness but it is not an overly demanding trip.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 Years Old",

This makes it easier as we will start to collect all clients (from their hotels) at around 5am (time to be confirmed nearer the time), we want to start as early as possible so that we can get to the park and set up camp before dark. So once we have collected the group together we will head towards the western tip of the island of Java and the forest park of Ujong Kulon National Park. The drive will take around 3 hours or so to get to Carita, from here we will get into a speed boat and cruise along the coast to the park’s gateway. This boat trip will take round 2.5 hours and we will have lunch on board the boat. We will travel by the boat to Taman Jaya and then land at Laban in the park. Were we will explore once in the park may well vary from what is documented in the next few days and will be dependant on what the local guides and rangers recommend based on their experience and the recent movements of the rhinos. Being an expedition style trip a great amount of flexibility is needed and we will do everything we can to make sure we are in the right place at the right time to try and see one. We will hike south towards Karang Ranjang, searching for signs of the rhinos along the way, we will have the camp close but not too close to where we focus most of our efforts. Todays hike could be around 3 hours long, on arrival at the camp we will set up and settle in with some dinner. If the light is still good and people still have some energy we can take a little walk around. However we recommend that we are up and ready for the morning canoe along the Cikeusik River at dawn (or pre-dawn) so a good nights rest is a good idea tonight.

The area has done well with its conservation measures and its robust population of sea turtles is a testament to this fact.

We then return to the resort for lunch and some downtime before heading out for an afternoon snorkel. The house reef is incredible and well worth several visits. It is accessed via the resort’s own private pier which has an easy to climb ladder for a comfortable entry and exit. The house reef is pretty spectacular and usually ends up being one of the highlights of the trip as the reef just in front of the resort is home to juvenile blacktip reef sharks, schools of fish, vibrant corals, and loads of cool critters. The beauty of the house reef is that you can snorkel it any time you want. One day will be spent out on the boat all day, as we tour the Fam Islands. On this day we will have a packed lunch on the boats, and enjoy 2 snorkel sessions as well as an opportunity to check out the famous viewpoint of the lagoon before heading back to the resort. The exact days for these outings will be decided according to the weather. The snorkeling accessible from the resort is highly varied and arguably some of the best in Raja Ampat. In this Dampier Straight region, you will find a multitude of beautiful coral reefs with each offering something different. Some may be situated around unique topography with shallow swim-throughs, while others may just extend for hundreds of meters in every direction. This area is also very popular with the manta rays as there are certain bays and islands that are known to feed and clean at different times of the day. We will also take the opportunity to meander through the famous mangroves where the mangrove tree roots seem to be an extension of the coral reef below. The marine life is just as diverse as the types of snorkeling sites, the shallow reef tops are a great place to enjoy the rhythmic pulse of the colorful reef fish and admire the determination of the hawkbill sea turtles as they forage for the sponges at the base of corals. In the blue you never know what you might find, but you can count on larger schools of jackfish, batfish, and the odd tornadoes of barracudas. On other sites we might get lucky with some cleaning or feeding manta rays. This area has the highest species count of anywhere in the world so really, everywhere you look you’re bound to find something truly amazing."

Your day begins aboard a comfortable fibreglass boat with a shaded roof, waiting just in front of the resort. Stocked with life jackets, towels, a picnic lunch, chilled drinks, and everything you need for fishing and snorkelling, it’s your ticket to another unforgettable day in this remote island paradise. Cross the Savu Sea, skimming over 15 kilometres of open water towards Ndao Island, which, together with Rote, gives the regency its name. Leave early and your chances of reeling in a big catch for dinner are even better. These waters are among the richest in Indonesia, thanks to the near absence of commercial fishing. As you go, your lines will be trolling for Spanish mackerel, giant and bluefin trevally, barracuda, dogtooth and yellowfin tuna, marlin, and more. On arrival at Ndao, dive straight from the boat into impossibly blue water lapping at blinding white sand. The colours are so vivid they almost don’t look real. Stretch out on the beach and you’ll soon understand why the shores of Rote Ndao are considered some of the most beautiful in all of Asia. From here, cruise onwards to neighbouring Do’o – an uninhabited, oval-shaped coral island ringed by a turquoise lagoon and lush with pandanus trees, coconut palms, and low tropical bush. Slip into the water with your snorkel to discover a kaleidoscope of reef fish, living seashells, flashes of fluorescent coral, and perhaps even an octopus, lobster, or gliding manta ray. Enjoy your freshly prepared lunch on the soft sand, soaking up the silence. Spending a little extra time on Do’o feels like having your own private desert island – until it’s time to cruise back across the water to your hotel."

This remote corner of Indonesia is a land of deserted white-sand beaches, tangled mangroves, untouched coral reefs, rich marine life, and world-class waves. Scattered offshore are uninhabited islets, while inland you’ll find a pace of life that feels wonderfully unchanged. The Rotenese people are warm and welcoming, their lives rooted in Christian traditions, farming, fishing, and seaweed cultivation for cosmetics. Lontar palms dot the landscape, and it’s not unusual to see pigs, goats, and cows wandering freely along the roadside. Food here is as local as it gets – fruit and vegetables come from the island’s small farms, while fish and meat are often bought straight from the fishermen. Your adventure begins paddling through one of Rote’s most remarkable ecosystems – its mangrove forests. Glide your kayak along glassy waterways beneath the dense canopy, listening to the calls of birds and the rustle of wildlife in this rarely visited sanctuary. Heading south, the road winds through timeless countryside, past simple villages and rolling fields where life moves to the rhythm of the land and sea. In Oeseli, you’ll swap your car for a small motorised wooden boat, crossing the bay into a narrow channel of clear turquoise water. Mangroves and lush tropical forest line the way, leading you to a hidden saltwater lagoon of extraordinary beauty. Known locally as Lake Nirvana, it’s a serene spot for a swim or a short climb to a lookout where the view is picture-perfect. After soaking up the moment, cruise back to shore and return to your hotel, with the afternoon free to relax or explore at your own pace."

        "description": "Banda Neira - Spice Islands: At the historic heart of the spice trade, the Banda archipelago holds a rich and fascinating history that we will delve into during our two days here. A beautiful group of 10 lushly vegetated volcanic islands, Banda has attracted merchants and traders for over 2,000 years owing to its highly sought-after goods such as cloves, textiles, batik and rice. Yet its not only its goods that have attracted visitors here over the years. Its tropical flora, enchanting underwater lava flow reefs and beautiful landscapes are equally impressive. As we approach Banda Neira, the archipelago’s administrative capital, on the morning of day 4, make sure to be on deck to savour the view of the outline of Gunung Api volcano with its thin plume of smoke often rising from the summit, and watch the Moluccan paddlers propelling kora kora canoes with their elaborately carved figureheads. Your first morning here can be spent exploring ashore enjoying local tea and snacks on the waterfront. Or you may wish to take a snorkel or dive over the fascinating lava flow reef system. In the afternoon, we can explore the famous and extremely well-preserved Fort Belgica whilst gaining an interesting insight into the area’s Dutch colonisation and joining the locals for a traditional dance and music performance. The day will conclude with a refreshing glass of sparkling wine as we watch the sun setting over the fort. The following day, you can choose to explore the colourful streets of Banda Neira, meet some of the locals and visit a local nutmeg plantation to gain a fascinating insight into the spice that started Banda’s spice trade history on a memorable guided tour. Alternatively, delve into the spectacular underwater world of colourful coral and captivating species such as mobula rays, Dogtooth tuna and one of Indonesia’s largest populations of Napoleon Wrasse on an exciting snorkelling or diving excursion."

    "generalInfo": "Arguably two of Indonesia’s finest snorkeling destinations combined into one complete tour, our Misool &amp; Wakatobi Safari is a once-in-a-lifetime experience spread over 18 full days of adventure. We’ll be based out of Misool Resort in the very south of Raja Ampat and later in Wakatobi Resort in the Wakatobi National Park just off of Sulawesi. Both locations offer something different in terms of the snorkeling experience. Our time in Raja Ampat will be spent surrounded by large schools of fish, good possibilities of manta ray encounters, and densely packed soft coral reefs that rise to the surface. In Wakatobi we can expect great visibility with endless coral reefs that play host to a huge range of reef creatures. The main differences between the locations is the topography and reef structure but also in the makeup and variety of the reefs themselves.<br/><br/>Misool Resort is a paradise brimming with pristine coral reefs and more exotic marine species than you possibly count in a single trip. The resort is exceptionally comfortable given its remote location. Because of the amazing conservation efforts taken on by the resort, the surrounding waters are extremely densely populated. This can be witnessed on the doorsteps of the resort with its abundant house reef and naturally occurring black tip reef shark nursery.<br/><br/>Wakatobi Resort is situated at the geographical center of the Coral Triangle, the most marine bio-diverse environment in the world.  Wakatobi in particular is recognized as having the highest number of coral and fish species found anywhere on the planet and has a truly amazing house reef, which one can easily explore from the resort's pier. The islands and reefs in the Wakatobi National Park have been preserved from the negative effects of large-scale tourism as the area is only accessible by a private charter flight and liveaboard boats.<br/><br/>While both these areas can have some current, which brings in the nutrient-rich water that helps keep the reef alive and healthy, our local guides will choose protected sites, or appropriate times to enter the water to avoid being in current. If we are ever in a current, we will always drift with the water and not try to swim against it. You should be comfortable in the water with some upper body strength to climb back up the ladder onto the boat.",

Evenings, when not snorkeling, can be enjoyed at the bar with a soft drink or beer, looking at fish ID books or photos and reminiscing about all the fabulous things encountered each day."

Now the city glistens, its pristine efficiency is a sight to behold, and its Gardens by the Bay will leave most botanists breathless. For your time in the city you’ll stay in Sofitel So, a modern city hotel just 15 minutes walk from Marina Bay. Its rooftop pool means you can swim under skyscrapers. You could enjoy the rooftop pool bar or you could get out to the night markets and choose from a medley of Malay, Chinese and Indian cuisines: chicken rice, twisting plates of the city’s eponymous noodles, and seafood curry.<br/><br/>From Singapore it’s just a short hop to Lombok. This Indonesian island sits next to Bali and it’s famous for its gorgeous Gili islands, which sit just off its west coast. Here the snorkelling and diving has attracted attention across the world. Tugu Lombok, your home for the week, is a boutique hotel that sits on a jungle-ringed white sand beach on Lombok’s west coast, looking out towards the Gili islands themselves.  The hotel’s traditional Lombok style means wooden beds, luxuriously heavy drapes at the windows and even unusual copper baths. Antiques don’t look out of place in each beautifully-appointed room, and bamboo-lined paths are lit by old oil lamps. The hotel’s on-site spa is set in the walls of an ancient Hindu temple.  <br/><br/>Expect plenty of temptations on the spa menu, dine in a pretty pavilion, and snorkel and kayak straight off the beach. Turtles nest on the beach between March and October. The more hardy and adventurous can attempt the challenging overnight ascent of Mount Rinjani Volcano, the second highest in Indonesia. More delights await below the water at the Gili islands. You can arrange a diving excursion with the hotel and see sharks, octopus and more turtles. <br/>",

As snorkelers we will have exclusive use of the resort for the duration of our stay.

After lunch we will head out to another site for our third snorkel session of the day. The house reef is open for us at our leisure and is beautiful and worth several visits. Night snorkeling will also be offered, and again, is highly recommended. One day will be spent out on the boat all day, as we tour the famous Fam Islands, with a packed lunch and 2 snorkel sessions. This schedule will be decided according to the weather. The Fam Islands are famous for their iconic viewpoint of the karst islands and secret lagoons as well as their spectacular snorkeling sites where sea fans and soft corals grow right up the walls of the island to the surface. Meals are served at the restaurant, built in an unusual circular design on stilts over the water, providing a 360' view of the ocean and jungle. Meals are generally served buffet-style and include western and Indonesian dishes and flavors. Snacks are served between snorkels on the boat, and afternoon tea, coffee, and snacks are served as we return from our third snorkel of the day."

Located on an idyllic island in the far fringes of Indonesia, Misool is a paradise brimming with pristine coral reefs and more exotic marine life than you possibly count in a single trip. The resort is exceptionally comfortable and given its remote location you can relax and snorkel in absolute peace.<br/><br/>Expect healthy colorful reefs teeming with fish large and small, turtles, reef sharks, and a variety of smaller critters. We will also snorkel over manta cleaning stations looking for these gentle giants.<br/><br/>Because of the amazing conservation efforts taken on by the resort, there is a huge surge in the marine life’s population and you can witness it on the doorsteps of the resort with their blacktip reef shark nursery which has naturally occurred.<br/><br/>While this area can have some strong currents, which bring in the nutrient-rich water that helps keep the reef alive and healthy, our local guides will choose protected sites, or appropriate times to enter the water to avoid being in current. If we are ever in a current, we will always float with it and not try to swim against it. For this tour you should be comfortable in the water with some upper body strength to climb back up the ladder onto the boat.",

    "generalInfo": "Explore the little known and seldom visited forests of Sulawesi in Indonesia. This large island is a mix of wildlife from Asia and Australasia, a land made famous by Alfred Wallace and his exploration of the Indonesian archipelago the island is home to a wealth of endemic wildlife and some of the most unusual species in the world.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife tours which focus on some of the world’s rarest wildlife. These trips are specialist and are run more like expeditions than your conventional wildlife holiday. <br/><br/>This particular trip heads to Sulawesi and a variety of different forests here, it is the first and only dedicated mammal watching tour of Sulawesi. Most people who visit here are looking for birds or come to see the wonderful and iconic Black-crested Macaques. But no one dedicates two weeks to seeking out the wealth of endemic mammals here; that was until we established this unique wildlife tour.. <br/><br/>From the muddy salt licks of Nantu forest where the stunning babirusa and very rare lowland anoa can be seen, to the black sand beaches of Tangkoko which are home to black-crested macaques and the nighttime forests where various species of tarsier jump from branch to branch looking for insects, the country has so many species of mammals and all of them are our specialist targets.<br/><br/>Throughout the trip you will be guided by local park rangers and a zoologist guide (where available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us), and people with an intimate knowledge of the wildlife and habitats you will be visiting. This is a ground breaking tour that is unique in the world, we have negotiated special rates for the scientific permits that are needed to access the core area of the forest. For anyone who wants a chance of seeing this incredibly rare species you have to get in touch with us and we can provide more information about our group tour.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned. There will be boiled or bottled water available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable local rangers who have many years of experience working and guiding in Sulawesi. Your naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local rangers have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit in order to maximise our chances of seeing all of our targeted species. We also include all park entrance fees and the special permits needed to enter the core area of the park. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us). We will also bring thermal imaging equipment to help us find wildlife after dark and go spotlighting as often as the local conditions allow.<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>The best season for looking for mammals in Sulawesi is the dry season (June – mid September) and subject to availability the trip can be booked any time in this period. But we recommend the above mentioned dates.  <br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local rangers, drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it. The main wildlife activities on this trip will be early morning and evening canoe trips up and down a commonly used river by rhinos. We will also have a hide where we can set this up nearby a mud wallow or along a trail and see if a rhino comes by.<br/>• We will bring some specialist equipment with us to help us find wildlife, including thermal imaging equipment which help find nocturnal mammals.<br/>• Spend as much time as you wish to looking for wildlife throughout the day, with special focus in the early morning and late afternoon as these are the peak activity periods for many mammals - we will also head out after dark for spotlighting at every possible opportunity as many mammals are nocturnal.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our expedition for the endemic mammals of Sulawesi a great success rate in seeing many unique species. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Indonesia so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the babirusa, cuscuses and tarsiers and other endemics on the island as well as many more species throughout the rest of the Indonesian archipelago. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Indonesia at other times of year and focusing on other species such as orangutans, gibbons, clouded leopards, Javan rhinos, komodo dragons, birds of paradise and many incredible species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour explores many different forests in northern, central and southern Sulawesi, including Tangkoko, Nantu, Dumoga Bone, Karaenta and Lore Lindu. We will arrive into Manado and then leave from Palu.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>Whilst most of this trip is done with hiking in the forests you will need to be used to hiking. However the terrain is largely flat and not too difficult to walk. <br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 Years Old",

This area houses the largest population of Sumatran orangutans, approximately 80% of the entire wild population of 7,000. Leuser Ecosystem is also home to an enormous population of other wildlife including the Thomas leaf monkey, pigtail macaque, longtail macaque, gibbons, lizards, turtles, hornbills and more. Your home on this trip will be a mix of both basic guest houses, hotels and tents. You will be escorted from one destination to the next by an experienced local guide.<br/><br/>THE LEUSER ECOSYSTEM - THE LAST PLACE ON EARTH<br/>At around 2.63 million hectares, the Leuser Ecosystem really is a world unto itself; a rich expanse of original tropical lowland rainforests, cloud-covered mountains and swampy peatlands. It is among the most biodiverse ecosystems ever recorded by science, and it is the last place on earth where Sumatran orangutans, elephants, tigers and rhinos still freely roam.<br/><br/>However, the Leuser Ecosystem is now under threat. Despite being protected under Indonesian national law, massive industrial development is being planned for logging, palm oil, pulp and paper plantations and mining. This will threaten the entire ecosystem, as well as the continued wellbeing of the millions of Acehnese traditional landholders who depend on it for their food, water and livelihoods.<br/><br/>HIGHLIGHTS<br/>- Visit pristine rainforest in search of the amazing orangutan<br/>- Trek through beautiful primary forest and see Thomas leaf monkeys, pigtail and long tail macaque, monitor lizards, gibbons, wild peacocks and more.<br/>- Part of your expedition cost is directly donated to save these wonderful creatures<br/><br/>EXPEDITION GOALS<br/>Our goal is to provide our guests with a unique experience, to observe wild and semi-wild orangutans in their natural habitat. We will provide you with a safe platform to observe the amazing wildlife Sumatra has to offer including monkeys, gibbons and more. We will also provide you with comprehensive information about the destination you are in so that you are fully informed of your surrounds. Further, we have partnered up with The Orangutan Project which supports conservation programs in both Borneo and Sumatra. Each guest's fare includes the cost of a deluxe one-year orangutan adoption package.<br/><br/>HOW DO I GET TO MEDAN?<br/>Medan is in northern Sumatra, with the major airport being Medan Kualanamu International Airport (KNO). There are many daily direct flights to Medan from both Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.",

    "generalInfo": "Sumatra is one of the world’s biggest islands and easily the best island in the  Indonesian archipelago to see large numbers of mammals. Sumatra contains some of the largest areas of forest remaining in Indonesia and during this tour you will be taken to explore two of the most important. <br/><br/>Starting in the large mountainous and rich forests of the north and in particular Gunung Leuser. The only place in world where Elephants, Orangutans, Rhinos and Tigers all live. From here you will head towards the southern tip of the island and to the lowland forest reserve of Way Kambas. In Way Kambas we will combine daytime wildlife watching as well as spotlighting for a range of nocturnal wildlife including clouded leopards, various civets and maybe even sun bears, all of which are known from here in addition to saimangs, langurs, tigers, tapirs, elephants and critically endangered Sumatran rhinos.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife tours which focus on some of the world’s rarest wildlife. These trips are specialist and are run more like expeditions than your conventional wildlife holiday. <br/><br/>This particular trip heads to the Indonesian island of Sumatra and is the first and only dedicated mammal watching tour of Sumatra. Most people will know about the orangutans of Sumatra and the various elephant rescue centres which are fantastic but it is the wealth of wildlife in the forests here which will be our major focus throughout the trip. <br/><br/>From hiking the steep, dense and wonderful forests of Gunung Leuser in search of orangutans to cruising along the Way Kanan river in Way Kambas checking the river banks for signs of wildlife including the incredibly rare Sumatran rhino. This is a unique wildlife watching tour of one of the best wildlife watching destinations in the world.<br/><br/>Throughout the trip you will be guided by local park rangers and a local naturalist guide, and people with an intimate knowledge of the wildlife and habitats you will be visiting. This is a ground breaking tour that is unique in the world, we have negotiated special rates for the scientific permits that are needed to access the core area of the forest. For anyone who wants a chance of seeing this incredibly rare species you have to get in touch with us and we can provide more information about our group tour.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned. There will be boiled or bottled water available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, but can be hired if you wish - you need to contact us for availability) who would escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable local rangers who have many years of experience working and guiding in Sumatra. Your naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local rangers have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit in order to maximise our chances of seeing all of our targeted species. We also include all park entrance fees and the special permits needed to enter the core area of the park. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide). We will also bring thermal imaging equipment to help us find wildlife after dark and go spotlighting as often as the local conditions allow.<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>There are two drier parts of the year when visiting Sumatra for wildlife, the first being December - April and the second being June - September. However rain is expected in nearly every moth of year. so There is no real bad time visit.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local rangers, drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it. The main wildlife activities on this trip will be early morning and evening trips intoo the forests as well as spotlighting after dark (in Way Kambas) looking for nocturnal wildlife.<br/>• We will bring some specialist equipment with us to help us find wildlife, including thermal imaging equipment which help find nocturnal mammals.<br/>• Spend as much time as you wish to looking for wildlife throughout the day, with special focus in the early morning and late afternoon as these are the peak activity periods for many mammals - we will also head out after dark for spotlighting at every possible opportunity as many mammals are nocturnal.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our expedition for the wildlife of Sumatra a great success rate in seeing many unique species. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Indonesia so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the Sumatran orangutans, Siamang, Sunda leopard cat and banded civets and other endemics on the island as well as many more species throughout the rest of the Indonesian archipelago. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Indonesia at other times of year and focusing on other species such as Javan rhinos, babirusa, cuscus, komodo dragons, birds of paradise and many incredible species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour explores two very different forests in Sumatra. One in the north (Gunung Leuser) and one in the south (Way Kambas). We will arrive and depart from Jakarta.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>Whilst most of this trip is done with hiking in the forests you will need to be used to hiking. The terrain in Gunung Leuser can be very steep in places as the park is mountainous.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 Years Old",

Once we arrive in Medan you will be met by a local driver and transferred inland towards the forests of Gunung Leuser National Park (4.5 hours). Gunung Leuser National Park is a mountainous area of protected forest that is home to the largest population of wild Sumatran orangutans remaining in the world. Over the next 2.5 days we will explore the park and hope to come across some of these orangutans. We have a great chance as the Ketambe Research Station was set up in 1971 (which in 1973 led to the establishment of Bohorok Orangutan Centre) to specifically help protect, rehabilitate and research orangutan. This has lead to numerous orangutans being re-wilded and reintroduced to the forest, for newly introduced individuals food is left on platforms to help supplement their diet. The forest is also home to Sumatran rhinos, Sumatran tigers, Asiatic elephants, Sumatran serow, Sunda leopard cats, saimangs and sambar deer however most of these species are very elusive here. We will however have a good chance of seeing orangutans, Thomas’s langur, white-handed gibbons among other mammals, birds, reptiles and insects. This morning we will be driven to our accommodation in the village of Bukit Lawang after flying into Medan. After settling into the lodge we will have some lunch, either here or at one of the restaurants in the village. In the afternoon you will have your first guided walk through some of the forest here, the mornings are best for orangutans but you may see other primates and many species of birds in the afternoon.

    "generalInfo": "A thrilling adventure to one of the world’s last wild frontiers. The island of New Guinea is one of the richest places on our planet in terms of traditional cultures, and a treasure trove of tribal diversity, and for many groups first contact with the western world was made within living memory. This unique trip explores the western half of the island, visiting distinct cultures in an effort to understand a vanishing way of life.<br/><br/>We start in Jakarta and from here take an overnight flight to the paradise island of Biak, with its beautiful landscapes and remnants of the Second World War. After our ‘easy’ introduction to Papua, we continue on to Jayapura on the mainland, taking a boat trip on Lake Sentani, seeing the old Dutch settlement and exploring local markets.<br/><br/>The highlight of this trip comes next as we fly on to Wamena. In the Baliem Valley live the Dani, a highland people who were first ‘discovered’ in the 1930s by the outside world. With a culture centred around ancestor worship and the veneration of spirits, we’ll be lucky enough to meet a 250-year-old mummified warrior, see their traditional war dances and explore simple mountain villages that have barely changed in centuries – if not millennia.<br/><br/>Travelling in Papua is far from easy, with limited infrastructure and a comfort level that can sometimes be lacking, but it offers rewards that other destinations just don’t. Although the island is modernising, it is still in many ways a window to our own past, to a world that has disappeared from most of the globe. Papua is an adventure like no other….",
