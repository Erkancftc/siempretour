  "generalInfo": "Indonesia is the world's largest archipelago and with over 20,000 islands the country is full of life, many of the species are endemic to Indonesia and many still endemic to an island within Indonesia. This trip focuses on one of the largest islands in Indonesia. In fact it is the most populated island in the world; Java. As a result of booming human population there is a not extensive wilderness areas left on the island, but there are still many places were a large diversity of wildlife can be seen. This tour takes you to some of these locations as we go in search of some of Java's endemic mammals.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>Java is also home to many endemic species of mammals and like many parts of South East Asia the forests and other protected areas here are under huge pressure from increasing human populations. This is not a good combination and we aim to showcase some of the lesser visited forests on Java to increase eco-tourism and try and provide a means for these species and forests to be protected. <br/><br/>This trip is run in conjunction with our popular and unique Javan Rhino Expedition, combining these two trips can result (with a little good luck) in a 2 week trip that could produce all of the endemic mammals of the island. Our Javan rhino tour will focus on the rhino obviously and will be based solely in Ujong Kulon National Park. Our Endemic Mammals of Java tour is run at the start and finish of the Javan Rhino tour and so are easily combined. This trip will explore forests in and around two other national parks, the mountainous and rugged Gunung Gede Pangrango National Park. Here many of the species we are targeting are present. We also have some other locations nearby for other animals which may prove a little hard inside the thickly forested park (such as the Javan slow loris), so we remain flexible on this trip so we can move from location to location and get to the best and most reliable locations for the endemic mammals based on recent movements. <br/><br/>This is a short extension trip that focuses on the wonderful and endemic species to Java, these include the Javan lutung, Javan gibbon, Javan warty-pig, Javan slow loris, Javan small-toothed civet, Javan mongoose, Javan ferret-badger, Javan treeshrew and Grizzled leaf monkey. Of course we cannot guarantee any or all of these species but we will do our very best to get all of them and other species<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Jakarta. There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Java and other parts of Indonesia. Your naturalist escort is an expert in mammals including their conservation and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. <br/><br/>The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, river safaris, spotlighting, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the park. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>We visit Java on this tour during the dry season months of June and July. This increases our chances of seeing targeted species. This trip has scheduled dates for the start and end of our Javan Rhino Expedition tour which can be added onto this tour as a extension easily.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• Our local Indonesian guides in Java have a good relationship with the park officials and because of this we get a heads up when animals are sighted and this can guide us in where to focus and thus increasing our chances of seeing our targeted species. In fact some of the places we will be visiting are community run reserves and only with our local guides are we able to explore them.<br/>• All of the wildlife watching activities are done on your own (or in your own group) with your own private guide only.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our wildlife tours and specialist mammal watching tours of Indonesia a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Indonesia so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the all of the Javan endemic mammals. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Indonesia at other times of year and focusing on other species such as Javan rhinos, babirusas, cuscuses, orangutans, Asiatic elephants, clouded leopards, manta rays, komodo dragons as well as the range of endemic and wonderful bird species in Indonesia. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour is based solely on the island of Java, Indonesia. But more specifically the western section of Java.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from a vehicle. So no physical fitness for hiking or anything like that is needed. This is a very easy trip to undertake.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 16 Years Old",

      "description": "Garot - We have no set location or plan for today, this day is specifically for finding any wildlife that we have not already seen. The most difficult species is likely to be the Javan slow loris and we will most likely head to Garot or another location to search for this species. Whatever our exact location and plan for today we will spend the whole day and once again go spotlighting looking for wildlife with our meals prepared at the campsite. (Breakfast and dinner are included today)."
