      "description": "Pungu Island - Kukusan - Gado - Warloka - Kaaba (B,L,D) This morning starts again with the option for an early morning snorkel just off the beach of Pungu Island before breakfast back on the support boat - always a great way to start the day! Your first paddle of the day will either take you to Kukusan Island or Rinca Village and if school is in, at these villages, you will pay a visit to the students before exploring life on the island. The next leg of kayaking is to Gado - with its’ wonderful mangroves and some amazing snorkelling in a spot with giant table corals, plenty of fish and turtles, who hopefully swim by to say hello. After lunch and some more snorkelling you will either paddle or travel on the support boat to a small mangrove island (Kaaba), which is inhabited by bats. This is a wonderful sight enjoyed from our top deck - watching thousands of bats flying into the night sky for their evening meal. Overnight in cabin on support boat in the park. Kayak 7.2km & 9km by boat (approximately)"

      "description": "Rinca - Manta Point - Sebayor Kecil (B,L,D) Early morning you will rise and boat to the Rinca Ranger’s Office to look for Komodo Dragons. Rinca (pronounced Rin - cha) is the best place in the park to see the Dragons as their numbers and density are larger here than Komodo Island. You will be shown around the Park by a trained Ranger who will explain the eco-system, the Dragon's habits and the life of other inhabitants on the island such as the Macaque, Buffalo, Deer, Tree snakes etc. After your trek and a drink at the Ranger's Cafe' you will start heading west on the support boat to Manta Point. One of the highlights of this trip is snorkelling with the manta rays at Manta Point and hopefully, these gracious animals will delight you with their presence. After lunch, you will then start paddling towards Sebayor Kecil for your last beach camp of the expedition. Sebayor Kecil has a beautiful beach with some great coral reefs and fish population so a spot of snorkelling in the late afternoon or early the next morning is certainly encouraged. Overnight in Safari style tents. Kayak 10 km and 9km by boat (approximately)."
