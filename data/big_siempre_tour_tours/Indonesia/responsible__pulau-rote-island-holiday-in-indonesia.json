  "generalInfo": "The Rote-Ndao Regency is home to Indonesia’s – and Asia’s – southernmost islands. Part of the Lesser Sunda chain, they sit just 500 kilometres across the Timor Sea from Australia. At its heart lies Pulau Rote, the largest island, shaped like a slender shard of limestone and fringed with powdery white sand, clear turquoise waters, and world-class surf breaks. <br/><br/>This 6-day itinerary is designed to showcase Pulau Rote's relaxed lifestyle; where the unhurried pace and warmth of the locals makes it feel as though you’ve stepped back in time. <br/><br/>One of the highlights of this trip is setting across the Savu Sea to Ndao Island, where you will troll for Spanish mackerel, trevally, marlin and more in some of Indonesia's richest and least-fished waters. <br/><br/>Still largely untouched by tourism, Rote offers a rare tropical escape where adventure and tranquillity go hand in hand. It’s a small slice of paradise, ready to be discovered.",

      "description": "Arrive in Pulau Rote & Transfer to Seed Resort in Nemberala - A short 30-minute flight from Kupang, the capital of East Nusa Tenggara, brings you to the tranquil island of Rote. Here you’ll be met by your English-speaking guide and transferred in air-conditioned comfort to your hotel. For an energising escape, Seed Resort in Nemberala sits right on the doorstep of Rote’s legendary surf breaks – a dream for experienced surfers. If a gentler pace calls to you, join one of the resort’s Yoga or Pilates classes in the open-air traditional shala, or indulge in a soothing massage in the dedicated treatment room. Just steps from your villa, a stretch of powdery white sand meets crystal-clear turquoise water. The saltwater infinity pool and palm-dotted sun deck offer the ideal place to soak up the island’s beauty, sip a cool cocktail, and watch the sun sink into the horizon in a blaze of colour."

      "description": "Private Surf Lesson - Fuel up for the day ahead with a hearty breakfast at the restaurant, or take advantage of the all-day breakfast and eat when it suits you. The kitchen at Seed Resort is all about fresh, healthy flavours, with ingredients sourced from the island itself. Coconuts are harvested on site, herbs and vegetables are grown in the resort’s own rainwater-fed garden, and every plant is nurtured without chemicals to keep everything natural and organic. Sustainability runs through everything here. Plastic use is kept to a minimum, solar power provides much of the resort’s energy, and organic waste is composted to feed the gardens. Even the saltwater infinity pool overlooking the beach runs entirely on solar. Villas are crafted from recycled wood, and every detail is designed to leave the lightest possible footprint. Rote remains off the radar for most travellers, but among surfers it has legendary status – often hailed as the world’s second-best surf destination after Hawaii. Today is your chance to see why. With your private instructor by your side, you’ll take a short boat ride to the breaks and learn to read, paddle, and ride the waves that roll endlessly over the reef. The water is warm, the scenery is spectacular, and the thrill of catching your first Rote wave will stay with you long after you’ve left this hidden paradise."

      "description": "Rote Ndau Island Hopping with Fishing & Snorkelling - After breakfast, set out to explore some of the smaller islands scattered around Pulau Rote. Your day begins aboard a comfortable fibreglass boat with a shaded roof, waiting just in front of the resort. Stocked with life jackets, towels, a picnic lunch, chilled drinks, and everything you need for fishing and snorkelling, it’s your ticket to another unforgettable day in this remote island paradise. Cross the Savu Sea, skimming over 15 kilometres of open water towards Ndao Island, which, together with Rote, gives the regency its name. Leave early and your chances of reeling in a big catch for dinner are even better. These waters are among the richest in Indonesia, thanks to the near absence of commercial fishing. As you go, your lines will be trolling for Spanish mackerel, giant and bluefin trevally, barracuda, dogtooth and yellowfin tuna, marlin, and more. On arrival at Ndao, dive straight from the boat into impossibly blue water lapping at blinding white sand. The colours are so vivid they almost don’t look real. Stretch out on the beach and you’ll soon understand why the shores of Rote Ndao are considered some of the most beautiful in all of Asia. From here, cruise onwards to neighbouring Do’o – an uninhabited, oval-shaped coral island ringed by a turquoise lagoon and lush with pandanus trees, coconut palms, and low tropical bush. Slip into the water with your snorkel to discover a kaleidoscope of reef fish, living seashells, flashes of fluorescent coral, and perhaps even an octopus, lobster, or gliding manta ray. Enjoy your freshly prepared lunch on the soft sand, soaking up the silence. Spending a little extra time on Do’o feels like having your own private desert island – until it’s time to cruise back across the water to your hotel."

      "description": "Rote's Mangroves, Beaches, Lagoons & Villages - Today is all about uncovering some of Rote Island’s most unforgettable highlights. This remote corner of Indonesia is a land of deserted white-sand beaches, tangled mangroves, untouched coral reefs, rich marine life, and world-class waves. Scattered offshore are uninhabited islets, while inland you’ll find a pace of life that feels wonderfully unchanged. The Rotenese people are warm and welcoming, their lives rooted in Christian traditions, farming, fishing, and seaweed cultivation for cosmetics. Lontar palms dot the landscape, and it’s not unusual to see pigs, goats, and cows wandering freely along the roadside. Food here is as local as it gets – fruit and vegetables come from the island’s small farms, while fish and meat are often bought straight from the fishermen. Your adventure begins paddling through one of Rote’s most remarkable ecosystems – its mangrove forests. Glide your kayak along glassy waterways beneath the dense canopy, listening to the calls of birds and the rustle of wildlife in this rarely visited sanctuary. Heading south, the road winds through timeless countryside, past simple villages and rolling fields where life moves to the rhythm of the land and sea. In Oeseli, you’ll swap your car for a small motorised wooden boat, crossing the bay into a narrow channel of clear turquoise water. Mangroves and lush tropical forest line the way, leading you to a hidden saltwater lagoon of extraordinary beauty. Known locally as Lake Nirvana, it’s a serene spot for a swim or a short climb to a lookout where the view is picture-perfect. After soaking up the moment, cruise back to shore and return to your hotel, with the afternoon free to relax or explore at your own pace."

      "description": "Private Surf Lesson - Surfing remains the heartbeat of Rote Island. With breaks ranging from gentle rollers for beginners to powerful swells that challenge seasoned pros, the island’s coastline has been drawing surfers for over 30 years. After Sumatra, it’s the most popular surfing destination in the Indonesian archipelago. The prime surfing season runs from April to November, when the trade winds deliver consistent, high-quality waves across Rote and its neighbouring islands. The star of the show is Nemberala, right in front of your hotel, where a world-class left-hander offers long, satisfying rides. On smaller days it’s a friendly, forgiving wave, but when the swell picks up it transforms into something far more powerful. Today brings another chance to sharpen your skills, with your expert surf instructor on hand to guide and encourage you every step of the way. By the afternoon, sun-kissed and salt-crusted, you can slow things down. Stretch out by the pool, sip something cold, or wander further to uncover more of Rote’s rare, unspoilt beauty – a treasure in a fast-changing world."
