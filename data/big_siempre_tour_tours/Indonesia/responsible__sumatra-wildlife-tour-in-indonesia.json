  "generalInfo": "Sumatra is one of the world’s biggest islands and easily the best island in the  Indonesian archipelago to see large numbers of mammals. Sumatra contains some of the largest areas of forest remaining in Indonesia and during this tour you will be taken to explore two of the most important. <br/><br/>Starting in the large mountainous and rich forests of the north and in particular Gunung Leuser. The only place in world where Elephants, Orangutans, Rhinos and Tigers all live. From here you will head towards the southern tip of the island and to the lowland forest reserve of Way Kambas. In Way Kambas we will combine daytime wildlife watching as well as spotlighting for a range of nocturnal wildlife including clouded leopards, various civets and maybe even sun bears, all of which are known from here in addition to saimangs, langurs, tigers, tapirs, elephants and critically endangered Sumatran rhinos.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife tours which focus on some of the world’s rarest wildlife. These trips are specialist and are run more like expeditions than your conventional wildlife holiday. <br/><br/>This particular trip heads to the Indonesian island of Sumatra and is the first and only dedicated mammal watching tour of Sumatra. Most people will know about the orangutans of Sumatra and the various elephant rescue centres which are fantastic but it is the wealth of wildlife in the forests here which will be our major focus throughout the trip. <br/><br/>From hiking the steep, dense and wonderful forests of Gunung Leuser in search of orangutans to cruising along the Way Kanan river in Way Kambas checking the river banks for signs of wildlife including the incredibly rare Sumatran rhino. This is a unique wildlife watching tour of one of the best wildlife watching destinations in the world.<br/><br/>Throughout the trip you will be guided by local park rangers and a local naturalist guide, and people with an intimate knowledge of the wildlife and habitats you will be visiting. This is a ground breaking tour that is unique in the world, we have negotiated special rates for the scientific permits that are needed to access the core area of the forest. For anyone who wants a chance of seeing this incredibly rare species you have to get in touch with us and we can provide more information about our group tour.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned. There will be boiled or bottled water available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, but can be hired if you wish - you need to contact us for availability) who would escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable local rangers who have many years of experience working and guiding in Sumatra. Your naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local rangers have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit in order to maximise our chances of seeing all of our targeted species. We also include all park entrance fees and the special permits needed to enter the core area of the park. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide). We will also bring thermal imaging equipment to help us find wildlife after dark and go spotlighting as often as the local conditions allow.<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>There are two drier parts of the year when visiting Sumatra for wildlife, the first being December - April and the second being June - September. However rain is expected in nearly every moth of year. so There is no real bad time visit.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local rangers, drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it. The main wildlife activities on this trip will be early morning and evening trips intoo the forests as well as spotlighting after dark (in Way Kambas) looking for nocturnal wildlife.<br/>• We will bring some specialist equipment with us to help us find wildlife, including thermal imaging equipment which help find nocturnal mammals.<br/>• Spend as much time as you wish to looking for wildlife throughout the day, with special focus in the early morning and late afternoon as these are the peak activity periods for many mammals - we will also head out after dark for spotlighting at every possible opportunity as many mammals are nocturnal.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our expedition for the wildlife of Sumatra a great success rate in seeing many unique species. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Indonesia so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the Sumatran orangutans, Siamang, Sunda leopard cat and banded civets and other endemics on the island as well as many more species throughout the rest of the Indonesian archipelago. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Indonesia at other times of year and focusing on other species such as Javan rhinos, babirusa, cuscus, komodo dragons, birds of paradise and many incredible species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour explores two very different forests in Sumatra. One in the north (Gunung Leuser) and one in the south (Way Kambas). We will arrive and depart from Jakarta.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>Whilst most of this trip is done with hiking in the forests you will need to be used to hiking. The terrain in Gunung Leuser can be very steep in places as the park is mountainous.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 Years Old",

      "description": "Jakarta - Arrival On your arrival in Jakarta you will meet your local guide and be taken to your accommodation. There are no scheduled plans for today. If you arrange your flight to arrive early enough it may be possible to get to northern Sumatra today. However we like to spend the first day here so you can rest and recover from the long journey.

      "description": "Gunung Leuser National Park - Travelling & Wildlife Watching This morning you will leave your hotel and be taken to the airport to catch your flight to the north east of Sumatra. Once we arrive in Medan you will be met by a local driver and transferred inland towards the forests of Gunung Leuser National Park (4.5 hours). Gunung Leuser National Park is a mountainous area of protected forest that is home to the largest population of wild Sumatran orangutans remaining in the world. Over the next 2.5 days we will explore the park and hope to come across some of these orangutans. We have a great chance as the Ketambe Research Station was set up in 1971 (which in 1973 led to the establishment of Bohorok Orangutan Centre) to specifically help protect, rehabilitate and research orangutan. This has lead to numerous orangutans being re-wilded and reintroduced to the forest, for newly introduced individuals food is left on platforms to help supplement their diet. The forest is also home to Sumatran rhinos, Sumatran tigers, Asiatic elephants, Sumatran serow, Sunda leopard cats, saimangs and sambar deer however most of these species are very elusive here. We will however have a good chance of seeing orangutans, Thomas’s langur, white-handed gibbons among other mammals, birds, reptiles and insects. This morning we will be driven to our accommodation in the village of Bukit Lawang after flying into Medan. After settling into the lodge we will have some lunch, either here or at one of the restaurants in the village. In the afternoon you will have your first guided walk through some of the forest here, the mornings are best for orangutans but you may see other primates and many species of birds in the afternoon. (breakfast and dinner included today)."

      "description": "Jakarta - Travelling Despite being on the same island there are no direct flights from Medan to Bandar Lampung in the south. So today we will have to depart from Gunung Leuser early and catch a flight back to the capital Jakarta. As we cannot guarantee the traffic we will have the night here and then head back to Sumatra tomorrow. On arrival back in Jakarta you will be taken back to the hotel nearby the airport and the rest of the day is free for you to rest. (breakfast is the only meal included today)."

      "description": "Way Kambas National Park - Travelling & Wildlife Watching This morning we will leave the airport and catch your flight to Bandar Lampung in southern Sumatra. We will then be met by a local driver and transported to the accommodation near the park (3-4 hours). Once we arrive at the lodge we will check in and if time allows we will have an afternoon / evening jeep drive. The lodge is located on the outskirts of the Way Kambas National Park that is home to many species of mammals and birds that are on the brink of extinction and this protected forest (1,300km2) is the last stronghold of many, including the Sumatran tiger, Sumatran rhino and Malayan tapir. If we have time to head out this afternoon / evening we will most likely head along the jeep track that connects the lodge to the Rhino Centre, Elephant Sanctuary and Way Batin Bridge. Along the various sections of this road many of the areas rare and elusive mammals and nocturnal birds can be seen. (breakfast and dinner included today)."
