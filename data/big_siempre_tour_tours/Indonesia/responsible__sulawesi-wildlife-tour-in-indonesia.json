  "generalInfo": "Explore the little known and seldom visited forests of Sulawesi in Indonesia. This large island is a mix of wildlife from Asia and Australasia, a land made famous by Alfred Wallace and his exploration of the Indonesian archipelago the island is home to a wealth of endemic wildlife and some of the most unusual species in the world.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife tours which focus on some of the world’s rarest wildlife. These trips are specialist and are run more like expeditions than your conventional wildlife holiday. <br/><br/>This particular trip heads to Sulawesi and a variety of different forests here, it is the first and only dedicated mammal watching tour of Sulawesi. Most people who visit here are looking for birds or come to see the wonderful and iconic Black-crested Macaques. But no one dedicates two weeks to seeking out the wealth of endemic mammals here; that was until we established this unique wildlife tour.. <br/><br/>From the muddy salt licks of Nantu forest where the stunning babirusa and very rare lowland anoa can be seen, to the black sand beaches of Tangkoko which are home to black-crested macaques and the nighttime forests where various species of tarsier jump from branch to branch looking for insects, the country has so many species of mammals and all of them are our specialist targets.<br/><br/>Throughout the trip you will be guided by local park rangers and a zoologist guide (where available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us), and people with an intimate knowledge of the wildlife and habitats you will be visiting. This is a ground breaking tour that is unique in the world, we have negotiated special rates for the scientific permits that are needed to access the core area of the forest. For anyone who wants a chance of seeing this incredibly rare species you have to get in touch with us and we can provide more information about our group tour.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned. There will be boiled or bottled water available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable local rangers who have many years of experience working and guiding in Sulawesi. Your naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local rangers have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit in order to maximise our chances of seeing all of our targeted species. We also include all park entrance fees and the special permits needed to enter the core area of the park. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us). We will also bring thermal imaging equipment to help us find wildlife after dark and go spotlighting as often as the local conditions allow.<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>The best season for looking for mammals in Sulawesi is the dry season (June – mid September) and subject to availability the trip can be booked any time in this period. But we recommend the above mentioned dates.  <br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local rangers, drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it. The main wildlife activities on this trip will be early morning and evening canoe trips up and down a commonly used river by rhinos. We will also have a hide where we can set this up nearby a mud wallow or along a trail and see if a rhino comes by.<br/>• We will bring some specialist equipment with us to help us find wildlife, including thermal imaging equipment which help find nocturnal mammals.<br/>• Spend as much time as you wish to looking for wildlife throughout the day, with special focus in the early morning and late afternoon as these are the peak activity periods for many mammals - we will also head out after dark for spotlighting at every possible opportunity as many mammals are nocturnal.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our expedition for the endemic mammals of Sulawesi a great success rate in seeing many unique species. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Indonesia so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the babirusa, cuscuses and tarsiers and other endemics on the island as well as many more species throughout the rest of the Indonesian archipelago. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Indonesia at other times of year and focusing on other species such as orangutans, gibbons, clouded leopards, Javan rhinos, komodo dragons, birds of paradise and many incredible species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour explores many different forests in northern, central and southern Sulawesi, including Tangkoko, Nantu, Dumoga Bone, Karaenta and Lore Lindu. We will arrive into Manado and then leave from Palu.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>Whilst most of this trip is done with hiking in the forests you will need to be used to hiking. However the terrain is largely flat and not too difficult to walk. <br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 Years Old",
