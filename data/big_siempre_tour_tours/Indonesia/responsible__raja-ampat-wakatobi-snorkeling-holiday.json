  "generalInfo": "Arguably two of Indonesia’s finest snorkeling destinations combined into one complete tour, our Misool &amp; Wakatobi Safari is a once-in-a-lifetime experience spread over 18 full days of adventure. We’ll be based out of Misool Resort in the very south of Raja Ampat and later in Wakatobi Resort in the Wakatobi National Park just off of Sulawesi. Both locations offer something different in terms of the snorkeling experience. Our time in Raja Ampat will be spent surrounded by large schools of fish, good possibilities of manta ray encounters, and densely packed soft coral reefs that rise to the surface. In Wakatobi we can expect great visibility with endless coral reefs that play host to a huge range of reef creatures. The main differences between the locations is the topography and reef structure but also in the makeup and variety of the reefs themselves.<br/><br/>Misool Resort is a paradise brimming with pristine coral reefs and more exotic marine species than you possibly count in a single trip. The resort is exceptionally comfortable given its remote location. Because of the amazing conservation efforts taken on by the resort, the surrounding waters are extremely densely populated. This can be witnessed on the doorsteps of the resort with its abundant house reef and naturally occurring black tip reef shark nursery.<br/><br/>Wakatobi Resort is situated at the geographical center of the Coral Triangle, the most marine bio-diverse environment in the world.  Wakatobi in particular is recognized as having the highest number of coral and fish species found anywhere on the planet and has a truly amazing house reef, which one can easily explore from the resort's pier. The islands and reefs in the Wakatobi National Park have been preserved from the negative effects of large-scale tourism as the area is only accessible by a private charter flight and liveaboard boats.<br/><br/>While both these areas can have some current, which brings in the nutrient-rich water that helps keep the reef alive and healthy, our local guides will choose protected sites, or appropriate times to enter the water to avoid being in current. If we are ever in a current, we will always drift with the water and not try to swim against it. You should be comfortable in the water with some upper body strength to climb back up the ladder onto the boat.",

      "description": "Upon arrival into Sorong, we will be met by Misool staff and transferred to the pier where we will board our very spacious boat to Misool. The boat ride can take 4+ hours, but we have food and beverages on the boat, as well as a large restroom and plenty of indoor and outdoor space to relax. Upon arrival at the resort we will check in to our bungalows, have lunch and an orientation, and then snorkel on the house reef, before dinner. Meals at Misool are served in the beautiful outdoor restaurant set over the water, with stunning views of the North Lagoon. Breakfast and lunch are served buffet style, while dinner is plated and served. Tea is served mid-afternoon when baked goods, savory, and sweet are served. The resort has a hydroponics lab and grows much of the ingredients we will eat right there. Other products are sourced from nearby local villages. Special dietary requirements can be accommodated with advance notice."

      "description": "Our days here will start with a delicious buffet breakfast, followed by a snorkel trip on the boat. Most the snorkel sites are between 10 and 30 minutes from the resort. We will then return back to the resort for a big buffet lunch and some downtime, before heading back out to another site. Each snorkel session will last between 60 - 90 minutes. We will always have boat support so you can take a break back on the boat if you wish. Local snorkel guides will be with us in the water and available to point out interesting creatures we may encounter. We will also have plenty of opportunities to snorkel the expansive and healthy house reef, arguably one of the best in the world. Also highly recommended is a night snorkel or two- the reef completely transforms at night when the nocturnal creatures come out to hunt, including eels, sharks, cuttlefish, octopus, squid, crabs, shrimps.... the list is long. Evenings, when not snorkeling, can be enjoyed at the bar with a soft drink or beer, looking at fish ID books or photos and reminiscing about all the fabulous things encountered each day."

The Griya Santrian Resort will be our home base for the couple of days we spend in Sanur. That first afternoon you are welcome to relax by the pool or enjoy the spa facilities, or walk around the beach, shops, and restaurants.

Here too we will have boat support and in-water local snorkel guides. We return to the resort for a delicious buffet lunch and a bit of downtime before our afternoon snorkel session. Some days we may do two morning sessions by boat and a scheduled house reef snorkel as not to miss anything on the awesome reef."
