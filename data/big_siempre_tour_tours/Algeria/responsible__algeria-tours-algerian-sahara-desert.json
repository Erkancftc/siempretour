  "generalInfo": "A magical and memorable adventure into landscapes like no other, this Algerian Sahara Desert tour explores some of the most spectacular locations around Tassili n’Ajjer National Park. Over two weeks you’ll admire ancient rock carvings, camp among vast seas of sand dunes, and enjoy spontaneous, completely authentic encounters with nomadic Tuareg people you meet along the way.<br/><br/>Keen photographers will love travelling through this stunning region, dotted with surreal rock formations carved by millennia of erosion. Getting around by hardy 4x4 vehicles, there will be many opportunities to pause and admire the views over sand dunes and the rims of deep canyons.<br/><br/>Of course, the Sahara Desert has a long history of human settlement, and there are countless petroglyphs to be seen on cave walls that depict the lives of communities from long ago. Their descendants continue to thrive in this harsh environment and during this tour you may well encounter nomadic Tuareg people on the road. These meetings cannot be pre-planned, but they can often result in an invitation to take tea. <br/><br/>It goes without saying that spending two weeks in these remote areas comes with a degree of challenge. You’ll be camping every night, and having to do without many comforts, with hot, dusty drives every day. But it’s so worth it, to see these enigmatic and beautiful landscapes illuminated by a canvas of stars every night, and open your tent zip on them at sunrise every morning. Very few others make this journey, but those that do never forget it. <br/>",
