    "generalInfo": "Ever since Stanley emerged from the jungle on his epic trek across the continent, the Congo has held a place in western imaginations as Africa’s ‘dark heart’, a land of thick rainforest, surging rivers and isolated hostile tribes. The undisputed giant of Africa, the Democratic Republic of Congo is undoubtedly one of the most challenging countries to travel through, yet those that make the step will be rewarded with some of the most incredible experiences the continent can offer. We combine the DRC with its tiny neighbours Rwanda and Burundi, for a comprehensive trip through the region.<br/><br/>Starting in the Rwandan capital Kigali, we head first to the little visited Akagera National Park, home to the Big Five and a Rwanda success story, where we look for lion, elephant and other species. Heading west from here, we drive to the forests of Nyungwe, one of the premier spots in Africa for primates, where we explore its canopy walkway and track wild chimpanzees.<br/><br/>We then cross the border into the Congo, where in the forests of Kahuzi-Biega we trek to meet a family of rare eastern lowland gorillas, the largest of all the ape species. We spend time with pygmy communities on the idyllic island of Idjwi, and meet local fishermen on Lake Kivu.<br/><br/>Our final country is Burundi, where we explore the lively capital, see traditional Burundian drummers, and discover the lush wetlands of Rusizi National Park.<br/><br/>This two week trip shows you the best of this region’s natural world, as well as giving ample opportunity to meet and interact with local people, gaining insights into their often challenging lives. This area is all too often portrayed as Africa’s ‘heart of darkness’ – we show you another side to this much misunderstood part of Africa.",
