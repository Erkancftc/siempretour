  "generalInfo": "This unique island is one of the least visited and photographed places between Africa, Arabian peninsula and South Asia. It is located in the Arabian ocean, south of Yemen and Oman, east of Somalia (the closest landmass). Politically it belongs to Yemen but luckily it has avoided all the turmoil of the mainland. The population of the island is only 50 thousand and the only city on the island is the capital Hadiboh. Most of the population is Muslim and Arabic speaking. The island is most famous for its endemic flora such as dragon blood trees or bottle trees. <br/><br/>This is a unique small group photo tour led by two pro photographers who extensively scouted Socotra for this opportunity. We will travel to the island from Dubai, avoiding mainland for safety reasons. For the whole tour, everything is included, meals, transport, guides, accommodation. This trip is not for comfort creatures though. We will be camping at our photography locations, enjoying the best light and nature. We will be hiking in untouched wilderness and photograph the best the island has to offer. <br/><br/>Socotra is also a very diverse island and every photographer can get what they are interested in. Mountainscapes, sand dunes, seascapes, forests, snorkelling, traditional villages and fish markets, astrophotography. Your photography leaders will always be around to offer helpful advice and teach you new techniques on location. <br/><br/>Join us on this once-in-a-lifetime adventure and come back home with incredible portfolio of photos!",
