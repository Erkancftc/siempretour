    "generalInfo": "Taking a nine day cultural tour of South Sudan invites travellers to step into a traditional tribal world amongst the ethnic groups that have inhabited the region’s wilderness areas for as long as anyone can remember. <br/><br/>This is an intensely personal tour of one of the world’s lesser-known, yet newest, countries where ancient cultural rituals collide with preconceived traveller expectations, to create an incredibly unique and often moving experience.<br/><br/>Our South Sudan cultural tour starts in Juba, the capital, before heading into the heartland of the Mundari people whose tribal scars and competitive displays of inter-village wrestling have made them revered throughout the region.<br/><br/>A chance to then head east and visit the Toposas people offers further insight into the cultural comparisons of South Sudan where you’ll discover Kenyan and Ethiopian influences displayed within decorative and incredibly elaborate facial and body scarring.<br/><br/>The chance to meet tribal elders and compare life in other tribal groups, such as the Boya and Lotuko, ensures this South Sudan cultural tour sheds light on an area of Africa that’s way off the tourist track with a lack of infrastructure increasing excitement levels as well as opening eyes to what is deemed to be part of every day life.<br/>",
