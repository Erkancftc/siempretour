  "generalInfo": "Embark on an extraordinary Arctic expedition from Iceland to Scoresby Sund, the world’s largest fjord system and one of the most remote corners of the planet. This is far more than a sailing trip—it’s a pioneering mission into uncharted waters. Following in the footsteps of Amdrup, the legendary explorer who first mapped these regions, we will continue his work by creating new bathymetric charts of Greenland’s wild coastline, where depths remain scarcely surveyed since 1932. You won’t just feel like an explorer—you will be one.<br/><br/>Our yacht becomes your floating base as we cross the Denmark Strait and enter the icy labyrinth of Scoresby Sund. Sailing here is a challenge like no other: unpredictable Arctic winds, drifting icebergs, and narrow fjords demand skill, teamwork, and determination. Under the guidance of an experienced skipper, you’ll learn advanced navigation techniques, steer through ice-strewn waters, and discover what it means to sail in one of the most demanding environments on Earth. For those eager to deepen their knowledge, we offer hands-on sailing workshops—because nothing compares to learning in the shadow of towering glaciers.<br/><br/>Beyond sailing, this journey takes you ashore into untouched wilderness. Every landing opens a new world: vast tundra, rugged mountains, and valleys carved by ancient ice. Guided treks lead to panoramic viewpoints where silence reigns, broken only by the cry of seabirds or the distant rumble of calving glaciers. These hikes are accessible yet rewarding, offering unforgettable encounters with Arctic wildlife—musk oxen grazing on the tundra, Arctic foxes darting across rocky slopes, and seabirds nesting on sheer cliffs.<br/><br/>We’ll visit Ittoqqortoormiit, one of the most isolated settlements on Earth, for a rare glimpse into Inuit traditions before continuing along Greenland’s truly wild coast. Here, the charts are blank, and the depths unknown. Equipped with modern instruments, we’ll map anchorages and fjords, contributing vital data for future explorers. This is real exploration—work that matters.<br/><br/>And then comes the highlight: a total solar eclipse witnessed from one of the most remote places on the planet. Imagine standing on deck as day fades to twilight under the Arctic sky—a once-in-a-lifetime experience that will stay with you forever.<br/><br/>Life on board blends comfort and camaraderie. After a day of sailing and trekking, relax on deck with a hot drink, share stories with fellow adventurers, and plan the next day’s discoveries. Evenings bring laughter, learning, and the unique bond that forms when you sail together through the world’s last great wilderness.<br/><br/>This is more than a voyage; it’s a journey into silence, light, and pure nature. Scoresby Sund offers landscapes few will ever witness, and we know the best spots to experience them safely. Ready to make history? Join us and sail beyond imagination.",

      "description": "Embarkation in Bolungarvík, Iceland Arrive in the picturesque fishing village of Bolungarvík, nestled at the edge of Iceland’s dramatic Westfjords. Here, you’ll meet your expedition team and fellow adventurers. After a warm welcome and safety briefing, we’ll board our yacht—your home for the coming days. Take time to settle in, explore the vessel, and enjoy the stunning views of steep mountains plunging into the sea. In the evening, we’ll share dinner on board and review the route ahead, preparing for the crossing to Greenland. The adventure begins!"

      "description": "Crossing the Denmark Strait We leave the shelter of Iceland’s fjords and set a course across the Denmark Strait toward Greenland. At this time of year, conditions are expected to be relatively gentle, making for a smooth passage. For the solar eclipse voyage, we’ll take the shortest route north, heading directly toward the heart of Scoresby Sund. On other expeditions, our plan is different: first, we aim to reach Ittoqqortoormiit, one of the most isolated settlements on Earth, before turning to sail with the wind and current along Greenland’s unknown coast. Whichever route we take, this day is all about open-water sailing, learning navigation skills, and feeling the thrill of the Arctic Ocean beneath our keel."

      "description": "Into Amdrup’s Footsteps As we sail deeper into Scoresby Sund, the wilderness feels absolute—no signs of human presence, except for one: Amdrup’s hut. This modest shelter stands as a silent tribute to Vice Admiral Georg Carl Amdrup, a Danish naval officer and explorer whose courage shaped Arctic history. In 1884, Amdrup reached Amassalik, overwintered, and then ventured north to chart unknown coasts, including Kangerlussuaq Fjord, previously known only through Inuit stories. By July 1885, he had mapped vast stretches of shoreline, collected geological and ethnological treasures, and reached Aggas Island at 67°22’ N—the northernmost point of his journey. Later, he explored Greenland’s least-known coast, the very waters we sail today. Standing here, you’ll feel the weight of history and the thrill of continuing a legacy of true exploration."

      "description": "Ittoqqortoormiit: Life at the Edge of the World These days we reach the only inhabited place on our route—Ittoqqortoormiit, the northernmost permanent settlement in the world. Home to just a few hundred people, this remote village offers a rare glimpse into life in one of Earth’s most isolated regions. Here, Inuit traditions endure against the backdrop of Greenland’s vast wilderness. We’ll step ashore to explore the settlement, meet locals, and learn about their culture and resilience in an environment where survival depends on knowledge passed down through generations. After this unique cultural encounter, we set sail again, leaving the last sign of human presence behind as we venture deeper into untouched fjords."

      "description": "Dunholm, Deichmann Fjord & Turner Sund: Glaciers and Exploration We venture deeper into the fjord system, reaching Dunholm and the spectacular Deichmann Fjord before continuing into Turner Sund. Here, the Arctic reveals its raw beauty—towering glaciers, sheer cliffs, and valleys carved by ancient ice. This is the day for our first longer treks: guided hikes lead to panoramic viewpoints overlooking vast ice fields and glacial tongues descending into the sea. On the water, our “Superdinghy” becomes an essential tool for exploration as we conduct depth soundings and gather data for new bathymetric charts. Every landing and every measurement brings us closer to understanding these uncharted waters. In the evening, we anchor in a remote bay surrounded by silence and ice, sharing stories of discovery under the endless Arctic sky."

      "description": "Storbræ Glacier near d’Aunay Bugt Today we sail toward d’Aunay Bugt, where the immense Storbræ Glacier dominates the horizon. This colossal river of ice constantly calves enormous icebergs into the fjord, creating a dramatic and ever-changing seascape. We’ll approach as close as safety allows to witness the raw power of the Arctic, listening to the thunder of ice breaking away. Time is precious, and we likely won’t venture farther east—this glacier is the highlight. Depending on conditions, we may land for a short trek to viewpoints overlooking the ice front, or continue our bathymetric surveys from the yacht and “Superdinghy.” Evening brings a sense of awe as we anchor amid drifting ice, surrounded by silence and the glow of Arctic light."

      "description": "rossing the Denmark Strait (Return) After days of exploration among fjords and glaciers, it’s time to turn west and begin our return voyage across the Denmark Strait. The open ocean awaits once more, but now you sail as a seasoned Arctic explorer. Conditions at this time of year are usually favorable, yet the passage remains a true test of seamanship. We’ll set watches, trim sails, and navigate toward Iceland, sharing stories of the adventures behind us. With luck, whales and seabirds will accompany us on the crossing. As Greenland’s rugged coast fades into the distance, the sense of accomplishment grows—you’ve sailed one of the most remote and challenging routes on Earth."
