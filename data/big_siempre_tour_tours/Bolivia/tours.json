If night is clear we will see dark constellations as observed by ancient cultures that inhabited the region and learn about the Aymara beliefs (B, L, D). OR DIFFERENTLY if you are coming during the Wet season: Dec-March, the Uyuni Salt Flat is usually flooded, and crossing is forbidden due to travel safety. We will do our best to take you at specific locations in the salt flat margins where you can enjoy impressive water reflections and picture sunset and sunrises that make this place one the best for nature experiences, and also walk some distance in shallow waters. At this time of the year Uyuni is also spectacular for nature photography as well as for gazing up the mysterious night sky."

Our experience takes us to a mining market, where vendors sell dynamite and chemical products used in the extraction process. Then, we visit an ingenio, a factory in which minerals are extracted, separated and processed. Finally, we see an active mine to learn how the workers get in and out (though we’re not allowed in there ourselves!).

Prepare your camera - the dazzling white mantle of the Uyuni Salt Flat (or Thunhupha) resembles an immense glacier. In the winter (dry season, from May to October), when the surface hardens, geometrical formations start appearing formed by salt particles conglomerating into polygons. In summer (rainy season, November to February), the saline desert transforms into a gigantic mirror that melts into the purest sky in America. We come onto the salt flat through Colchani and its salt factories. We visit one of these and receive an explanation from one of the resident family about the economy of the salt industry which governs the life of the people here, and who have organised a co-operative organization. We then visit the salt plains - where the mounds of salt are collected. After the visit, we head towards Incahuasi Island. The tourist centre here has a path, which we climb, to the summit, from where we get a great 360 view. We'll have a box lunch at the island and then head toward the dominant Volcano Thunupa and the Chantani Museum. The museum features stone that resemble animals and mummies from the old burials in these lands. We arrive at Tayka Salt Hotel, settle in, and then head off by car to the town of Chillguilla at north, where we'll start the climb to Pucara. We walk for 20 minutes, climbing to the impressive site of Pucara Chillima. It is an quiet corner of the Salt Flat and a spiritual spot thanks to the stone buildings which are more than thousand years old.

Here there are strange geological underwater formations, from de time of Lake Michin (300,000 years ago) and Lake Mauca (40, 000 years ago). Next we cross from north to south, the most beautiful part in the white desert, far from the usual route of the tourists. We head towards the bay of the Campanas Islands, dominated by Volcano Caltama. We leave the salt flat and head to Charagua, a pretty place of corrals and goat farmers. It will take us one hour, via a bumpy road, to reach the Burnt Town of San Pedro de Quemes, where we will leave the car to wander in its small streets and view the buildings which inspired the hotel Tayka of Stone. We have lunch in the Hotel of Stone (optional Llama Shepherding trip, spending an hour or so helping a shepherd or shepherdess with the llamas, a vital part of life in the Salar). In the afternoon we will head for the lagoons - Cañapa, Hedionda, Chiarkota, Honda and Ramaditas, full of flamingos happy to be photographed! Other birds, such as Andean gulls and ducks, accompany the flamingos in these lagoons, which are flanked by snow-capped volcanoes. Next we enter the deserts of sand and the range of terracottas: red, oranges, ochers, coffees and beige - every bend in the road offers more colours.

    "generalInfo": "Move over the northern Pantanal as we have a new contender for the best place in the world to see Jaguars and other (usually elusive) South American wildlife. The Bolivian wetlands and chaco forests are home to large numbers of jaguars, pumas, ocelots, tapirs, anteaters and many other species. <br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We have developed this unique cat specialist trip to Bolivia for anyone wanting to avoid the crowds in Brazil and enjoy spotting jaguars, pumas, ocelots and possible jaguarondis in the wonderful remote Bolivian pantanal. There is a huge range of wildlife found in Bolivia including endemic river dolphins, various armadillos, rare peccaries, endemic primates, as well as very rare and localised macaws and anacondas as well as many more on this unique Bolivian wildlife tour.<br/><br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife watching holidays that focus on one specific rare or elusive species of mammals. These trips are specialised in that they have a distinct focus, a species which is the overall target for the tour. But of course we are exploring the wonderful and diverse natural environment and many other species can also be seen. However this is the only specialist mammal tour focusing on the ecosystems of Bolivia.<br/><br/>This tour visits two particular areas for wildlife, including a private reserve in the Bolivian pantanal which is part of the same huge wetland ecosystem which spreads out into Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay. The private reserve offers the chance for some of the most spectacular wildlife watching in South America. The reserve encompasses the various ecosystems which make up the Pantanal, including grasslands, tropical forest, lakes and cattle ranching land all of which increases the density of divesity of life as well as making wildlife watching much easier than in thick forests and most other regions.<br/><br/>One of the major draw cards for Bolivia over Brazil is that very few people visit this region, in fact only a handful of guides are allowed to visit this private reserve and so on these trips we avoid the vast crowds of the Pantanal and we can observe wildlife in peace. <br/><br/>In the short time we have been running trips to this reserve we have an amazing 100% success rate for seeing Jaguars and we also have a very high success rate in seeing Ocelots, Lowland Tapirs, Pink Dolphins (endemic to Bolivia), Sloth, Anteaters, Marsh Deer and much more. But it is not just mammals which are spectacular here, the birding is phenomenal with over 270 species being recorded here. The larger more colourful species which can be found include various macaws, king vultures, spoonbills, toucans, sunbitterns and more.<br/><br/>The second place we visit on this trip is the internationally famous yet rarely visited Kaa Iya National Park in search of the elusive Jaguar, Tapir and Puma. We will explore this park in the morning, afternoon and during the night with spotlighting from our 4x4 vehicle. <br/><br/>This tour heads into the heart of the Bolivia Chaco which is a wonderfully diverse ecosystem. As well as safari drives and hikes we will be setting up and checking our camera traps to see what wildlife is around when we are not there to see. <br/><br/>All of this will be done with the expert guidance of local naturalist guides and where possible our own zoologist guides (where available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) also. All you have to do is to get in touch with your budget and your group size and where you would like to go and we will come back to you with an itinerary and quote for your perfect specialist Bolivian cat focused mammal watching tour.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Santa Cruz. There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers and safaris. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Bolivia. Your naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. We have to camp in the remote areas we visit and all camping equipment will be provided with the exception of sleeping bags or sleeping liners. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, guided walks, park entrance fees and permits. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the field. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>During September to October the weather in the Bolivian Pantanal and Chaco ecosystems is hot and dry (although it is the end of the dry season and the occassional early rain can occur). The temperatures during the day and night are hot and they heat up quickly in the morning. At this time of year the rainy season is approaching and whilst rain is rare at this time of year it is not unheard of for a tropical storm to blow in.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• Our local naturalist guides have their ears to the ground and are constantly scouting new areas for rare and unusual wildlife. So we know of all of the locations to visit and we have the adaptability to change our plan (if needed) to take advantage of better wildlife watching in other locations whilst on the trip.<br/>• We will stay in a variety of accommodation when on this tour, from hotels in Santa Cruz to camping and basic accommodation. <br/>• Spend all the daylight hours searching for wildlife as well as spotlighting as many mammal species are nocturnal.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our specialist mammal watching tours give us a great success rate of seeing our targeted species (as well as many others). We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Bolivia so that we can try and find and observe mammals and many more species. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Bolivia at other times of year and focusing on other groups of wildlife such as birds, reptiles &amp; amphibians or even botany as well as other groups of animals or even specific species such as jaguars, maned wolves, giant armadillos etc. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour focused on 2 particular locations, firstly the vast wetland ecosystem of the Pantanal as part of the private reserve and then the drier more scrub forest ecosystem of the Bolivian Chaco. <br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from a vehicle (4x4) but we also include hiking where needed to have a better chance of seeing wildlife. There is no particular high level of fitness required and so the trip requires no special hiking experience or a specific level of physical fitness. This is a very easy trip to undertake. <br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 15 Years Old<br/><br/>Pictures:<br/>WolfmanSF, CC BY 3.0",

    "tourName": "Bolivia wildlife holiday, jaguars and wild cats",
    "placesVisited": "",
    "generalInfo": "Move over the northern Pantanal as we have a new contender for the best place in the world to see Jaguars and other (usually elusive) South American wildlife. The Bolivian wetlands and chaco forests are home to large numbers of jaguars, pumas, ocelots, tapirs, anteaters and many other species. <br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We have developed this unique cat specialist trip to Bolivia for anyone wanting to avoid the crowds in Brazil and enjoy spotting jaguars, pumas, ocelots and possible jaguarondis in the wonderful remote Bolivian pantanal. There is a huge range of wildlife found in Bolivia including endemic river dolphins, various armadillos, rare peccaries, endemic primates, as well as very rare and localised macaws and anacondas as well as many more on this unique Bolivian wildlife tour.<br/><br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife watching holidays that focus on one specific rare or elusive species of mammals. These trips are specialised in that they have a distinct focus, a species which is the overall target for the tour. But of course we are exploring the wonderful and diverse natural environment and many other species can also be seen. However this is the only specialist mammal tour focusing on the ecosystems of Bolivia.<br/><br/>This tour visits two particular areas for wildlife, including a private reserve in the Bolivian pantanal which is part of the same huge wetland ecosystem which spreads out into Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay. The private reserve offers the chance for some of the most spectacular wildlife watching in South America. The reserve encompasses the various ecosystems which make up the Pantanal, including grasslands, tropical forest, lakes and cattle ranching land all of which increases the density of divesity of life as well as making wildlife watching much easier than in thick forests and most other regions.<br/><br/>One of the major draw cards for Bolivia over Brazil is that very few people visit this region, in fact only a handful of guides are allowed to visit this private reserve and so on these trips we avoid the vast crowds of the Pantanal and we can observe wildlife in peace. <br/><br/>In the short time we have been running trips to this reserve we have an amazing 100% success rate for seeing Jaguars and we also have a very high success rate in seeing Ocelots, Lowland Tapirs, Pink Dolphins (endemic to Bolivia), Sloth, Anteaters, Marsh Deer and much more. But it is not just mammals which are spectacular here, the birding is phenomenal with over 270 species being recorded here. The larger more colourful species which can be found include various macaws, king vultures, spoonbills, toucans, sunbitterns and more.<br/><br/>The second place we visit on this trip is the internationally famous yet rarely visited Kaa Iya National Park in search of the elusive Jaguar, Tapir and Puma. We will explore this park in the morning, afternoon and during the night with spotlighting from our 4x4 vehicle. <br/><br/>This tour heads into the heart of the Bolivia Chaco which is a wonderfully diverse ecosystem. As well as safari drives and hikes we will be setting up and checking our camera traps to see what wildlife is around when we are not there to see. <br/><br/>All of this will be done with the expert guidance of local naturalist guides and where possible our own zoologist guides (zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) and wildlife researchers also. All you have to do is to get in touch with your budget and your group size and where you would like to go and we will come back to you with an itinerary and quote for your perfect specialist Bolivian cat focused mammal watching tour.<br/><br/>Group Departure: 4-16 October 2023<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Santa Cruz. There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers and safaris. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Bolivia. Your naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. We have to camp in the remote areas we visit and all camping equipment will be provided with the exception of sleeping bags or sleeping liners. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, guided walks, park entrance fees and permits. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the field. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>During September to October the weather in the Bolivian Pantanal and Chaco ecosystems is hot and dry (although it is the end of the dry season and the occassional early rain can occur). The temperatures during the day and night are hot and they heat up quickly in the morning. At this time of year the rainy season is approaching and whilst rain is rare at this time of year it is not unheard of for a tropical storm to blow in.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• Our local naturalist guides have their ears to the ground and are constantly scouting new areas for rare and unusual wildlife. So we know of all of the locations to visit and we have the adaptability to change our plan (if needed) to take advantage of better wildlife watching in other locations whilst on the trip.<br/>• We will stay in a variety of accommodation when on this tour, from hotels in Santa Cruz to camping and basic accommodation. <br/>• Spend all the daylight hours searching for wildlife as well as spotlighting as many mammal species are nocturnal.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our specialist mammal watching tours give us a great success rate of seeing our targeted species (as well as many others). We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Bolivia so that we can try and find and observe mammals and many more species. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Bolivia at other times of year and focusing on other groups of wildlife such as birds, reptiles &amp; amphibians or even botany as well as other groups of animals or even specific species such as jaguars, maned wolves, giant armadillos etc. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour focused on 2 particular locations, firstly the vast wetland ecosystem of the Pantanal as part of the private reserve and then the drier more scrub forest ecosystem of the Bolivian Chaco. <br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from a vehicle (4x4) but we also include hiking where needed to have a better chance of seeing wildlife. There is no particular high level of fitness required and so the trip requires no special hiking experience or a specific level of physical fitness. This is a very easy trip to undertake. <br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 15 Years Old<br/><br/>Pictures:<br/>WolfmanSF, CC BY 3.0",

Today’s hike will be a relatively easy one, designed to help you acclimatise to the altitude while soaking in the stunning Andean vistas. You’ll only need to carry a light day pack, as your larger luggage will be transported separately. As the day comes to a close, we’ll set up camp and enjoy a delicious dinner prepared by our expert trekking team.

While our first priority will always be to secure these permits for you, if we’re unable to get them, we’ll arrange permits for the Salkantay Trek as an excellent alternative. The Salkantay Trek takes a different route but offers just as much stunning scenery, following a path through the Andes mountains, and lasting the same length of time.

If you’re hiking the Inca Trail or the Quarry Trail, the evening before you leave, you'll receive a small duffle bag to carry your clothes in for the next four days (5 kg maximum). Your team of porters will carry these bags for you, together with the food and equipment for the trail.

Your first day will include uphill trekking to the campsite, which sits at 3100 m above sea level.

There are also several sacred tombs in the area, protected by the locals, which you can explore with your leader and even see some of the original structure crafted from wood and leather. These remains have never been seen by travellers before, so you can be a part of this exclusive experience. Carry on to the Perolniyoc Cascade lookout, where you can stop for some snacks and photos. Arrive at the campsite, 3700 m above sea level, around lunchtime. After, set off to explore the Q'orimarca archaeological site, which once served as a checkpoint to the Incas.? Route 3 Cusco:?

This Caribbean outpost is known for its laid-back energy, vibrant Afro-Caribbean culture, and rich natural beauty.

With masks and snorkels on hand, the group explores vibrant coral reefs teeming with life — tropical fish darting between sea fans and brain corals in warm, shallow water. Between snorkeling sites, the boat glides past islands fringed with coconut palms and echoing with bird calls. Later, the focus shifts inland with a visit to a Ngäbe-Buglé community, where we are welcomed with hospitality and pride. The encounter offers a meaningful window into the traditions, social structure, and crafts of one of Panama’s most populous Indigenous groups. It’s a respectful cultural exchange that balances observation and participation. Meals today are enjoyed at local restaurants in the island town, which by now feels like a home base within the archipelago. Overnight at Palma Royale Hotel or similar (BLD)"

You will begin to explore the depths of the Salar de Uyuni, the largest of its kind on Earth, surrounded by ancient volcanic mountains and where the unique landscape offers many opportunities to take amazing nature photographs. On the way to explore the salt flat, you will observe the eyes of the salt flat, where icy healing water bubbles through the thick salt through unknown underground rivers. Lunch in the middle of the salt flat. The trip continues crossing towards the strange Isla Incahuasi, populated by huge very old cacti where you will have short hikes accessing 360-degree viewpoints with breathtaking views of the immense salt flat. In the afternoon, get ready for an amazing sunset, before we return to your hotel located on the shore of the Uyuni Salt Flat. (B, L, D) Optional: After dinner, you can have a stargazing experience by looking deeply into the usually starry night sky of the Uyuni Salt Flat. If the night is clear we will see dark constellations like those observed by the ancient cultures that inhabited the region and learn about Aymara beliefs (B, L, D). Or DIFFERENTLY if you come during the rainy season: December-March, the Salar de Uyuni is usually flooded, and it is forbidden to cross due to the safety of the trip. We will do our best to take you to specific places on the margins of the salt flat where you can enjoy stunning reflections of water and images of sunsets and sunrises that make this place one of the best for nature experience, also walk some distance in shallow water. At this time of year, Uyuni is also spectacular for nature photography, as well as for gazing at the mysterious night sky."

Using a mixture of comfortable, private and public transport, plus three internal flights to cover the mountainous heartland of the Andes, we cover a lot of ground on this trip.<br/><br/>Your adventure starts in Lima. After a guided tour and a night in this magnificent capital, we take a domestic flight to Cusco. Cusco was capital of the Inca Empire and is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, not only for its rich Quechua culture but because it is also gateway to the Sacred Valley of the Incas.  Taking the famous train journey up to Machu Picchu from Cusco is a highlight for many, but equally stunning is our journey further south to Lake Titicaca, where you can witness the very traditional local lifestyles in town of Puno.<br/><br/>Lake Titicaca straddles the border with Bolivia. Crossing over, we’ll take a boat trip along the famous sapphire lake. From here we drive over dramatic Altiplano landscapes to the most elevated capital city in the world at 3,800m, La Paz, surrounded by the Cordillera Real Mountains where we enjoy a few days. <br/><br/>Our next journey is by plane to Uyuni and its famous, eponymous Salt Flats, known as the Salar de Uyuni. From here we take on a three-day overland expedition through stunning terrain, a salt crust that stretches over thousands of square kilometres, at 3,656m above sea level and with the Andes always in sight. From here, in we head into Chile and the Atacama, the driest non polar desert in the world, staying at the adobe oasis town of San Pedro de Atacama. And in contrast, because Chile likes its contrasts, we take one last internal flight to the country’s capital, Santiago where the tour finishes in style in this ancient colonial capital with Andean backdrop, bohemian vibe, vineyards, museums and café life.<br/>",

The drive to the hotel encapsulates the invigorating chaos of a modern Latin American capital city. Lima, the City of Kings, was once the capital of Spanish America, and the vestiges of its glorious past can still be seen in the faded grandeur of the colonial churches and traditional wooden balconies in the city centre. The explosive growth of the last 50 years, so typical of capital cities in the developing world, has transformed Lima into a dynamic and chaotic low-rise city of over 10 million people. In crowded streets, throngs of traffic race out towards Miraflores, a modern middle-class suburb on the coast, where your hotel is located."

Once the bread-basket of the Inca Empire, it was heavily populated in imperial times and scores of archaeological sites remain, where well-preserved ruins bear witness to the highly developed society that the Incas created. The drive passes through or close to several of the villages and temple fortresses that pepper the valley. The Pisac complex, set high above and visible from the eponymous colonial village you will visit, is built on terraces carved into the steep hillsides. The engineering and preservation are unrivalled. From the flat valley floor this intricate hillside rises up like a green staircase to the heavens. Continue along this picturesque, patchwork valley to the temple of Ollantaytambo. The snow-frosted Andean cordillera forms a stunning backdrop. Ollantaytambo, sitting strategically at the gateway to the Amazon basin, was never captured by the Spanish conquistadors, but the inhabitants decided that the settlement was too vulnerable and would eventually fail, and so they abandoned it. The fortress, the colonial grid plan and the Inca foundations are still intact and there are wonderful views down over the sloping hillsides and into the fertile valley. You spend the night in the tranquil valley."

Arrive in the small, sub-tropical spa village of Machu Picchu, where you leave your bags at the hotel and board a bus for a precipitous journey up a sinuous road to the Inca site of Machu Picchu and take a guided tour. The American explorer Hiram Bingham discovered the site in 1911, by which time it was completely buried beneath tropical cloud forest. It soon became clear to excavators that the conquistadors had never found the city, and for many years it was mistaken for the legendary last refuge of the Incas, Vilcabamba. Fancy hiking some of the Inca Trail without interrupting your tour? We can organise for you to walk the mini Inca Trail on this day, but still, have a guided tour of the ruins and stay with the group in the evening. Please ask us for more details."

Travel 2 hours from of La Paz across the bleak, tawny earth of the altiplano, past glimmering lakes and herds of haughty alpacas.

You arrive on the pitted, craggy geyser field just before dawn, and as the sun rises and warms the earth, hot steam projects dramatically out of the crater into the freezing morning air, creating a wall of mist through which you can make out dark silhouettes and the penetrating sunlight. Note that a rapid ascent to an altitude of 4,500m makes this excursion unsuitable for some. Alternatively you may want to walk to Pukará de Quitor (3 km). This old Inca fortress has superb views of the mountains and volcanoes bordering Bolivia and Argentina. On the included excursion to the Moon Valley you arrive late afternoon to explore shady gorges and dramatic canyons formed over centuries by the erosion of salt mountains.

Elsewhere the river flows decorously through the rainforest breaking up into dozens of smaller falls. You might spot toucans with their outsized bright orange beaks perched in the foliage above the tumultuous waters. You head out to the Brazilian side of the falls, from where there is a broad panorama of these magnificent cataracts, and there are some excellent opportunities to photograph the full sweep of the cascades. Before leaving the Brazilian side, you could stop off at the excellent and rather quirky bird park just outside the entrance of Iguaçu National Park.

It takes about an hour and a half to explore the site, after which you stop off in the village below where an arts and crafts market spills across the main square, stalls laden with tapestries and weavings crafted in the surrounding villages. Continue along this picturesque, patchwork valley to Ollantaytambo, the snow-capped Andean cordillera forming a stunning backdrop. The Inca fortress towering above the adobe village is well preserved and there are wonderful views down over the gentle sloping hillsides and into the fertile valley. You spend the night in the Sacred Valley."

        "description": "A dramatic 2hr train journey from Ollantaytambo delivers you to the ruins of Machu Picchu. As the river Urubamba enters its narrow gorge between thickly-forested granite hills, there is room only for a single rail track, which hugs the right bank and passes through hamlets which are no more than a collection of shacks. The citadel is then reached by minibus up a sinuous road. In 1911 the American explorer Hiram Bingham discovered the ruins buried beneath tropical cloud forest. It is the city’s location which most captures the imagination, on a ridge spur amid forested peaks and above a roaring river canyon. Following a guided tour of the ruins you spend the night at the spa village of Machu Picchu, a couple of kilometres upstream. Fancy hiking some of the Inca Trail without interrupting your tour? We can organise for you to walk the mini Inca Trail on this day, but still, have a guided tour of the ruins and stay with the group in the evening. Please ask us for more details."

From here it is a short walk to the salt pans at Maras, circular pans of glistening white carved into the mountain side. Ask your tour leader for more optional excursions into the region, including horse riding and white water rafting on the Urubamba river."

        "description": "There is a morning excursion to the famous Uros Islands. You alight on a floating island, made entirely of tortora reeds – the same material used to build their canoes and even their homes. The inhabitants earn their living mainly through selling handicrafts to tourists and, while this is a unique experience, it has the air of a visit to a living museum. Later continue across the Bolivian border to the small lakeside town of Copacabana. This pretty little town is a religious sanctuary (it gave Rio’s famous beach its name), and its whitewashed buildings and Moorish-style basilica are striking against a clear blue Andean sky. The Basilica is frequented by pilgrims to the miraculous 16th-century Dark Virgin of the Lake, and they bring their rickety cars to the forecourt, bedecked in flowers, to be blessed by her. If you have the energy in this rarefied air, climb the stations of the cross for views out over the lake and the snow-capped cordillera in the distance."

The children of the sun god sprung from the lake’s depths to found the mighty empire in Cusco, and a rock at the northern end of the island was their birthplace. Later in the day we will drive across the altiplano’s windswept plains to La Paz (4hrs). At over 3,500m, La Paz is the highest capital city in the world. It is a glittering mosaic of tin, slate and tile roofs, interspersed with a line of skyscrapers that march down the valley. Beyond, keeping an eye on it all, is the colossal snow-capped Mount Illimani. This busy, commercial city has a 60% indigenous population; women dress in voluminous multi-coloured skirts, bowler hats and have centre-partings, as decreed by the Spanish monarch 3 centuries ago."

We’ll jump on some public buses to get a real feel for the city, and then we’ll take to the skies on board the cablecars that zigzag the city, all the way up to El Alto for magnificent views of the city."

This rather old world, eclectic city is located on the shores of the Río Paraguay, and an air of nostalgia permeates its busy streets. Paraguay feels caught in a time warp, the legacy of years of isolation from the outside world under the rule of a series of dictators. The wide, tree-lined avenues, parks and stately buildings are impressive, and you will explore them on your walking tour of the capital."

        "description": "The adventure continues with a road journey (7 hours) across the Argentinean border to the town of Puerto Iguazu. The Iguazú Falls are unquestionably one of the most extraordinary natural wonders in the world. A total of 275 falls thunder through dense forest over a 2.5km stretch. The u-shaped Devil’s Throat is the main gorge, where the frothy water of the Iguazú River crashes over a 1.5km-wide precipice and columns of vapour are thrown skyward. Elsewhere the river flows decorously through the rainforest breaking up into dozens of smaller falls. You might spot toucans with their outsized bright orange beaks perched in the foliage above the tumultuous waters. On your full day based here there is an expedition to the Argentine side of the falls with your tour leader. From the National Park Visitor Centre, where there is a display that illustrates the biodiversity of the region’s tropical rainforest, a little natural-gas-powered train transfers you to Cataratas Station where the Upper Walk begins. This sequence of causeways and passarelles links dozens of tiny basalt islands at the top of a sheer rock face and the walkways cross the myriad streams of the River Iguazú as they cascade over the lip of the precipice. Your breath is quite literally taken away as the water thunders on to the rocks below. The train continues to Devil’s Throat Station where a 1km-long walkway leads across the river to the thunderous Garganta del Diablo, The Devil’s Throat. From this vantage point you can feel the incredible power of the water, and the flow is mesmeric as it plummets into the vortex below."

Continue onto Foz do Iguaçú airport and fly to Rio de Janeiro (2 hours). Rio de Janeiro is the most romantic, intriguing and beautiful city on the continent. Sumptuous apartments overlook sparkling bays against a backdrop of half-built slum dwellings, favelas, which cling precariously to the hillsides. Rio has an awesome bay-side location among near-vertical granite mountains. Here, tropical foliage swoops down to white-to-toffee coloured sandy beaches in turn battered by the huge waves of Atlantic surf. The drive into the city gives a fleeting glimpse of the docks and commercial centre as you head towards the magnificent stretch of sand at Copacabana beach; your hotel is close by."

Here the famous 40m art deco Christ the Redeemer statue soars above the city, arms outspread benevolently. On a clear day, the views over the city and out across the ocean and outlying islands are stupendous. The afternoon is at leisure. A popular optional excursion is a visit to the exotic Botanical Gardens. Walk along the splendid Avenue of the Royal Palms, and see if you can catch a glimpse of the toucans and marmosets that frequent the park, attracted by thousands of species of tropical and subtropical plants. There are also glass houses sheltering bromeliads, and a research institute here."

Its highlights include some of the best preserved dinosaur footprints in South America, stunning geological formations plus pleasing colonial towns.  <br/><br/>Travelling from the atmospheric city of Cochabamba, private 4x4s cover the rugged road to Toro Toro. Pause en route at the colonial village of Tarata to admire its beautiful crumbling colonial facades. Then don torch helmets to explore the nearby Umajalanta Cave – a remarkable partly explored arena of giant stalagtites and stalagmites, blind fish and stunning rock formations. <br/><br/>Another day, climb to 4000m for stunning mountain views as you head for the unique Ciudad Itas – a natural 'city of stone'  created by millennia of rock erosion. Here too are rock paintings estimated to be around 2000 years old. This is also your first encounter with the thousands of dinosaur footprints that are a highlight of the Park – including the mighty 36m long Titanosaurus.  <br/><br/>You'll also explore the depths of the Vergel Canyon, overseen by soaring condors. At the bottom of the canyon, a wonderful natural pool formed by a waterfall provides a perfect swimming spot.",
