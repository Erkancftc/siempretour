  "generalInfo": "Mind blowing vistas, multi-coloured lagunas, geysers, hot springs, flamingos and volcanoes greet travellers on this three-day small group tour across Bolivia’s high-altitude desert in search of one of the most remote and striking landscapes in South America; the Salar de Uyuni salt flats.<br/><br/>Using 4WD vehicles fully equipped with radios, GPS, oxygen and first aid kits, this trip is designed for the travellers who want more comfortable accommodation than is usually offered on this route.<br/><br/>Using a network of community-owned and very comfortable midrange hotels this trip offers guests an excellent opportunity to support local Aymara people in one of the poorest regions of Bolivia. Each property is sustainably built on land rented from local communities using local materials (including salt!) – and ownership will pass back to the communities after seven years. Accommodation is of a high standard, with private bathrooms, solar hot water and heating. And delicious buffet-style food is locally sourced where possible; Llama Bolognese anyone?<br/><br/>Starting and finishing in the small town of Uyuni, this is a small group tour with weekly departures, however longer itineraries including other activities and other areas of Bolivia, Chile or Peru can be tailor made if required. It is also possible to finish this tour at San Pedro de Atacama in Chile.<br/>",

      "description": "Today we have an unforgettable journey through 12,000 km ² of fantastic landscapes of salt. Prepare your camera - the dazzling white mantle of the Uyuni Salt Flat (or Thunhupha) resembles an immense glacier. In the winter (dry season, from May to October), when the surface hardens, geometrical formations start appearing formed by salt particles conglomerating into polygons. In summer (rainy season, November to February), the saline desert transforms into a gigantic mirror that melts into the purest sky in America. We come onto the salt flat through Colchani and its salt factories. We visit one of these and receive an explanation from one of the resident family about the economy of the salt industry which governs the life of the people here, and who have organised a co-operative organization. We then visit the salt plains - where the mounds of salt are collected. After the visit, we head towards Incahuasi Island. The tourist centre here has a path, which we climb, to the summit, from where we get a great 360 view. We'll have a box lunch at the island and then head toward the dominant Volcano Thunupa and the Chantani Museum. The museum features stone that resemble animals and mummies from the old burials in these lands. We arrive at Tayka Salt Hotel, settle in, and then head off by car to the town of Chillguilla at north, where we'll start the climb to Pucara. We walk for 20 minutes, climbing to the impressive site of Pucara Chillima. It is an quiet corner of the Salt Flat and a spiritual spot thanks to the stone buildings which are more than thousand years old. Return to Tayka Salt Hotel with private bathrooms, hot water and heating."

      "description": "Today we focus on less visited parts of the Salt Flat. We head by 4x4 to Chiquini, making a stop in a lonely Ojo de Agua (Water Eye) then continue toward “The Cathedral”, a huge cliff facing the Salt Flat and very near the Chiquini Cave. Here there are strange geological underwater formations, from de time of Lake Michin (300,000 years ago) and Lake Mauca (40, 000 years ago). Next we cross from north to south, the most beautiful part in the white desert, far from the usual route of the tourists. We head towards the bay of the Campanas Islands, dominated by Volcano Caltama. We leave the salt flat and head to Charagua, a pretty place of corrals and goat farmers. It will take us one hour, via a bumpy road, to reach the Burnt Town of San Pedro de Quemes, where we will leave the car to wander in its small streets and view the buildings which inspired the hotel Tayka of Stone. We have lunch in the Hotel of Stone (optional Llama Shepherding trip, spending an hour or so helping a shepherd or shepherdess with the llamas, a vital part of life in the Salar). In the afternoon we will head for the lagoons - Cañapa, Hedionda, Chiarkota, Honda and Ramaditas, full of flamingos happy to be photographed! Other birds, such as Andean gulls and ducks, accompany the flamingos in these lagoons, which are flanked by snow-capped volcanoes. Next we enter the deserts of sand and the range of terracottas: red, oranges, ochers, coffees and beige - every bend in the road offers more colours. In front of the most impressive of these palettes of colours is the Hotel Tayka of the Desert, with private bathrooms, hot water and environmental heating."

      "description": "An early start today at 05:30 o'clock, towards the Eduardo Avaroa and Flora and Andean Fauna Reserve and then the famous Stone Tree. Next is the Red Lagoon to observe its large population of flamingos, then to the Morning Sun Geysers to catch them in their most active moments. This will be the highest point in the route at nearly 5,000m. Here, noisy fumaroles and spluttering reddish mud puddles. The desert and salt flat of Chalviri is another superb scene. It combines the white of the snow, the ochre of the desert, the blue of the water, and, in one of its corners, the Hot Springs of Polques where you can take a dip. It is a day full of highlights, as next is Ladies of the Desert, a masterpiece created by the the wind and the Andean peaks around, with crazily shaped rocks in fantastic colours. Nearby is Green Lagoon, at the foot of the Volcano Licancabur, another pearl of the reserve. From the Green Lagoon we return to the Red Lagoon, have lunch, and then watch as the shifting sun helps to change its colour to blood red. We return via Villa Mar to Uyuni, and the tour ends."
