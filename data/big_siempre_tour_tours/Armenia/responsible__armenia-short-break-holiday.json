  "generalInfo": "Armenia is a fascinating mixture of cultural influences. Proud of its independence, its alphabet, and its Christian heritage, Armenia has more than a whiff of former Soviet Republic, indeed crossing Yerevan’s busy Republic Square (built over a nuclear bunker) risks being run over by one of many shiny white Lada Nivas.<br/><br/>This short break in Armenia will give you an excellent insight into this fascinating frontier state.<br/><br/>From your base in vibrant Yerevan, explore the most intrinsic areas of the city, before on Days 3 and 4 heading out of the city to observe incredible architecture and historical monuments such as the remarkable UNESCO listed Geghard monastery carved from the mountain,  and Khor Virap with its incredible views of Mt. Ararat.<br/><br/>Also gain an insight into Armenian culture, even trying your hand at traditional bread making and tasting delicious wine in one of the world’s oldest wine producing nations.",
