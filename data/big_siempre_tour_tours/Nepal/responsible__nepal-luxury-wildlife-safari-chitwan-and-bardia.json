  "generalInfo": "Introduction:<br/>This luxury safari of both Chitwan and Bardia National Parks is a great way to explore the amazing and richly diverse ecosystem of the terai. This strip of fertile land runs parallel to the Himalayas in Nepal, India and Bhutan and is home to large densities of tigers, rhinos, sloth bears, elephants and other wildlife. These parks are among the only places on the planet where you can experience the park and possibly see these species on foot.<br/><br/>The terai ecosystems of Chitwan and Bardia are made up of a combination of jungle, sal forest, grassland and river systems all of which are ideal habitat for tigers as well as Indian one-horned rhinos many other mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish. This makes the park one of the greatest wildlife watching locations in the world. <br/><br/>The itinerary below is for a combined visit to both Chitwan and Bardia National Parks and uses some of the best lodges in the area. These lodges are not just beautiful and luxury, but also massively invest into the local communities surrounding the park. <br/><br/>All of our tiger safaris are guided by a zoologist (where available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) as well as local naturalist guides, drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible. This not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits. We are proud of the fact that we have a 75% success of spotting tigers in Nepal, with a 60% success in spotting them on foot whilst tracking tigers in Chitwan or Bardia (Bardia having a slightly higher success rate even though there are less tigers known living in Nepal). The fitness level required for our tiger safaris, is a moderate level of walking in Nepal (as tiger tracking on foot through the forests and grasslands can last for 7-8 hours). <br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned. There will be filtered or boiled water available for each guest each day. We have our own private AC vehicles with an excellent driver for all vehicular transfers and internal flights booked in economy class where needed and mentioned on the itinerary. You will have a local cultural and naturalist guides. The guides have spent years in Nepal (and in particular Chitwan and Bardia) and know the places and wildlife and local villages. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Best time to go on a tiger safari in Nepal:<br/><br/>For tiger watching in Nepal we recommend mid January to mid May which is the middle and end of the hot dry season when wildlife gather at waterholes.<br/><br/>Why choose this tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced local naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>• Our zoologist (please check the availability of our specialist zoologists for this trip when enquiring) that escorts all our safaris has great experience working with and studying wild animals all over the world and has experience in working with big cats (particularly Tigers) in the Indian Subcontinent and elsewhere in the world.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it.<br/>• This specific wildlife tour is one of the few in the world that explores remote and wilderness areas of Nepal in the company of expert guides.<br/>• We provide camera traps for you to set up and you are free to use any and all of the photographs and videos that this camera trap gets during your stay.  <br/>• All the above reasons give this, our unique Chitwan &amp; Bardia Luxury Tiger Safari Holiday a great success rate of seeing rare wildlife. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Nepal which explore other areas and focus on other species such as Jungle cats and Red pandas as well as many other species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari. We are also experts in organising treks in the Nepalese Himalayas.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/>• We also contribute to Tour Operators for Tigers (TOFT) which is an NGO in the the Indian Subcontinent which is dedicated the sustainable and eco friendly future of tiger tourism. <br/> <br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour explores the two best known and most famous national parks of Nepal. Bardia &amp; Chitwan which are located in the in southern Nepal. The entry and exit port of this tour is the wonderful and iconic city of Kathmandu.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The fitness level required for our Luxury Chitwan &amp; Bardia Safari wildlife holiday is relatively high. This is because we include jungle hikes, these are either full days (7-8 hours) or half days (3-4 hours) inside the park hiking. The terrain is rough and the heat can be very hot and fatiguing. There are also dangerous animals around (such as rhinos and elephants) and on rare occasions evasive action is needed to avoid these animals.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.
