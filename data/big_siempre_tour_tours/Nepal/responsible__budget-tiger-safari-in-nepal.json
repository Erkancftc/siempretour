  "generalInfo": "Introduction:<br/>This budget Bardia tiger safari holiday is a great way of exploring this incredible park and go in search of wildlife such as tigers, rhinos, elephants and other species. Nepal and in particular Bardia is one of the few places in the world where you can track tigers on foot and indeed Bardia is one of the most reliable places in the world for tiger sightings on foot.<br/><br/>Bardia is a combination of jungle, sal forest, grassland and river systems all of which are ideal habitat for tiger as well as many other mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish. This makes the park one of the greatest wildlife watching locations in the world. Another great aspect of Bardia is that the number of tourists that visit the park is so low you can often have the park to yourself.<br/><br/>In this itinerary we have substituted the luxury lodges for budget eco lodges and so have maximised our time in the forest looking for wildlife whilst keeping the costs low.<br/><br/>All of our tiger safaris are guided by local naturalist guides, drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible. This not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits. We are proud of the fact that we have a 75% success of spotting tigers in Nepal, with a 90% success in spotting them on foot whilst tracking tigers in Bardia. The fitness level required for our tiger safaris, is a moderate level of walking in Nepal (as tiger tracking on foot through the forests and grasslands can last for 7-8 hours). <br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned. There will be filtered or boiled water available for each guest each day. We have our own private AC vehicles with an excellent driver for all vehicular transfers. You will have a local cultural and naturalist guides. The guides have spent years in Nepal (and in particular Bardia) and know the places and wildlife and local villages. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - inquire about the availability of a zoologist if you wish to have one escort your trip).<br/><br/><br/>Best time to go on a tiger safari in Nepal:<br/><br/>For tiger watching in Nepal we recommend mid January to mid May which is the middle and end of the hot dry season when wildlife gather at waterholes.<br/><br/>Why choose this tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced local naturalist or guides as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it.<br/>• This specific wildlife tour is one of the few in the world that explores remote and wilderness areas of Bhutan in the company of expert guides.<br/>• We provide camera traps for you to set up and you are free to use any and all of the photographs and videos that this camera trap gets during your stay.  <br/>• All the above reasons give this, our unique Bardia Budget Tiger Safari Holiday a great success rate of seeing rare wildlife. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Nepal which explore other areas and focus on other species such as Jungle cats, Snow Leopards and Red pandas as well as many other species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari. We are also experts in organising treks in the Nepalese Himalayas.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/>• We also contribute to Tour Operators for Tigers (TOFT) which is an NGO in the the Indian Subcontinent which is dedicated the sustainable and eco friendly future of tiger tourism. <br/> <br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour explores the massive, famous park of Bardia in western Nepal. The entry and exit port of this tour is the wonderful and iconic city of Kathmandu.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The fitness level required for our Bardia Tiger Safari wildlife holiday is relatively high. This is because we include jungle hikes, these are either full days (7-8 hours) or half days (3-4 hours) inside the park hiking. The terrain is rough and the heat can be very hot and fatiguing. There are also dangerous animals around (such as rhinos and elephants) and on rare occasions evasive action is needed to avoid these animals.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking. We can also include specialist equipment on request such as camera traps, infrared cameras, thermal imaging equipment and spotlights.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 Years Old",

If your flight has arrived in the morning you can have lunch in Thamel and then there is the option for some sightseeing around this historic city; we will look to visit Swayambunath, Boudnath Stupa and Durbar Square and then we will head back to Thamel for dinner.

      "description": "Bardia National Park - Travelling After breakfast in Thamel you will be transferred to the domestic airport to catch the internal flight west to the town of Nepalganj (~1.5 hours). One you land here you will meet a driver from the lodge and be transferred further to the borders of Bardia National Park (~2-3 hours). Once we arrive at the accommodation, you will settle in and depending on the time have lunch or just head out into the park for your first activity. There are various activities for exploring the park and today we will probably have a jungle walk or jeep safari this afternoon. This is a great introduction to this park and as the sun begins to creep behind the trees and the sky gets darker there is the chance of spotting one of Nepal's top predators as the tigers, leopards, dhole and sloth bears begin to start a night of hunting. This afternoon activity will probably be around 2-3 hours long. You will arrive back at the accommodation in time for your evening meal and we recommend a good early night as the next few days will be long and exciting as you go in search of some of the worlds most incredible, beautiful and endangered wildlife. (breakfast and dinner included today)."

      "description": "Kathmandu - Travelling This morning will be a little more relaxed, you do not need to wake at dawn to enter the park, and after your more leisurely breakfast you will be transferred to Nepalganj in time to catch your return flight back to Kathmandu. If you sit on the left hand side of the plane you could possibly see views of the Annapurna massif as well as much more of the Himalayas as well. Then once you arrive back in Kathmandu you will be transferred to the accommodation in Thamel and if you did not have any time for sightseeing on day 1 and would wish to go this afternoon this would be an option. (breakfast is the only meal included today)."
