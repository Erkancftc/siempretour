  "generalInfo": "From the charms of Kathmandu to the snowcapped Himalayas, forests thick with wildlife and hilltop villages dotted with Hindu and Buddhist temples, the scenery of Nepal is a lot more diverse than you may think. This two-week small group tour takes you through a range of breathtaking landscapes on foot, raft, jeep and even elephant back as you travel from Kathmandu to Pokhara and back again, with a few days of mountain trekking thrown in for good measure.<br/><br/>In the capital, a guided tour of the city’s winding back streets takes you around temples and palaces carved from wood and stone, workshops, stupas and rooftop restaurants, with landmarks including Durbar Square and the lively ‘monkey temple’. The following day you’ll drive out into rural Nepal, past forested hills, rivers and terraced farmland, headed to Chitwan National Park – home to tiger, rhino and wild elephant. This will be an undisputed highlight of your trip, as you explore the jungle by canoe, jeep and even on the back of an elephant. <br/><br/>After brief stops in Bandipur and Pokhara, Nepal’s ‘adventure capital’, you’ll then embark on a five-day round trip trek, taking you through forests where monkeys swing and atmospheric river valleys, with sublime views of the Himalayan foothills before you. Leaving the Annapurna region and returning to Kathmandu, you have the option of taking a memorable flight to see Everest. <br/><br/>As the trip winds down, there is time left for some last-minute sightseeing around key historic and religious landmarks, and seeking out some unique souvenirs in the capital’s many little stalls, markets and workshops. You can't take a monkey home with you though, sorry.<br/><br/>",

You can hike back uphill to Bandipur from here or walk down to the highway for our vehicle to pick you up.
