    "generalInfo": "The Mustang Overland Trip is an exciting and fascinating 12 day journey into a less well known region, but travelling in Upper Mustang is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It allows you to witness the way of life of true mountain people, who have had little contact with the rest of the world for hundreds of years. Upper Mustang is like being in Tibet in many ways, as it is geographically part of the Tibetan plateau. Prepare to be awestruck by breath-taking landscapes and meet the people of one of the world's most culturally preserved regions. Until 1950, the district of Mustang was a separate kingdom within the borders of Nepal. Upper Mustang was opened to non-Nepali visitors in 1994, and visiting the region today feels like stepping back in time.<br/>SPECIAL EVENT - TIJI FESTIVAL - MAY 2025<br/>You can also experience the Tiji Festival which is a 3-day festival celebrated in Lomanthang of Upper Mustang and which takes place in May in 2025. We combine days 2 and 3 of the itinerary below and get you to Lo Manthang on day 6, to enjoy  the Festival on day 7 - May 24. <br/>The Festival is held every year but on different dates, as it is depends on a special day in the Tibetan calendar. The Festival marks the victory of good against evil and local people from villages and all the Buddhist Lamas from the monastery gather at the place where festival is celebrated. The main Lama of the village then fights against a demon father to save Kingdom of Mustang from destruction. A special mask dance by Buddhist Lama is the main attraction during this festival and the mask dance with the special Mantra is thought to expel all demons from the area.",

After the permits are checked at the police post in Kagbeni, the jeep track today pretty much skirts the side of the Kali Gandaki River Valley. Whether there is any water in the river rater depends on what time of year you're undertaking the journey. Usually from October to mid-May the broad river floor looks more like a level boulder field. Take a walk onto the riverbed and you may just hear water flowing underneath. Along the way you can take a halt and explore the small villages and see how their carefully tended terraced fields are irrigated in a landscape that is otherwise dry and barren wilderness. At Chusang there is a river tributary to cross and shortly thereafter the Kali Gandaki Riverbed itself. After crossing the Kali Gandaki the jeep track now climbs away from the valley and there are a couple of high passes (approx. 4000m) to cross before dropping down into Charang.

    "generalInfo": "Introduction:<br/>This budget Bardia tiger safari holiday is a great way of exploring this incredible park and go in search of wildlife such as tigers, rhinos, elephants and other species. Nepal and in particular Bardia is one of the few places in the world where you can track tigers on foot and indeed Bardia is one of the most reliable places in the world for tiger sightings on foot.<br/><br/>Bardia is a combination of jungle, sal forest, grassland and river systems all of which are ideal habitat for tiger as well as many other mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish. This makes the park one of the greatest wildlife watching locations in the world. Another great aspect of Bardia is that the number of tourists that visit the park is so low you can often have the park to yourself.<br/><br/>In this itinerary we have substituted the luxury lodges for budget eco lodges and so have maximised our time in the forest looking for wildlife whilst keeping the costs low.<br/><br/>All of our tiger safaris are guided by local naturalist guides, drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible. This not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits. We are proud of the fact that we have a 75% success of spotting tigers in Nepal, with a 90% success in spotting them on foot whilst tracking tigers in Bardia. The fitness level required for our tiger safaris, is a moderate level of walking in Nepal (as tiger tracking on foot through the forests and grasslands can last for 7-8 hours). <br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned. There will be filtered or boiled water available for each guest each day. We have our own private AC vehicles with an excellent driver for all vehicular transfers. You will have a local cultural and naturalist guides. The guides have spent years in Nepal (and in particular Bardia) and know the places and wildlife and local villages. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - inquire about the availability of a zoologist if you wish to have one escort your trip).<br/><br/><br/>Best time to go on a tiger safari in Nepal:<br/><br/>For tiger watching in Nepal we recommend mid January to mid May which is the middle and end of the hot dry season when wildlife gather at waterholes.<br/><br/>Why choose this tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced local naturalist or guides as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it.<br/>• This specific wildlife tour is one of the few in the world that explores remote and wilderness areas of Bhutan in the company of expert guides.<br/>• We provide camera traps for you to set up and you are free to use any and all of the photographs and videos that this camera trap gets during your stay.  <br/>• All the above reasons give this, our unique Bardia Budget Tiger Safari Holiday a great success rate of seeing rare wildlife. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Nepal which explore other areas and focus on other species such as Jungle cats, Snow Leopards and Red pandas as well as many other species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari. We are also experts in organising treks in the Nepalese Himalayas.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/>• We also contribute to Tour Operators for Tigers (TOFT) which is an NGO in the the Indian Subcontinent which is dedicated the sustainable and eco friendly future of tiger tourism. <br/> <br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour explores the massive, famous park of Bardia in western Nepal. The entry and exit port of this tour is the wonderful and iconic city of Kathmandu.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The fitness level required for our Bardia Tiger Safari wildlife holiday is relatively high. This is because we include jungle hikes, these are either full days (7-8 hours) or half days (3-4 hours) inside the park hiking. The terrain is rough and the heat can be very hot and fatiguing. There are also dangerous animals around (such as rhinos and elephants) and on rare occasions evasive action is needed to avoid these animals.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.

This two-week small group tour takes you through a range of breathtaking landscapes on foot, raft, jeep and even elephant back as you travel from Kathmandu to Pokhara and back again, with a few days of mountain trekking thrown in for good measure.<br/><br/>In the capital, a guided tour of the city’s winding back streets takes you around temples and palaces carved from wood and stone, workshops, stupas and rooftop restaurants, with landmarks including Durbar Square and the lively ‘monkey temple’. The following day you’ll drive out into rural Nepal, past forested hills, rivers and terraced farmland, headed to Chitwan National Park – home to tiger, rhino and wild elephant. This will be an undisputed highlight of your trip, as you explore the jungle by canoe, jeep and even on the back of an elephant. <br/><br/>After brief stops in Bandipur and Pokhara, Nepal’s ‘adventure capital’, you’ll then embark on a five-day round trip trek, taking you through forests where monkeys swing and atmospheric river valleys, with sublime views of the Himalayan foothills before you. Leaving the Annapurna region and returning to Kathmandu, you have the option of taking a memorable flight to see Everest. <br/><br/>As the trip winds down, there is time left for some last-minute sightseeing around key historic and religious landmarks, and seeking out some unique souvenirs in the capital’s many little stalls, markets and workshops. You can't take a monkey home with you though, sorry.<br/><br/>",

    "placesVisited": "",
    "generalInfo": "Introduction:<br/>For a very long time clouded leopards were among the top of every wildlife enthusiasts wish lists (which has not changed), but for a long time the chances of seeing one were lottery like odds. Very few people were ever lucky enough to happen chance across one as they trekked in various forests around South and South East Asia. All of that changed around 5 years ago when a wonderful forestry department opened its up for tourism in Sabah, Malaysia (Deramakot Forest Reserve) and the rate of seeing this wonderful species shot up drastically. But nearly at the same time as this location arrived on the wildlife watching scene the clouded leopard was split into two different species; the Indochinese clouded leopard (native to the mainland of Asia) and the Sunda clouded leopard (found on Sumatra and Borneo). So whilst seeing the Sunda clouded leopard is now possible (although still with some luck and the right guides), there remained nowhere to see the Indochinese clouded leopard – well that was until very recently.  <br/>Due to some very adventurous solo travellers and the incredible work of clouded leopard researchers various parks and forests in the north-east of India and along the Himalayan foothills of Nepal have been extensively studied and tracked with views of finding clouded leopard populations and possibly getting a sighting. The breakthrough came in late 2018 and since then we have been working hard with the best clouded leopard researchers in Nepal to pioneer the first ever group tour to try and find this species. We have also hired the serviced of Mike Gordon, the dedicated and passionate wildlife spotter and guide from Sabah, made famous for his numerous sightings of Sunda clouded leopards. Possibly no one in the world understands this species better than Mike and we are delighted that he will be guiding our new Clouded Leopard Expeditions to Nepal.<br/>But there are other advantages of travelling to this region of Nepal to look for this species of clouded leopard, not just that it is a different species from the Bornean ones, but also that Nepal offers a brand new wildlife experience and also the price is cheaper and a whole new set of species can be seen in these forests too. <br/>So why not branch out and away from Sabah, Borneo and cast the clouded leopard net wider. This tour is unique and offers the chance to explore a wonderful forest which is seldom visited and little understood. But in recent times this area has become a hotbed for clouded leopard sightings. <br/>We do our best to pioneer as many new trips as possible, to try and get people out to the newest and best wildlife watching destinations ahead of the larger companies and the bigger groups. This is the latest in a long list of pioneering mammal watching tours from us and it will not be the last.<br/>So we hope you decide to book on this unique big cat watching tour, dedicated to the Indochinese clouded leopard, however if you wish to know more about the Sunda clouded leopard we also offer a rare mammals tour of Borneo where the Sunda clouded leopard is a top targeted species. Just contact us for more information or our brochure.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned. There will be filtered or boiled water available for each guest each day. We have our own private AC vehicles with an excellent driver for all vehicular transfers. You will have a local cultural and naturalist guides including a Nepalese clouded leopard specialist. We also have a the expert help of the world's most renowned clouded leopard guide from Borneo. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us). We also have high powered spotlights, quality optical equipment, night-vision and thermal imaging equipment (on request).<br/><br/><br/>Best time for this Nepal expedition for clouded leopards:<br/><br/>This tour can be booked anytime of the year, however we recommend avoiding the height of winter. And we think that spring and autumn are the best seasons to visit. This would be from late February – May and then September – mid November. <br/><br/>Why choose this tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced local naturalist or guides as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We employ three different specialist clouded leopard guides, firstly a local guide who knows the particular region intimately, secondly a Nepalese biologist who specialises in clouded leopards and then a guide who has probably see more clouded leopards than any living person.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it.<br/>• This specific wildlife tour is one of the few in the world that explores remote and wilderness areas of Nepal in the company of expert guides.<br/>• We provide camera traps for you to set up and you are free to use any and all of the photographs and videos that this camera trap gets during your stay.  <br/>• All the above reasons give this, our unique Clouded Leopard Expedition of Nepal a great success rate of seeing rare wildlife. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Nepal which explore other areas and focus on other species such as Tigers, One-horned Rhinos, Jungle cats and Red pandas as well as many other species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari. We are also experts in organising treks in the Nepalese Himalayas.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/> <br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour explores the massive and famous national park of Langtang in central Nepal. The entry and exit point of this tour is the wonderful and iconic city of Kathmandu.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The fitness level required for our Nepal Clouded Leopard Expedition is relatively high. This is because the tour is at altitude and the hiking to and from the guesthouse and the hiking to get to observation points can be steep and on uneven ground. Anyone who is used to hiking for 2-3 hours at a time (preferably at altitude) will not have a problem, anyone who has experienced altitude whilst hiking will most likely also be ok.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking. We can also include specialist equipment on request such as camera traps, infrared cameras, thermal imaging equipment and spotlights.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 Years Old<br/><br/>Pictures on this page courtesy of:<br/><br/>Dr. Raju Kasambe / CC BY-SA <br/>Charles Barilleaux from Cincinnati, Ohio, United States of America / CC BY <br/>Jindrich pavelka2 / CC BY-SA <br/>[2] / CC BY-SA <br/>A.

We will then visit the hilltop temples at Swayambunath that are dedicated to Hanuman the monkey god n Hindu mythology; alongside the playful macaques the views over Kathmandu are worth the long climb up alone.

Outdoors enthusiasts flock to this mountain outpost not only for the views, but also for the serenity. Here thick pine forests and verdant valleys offering plenty of hiking opportunities will surround travelers. Those interested in trekking should consider hiking back out of Nagarkot to Kathmandu or even hike on to their next destination.<br/><br/>Located 20 miles (32 kilometers) from Kathmandu, Nagarkot can be enjoyed as a long day trip, or better yet, an overnight getaway so you can watch the sunrise light up the surrounding peaks. If you can withstand the cold, a visit between October and March almost guarantees clear skies and views as far as the peak of Mt Everest. The monsoons of June, July and September bring clouds and obstructed views at best.",

This makes the park one of the greatest wildlife watching locations in the world. Chitwan has very high densities of rhinos, tigers and sloth bears - among the highest densities of these species in the world and so you have very good chances of seeing these animals when exploring the park in full.<br/><br/>All of our tiger safaris are guided by a zoologist (where available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) as well as local naturalist guides, drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible. This not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits. We are proud of the fact that we have a 75% success of spotting tigers in Nepal, with a 60% success in spotting them on foot whilst tracking tigers in Chitwan.

    "generalInfo": "Introduction:<br/>For a very long time clouded leopards were among the top of every wildlife enthusiasts wish lists (which has not changed), but for a long time the chances of seeing one were lottery like odds. Very few people were ever lucky enough to happen chance across one as they trekked in various forests around South and South East Asia. All of that changed around 5 years ago when a wonderful forestry department opened its up for tourism in Sabah, Malaysia (Deramakot Forest Reserve) and the rate of seeing this wonderful species shot up drastically. But nearly at the same time as this location arrived on the wildlife watching scene the clouded leopard was split into two different species; the Indochinese clouded leopard (native to the mainland of Asia) and the Sunda clouded leopard (found on Sumatra and Borneo). So whilst seeing the Sunda clouded leopard is now possible (although still with some luck and the right guides), there remained nowhere to see the Indochinese clouded leopard – well that was until very recently.  <br/>Due to some very adventurous solo travellers and the incredible work of clouded leopard researchers various parks and forests in the north-east of India and along the Himalayan foothills of Nepal have been extensively studied and tracked with views of finding clouded leopard populations and possibly getting a sighting. The breakthrough came in late 2018 and since then we have been working hard with the best clouded leopard researchers in Nepal to pioneer the first ever group tour to try and find this species. We have also hired the serviced of Mike Gordon, the dedicated and passionate wildlife spotter and guide from Sabah, made famous for his numerous sightings of Sunda clouded leopards. Possibly no one in the world understands this species better than Mike and we are delighted that he will be guiding our new Clouded Leopard Expeditions to Nepal.<br/>But there are other advantages of travelling to this region of Nepal to look for this species of clouded leopard, not just that it is a different species from the Bornean ones, but also that Nepal offers a brand new wildlife experience and also the price is cheaper and a whole new set of species can be seen in these forests too. <br/>So why not branch out and away from Sabah, Borneo and cast the clouded leopard net wider. This tour is unique and offers the chance to explore a wonderful forest which is seldom visited and little understood. But in recent times this area has become a hotbed for clouded leopard sightings. <br/>We do our best to pioneer as many new trips as possible, to try and get people out to the newest and best wildlife watching destinations ahead of the larger companies and the bigger groups. This is the latest in a long list of pioneering mammal watching tours from us and it will not be the last.<br/>So we hope you decide to book on this unique big cat watching tour, dedicated to the Indochinese clouded leopard, however if you wish to know more about the Sunda clouded leopard we also offer a rare mammals tour of Borneo where the Sunda clouded leopard is a top targeted species. Just contact us for more information or our brochure.<br/><br/>Group Tour Departure: 11th November - 20th November 2022<br/>Group Tour Departure: 5th December - 14th December 2022<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned. There will be filtered or boiled water available for each guest each day. We have our own private AC vehicles with an excellent driver for all vehicular transfers. You will have a local cultural and naturalist guides including a Nepalese clouded leopard specialist. We also have a the expert help of the world's most renowned clouded leopard guide from Borneo. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us). We also have high powered spotlights, quality optical equipment, night-vision and thermal imaging equipment (on request).<br/><br/><br/>Best time for this Nepal expedition for clouded leopards:<br/><br/>This tour can be booked anytime of the year, however we recommend avoiding the height of winter. And we think that spring and autumn are the best seasons to visit. This would be from late February – May and then September – mid November. <br/><br/>Why choose this tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced local naturalist or guides as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We employ three different specialist clouded leopard guides, firstly a local guide who knows the particular region intimately, secondly a Nepalese biologist who specialises in clouded leopards and then a guide who has probably see more clouded leopards than any living person.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it.<br/>• This specific wildlife tour is one of the few in the world that explores remote and wilderness areas of Nepal in the company of expert guides.<br/>• We provide camera traps for you to set up and you are free to use any and all of the photographs and videos that this camera trap gets during your stay.  <br/>• All the above reasons give this, our unique Clouded Leopard Expedition of Nepal a great success rate of seeing rare wildlife. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Nepal which explore other areas and focus on other species such as Tigers, One-horned Rhinos, Jungle cats and Red pandas as well as many other species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari. We are also experts in organising treks in the Nepalese Himalayas.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/> <br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour explores the massive and famous national park of Langtang in central Nepal. The entry and exit point of this tour is the wonderful and iconic city of Kathmandu.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The fitness level required for our Nepal Clouded Leopard Expedition is relatively high. This is because the tour is at altitude and the hiking to and from the guesthouse and the hiking to get to observation points can be steep and on uneven ground. Anyone who is used to hiking for 2-3 hours at a time (preferably at altitude) will not have a problem, anyone who has experienced altitude whilst hiking will most likely also be ok.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking. We can also include specialist equipment on request such as camera traps, infrared cameras, thermal imaging equipment and spotlights.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 Years Old<br/><br/>Pictures on this page courtesy of:<br/><br/>Dr. Raju Kasambe / CC BY-SA <br/>Charles Barilleaux from Cincinnati, Ohio, United States of America / CC BY <br/>Jindrich pavelka2 / CC BY-SA <br/>[2] / CC BY-SA <br/>A.

From the airport we will be transferred in our private vehicle into the middle of Kathmandu (20-30 mins). Once here we will head to the Thamel district and your hotel for the night. If there is time you will be taken around the winding streets of Thamel. This area is the heartbeat of Kathmandu and a place which teems with colour, sights and sounds. You can easily get lost meandering down the maze of streets souvenir shopping and we can spend hours here enjoying the hustle and bustle of Nepal’s busiest city. Whilst still very touristy Thamel is a good welcome to Nepal and in particular Kathmandu. If time allows we will have a short city tour today, however it depends on the arrival times of all of the clients booked on the trip. However Thamel is safe to walk around and with a large selection of restaurants your guide can point you in the right direction for your evening meal, alternatively you can rest and prepare for the long car journey tomorrow morning to get to Lantang district. Depending on the time we arrive back into Kathmandu on the final day of the trip we will look to conduct some sightseeing around the city and show you some of the better known sites such as Boudnath Stupa, which is the largest Buddhist stupa in the world and a very important place for Nepalese Buddhists. We will then visit the hilltop temples at Swayambunath that are dedicated to Hanuman the monkey god n Hindu mythology; alongside the playful macaques the views over Kathmandu are worth the long climb up alone. We then visit the historical Royal palaces and temples of the bustling Durbur Square."

These lodges are not just beautiful and luxury, but also massively invest into the local communities surrounding the park. <br/><br/>All of our tiger safaris are guided by a zoologist (where available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) as well as local naturalist guides, drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible. This not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits. We are proud of the fact that we have a 75% success of spotting tigers in Nepal, with a 60% success in spotting them on foot whilst tracking tigers in Chitwan or Bardia (Bardia having a slightly higher success rate even though there are less tigers known living in Nepal). The fitness level required for our tiger safaris, is a moderate level of walking in Nepal (as tiger tracking on foot through the forests and grasslands can last for 7-8 hours). <br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned. There will be filtered or boiled water available for each guest each day. We have our own private AC vehicles with an excellent driver for all vehicular transfers and internal flights booked in economy class where needed and mentioned on the itinerary. You will have a local cultural and naturalist guides. The guides have spent years in Nepal (and in particular Chitwan and Bardia) and know the places and wildlife and local villages. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Best time to go on a tiger safari in Nepal:<br/><br/>For tiger watching in Nepal we recommend mid January to mid May which is the middle and end of the hot dry season when wildlife gather at waterholes.<br/><br/>Why choose this tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced local naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>• Our zoologist (please check the availability of our specialist zoologists for this trip when enquiring) that escorts all our safaris has great experience working with and studying wild animals all over the world and has experience in working with big cats (particularly Tigers) in the Indian Subcontinent and elsewhere in the world.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it.<br/>• This specific wildlife tour is one of the few in the world that explores remote and wilderness areas of Nepal in the company of expert guides.<br/>• We provide camera traps for you to set up and you are free to use any and all of the photographs and videos that this camera trap gets during your stay.  <br/>• All the above reasons give this, our unique Chitwan &amp; Bardia Luxury Tiger Safari Holiday a great success rate of seeing rare wildlife.

The entry and exit port of this tour is the wonderful and iconic city of Kathmandu.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The fitness level required for our Luxury Chitwan &amp; Bardia Safari wildlife holiday is relatively high. This is because we include jungle hikes, these are either full days (7-8 hours) or half days (3-4 hours) inside the park hiking. The terrain is rough and the heat can be very hot and fatiguing. There are also dangerous animals around (such as rhinos and elephants) and on rare occasions evasive action is needed to avoid these animals.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.

    "generalInfo": "Known as the Kingdom of Lo until as recently as 2008, Mustang means \"fertile plain\" and is a vast and arid valley, distinguished by eroded canyons, vividly coloured stratified rock formations and barren high-altitude deserts. Geographically, this cold steppe is a part of the Tibetan highlands, with altitudes ranging from 10,000-13,000 feet (3000-4000m). <br/><br/>The area receives an average annual rainfall of less than 260 mm at Jomsom in the Lower Mustang and is generally dry. As the second least populated district of the country, it is rich in Buddhist culture, with local people's income derived largely through simple agriculture. <br/><br/>Foreign visitors have been allowed to the region since 1992, but tourism to Upper Mustang is regulated and foreigners need to obtain a special permit to enter. We spend a day in Kathmandu on your arrival, organising that for you and, of course, we will visit some of our favourite photographic haunts whilst the paperwork is being done.<br/><br/>Photographic opportunities will abound on this tour – ancient culture, people portraits, monasteries, and spectacular landscapes with the majestic backdrop of the Himalayan mountains. We will also explore traditional villages, caves and mule trails. <br/><br/>Transport is an essential consideration of a photography tour, so on this tour we include three separate domestic flights to cut down on travel time within the country. Although most people who visit this region like to trek, we have prioritised your comfort as a photographer and have arranged travel by Scorpio Jeeps. <br/><br/>With only three photographers in each vehicle, you are guaranteed a window seat and ample room for your equipment. We know this is a challenging drive but hope it gives us boundless opportunities for landscape photography, with roadside stops to take photographs of the locals working in the fields. <br/><br/>Anyone who has enjoyed either Ladakh or Nepal with us in the past will enjoy this tour as one step further on the road less travelled. Our advice is to get here fast and soak up the unique culture of this region in its rawest fashion before the superhighway and motels open along the whole route.",

Sandwiched between the mighty Himalayas to the north and the dry and hot lowlands of the Gangetic Plains to the south lie the parks of Chitwan and Bardia in the fertile Terai of Nepal. <br/><br/>These protected areas (particularly Chitwan) has healthy populations of tigers, Indian one-horned rhinos, Asiatic elephants, sloth bears, leopards, gharials and hundreds of other species living in the parks.<br/><br/>But this tour is not just about the sub-tropical forests and grasslands of the lowlands (terai) but our major focus on this trip is the incredible mountainous area around the 3rd highest mountain in the world (Kachenjunga) it is in the shadow of this mountain that you will hike the bamboo &amp; rhododendron forests in search of red pandas.<br/><br/>Here the small population of red pandas is being protected by an initiative set up by the Red Panda Network and the local forest guardians they are training. The rate of deforestation here is worrying and only by understanding and providing an income from the wildlife here do the forests stand a chance of being preserved.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included.

We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Nepal which explore other areas and focus on other species such as Jungle cats, Snow Leopards and Gangetic River Dolphins as well as many other species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.

This is because we include jungle hikes, these are either full days (7-8 hours) or half days (3-4 hours) inside the park hiking. The terrain is rough and the heat can be very hot and fatiguing. There are also dangerous animals around (such as rhinos and elephants) and on rare occasions evasive action is needed to avoid these animals. Then when looking for red pandas the paths are often very steep (on mountain and hill sides) as well as being at altitude, so a good level of fitness is required and whilst no experience of being at altitude is needed it is good if you have been at altitude previously.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking. We can also include specialist equipment on request such as camera traps, infrared cameras, thermal imaging equipment and spotlights.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 Years Old",

    "generalInfo": "This Nepal tiger safari holiday, a tailor made trip, is particularly spectacular because Nepal is one of the few places in the world where you can track tigers on foot and indeed we encounter more tigers  in the regions of Chitwan or Bardia National Parks on foot than anywhere else on Earth.<br/><br/>This is the beautiful and biodiverse Terai region of Nepal, southern sub-tropical mix of jungle, sal forest, grassland and river systems all of which are ideal habitat for tiger as well as many other  mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish.<br/><br/>The itinerary below is for Chitwan National Park, although we can create one for Bardia too of course. Both are the largest and most pristine national parks in the Terai, and you can explore them in a variety of ways. Drive around by jeep, walk through the forests and grasslands tracking the elusive big cat, cruise rivers in canoes or larger wooden boats or even go spotlighting after dark. Other wildlife to see on this trip includes: Asiatic elephants, Indian one-horned rhinos, leopards, jungle cats, sloth bears, Gangetic river dolphins and gharials. <br/><br/>All of our tiger safaris are guided by a local naturalist guides, drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible. This not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits. We are proud of the fact that we have a 75% success of spotting tigers in Nepal, with a 60% success in spotting them on foot whilst tracking tigers in Chitwan or Bardia. The fitness level required for our tiger safaris, is a moderate level of walking in Nepal (as tiger tracking on foot through the forests and grasslands can last for 7-8 hours). Minimum age is 18 years old. <br/><br/>The price of this holiday includes:<br/><br/>All activities, all meals, bottled water, air conditioned vehicles, local transfers, internal flights, guides, park entrance fees, reference library.<br/><br/>Best time to go on a tiger safari in Nepal<br/><br/>For tiger watching in Nepal we recommend mid January to mid May which is the middle and end of the hot dry season when wildlife gather at waterholes.",

    "placesVisited": "",
    "generalInfo": "Introduction:<br/>Nepal is home to a great diversity and abundance of amazing landscapes, habitats and wildlife; particularly mammals. It is these mammals which form the focus of this tour. We will travel across Nepal and visit several habitats to try and see a large diversity of mammal life. From tigers, Indian one-horned rhinos, Asiatic elephants and Gangetic river dolphins from the southern Terai regions to red pandas, Indochinese leopard cats and Himalayan thars in the sub Himalayan hills of Eastern Nepal. <br/><br/>Nepal's range of habitats covers the permanently frozen mountain tops of the high Himalayas through to the lush coniferous and rhododendron covered foothills to the subtropical jungles and thick grasslands of the fertile lowlands bordering India. This huge range of habitats and ecosystems has lead to Nepal to boast one of the best diversities of mammal and bird species for its land area in the world, it is also the size of this country that allows us to explore most of these ecosystems within a relatively short period of time. <br/><br/>This ultimate mammal watching tour of Nepal explores the two most famous national parks in Nepal. The subtropical forests and grasslands of Chitwan and Bardia National Parks. The jungles of these parks are full of rhinos, tigers, elephants and their waterways support gharials, crocodiles and populations of endangered Gangetic river dolphins. <br/><br/>We will also head into the far east of Nepal in search of the elusive and adorable red panda, as well as other mammals such as Himalayan tahr, Indochinese clouded leopard, Asiatic black bear and Himalayan serow. <br/><br/>We can also head higher up into the true Himalayas to try and find evidence of snow leopards and bharal (on request). <br/><br/>Led by expert naturalist guides with years of experience tracking and watching mammals throughout Nepal and local researchers studying red pandas and other species we are sure of an impressive haul of mammal sightings including up to 5 species of cat, 2 species bears and possibly 40plus species of mammals altogether.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned. There will be filtered or boiled water available for each guest each day. We have our own private AC vehicles with an excellent driver for all vehicular transfers. All internal flights needed in the itinerary (bookings in economy class). You will have a local cultural and naturalist guides. The guides have spent years in Nepal and know the places and wildlife and local villages. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Best time to go on a mammal watching safari in Nepal:<br/><br/>For mammal watching in the terai we recommend mid January to mid May which is the middle and end of the hot dry season when wildlife gather at waterholes. For looking for wildlife in the sub Himalayan is best in the spring and autumn, so the best overall time of year for this trip is April.<br/><br/>Why choose this tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced local naturalist or guides as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it.<br/>• This specific wildlife tour is one of the few in the world that explores remote and wilderness areas of Bhutan in the company of expert guides.<br/>• We provide camera traps for you to set up and you are free to use any and all of the photographs and videos that this camera trap gets during your stay.  <br/>• All the above reasons give this, our unique mammal watching safari holiday a great success rate of seeing rare wildlife. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Nepal which explore other areas and focus on other species such as Jungle cats, Snow Leopards and Red pandas as well as many other species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari. We are also experts in organising treks in the Nepalese Himalayas.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/>• We also contribute to Tour Operators for Tigers (TOFT) which is an NGO in the the Indian Subcontinent which is dedicated the sustainable and eco friendly future of tiger tourism. <br/> <br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour explores the massive, famous parks of Chitwan and Bardia in the south of Nepal and we also visit the Kachenjunga massif for high altitude wildlife in the east of the country. The entry and exit port of this tour is the wonderful and iconic city of Kathmandu.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The fitness level required for our Mammal Watching Safari is relatively high. This is because we include jungle hikes, these are either full days (7-8 hours) or half days (3-4 hours) inside the park hiking. The terrain is rough and the heat can be very hot and fatiguing. There are also dangerous animals around (such as rhinos and elephants) and on rare occasions evasive action is needed to avoid these animals. We also include hiking at altitude (around 3,000-3,800m above sea level), the paths can be steep also.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.

    "generalInfo": "Travel to the far east of Nepal and in the Himalayan foothills you will track down red pandas and other rare mammals on this unique mammal watching holiday of Nepal. Recent genetic studies has split the red panda species into two different species, one in China and one in Nepal, the Nepalese red panda is only reliable seen in a couple of locations. This tour takes you into the heart of one of those reliable locations. <br/><br/>As well as red pandas there are many species that inhabit these forested hills, a mix of rhododendron forest and bamboo groves these slopes are steep and teeming with life. Over the last few years the hard work of NGO's and dedicated local forest guardians the area has been well protected and replanting has overtaken deforestation. The result is a good area of sub-Himalayan highlands now bountiful with wildlife.<br/><br/>This tour offers a great opportunity to visit a very seldom visited part of Nepal and a chance to find some of the most beautiful and elusive animals the world has to offer. Species such as red pandas, clouded leopards, Himalayan thar, Asiatic black bear and yellow-throated martens are all dwelling in the dense forests here.<br/><br/>Whilst spotting a red panda and other species in the wild can never be guaranteed, sightings are certainly increasing as guides get better and better at knowing where and what to look for.<br/><br/>This is an excellent tour for responsible travellers, the major conservation work carried out in this region is undertaken by an NGO which is looking for official protection at national level for this location. It is in conjunction with this NGO that we travel and look for these animals. In doing so we make sure that the local area is protected in the long term as well as for our visit.<br/><br/>By employing local people as our guides and our wildlife spotting team, and by staying in local guesthouses in Dobate village (in the heart of red panda territory) we contribute directly to sustainable eco-tourism in this amazing location. We also use the latest equipment when it comes to finding red pandas and other wildlife including: high powered HD spotting scopes, camera traps, spotlights and even night vision and thermal imaging (on request).<br/><br/>We also boast an impressive record when it comes to the number of sightings. On our most recent tour we spotted 3 different red pandas. We regularly record lots of mammal and bird species on this tour and are convinced that any wildlife enthusiast will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>The best time to see mammal species in this area of Nepal:<br/><br/>The best (and perhaps only) seasons when mammals are relatively easy to see in these forested hills are the shoulder months of the monsoon and summer seasons of the far eastern Himalayan foothills. The spring is from mid March to mid May and then the autumn is from October through to November. During this time of year the temperatures are around 20C during the day, it is relatively dry and the skies clear and blue. In between these seasons is the very different monsoon period. During the monsoon the torrential rainfall makes moving around the forested hills dangerous for us and so we avoid the monsoon season. <br/><br/>Fitness levels required:<br/><br/>As the tour is predominantly located at altitude (9,800ft -13,000ft) a good level of fitness is required or at least experience at hill walking. However we must stress that all trekking is done at your own pace, the longest treks (in one continuous walk) are around an hour and most are usually less than an hour.<br/><br/>Equipment needed:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment. But here is a brief outline of the basics: binoculars or spotting scope; clothing should be light and durable walking clothes (such as khaki shirts and khaki trousers as well as very warm winter clothes, such as waterproof jackets, trousers, hiking socks, gloves, hats, scarves, fleeces, thermals underwear, long-sleeve polypropylene vests etc.) These are not essential but it can get cold during the evenings and night at this altitude and rain is common throughout the year. Broken in and comfortable (waterproof) walking boots with ankle support are essential. Please bring plenty of memory cards or film for your camera. As there is some power in the park please bring spare batteries for any electrical equipment. Also do not forget sun cream, sun hat and sun glasses as the sun can be strong here during the day. Snacks and sugary foods are a good idea, especially if you have any favourites from home that may be difficult to source in Nepal.<br/><br/>Minimum age: 16 years<br/><br/>Picture credits:<br/><br/>Dr. Raju Kasambe, CC BY-SA 4.0 <br/>Rushenb, CC BY 2.0 <br/>Cks3976, CC BY-SA 3.0",

This festival commemorates the victory of Lord Buddha's incarnation Dorjee Sonnu over a demon called Man Tam Ru a vicious creature feeding on human beings and causing storms and droughts.<br/><br/>During the festival, the monks of Lo Manthang's \"Choedhe\" monastery perform ritual dances during the celebration. The harassment of Ma Tam Ru Ta (in a dance called \"Tsa Chham\" on the first day), the birth of Dorjee Sonnu as the demon's son (on the second day called \"Nga Chham\") and then attempt to return the demon to Lord Buddha's realm (on the third and final day) are enacted during the performances.<br/><br/>The Tiji festival dances are all organized by the Choedhe Monastery - the Sakya sect of Buddhism.<br/><br/>This trek guiding to the forbidden kingdom of Nepal along the ancient trade route between Nepal and Tibet exploiting the lowest pass of the Kora La through the Himalaya west of Sikkim falls under moderate trek. One must be physically fit and keep an eye open for signs of altitude sickness due to thinning air with the rising elevation.<br/><br/>Explore the magnificence of Tiji festival of the untrodden upper mustang closely knit by religion with Upper Mustang – Tiji Festival.",

Cracked brick houses celebrate alternative deities along narrow streets, figurines that honor the gods decorate courtyards, and temples remain the centerpiece of daily life. While many of the smaller pagoda temples have collapsed, icons like Sundari Chowk and Krishna Mandir remain in a remarkable state of preservation. Patan Durbar Square doesn’t look like it used to, but then again this square has always evolved as buildings have been added over the centuries. The reconstruction process is in full swing and Patan Durbar Square’s site director provides an intimate insight into what’s happened and what will happen next. Individual buildings are sponsored by specific countries, as foreign aid from China, the US, Australia, and beyond have reshaped the landscape. Some temples are being taken down brick by brick, so they can be rebuilt again. Everything is documented and recorded, with huge slabs of stonework resting before being restored. It’s estimated that another 25 years are needed before this World Heritage Site returns to its pristine state and you’ll witness the process as it is just beginning. After half a day in Patan, you visit Kathmandu Durbar Square, where a similar process is underway and the temples reveal how architectural styles evolved over the last eight centuries."

From Sarangkot you’ll travel a little further along the ridgeline, to a small monastery that remains mostly off the beaten track. Silence reigns as you’re introduced to the basics of meditation and the setting will be perfect for this practice. The afternoon will be free and you’ll have a driver-guide to take you around Pokhara. Stand before the World Peace Pagoda as it glows white against the blue sky. Disappear into Gupteshwar Cave and wonder as to its religious history. Follow the sounds to Devi’s Fall, a peculiar cascade with a mysterious past. The small town is easy to get around on foot although you can also get out to nearby villages for a more strenuous walk today. Complete the day on Phewa Lake, where mountains are mirrored on the glassy surface and Pokhara’s legendary tranquility continues."

Secrets can be found within their folds including monastic retreats, Sherpa villages, glaciers, and ice falls, plus an unerring solitude. These are secrets you can’t see from the outside looking in, but things you must discover when trekking through the mountains. Rugged trails connect villages, as they take you deeper into a land of towering peaks. With each step you take, the solitude will increase and the serenity provides space to think. The vistas will be brilliant and you’ll feel a sense of achievement as you have a chance to connect with local people in small villages. Most of all, a multi-day Nepalese trek will be a time and space to think about you. You will begin by walking to the village of Ghorepani, first through rhododendron forests then up thick stone steps past monasteries and temples. Cross mountains escarpments and spin the prayer wheels as caravans of donkeys wander past the other way. Wander across bridges and stop to feel the fresh coolness of river water. Walk beneath mountain shadows then come to viewpoints bathed in sunshine. Nature will humble you as you are enveloped by the wild and then comforted by teahouses along the way. This is a wild mountain region but each night you’ll settle into warm and relaxing accommodations that have traditionally been used to host people traveling on foot. Rise early to summit Poon Hill while bands of red, yellow, and gold cover the horizon as some of the world’s tallest mountains begin to reveal themselves. Wind rushes past your ears as the valley comes into view and you realize just how far and how high you have traveled. Poon Hill will be a beautiful introduction to multi-day trekking, which is stunning to behold without having to disappear much deeper into the mountains. Then, you’ll trek back down to spend the night in Pokhara and look back at the landscape with which you are connected."

You ride on top of one during a rhino safari, with the late afternoon being the best time to see the one-horned mammals out in the open. Munching on grass as they go, these great armored giants are another work of nature that can stun you into silence.

Spotting a tiger is rare but there will be far more to discover here beyond the striped cats. On a river safari, you cruise quietly through this landscape, inspecting the four-legged mammals coming for a drink, perhaps getting a little startled at a crocodile sunbathing on the banks.

After brunch back at the lodge, you will drive north to Bandipur, an old bazaar town perched on a precipitous ridge. Small and surreal, this little haven is surrounded by seemingly endless panoramas. At its heart, you find the daily bustle of market life, with goods spilling from small stalls and locals flashing gold teeth as they smile their distinctive smiles. A guide will take you on a tour, from the old-world temples to the marketplace. Then you’re free to explore, for this is a town where you must take your time and discover nooks and crannies for yourself. Bandipur is also home to stunning boutique hotels, throwbacks to the decadent days of medieval trading when wealthy marketers wanted an upmarket place to stay.

Many of the smaller temples and pagodas were destroyed here and some of the rubble remains in the streets. However, Nyatapola Temple still stands tall, as this five-story pagoda is seemingly unchanged since the 18th century. Once you walk a little further, a local guide will introduce the story of Changu Narayan Temple, a World Heritage Temple that’s been reconstructed and re-opened to the public in less than three years. As you walk even further, you will find that this microcosm of Nepalese history is alive with sights, sounds, and the strange meanderings of local cows.

Enjoy taking in the sites at a slow pace before you return to the hotel rooftop to relax. Like each day in India, you’ll be led by an expert guide, who shows you the destination through local eyes."

        "description": "In the next few days, you’ll discover that Varanasi rewards slow travel. Approximately 3000 years of history emanates from the haphazard walls, attracting devotees to an overflowing excess of temples and shrines. Narrow alleyways are lined with temple deities and mysterious archways while lumbering cows stop and sleep, requiring the street food carts to choose a different route. Incense flumes greet you on corners while funeral processions carry bodies on bamboo stretchers. Monkeys live on the rooftops while tiny food stalls send their smells through the narrowest of lanes and children fly kites over the Ganges. You will have a local guide who accompanies you everywhere in Varanasi, something that will be highly valuable while navigating the fascinating maze of the pedestrianized Old City. During your stay, your guide will plan a flexible itinerary that does not rush you through the attractions. One of the essentials will be a sunrise boat ride on the Ganges, some time spent at the holy burning ghat, and a candlelit sunset ceremony at the river. For many, this city reflects the magic of India, right down to the flower markets and confusing rituals."

An abundance of old temples fill the town’s center, each seemingly more elaborate than the last. Small palaces showcase an otherworldly opulence, with Orchha Palace the grand dame of forgotten Mughal architecture. You can travel anywhere by foot, giving you plenty of time during your visit to be immersed in the 16th-century Indian backwater city."

Traveling by train is an iconic Indian experience, and this route is air-conditioned and first class, giving you quiet time to absorb the rural impressions through the window. When you arrive in Agra, you will not immediately visit the Taj Mahal. Instead, you’ll take time to explore the region’s equally impressive but less recognized attractions. Begin with part-fortress and part-palace, Agra Fort, a sandstone giant that glistens deep crimson in the fading afternoon light. All over Agra you’ll find sublime examples of Mughal architecture, many of them overlooked by tourists. Explore them with a guide and you’ll also get to know the architectural building blocks that gave rise to the Mughal ode to love."

Calligraphic messages wrap around the monument, and they beckon you inside, where the architectural opulence comes as a surprise. Almost everyone has seen photos of the Taj Mahal, but few have considered consider how beautiful it must be on the inside. Take your time and enjoy the morning around this pre-eminent Mughal monument, before the afternoon takes you off the beaten path, with Persian mosques and Akbar’s Mausoleum among the highlights."

This city was the Mughal capital for a fleeting few years in the 16th century, but the royal town was eventually abandoned and left to the desert dust. Even today it feels like a ghost town, a showcase of architectural might that almost looks out of place. Persian and Hindu styles merge together and the more you walk around, the more you’ll get to discover. From here you continue across the ochre plains of Rajasthan to arrive in the Pink City for an afternoon in the markets. After the 16th-century you’re now in a city that brings history into today, which is exemplified by bazaars of cramped stalls and enigmatic smiles."

You will feel as if you could spend forever watching this view of forests in the valley below, ochre-colored dirt paths twisting away, and the sun setting behind the world’s highest mountains. Nagarkot is famous for Himalayan views and its sunrise and sunset that will impress you as the landscape changes color at a delightfully slow pace. It’s a view that welcomes you to Nepal and provides the backdrop for the next four days. Once you touch down at Tribhuvan International Airport, an experienced local guide will meet you. From here a private transfer will escort you into the mountain foothills and Nagarkot village. Far enough away to provide serenity, yet close enough to the Kathmandu Valley highlights, Nagarkot is a quiet village with a handful of lodges perched on the ridgeline. Small market stalls line the lanes, hiking trails twist out from all over the village, and when the sun starts to set all the locals also enjoy the view. Settle into the luxury lodge, and you’ll already feel Nepal pulling you into its rhythm."

Then, delight in the fact that you will have several more opportunities to enjoy the morning show. After breakfast, you will take a stroll, first through the village, where locals wave hello and you’re given the utmost respect. Age is highly revered in Nepal, a country where elders are always held in high esteem. This is extended to foreign visitors and the older you are the more you receive obsequious treatment. It will also be easy to communicate here since Nepal is a country of many tribal languages, which use English as a common denominator. From the village, you keep walking, along a trail that weaves through rhododendron and bamboo forests. As the trees begin to thin, the views will extend and the Everest region rolls out towards the horizon. Although you’re not at any great altitude (below 6,500 feet), when you walk along a ridgeline you’ll begin to understand the appeal of trekking in Nepal. It will be a chance to explore otherworldly landscapes at your own pace. There will be plenty of options for the length of the trek, from two to four hours, all completed at a speed that suits you. Then, stop for tea and lunch in a village before you return back to Nagarkot for another sunset."

When you look across at the mountains, you will feel humbled by nature before you spend the day discovering another side of the country. A five-story pagoda will be your compass point on the journey to Bhaktapur, one of three ancient kingdoms that once stood side by side in the valley. Other temples will impress you with their ornate carvings and peculiar clouds of incense. Some are cracked from earthquake damage but that somehow makes them feel more authentic. This architecture from past centuries wears its earthquake scars with pride as the dust and fissures seem to naturally reflect its age. After lunch at a small local restaurant, you will continue through the valley to Changu, a village hidden amongst forest and charm. It will be here that you explore Nepal’s oldest temple while a local guide narrates the legends of the architecture. With its history and spirituality, this temple is incredibly important to local Hindus, and you’ll witness as locals conduct a puja (ceremony) at the temple. As a senior traveler you may be invited to join one of these, or at least be a close witness to what’s going on. Return to Nagarkot and the lodge, where that sunset view only seems to be getting better."

Namo Buddha was where Buddha offered his body to a starving tiger in a moment of spontaneous compassion. It’s long been a pilgrimage spot for people as they arrive from distant lands. Travel across a Himalayan valley to the trailhead and as you start walking the mountains will loom higher. You’ll stop to breathe and inhale the fresh alpine air. It’ll be a slow walk uphill and you may fall into pace with local pilgrims, who emanate an energy that’s quick to inspire. A snow-covered Himalayan range paints the horizon as these slow footsteps bring you to Namo Buddha in less than two hours. Once you reach the mountaintop temple, there will be peace as monks meditate serenely and small lines of pilgrims enter the site. Emotion will be clearly visible in many of the patrons, although there’s an equally impressive equanimity on the faces of others. While the temple isn’t particularly big, or as ornate as those in Bhaktapur, there’ll be a wonderful atmosphere to enjoy. There’ll be plenty of opportunities to chat with other pilgrims, who share what Namo Buddha means to them. And it’s almost certain that you’ll soak up some of the founding Buddhist principles. Walk downhill as slowly as you came up and gaze out toward the mountains as prayer wheels chime from where you just left. Back at the lodge, you will enjoy your final Everest sunset."

Then tiny villages down below will begin to emerge, along with rice fields and ochre-colored pathways. Eventually, the ridges rise higher and the valleys get deeper as towering mountains flank the landscape. The first of these giants are only topped with snow but soon the entire mountain is a blanket of snow and ice. You’re flying toward Everest, cruising alongside the world’s highest mountains. Everest isn’t alone here and its neighbors are just as impressive and some peaks appear twisted and unruly while others have a shape that could have been painted by a child. Soon you will come alongside Everest itself and admire its brutality, how it rises above glaciers and icefalls, how it marks the boundary with the Tibetan Plateau. This fixed-wing scenic flight will offer the easiest look at Nepal’s most famous attraction, with the plane swooping around so there’s an uninterrupted view from every seat. Once you return to Kathmandu, you will spend a day in the city. Gold glistens as you enter a small temple, where incense burns alongside spirituality. A monk greets you outside the most important Tibetan stupas outside Tibet, providing insight into another Nepalese place of pilgrimage. Out on the streets of Thamel you’ll also make cultural connections, as many of the locals are keen to share conversation with esteemed older guests. Rather than return to Nagarkot, you spend a night in the city, which will be a slight change of tempo that still offers plenty of tranquility after dusk."

Pokhara is draped around Phewa Lake and backdropped by the Annapurna range of mountains. Sunset here is a little different to Nagarkot, as the mountains reflect back up off the water’s glassy surface. Once you touch down, you’ll enjoy coffee on the lakeshore, before you embark on a short journey into the valley and a monastery perched above Pokhara. Monks will invite you inside, where a special blessing ceremony takes place. It’s only for you, and they wish you good fortune in your travels while offering a unique insight into a Buddhist sanctuary’s inner workings.

After breakfast you head off deeper into nature, traveling through the Pokhara Valley to Seti River Gorge, where you will admire the brutal power of nature rather than just its beauty. Stop in Dobilla Village for Himalayan coffee, which is grown on nearby slopes. Then, weave across the plains to Begnas Lake where a small boat will take you around this piece of tranquility in the mountains. Nepal’s great highlights concern the natural landscape. While the country is famous for the highest mountains, Himalayan landscapes are settings to connect with not places to conquer. The guide will paddle slowly along Begnas Lake and point out rare birds that flutter around the reeds. You cruise serenely towards a remote part of the lake, where there’s a chance to stretch the legs on a hike or a fishing excursion. Gurgling natural streams will welcome you to the private tour’s final spot, a spa resort that you can use at your leisure.

Walk slowly and you will soak up the setting, from the snowy mountains on high to endemic flowers and subtle details all along the trail. As the day of trekking in Nagarkot, there will be a choice of routes today, all of them into areas that can’t be reached by vehicles. You’ll start by driving an hour north of Pokhara, where you can access the trailhead and quickly get into wilderness areas. Mani stones line the trail and they contain painted messages of peace and harmony. Small stupas also dot the route, many of them showing a harmony between Hindu and Buddhist ideals. Whether it’s two hours or the whole day, you’ll experience village life along the trail and appreciate the solitude that exists in these iconic mountains.

This will leave an afternoon to hang around the village and gain a first-hand understanding of local culture high in the Himalayas."

        "description": "The following morning, Manaslu will be the towering part of the panorama as you keep climbing higher. Although the route passes in and out of forests, mostly juniper and birch, the day is memorable for the world’s eighth highest mountain. You’ll walk on Manaslu, rising steadily to the mountain’s base camp. Otherworldly views extend from here, and not just of Manaslu’s alpine neighbors. Tilt your head back to admire the brute brilliance of the mountain, such nuance on its slopes, such expressions of power coming down from above. While it doesn’t have the fame of Everest or Annapurna basecamps, this is still one of the world’s tallest ten mountains. So congratulate yourself on the achievement and take that feeling onwards to Samdo, a village where you’ll hear stories from Tibetan refugees."

While Manaslu has only recently opened to foreign trekkers, Tibetans and Gurungs living life on two feet have long covered the region. Larkya Glacier provides another distinguishable highlight of the trek and you’ll have uninterrupted views on this short day of steep ascending to Dharamsala."

However, it is an exquisite place to be as grand mountains on both sides surround you. While you walk westwards, Annapurna II replaces Manaslu as the landscape’s main compass point. It’s easier going during the descent, especially when you realize that this route has provided you with some of the Annapurna region’s highlights, and you still have only encountered a handful of other trekkers."

In the encompassing silence you’ll able to connect with yourself, and unravel the threads of thought that get so knotted in fast-paced Western lifestyles.

For many centuries teahouses have been simple, welcoming places for those on foot to get a hot meal and a comfortable place to rest their head and enjoy plenty of warming tea as well. As they’ve adjusted to foreign visitors the facilities have improved and during this trek, you’ll stay at the best teahouses available. They will provide you with a charming, comfortable, and easy alternative to camping and carrying all that bulky gear."

The odd artificial noise drifts up from the streets, but it’s drowned out by the sound of rushing wind. Valleys extend into the distance and create stark shapes that cut through the low-lying haze. Mountains punctuate the horizon to offer you glimpses of a remote Himalayan world. Lush tropical vegetation marks the foreground, giving the rooftop a very natural feel. This haven above the city will be a place to retreat into your own world. Inhale. As you exhale and tune your senses, you will escape into this space. The sun starts to set as the session continues and it casts a deep orange glow over the rooftop and its surroundings. Mountains appear more dominant in this receding light as they create formidable silhouettes to keep you humble. This will be the first of many yoga sessions and it is designed as an introduction to connecting you with the basics. Yoga is much simpler than the complicated poses that are posted on social media, it’s a connection to yourself and that starts by reconnecting with its foundations. Soon the sun will be gone and you walk out into the city, wandering with an inner glow that helps you take in more of the streets and the sights."

It drifts upwards from behind the Himalayas, and it casually illuminates each of the mountains. On a clear day, you can see distant snow, a sharp contrast to the humid city air. From this beautiful viewpoint, you will start the day with an hour of yoga before you dine on a healthy vegetarian breakfast at a small cafe nearby. After breakfast, you will begin to explore. First, you journey to Bhaktapur, where a five-story pagoda escaped serious earthquake damage with only a few small cracks that make the temples more alluring. Next, you travel to the heart of Kathmandu, Durbar Square, a place where royal histories and spiritual heritage come together. Earthquake damage is conspicuous here but there are reasons to be optimistic, like a temple that has been rebuilt brick by brick and the ornate wooden figures that continue to line archways. Incense spreads out across the central square, random cows wander past, and colorful saris provide a picturesque scene. After you visit two World Heritage Sites you will return to the hotel and the rooftop where your sunset yoga practice brings a relaxed end to a day of sights."

Then, let your eyelids softly close and feel how your senses are heightened. This is the best way to start your day, as it is a time to connect with yourself before you are connected to the rest of the world. It will leave you in a fresh frame of mind, energized to explore the city’s other highlights. When you arrive at the hilltop monument, monkeys will be the first thing you see, as these small red-faced primates swing around Swayambhunath. Take a close look at the stupas here and absorbing the mix of Hindu and Buddhist iconography. On most stupas, the two religions are combined, with Shiva appearing alongside Buddha, and complementary religious ideas coming together rather than being separated. All across Nepal, you’ll see this harmonious trend. Nepal is the land of Buddha while it is statistically a predominantly Hindu nation, yet religion is fluid here. From Swayambhunath you will drive across the city to Boudhanath, and join the pilgrims that circumnavigate the holiest Tibetan Buddhist temple outside Tibet. Glowing white in the afternoon light and permeating with a sense of peace and tranquility, Boudhanath provides a quiet place to spend the afternoon. Relax on a rooftop terrace that overlooks the pagoda, soak up the feeling of spirituality, and feel how Buddhist practices have a profound impact in this part of the world. Like the previous day, you will enjoy a sunset yoga session before an evening at leisure."

Through meditation and breathing, there will be an emphasis on savoring every moment, something that can provide a new perspective when you explore. You’ll travel slower after morning practice, which means you can take in more of the subtleties and nuance. After a free morning in Kathmandu, you’ll be transferred to the airport for the short flight to Chitwan National Park, where the landscape is entirely different and it will not take long before your first glimpse of an elephant. A four-wheel drive safari reveals more life as you will follow the prints left behind rhinos and the unusual calls of endemic birds. In the evening, sunset yoga will be practiced down by the Rapti River while warm dusk colors reflect off the glassy water. Baritone hoots echo from the trees, which is probably an elephant herd on their late-afternoon wander. As the practice continues and you try new Asanas (postures) the soundtrack will start to change and the chatter of insects will come alive in dusk light. You’ll be immersed in nature, deep within a World Heritage jungle and surrounded by impressions of life. This setting will be quick to instill a relaxed mindset as you enjoy your first night at a remote eco-lodge."

Practicing yoga in nature is always inspiring, and it helps to tune your body and mind to a natural rhythm, However, practicing yoga in a national park is invigorating, and it provides energy and zest for a day of exploration. In the morning you will take a walk through the jungle to learn about tracking and spoor while you come face to face with the greatest animals that walk the planet. Tigers live here, although you will need some good fortune to spot one but just glimpsing a paw print in the sand will bring you goosebumps. Elephants have always occupied these trees and the famous animal highlight wanders of rhinos as they cross your vision. A walking safari will extend your connection to the landscape since you can get incredibly close to the giants. A rhino will look much bigger when you’re also standing on the ground, looking across at its single, pointed horn. A four-wheel drive safari covers more distance, so you’ll see more animals on the way and get incredibly close to them. Back at the eco-lodge, you unwind with restorative yoga, as your body and soul gets further tuned to the rhythmic cycle of the wild. Then, a rhino will walk past your lodge. Jungle safari are full of impressive moments like this, where nature reveals its secrets when you least expect it."

Enter the river and shift forward as the elephant sits down on its back legs then brings its head and neck down. Trunks splash against the water, perhaps also squirting water into the air and right back towards you. After this morning bath you will return to the eco-lodge and freshen up before the flight to Pokhara, where you’ll be greeted by blissful views of the Himalayas. Evening yoga will be on the shores of Phewa Lake, a vast body of water that Pokhara is draped around. Look up and you will see towering Himalayan peaks, then look across the water and you get a glimpse of a temple at the heart of the lake. It will feel like a classic setting for yoga practice that forges a harmony with the mountains where yoga has some of its roots.

This is the ideal setting for intrepid yogis to further their practice with challenging asanas. Snow-dappled mountains emerge from shadows, alpine panoramas extend for 270 degrees, and the only sound is the wind through the air. As always, the session will be led by a skilled and experienced teacher. You’ll learn from a variety of teachers during the course of this yoga tour, each with their own methods. Other than the morning yoga practice, today will be free for you to enjoy the great outdoors. Choose to paraglide off Sarangkot, perhaps in the company of an Egyptian vulture. Go zip lining across mountain valleys, a new angle on an otherworldly landscape. Cycle to small villages, perhaps by first getting driven to the ridgeline for an easy peddle down. Choose a day of hiking, with a number of excellent hikes on mountain slopes surrounding Pokhara. There’s even skydiving and bungee jumping here.

As incense swirls, you will receive a blessing from the monks, a profound moment that wishes you good fortune for the journey ahead. There will be time afterward to meet with the monks more informally and converse with those that live here. There will be more stories to hear nearby, where you meet a community of exiled Tibetans, who are unflinching in their honesty. Also on the journey today you can stop at some of Pokhara’s highlights, like Devi’s Falls and the World Peace Pagoda.

Although the 2015 earthquake impacted the capital, its spirit hasn’t been diminished. So along with the cracked roads, you will spot lines of excitable pilgrims, people communicating through deities, and friendly smiles that help set the scene. Check into the hotel early and join the guide for Himalayan coffee, an excellent opportunity to gain context in your private tour of two medieval kingdoms. It wasn’t that long ago that Kathmandu was the beating heart of three different kingdoms and your cultural and adventure trip will offer a unique impression into this past world. Start your exploration in Patan, where a gold-inscribed temple is found amid a cloud of incense, and the intricacy of woodcarving surrounds a royal bathhouse. Then, you’ll continue to an enormous stupa, where a rooftop cafe terrace overlooks the throngs of visiting pilgrims. Explore the heart of Kathmandu’s kingdom, and follow an architectural and historical journey through 13th to 15th and 18th-century styles. As you continue through the city there’ll be a chance to stop at a holy cremation site, which adds yet more spirituality to the day.

Today, you’ll travel to remote hiking trails that lead you on a journey across rhododendron forests and mountain slopes. Villages dot the route, and you will admire the quietude of these places that are unconnected by road. As locals wander past, you’ll appreciate the serenity of a remote home. With a local guide, you travel between villages on the trail, choosing between a variety of circular, one-way, and one-way-and-return routes. You’ll soon discover that Himalayan trekking isn’t just about scaling mountains. It’s about a connection with the natural world, so whether it’s two or eight hours on the trail, this day of trekking will provide a distinctive experience. Glimpses of Mt. Everest are a highlight in this part of the world, but you’ll find that there are thousands of viewpoints along the trail, each seemingly more impressive than the last. Walk slow and steady to soak up your surroundings, from Tibetan monasteries to calligraphic Mani stones and those mountain vistas that keep rolling on and on. Changu Narayan Temple, a Vishnu shrine along the trail, will be just one beautiful stopping point on your journey.

A scenic flight is the most efficient way to visit, and although it’s only a glimpse, it’s a breathtaking glimpse of the world’s highest mountain range.

After your flight, you’ll return to Kathmandu elated, with unforgettable memories of the soaring mountains. With the rest of the day in the city, you travel out to the third of the old kingdoms to spend a day in the back streets of old. Lined with sublime structures and a charming architectural style, Bhaktapur’s monuments were barely impacted by the earthquake.

You could drive or fly to Pokhara from Kathmandu, but it’s far more unique to break up the journey with some time in a raft. It’ll be a wild ride that’s open to all ability levels, with experienced guides keeping you afloat on the more challenging sections. The Trisuli is ideal for beginners because there are various sections to paddle on, dependent on the interests of the group. You’ll drop into the water and spend half the day paddling. Then, enjoy a packed lunch on an otherwise deserted riverine beach before you rejoin the road to complete the journey west. When you make it to the lakeside town by sunset, the daily show of light and mountain will play out across the water.

Take a walk around Phewa Lake then paddle out onto the water to see the mountain’s reflection, as boating is the quintessential activity in a town that’s dominated by the lake. Tal Barahi Temple stands in the middle of the water, a place to travel to on a motorized boat and connect with the strange allure of Phewa. You’ll spend the rest of the day exploring the surroundings. First, drop in on the World Peace Pagoda where a Buddhist stupa glimmers white in the afternoon light, and a community of Tibetan refugees welcome you with open arms. Dependent on the mood you can also take a journey out to Devi’s Falls, or visit a monastery and temple that feels very different from Kathmandu. The Old Bazaar is packed with color while Bindhyabasini Mandir reflects Pokhara’s glorious history. Most of all, Nepal is an escape and this day in Pokhara is all about that feeling of getaway.

Pokhara and the lake are down below, even more serene from the lofty vantage point. Then, in the afternoon, you can take to the sky again to ride the world’s longest zip line. The late-afternoon activity will be in a local kitchen, where a Nepalese chef takes you through the basics of flavorful and varied cuisine. Influences come from India, Tibet, and China, to mix with organic produce and create something that’s undeniably Nepalese.

The high Himalayas impress in the distance as the trail takes you through a handful of small Nepalese villages. Stop and linger in these villages, and you’ll start making cultural connections, perhaps at a monastery, a temple, a small cafe with plastic tables, or outside a stone house hanging above the valley. Now cycle downhill to a remote section of the lakeshore, where there will be a lovely picnic spot alongside the water.

Two minarets soar 135 feet tall and ring with the elegant Call to Prayer five times a day. The eastern gate once saw regular use by the imperial family. The minaret provides a sensational view of the mosque and the old city from atop 121 steps.

The fortified city is located less than 30 miles west of Agra and contains a fortified position to protect the political center of the empire designed and dictated by Emperor Akbar. He also erected three palaces, one for each of his favorite wives, one who was Muslim, one who was Hindu, and another who was Christian. Citizens of Fatehpur Sikri abandoned the masterful work of architecture shortly after the emperor’s death due to water shortages in the area. Jama Masjid, the main mosque of the city, contains elements of Persian and Indian design. A flight of stone stairs leads to the entrance located beneath a remarkable 177-foot tall Victory Gate, which was erected to commemorate the emperor’s military victory in Gujarat.

It took 20,000 men more than 20 years to complete the structure. Marble and precious stones add remarkable splendor to the enchanting architectural design. The onion-shaped dome reaches a height of 240 feet tall, centered between the four separate minarets. The gardens encompass more than 40 acres and guide visitors to the tomb entrance. The stones, such as lapis lazuli and mother of pearl, form twining vines, fruits, and flowers around the walls and inlaid surfaces. Each chamber contains a bas-relief refined with calligraphic quotations from the Quran inlaid with jasper. Elegance and grandeur combine around the elaborate design. When the sun begins to rise, the light casts brilliant colors across the pristine façade, altering the marble stones.

The city is located at nearly 4,600 feet above sea level in the Kathmandu Valley, surrounded by the Himalayan foothills. Parts of Nepal’s capital city are still feeling the effects of the 2015 earthquake that caused devastation around the valley floor and up into the hills. However, the life of the city remains constant and has mostly recovered its captivating combination of color, sounds, and aromas. Rickshaws race through old town and medieval temples continue to ring prayer bells throughout the day. The back streets hold a remarkable timelessness representing the artistic heritage in hidden temples shimmering with blossoming marigolds and courtyards dusted with the scent of drying chilies and rice. Swapna Bagaicha , the Garden of Dreams, is one of the most tranquil locations in the city. Although the site is only a two-minute walk from the bustling heart of Thamel, the commercial district of the capital, it feels miles away. The garden and pavilions retain gorgeous detail, including marble inscriptions on the original gate. Fountains and ponds trickling add to the serene ambiance inside the single acre that remains of the original 40 acres. Nepali couples relax on the lawn mats supplied by the garden and enjoy a quiet moment wrapped in each other’s arms."

The tangy aroma drifts upwards from the amber-colored autumn flush tea. Your private transfer greets you before sunrise and escorts you to the airport to board the plane bound for the summit of Mount Everest, the largest mountain in the world at more than 29,000 feet above sea level. The 50-minute flight travels over 20 miles from Kathmandu to reach the breathtaking mastiff dusted with snow. You have a view of the neighboring peaks of Lhotse and Makalu, which reach over 27,900 and above 27,800 feet above sea level respectively, providing a visual of the contrasting heights. The pilot shares the folklore of the mountain, accounting for the traditions, customs, and folklore that residents of Nepal and Tibet associate with the staggering peak. You return to Kathmandu to meet your guide for a private tour of the fascinating city, blending spiritual history with fast-paced modernity. The royal palace of Hanuman Dhoka was founded during the Licchavi period between the 4th and 8th centuries. The compound expanded in the 17th century, but the 2015 earthquake caused significant damage to the grounds. However, reconstruction is underway to return the royal courtyards and museum to their former glory. Turn your attention instead to the rectangular courtyard of Itum Bahal, the Buddhist monastery located in the historical quarter. The grounds remain a haven of serenity amidst the chaotic streets of central Kathmandu. A Bodhi tree grows through the center of the pagoda in front of the entrance."

Rickshaws return to the streets of the Old Quarter, and old men linger around newspaper vendors in the heart of Indra Chowk, the main square. Your guide escorts you out of town for the day, leading you to the ancient culture and fascinating history of the Kathmandu Valley, beginning with the city of Bhaktapur, the third medieval city-state in the valley. The scars of the 2015 earthquake remain visible in the city once described as the best-preserved medieval city in the country. However, the city maintains its namesake of Bhadgon , which means “City of Devotees.” The dedicated residents are eager to rebuild the city and return the luster to the three public squares surrounded by the staggering temples that reflect remarkable religious architecture. Narrow streets wind between houses colored with red brick and lead to hidden courtyards and peppered statues, cisterns, and wells. Culture remains on display with artisans weaving textiles, chiseling timber, and crafting ceramics in open kilns. You can hear locals playing intense card games or socializing in their communal courtyards while collecting water to create a mosaic of daily life in the historic city. The Nyatapola Temple has a towering rooftop reaching nearly 100 feet above the Taumadhi Tole. It is the tallest temple in Nepal and one of the tallest buildings in the entire Kathmandu Valley. The edifice was erected in the early 18th century with perfect proportions with such structural integrity that it has survived the major earthquakes of 1934 and 2015 with minor damage. Stone temple guardians flank the stairway and legendary Rajput wrestlers Jaimal and Phattu kneel with hefty maces along the bottom steps. The temple is dedicated to Siddhi Lakshmi, an incarnation of the goddess Durga. 180 carved roof struts dangle above a canopy of braided snakes in the torana , an arched gateway."

The doors to the Tribhuvan Museum open to the galleries erected during the 19th century but now celebrate the reign of King Tribhuvan and his revolt against the previous regime. The famous square of Nasal Chowk retains its dramatic allure as the site of royal coronations amidst the looming Basantapur Tower at the southern end of the courtyard.

An enormous Buddhist pagoda provides tranquil space in the warm early afternoon, especially when you eat lunch on an old terrace overlooking the pilgrims.

        "description": "The path will be a long one to Chukhung Ri, as you ascend 2,600 feet today. However, the trail is energizing, especially when you spend more than two weeks walking. The body and the mind are fully tuned to the challenge and there’s a good chance you’ll feel fitter than you ever have done. Views of Makalu and the Lhotse Wall are highlights from the summit, although by now you’ll know that it’s always the 360-degree impression that’s so memorable, not one specific mountain. It will feel like you’re standing on the roof of the world and there’s nothing like nature to make you feel humble. After brunch back in Chhukhung you’ll begin the descent to Dingboche."

Like always you spend the night in the best teahouse available. Some along the trail offers a little luxury while others are simple. However, all will provide a bed and a warm place to spend the night, meaning you don’t need to camp in the rugged landscape."

Although it’s not quite a return to the real world as you stay at a spa hotel on the outskirts of Kathmandu, a 90-minute trekkers massage will soothe your legs on their path back to normality. It’s wonderful how fit you feel at this stage, even if there is soreness in your muscles and joints. You’ll have time to reflect on what you’ve just achieved, which includes three alpine passes, three peaks, and more than 10 days hiking above 13,000 feet.

Bells tinkle from cycle rickshaws while the hum of chatter challenges the spluttering of exhausts. Just sit back and watch the show unfold as while it is chaotic when you are on a street like Chandni Chowk, a chance to be above it all gives you a chance to get your bearings on what India is all about. After watching you delve onto the streets, on a cycle rickshaw tour through Old Delhi, you can stop at the city’s oldest mosque, Jama Masjid, and visit an old Sikh Temple as you travel past the Red Fort, even grabbing a chai at a local store.

Monuments stand beside modern markets, painted cows walk straight past the marble Taj, and the juxtaposition of past and present is what makes Agra so special. That and the Taj Mahal, of course, the marble ode to love and loss, a building so majestic you may not even want to take photos. For while the beautiful structure adorns many a postcard, the Taj Mahal must be seen to be believed.

Spend the morning in Bhaktapur and eat lunch with local Newari luminaries, and then travel up into the mountains and a small hill station that looks towards the high Himalayas.

A porter will carry your main luggage as they trek with you to provide the guide with additional support when required. This morning’s trek rises steadily, and a slow pace is required as you clamber up through a forest of magnificent cedar trees. You’ll see deserted winter settlements, where Phoksundo residents stay when snow and ice cover the lake. The gushing sound of water provides a compass point beyond the forest that will lead you across uneven terrain to Nepal’s highest waterfall.

The lake is your high point at 11,800 feet, and the trail is up and down, rather than up and up. Mostly you will walk between valleys and follow an ancient path that Tibetans have used for generations. There are no roads here, so everyone has always walked, with donkeys and yaks used to transport goods. So although there are few other tourists on the trail, you will come into step with the locals and regularly encounter the tinkling bells of a yak herd. Today starts with a steep descent, through a birch forest with glimpses of the lake below. Then, cross a remote suspension bridge and push on northwards to follow the Phoksundo River until it reaches the lake. The gully narrows before you emerge on yak-covered meadows. Once you reached the lake, you’ll appreciate its blue beauty, which is such a calm, pristine color beneath bands of rough and ready mountains. Walk alongside the lakeshore, past the yaks, to the Tibetan village of Ringmo, where time seems to have stood still. Ringmo fulfills many preconceptions of Tibet, from locals in native dress to monks walking in procession to a white monastery."

From here it’ll be a steep drop back down to the lake and its mesmerizing turquoise as you pass glaciers that cover the cliffs. You can also visit other Tibetan settlements, along with smaller monasteries that cling to impossible locations in the mountainside.
