They live individually or in very small pods or groups and frequently swim in pairs. Large Baleen Whales and Toothed Whales also come within sight of the shore. The calm ocean is abundant with krill which Blue Whales feed. From December through to April; there is an outstanding window of opportunity for observing Blue Whales and Sperm Whales close to shore. Near the village of Weligama, you can see the Stilt Fisherman. Weligama literally translating as ‘sandy village,’ has a long stretch of fine golden sand. Famous for its stilt fishermen, visitors can see this unique sight only in this part of Sri Lanka. No-one knows where, or even when this form of fishing originated, but it is an old tradition which lives on in a modern world today. This centuries old traditional method of fishing is one of the best sustainable practices to catch the fish. The Stilt Fisherman spends 2-4 hours sitting on a thin plank, hoping to catch one or two fish for their family’s lunch or dinner. Location : Ahangama Hotel : Bed & Breakfast."

      "description": "In the morning you will leave the hotel to travel to Wilpattu. Travel time is approximately 2 hours. Afternoon jeep safari at Wilpattu National Park. In Evening the hotel shares a habitat with the elusive Grey Slender Loris, a nocturnal primate hidden in the scrublands beyond your dwelling. Known for its protruding eyes and nimble limbs, the loris scavenges for insects and berries above the trees on a moonlit trail that has been carefully designed for you to observe the rare creature in its natural habitat. Accompanied by hotel resident naturalist, a quiet evening walk takes you through the streams and bamboo bridges of our lush forest eco-system to the Loris Information Centre and Conservation Site. Equipped with harmless red light emitting headlamps that reflect off the characteristic eyes of our resident loris population, your silent search may even be prized with a close-up encounter of this fleeting species. About the size of a chipmunk with long, pencil-thin arms and legs, this shy, furry, nocturnal primate is found in the tropical forests of Southern India and Sri Lanka and grows to between 6 and10 inches in size. It has a round head dominated by two large, close-set brown eyes that seem as big as dinner plates in its small and somewhat bemused-looking face. These peepers flank a little, long snout, which ends in a heart-shape nose. Dark, browny-black circles of fur surround the eyes, like spectacles, and it has relatively big, round ears poking out of its grey fuzz, all adding to its appeal.
