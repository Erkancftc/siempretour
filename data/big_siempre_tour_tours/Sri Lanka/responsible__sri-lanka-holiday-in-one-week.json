Dambatenne Tea Factory was built in 1890 by Sir Thomas Lipton himself, this colonial tea factory is still in operation today. The term “Ceylon Tea” was coined here, and Lipton’s Tea was founded and sold its first pound of tea from the precincts of this very factory. The factory tour is an education in the intricate processes involved in the fermentation, rolling, drying, cutting, sieving and grading of tea, and the comprehensive tour culminates with an authentic tea tasting experience (It’s closed on Sundays).

Strategically nestled amidst three mountain ranges, Kandy was initially built in this location as a natural fortress against attack. Kandy was not an easy target for the foreign invaders who could gain the control of coastal areas of the island without too much loss. Kandy’s main architectural monuments date mainly from the 19th Century when King Sri Vikrama Rajasinghe, the last King of Kandy, constructed many new buildings. At the time of the eventual surrender of Kandy to British Rule in 1815, when King Rajasinghe was captured, imprisoned and finally deported to India where he died in 1832. In the Afternoon you will visit The Temple of the Tooth & Buddhist Museum, Sri Dalada Maligawa dates back to the 16th century, though most of the present buildings were built in the 19th century. Venerated as the most important object in the Buddhist world, the Sacred Relic of the Tooth of Buddha is enshrined at the Temple. Brought from India 2500 years ago, it is said that the possessor of the Relic had the right to rule the country. The Relic is kept in a gold casket and stored amidst great security in the Inner Chamber. Afterwards you will see Traditional Kandyan Dance – Kandy, Sri Lanka’s second largest city is home to a Sinhalese cultural tradition of which Sri Lankans are justifiably proud.
