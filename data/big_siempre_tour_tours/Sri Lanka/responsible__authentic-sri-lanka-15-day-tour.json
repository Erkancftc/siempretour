You will get up close and personal with your elephant as he bathes happily in the river, and you get the chance to help the mahout in scrubbing and rubbing the elephant’s wrinkly skin and ever-curious trunk. Delight in feeding your new ‘gentle giant’ friend as he devours the fruits and their favorite leaves you offer.
