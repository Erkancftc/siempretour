    "generalInfo": "Also known as the Pearl of the Indian Ocean, Sri Lanka is one of the most culturally rich holiday destinations in Asia if not the world. Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim and Christian faiths have all left their mark, as have the colonial powers of the Portuguese, Dutch and British. For a relatively small island nation, Sri Lanka is also blessed with superb scenery from the tea clad verdant slopes of the hill country to the idyllic palm fringed coast. Wildlife enthusiasts will not be disappointed either with large populations of elephant and perhaps even a glimpse of the elusive leopard may be possible. This short tailormade tour is designed for travellers to experience the diversity of the island in a limited timeframe.  Start at Negombo; an important and authentic fishing hub where you will cruise on the dazzling lagoon rich with birdlife, observing the kaleidoscope of colour of the local fishing fleet. Admire stunning vistas of misty tea clad hills from one of the world’s most spectacular train journeys and listen to Sri Lanka’s tale of tea from a local planter.  Join pilgrims at the revered Temple of the Tooth in Kandy (UNESCO), and feel the history strolling on the atmospheric and excellently preserved ramparts of Galle Fort. For nature lovers, we stay clear of the jeep-packed thoroughfares of Yala National Park and here take a peaceful alternative away from the crowds in search of stunning wildlife including the elusive leopard. This tour may be short, but is far from short on memorable experiences that will surely leave you wanting more of this genial island nation.",

It is believed that this was the site of a momentous meeting between the monk Mahinda and King Devanampiyatissa, introducing Buddhism to the country and the site is now an important place of Buddhist pilgrimage. Exploring Mihintale involves climbing a flight of shallow stone steps, and a short but steep final section with uneven steps and a handrail leading to the summit of Missaka Mountain. There are excellent 360-degree views from the top. The total excursion should take a couple of hours and is graded easy to moderate. Moving on to Habarana by bus later this morning we'll have to work for our lunch as we explore an organic garden and pick the ingredients. These will then be expertly cooked up by our local hosts, who will talk us through how to make a traditional Sri Lankan lunch. We'll then feast on the results, vegetable curries, pol sambal (a spicy coconut salad), rice and pickles. The menu depends on which vegetables are ready to harvest and you couldn't get fresher! After lunch we'll drive on to Giritale, where we spend the next two nights, taking a safari in Minneriya or Kaudulla National Park on the way. Between May and November is a possible to spot large herds of elephants, at other times of year birdlife."

We'll also pause at the huge lion paws carved into the rock, the original gateway to the fort. The final and main ascent of the rock is made via metal stairways with handrails which are at times exposed to a drop. If you suffer badly from vertigo, it is possible to sit this out. The hike takes around 2 to 3 hours depending on crowds and we have graded it as moderate. Next, we move on to another ancient site, this time the second oldest capital of Sri Lanka, the 12th century city of Polonnaruwa where we will take a break for lunch before an afternoon exploring. A simple local bike is an ideal way to explore the historic site so this afternoon we plan to cycle the very short distances around the site over a couple of hours, covering about 3-4km in total on the flat, stopping off to visit sites such as the decorated shrine at the Quadrangle and the impressive Galvihara stone carvings of Buddha, where the Reclining Buddha is 14 metres long!

The jungle around here was used as the backdrop for the 1957 film Bridge on the River Kwai and the grade 2-3 rapids provide us with the perfect combination of scenery and excitement. As we raft down to Kitulgala we cover a section of the river through about 8 rapids which will usually take approximately one hour to cover (dependant on water levels). We'll stop at the Kitugala Lodge for lunch before we make our way to UNESCO-protected Sinharaja Forest Reserve and our base for the night. You can feel the humidity climb high in this unique area - Sri Lanka's last viable area of rainforest and one of its key biodiversity hotspots. The scenic drive to Sinhajara should take about 4.5 hours including stops. This World Heritage Site of lowland evergreen virgin rainforest is a nature lover's paradise - 282 bird species have been sighted here and other fauna include a large variety of insects, reptiles and amphibians. Although there are a small number of leopards, these are very rarely seen due to the dense foliage and steep terrain. The word 'Sinharaja' means lion king and legend has it that the Sinhala people of Sri Lanka originated from the union between a princess and the lion king who once lived in the forest! The Blue Magpie Lodge is a very simple family run lodge set in peaceful jungle surroundings perfectly located on the edge of the Reserve.

We will take our time stopping often to see flora and fauna of interest. We have graded this 4.5 mile/ 7km hike (350 metres/1150 feet total ascent and descent) as moderate.

Traditionally made from clay or terracotta in this part of the world, roof tiles combine the classic four elements of nature: Earth, water, air and fire with human artistry. Visiting a clay roof tile factory in Sri Lanka will be a unique experience for you, as the industry in Sri Lanka is still labour-oriented with the minimal use of automated machinery. Spending a day with the people working in a clay roof tile factory will be a great way of experiencing the lifestyles of the locals. Check in and overnight stay at the Mud House in Anamaduwa.<br/><br/>On the third day you have a chance to go for a Nature Trail in Anamaduwa Village. The Mud house is located on the outskirts of a typical, rural, Sri Lankan village. The majority of the people are farmers and the area is surrounded by acres of paddy fields which are irrigated by the various tanks. The Mud house has its own organic farm where a variety of rice grains, vegetables, herbs, spices and fruits are grown. As much of the produce used in the kitchen as possible is grown here. All waste from the farm is recycled into compost, as are the remains from the kitchen. <br/><br/>After breakfast on the Fourth day you will transfer to Sigiriya. The ancient city of Sigiriya is a premier historical destination in Sri Lanka, designated as a cultural World Heritage Site in 1982. It  is also proposed that the site should be named the eighth wonder of the world, indicating it is in the same league as other international wonders such as the Grand Canyon and Ancient Pyramids. Translated as 'Lion Rock' into English, the name of the monument indicates the way in which visitors used to begin their final ascent to the top - through the open jaws and throat “giriya\" of a lion “sinha”. <br/><br/>Elephant Energy offers you the unique opportunity to spend time with your own personal elephant and its mahout/handler. You will get up close and personal with your elephant as he bathes happily in the river, and you get the chance to help the mahout in scrubbing and rubbing the elephant’s wrinkly skin and ever-curious trunk. Delight in feeding your new ‘gentle giant’ friend as he devours the fruits and their favorite leaves you offer. This is an unforgettable experience with plenty of one-on-one time with what has to be, one of the most incredible creatures to inhabit Sri Lanka’s shores.<br/><br/>On the sixth day you will be able to Learn the craft of wood whittling with Gunapala. Gunapala who is hailing from a rural village in Sigiriya is a master craftsman who carves many souvenirs to support his family of 4 including his two children. He runs his own workshop in his home with the support of his elder son after school. The marketplace for his products are the souvenir shops in and around Sigiriya. Carving your own souvenir will be the main highlight of this encounter while experiencing the unique Sri Lankan styles and artistry. <br/><br/>After that visit Traditional Sesath making center in Kandy. Sesath or av-atu is a traditional sunshade or a large, round fan that was used in the time of Sri Lankan kings. It was first brought to Sri Lanka from India, with the sapling of the Sacred Bodhi Tree as a shade. Since then, the sesath has become a hand-woven symbol of prosperity and a vibrant relic of history and heritage. Although making the sesath is time consuming and quite difficult, if you’ve got the time and will for it, a traditional village workshop near Kandy lets you try your hand at it using your own design! Alternatively, you may simply watch the artisans create it for you.<br/><br/>Naranpanawa village walk begins and is through quaint villages with their Kandyan Forest Gardens where while the villagers go about their daily chores at their own pace. Villagers will be invited to visit their houses, and you will be able to see how they make treacle and jaggery. Treacle and jaggery are the syrup and sugar blocks made from the sap of a palm tree. This will be a great opportunity for you. In your way, you will be able to see various trees, such as cloves, pepper, nutmeg, coffee, cocoa, jack, bread-fruit, arecanut, mangosteen, mango, passion-fruit, rambuttan, banana, papaya. Near to the river, there  are several rice fields, those are still worked by the water and buffaloes. <br/><br/>On the seventh day visit Drum Village in Kandy and Join to the drum making experience. The community is well known for making drums and during this visit you will have the once in a lifetime opportunity to view the entire drum making process which includes bringing the ‘hide’ or skin from slaughterhouses, cutting of wood from local trees and since you can view the entire process of making a drum in person, you will also have the opportunity to partake in the creation of a drum which will certainly add some color to this experience. <br/><br/>On the Eighth day transfer to Nuwara Eliya after breakfast. Nuwara-Eliya is surrounded by mountain chains covered by dense, moss-covered cloud forests and tea plantations; its perpetual English spring weather, seasonal mists and dry winds provide ideal weather conditions for the production of one of the choicest grades of high grown tea, to which it gives its name. Visit a Tea Plantation and a Tea Factory in the evening.<br/><br/>The famous Horton Plains National Park is a nature reserve characterized by a beautiful landscape of rolling hills, forests, and grasslands. The highest plateau in the island, spanning approximately 10,000 hectares, is home to 24 species of mammal - such as elk, deer, giant squirrel, wild boar, wild hare, porcupine, and leopard. The park also hosts unique vegetation and offers a perfect ground to observe many rare and endemic highland birds.<br/><br/>Nestled amidst the beautiful hill country, Belihuloya is a picturesque little town located in Sabaragamuwa province, 616 metres above sea level. The beautiful hillside location is a climatically transitional area, linking both the dry and wet zones and the hill and low country and making it one of the richest biodiversity spots in Sri Lanka -  and an ideal location for nature lovers! Belihuloya is perfectly in tune with nature and provides a gorgeous setting for all sorts of adventures from climbing to canoëing and trekking. Here, you can enjoy the scenic waterfalls, historic sites, and nature trails.<br/><br/>In the afternoon, you will have a chance to enjoy a refreshing river bath in a natural rock pool.

These  crystal clear waters have their origin in Maha Eliya (Horton Plains), 2200 meters above the sea level.<br/><br/>Kinchigune Trail, a diverse trail of approximately 06 kms begins at Kinchigune Eco Lodge running alongside a riverine forest and the Belihuloya river itself. During the trail, you will venture through paddy fields, across rivers and past local village houses with their extensive vegetable plots. It is an ideal opportunity to learn a bit about the local agricultural systems and simple way of village living. Along the way, you will also witness several types of beautiful birds and butterflies and some charming waterfalls. The trail finishes at River Garden Resort. The whole journey takes between 02 and 04 hours, depending on how often you want to stop for rest, photos, or simply to take in the wonderful surroundings.<br/><br/>Canoeing in Samanalawewa Reservoir, still calm waters of the Samanalawewa reservoir are perfect for canoeing. Whether you want to take your time and go for a leisurely paddle for a couple of hours, perhaps venturing out to the mouth of the Belihuloya River or spend an entire day exploring the perimeter of the reservoir, you are sure to have an unforgettable experience. <br/><br/>After the breakfast transfer to Udawalawe. Check in to the Big Game Safari Campsite in Udawalawe and evening Jeep safari at Udawalawe national park. Originally, the national park was created to provide a sanctuary for wild animals displaced by the construction of the Udawalawe Reservoir in 1972. The reservoir, surrounded by open plains and foothills, is continuously replenished by River Walawe that draws its waters from the central highlands. The fringes of the reservoir and its creeks are filled with weather-bleached skeletons of thousands of jungle trees, and the area is about to become an important breeding place for aquatic birds.<br/><br/>After breakfast on the twelfth day and Visit Elephant Transit home in Udawalawe Udawalawe Elephant Transit Home is a place; where closer to 35 baby elephants are being taken care of with minimum human interaction as they are separated from their mothers. Mothers of these babies are either killed or lost due to non-ending Elephants –human conflict in Sri Lanka.  Then transfer to Sinharaja. Sinharaja rainforest has been designated as a UNESCO Natural World Heritage Site, UNESCO Biosphere Reserve and also a Biodiversity Hotspot by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). All these titles are highlighting the importance of the forest reserve in terms of its exceptional biodiversity as well as its fragility. Birding in Sinharaja is particularly interesting since it is home to 95% of the endemic birds of Sri Lanka! <br/><br/>On the last days of your journey, spend leisure time on Bentota Beach. Bentota is famed as the prime beach destination of the south-western coast of Sri Lanka.  During the season from November to April, the calm seas make the golden sands of Bentota beach a glorious holiday sun-and-fun playground. Bentota Beach is ideal for snorkelling, diving, sailing, windsurfing, water-skiing and deep-sea fishing on a traditional outrigger canoe.<br/><br/>After breakfast check out from the hotel before noon and transfer back to the Bandaranaike International Airport for the Departure.",

    "generalInfo": "The first few days of this relaxing holiday are based on the island's southwest coast at The Villa Bentota, which is a sensitively converted 19th century colonial manor house and Sri Lanka’s first boutique hotel. Created by world-renowned architect Geoffrey Bawa, the updated and expanded villa has individually designed rooms, with unique features such as private courtyards and plunge pools, spread around an estate that also includes two pools, a minimalist open air dining pavilion and various places to relax with spectacular sea views. Away from the beach are the house and gardens of Lunuganga, which were lovingly created over several decades by Geoffrey Bawa as his vision of a tropical garden idyll, and the tropical garden paradise of Brief, the life’s work of Bevis Bawa, famed bon viveur and brother of Geoffrey. There are also boat safaris to explore the coastal lagoons and mangrove-clad waterways of the Madu Ganga nearby.<br/><br/>Leaving Bentota, you’ll head for a five-day tour of Sri Lanka’s hill country and national parks. First up, you'll stay in a luxurious boutique bungalow in the western highlands living the life of a modern-day tea planter before taking a picturesque train journey through the spectacular tea country for a relaxing day in the cool mountain air of Ella Gap. Dropping back down to the hot and dry southern plain, you'll enjoy jeep safaris in Udawalawe National Park, the island's main elephant reserve, which is renowned for its outstanding scenic beauty and wealth of animal species, particularly mammals and birds. Of all Sri Lanka's national parks, this best rivals the savanna reserves of Africa, with large herds of elephants, wild buffaloes and sambar deer as well as leopards and sloth bears.<br/><br/>The final stop on the tour is the heritage city of Galle, where you’ll get to explore the Dutch colonial era fort and the Arab Quarter before heading to Tangalle for your second beach stay for the last five nights.<br/><br/>Buckingham Place is a singular boutique hotel set on an unspoilt, palm-fringed beach on Sri Lanka's south coast.

The temple then stood at Sankili Thoppu on the eastern side of the Point Pedro Road (The site was later used for erecting a Christian Church). Jaffna again fell to Dutch in 1658. They were more tolerant on religious freedom and the temple was allowed to be rebuilt in the current location in 1734 by Don Juan Mappana Mudliyar as a humble temple dedicated to lord Murugan.

Kandy is a beautiful historical city in the citadel of the country. It is not only known for its great kings who ruled the city for almost 225 years independently until the British took over in 1815, but it is also the place where the Sacred Tooth of Lord Buddha is laid in a magnificent temple. Strategically nestled amidst three mountain ranges, Kandy was initially built in this location as a natural fortress against attack. Kandy was not an easy target for the foreign invaders who could gain the control of coastal areas of the island without too much loss. Kandy’s main architectural monuments date mainly from the 19th Century when King Vikrama Rajasinha, the last King of Kandy, constructed many new buildings. At the time of the eventual surrender of Kandy to British Rule in 1815, when King Rajasinha was captured, imprisoned and finally deported to India where he died in 1832. In the afternoon you will explore the Kandy City & markets with your guide. It is great place for shopping or just walks around the Lake and enjoys the beautiful scenery and narrow streets. KANDY LAKE – Built in 1806, Kandy Lake was constructed in order to bring more beauty to the Palace of King Sri Rajasinghe. In the centre of the Lake a small island was built to enable the King to be rowed out and relax whilst surveying his kingdom. The Queen’s Bathing House is set on the edge of Kandy Lake.

Rich in history and tradition, the Sri Dalada Maligawa is a religious centre where daily worship is a colourful and joyful way of everyday life. At several times throughout the day different services are held and with the large numbers of worshippers present, it is clear to see why Buddhists are so piously devoted towards the Sacred Tooth Relic. Spine-tingling traditional drumming to be heard coming from the Inner Chamber, will signal that the ceremonial opening of the window for the public viewing of the casket with the Relic within is just about to begin.

You will also have time for shopping as well. Colombo Fort is the business district of Sri Lanka with skyscrapers and big international hotels. The Fort was built by the Portuguese and Dutch partly, later took control by the British. In 1870 the British destroyed the Fort for urban development, and then they rebuilt some of the remaining buildings within it now. Colombo Fort is home to Fort Railway Station, President's House and Presidential Gardens, a palatial neo- classical building which was originally the home of the British Governors and is now the residence of Sri Lanka's president. The Lighthouse Clock Tower situated in the Chatham Street commissioned by the wife of Governor Sir Henry Ward in the hope that it would teach the Ceylonese to be punctual. Around here is good for shopping tea, souvenirs, and exchange money. Independence Square is known as one of the most prominent locations in Colombo. It is commonly used as a place where Sri Lankans come together in unison for significant national celebrations and cultural activities. The Independence Commemoration Hall is also used to host ceremonies that mark national unity. This unique and outstanding monument positioned in the heart of Sri Lanka’s commercial capital Colombo, commemorates the country’s independence from foreign rule. Sri Lanka gained independence on the 4th of February 1948 from the British who were the final colonial rulers of the country. Opposite the Presidential Secretariat (old Parliament) is the Colombo breathing green space known as Galle Face. Here every walk of life comes for relaxing time. Just to sit on the grass and watch the sunset over the Indian Ocean. Next to Galle Face is the grand Renaissance-style structure of Galle Face Hotel, South Asia’s leading Grande Dame, and the Galle Face Hotel is testimony to both Sri Lanka’s colonial past and its independent present. You can enjoy the English high tea on the Victorian style Veranda or sip a martini facing the sea and enjoy the sunset. Location: Colombo Hotel: Marino Hotel on Bed & Breakfast"

For centuries the indigenous herbs and spices have been used for both medicinal purposes and in traditional Sri Lankan cuisine.

    "generalInfo": "Sri Lanka is becoming one of the top whale watching destinations in the world. Join us on this specific blue whale watching tour and come face to face with the largest animal to ever live on the planet. With 100% successful sighting rate and fully WDCS certified boats we have a great track record when it comes to watching whales in Sri Lanka.  <br/><br/>It was originally thought that blue whales migrated to Sri Lanka from the Arabian gulf each winter and stayed until spring. However recent scientific studies have suggested that the blue whale population off the coast of Sri Lanka is here all year and they just come closer to the shore in winter. One thing is for sure, blue whales begin to congregate off the southern coast of Sri Lanka from late November through to mid April. They come here to feed and the largest numbers are typically from late February to mid March. Sperm whales and large pods of long-nosed spinner dolphins can also be seen here more reliably throughout the year and are also commonly seen during the peak blue whale season. <br/><br/>Your on-board guides for the suggested itinerary below will be able to help you identify the different species of cetaceans as well as interpret the different behaviours you're seeing. We also use excellent local whale watching naturalists (actually we use the only certified and accredited whale watching boat in Mirissa), with years of experience in locating whales and dolphins, just offshore. They know the exact areas the whales usually locate and their ability to spot whales at distance is phenomenal to see. <br/><br/>Whilst the dynamics of whale populations are relatively unknown we are aware that the blue whales and sperm whales are here en mass to feed on the plentiful krill, fish and squid. The reason for these bountiful seas is that the nutrient rich waters of the deep Indian Ocean are pushed up towards the surface by the near vertical continental shelf which skirts the south and eastern coastline of Sri Lanka. This cold current coming to the surface is full of plankton and attracts huge numbers of krill, which in turn attracts the krill’s predators: blue whales and small schooling fish. Huge pods of long-nosed spinner and long-beaked common dolphins also come to feed on the fish and the deep sea squid. In one morning’s whale watching it is possible to see a pod of 500 dolphins chasing down schools of sardines, followed by 4-5 blue whales in krill rich waters feeding and socialising before being surrounded by a large pod of deep diving sperm whales searching for deep sea squid. <br/><br/>Whale numbers in Sri Lanka are still being assessed but it is becoming apparent that for a few months the waters off the south coast become as rich in cetaceans as anywhere else on earth. With our expertise in whale watching we have a perfect success rate of seeing blue whales and we don’t put this down to chance. We also make sure that the whale watching boat we use for all our excursions is accredited by the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society (WDCS) and they abide by international whale watching guide lines. We are determined to make sure that whale watching in Sri Lanka is done sustainably and with respect to the environment.<br/><br/>Location:<br/><br/>Blue whales are rare by nature (over the last 100 years humans have reduced their numbers by 99% of their total population), however even in their heyday the blue whale was an oceanic wanderer which was difficult to follow and next to impossible to understand. Over the years there have been a few different locations where blue whales are seen with any regularity but recently the south coast of Sri Lanka has attracted large numbers, often close to shore. Also here are fin whales, Bryde’s whales, minke whales, humpback whales, sperm whales, long-nosed spinner dolphins, long-beaked common dolphins, common bottlenose dolphins and striped dolphins.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>As there is no real walking involved in this tour, there is no need to a high or even medium level of fitness. Obviously if you wish to snorkel a good level of swimming ability is essential. But the rest of the suggested itinerary below involves sitting or standing in awe on the whale watching boats.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment. But here is a brief outline of the basics: We recommend you bring along your own binoculars or spotting scope (although the ocean spray can be a problem on the boats) as well as appropriate clothing; which should be light and airy clothes for warm weather as well as a waterproof coat. Insect repellent is handy as there can be mosquitoes about during the evenings and nights. Oh and please bring plenty of memory cards or film for your camera. Also do not forget sun cream, sun hat and sun glasses as the sun can be strong here during the day. Also if you have your own mask, snorkel and fins they are always good to have as the snorkelling is great.<br/><br/>Minimum age: 12 Years old.<br/>",

From here you will have a short briefing before boarding the boat and heading out into the blue. First off we will search for large pods of dolphins close into shore whilst we head out to the blue whales feeding grounds. The blue whales congregate here in numbers not seen elsewhere in the world. We have never failed to see blue whales so far and so hold a good hope of seeing them every time we go out, the reason for this aggregation of blue whales is that during the winter, the blue whales are seen relatively close to shore as the continental shelf is very narrow to the South of Dondra. This focuses the nutrient rich water from the oceans’ depths and brings it to the surface carrying many species of smaller marine animals. After searching for the blue whales, we will head further off shore to try and find some of the large pods of sperm whales. These usually oceanic species are sometimes seen within a few kilometres of shore as they dive to feed on squid. Around midday we will begin to head back to the harbour and the afternoon is for you to enjoy at your leisure. There is plenty to do in terms of relaxing, swimming, snorkelling and other beach activities. (Breakfast & Dinner included)."

Rising dramatically from the central plains, the UNESCO-protected ruins of this 5th-century 'Sky Fortress' are one of Sri Lanka's major attractions and an impressive feat of engineering skill. The fortress was built in just seven years as a fortified palace atop the granite peak, to protect the reign of merciless King Kassapa who had assassinated his father and deposed his brother. Before our final ascent to the summit, we'll pass between a set of enormous lion paws carved out of the rock - all that remains of an ancient gateway that gave Sigiriya, the 'Lion Rock', its name. From here a series of switchback steel stairways ascend to the top. Once at the 200-metre/656-foot summit, we can take in the magnificent views of the surrounding jungle and countryside. We return to our hotel in time for a late breakfast. Leaving Sigiriya, we'll drive to Kandy, a journey of around two to three hours. We'll wander through the lush Royal Botanical Gardens, located just outside the city, which boasts more than 4,000 species of plants, including orchids, medicinal plants and palm trees. Our tour leader will lead us on a short walking tour of Kandy, which will include visiting the town's narrow streets lined with old buildings and colourful and interesting markets. Buddhists from all over the world come to this highland town specifically to visit the Temple of the Tooth or Dalada Maligawa and there is the option to visit the temple. You might like to continue shopping at the Kandyan Art Association's workshops, which have brassware, batik, lacquer work and other craft items on offer, which make excellent souvenirs or presents. In the late afternoon, we'll transfer to our hotel located 4 kilometres/2.4 miles from the centre of Kandy overlooking the Mahaweli River (Sri Lanka's longest river), allowing easy access to Kandy without the hustle and bustle of the city centre. The hotel has beautiful gardens, an open-air restaurant and a swimming pool."

We'll make the most of them with an afternoon rafting session down the river towards our accommodation outside Kitulgala. We cover a section of the river through several rapids. It will usually take approximately one hour to cover the section, but this depends on water levels so may be a bit shorter or longer. Taking lunch en route, we should arrive at our simple hotel late this afternoon. This evening, if time allows, there will be a chance to join an optional trek across the river and through the jungle to a hidden waterfall. In dry season the falls may be smaller or dried up according to recent climate conditions. Our night spent at Kitulgala is in a simple graded resthouse. The Kitulgala Resthouse Hotel has around 20 simply appointed en suite rooms with a fan in each room. It is located on the Kelani River front and surrounded by nature (ear plugs can come in handy!)."

    "generalInfo": "Geoffrey Bawa is the father of contemporary architecture in Sri Lanka, the creative innovator behind some of the most iconic buildings on the island. This 14-day guided tour will bring you the best of Bawa while introducing you to the design influences of the past with visits to a few of the country’s significant cultural sites. <br/><br/>Trained as a barrister at the London bar before becoming an architect at the age of 38 years, Geoffrey Bawa developed imaginative and ingenious designs using concepts derived from vernacular Sri Lankan architecture. Beginning with projects for close friends and his own country estate at Lunuganga, Bawa went on to master plan the Parliament Building at Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte, the administrative capital of Sri Lanka south of Colombo, and the University of Ruhuna near Matara. <br/><br/>Always a favourite with the island’s hoteliers, Geoffrey Bawa has an impressive and enviable track record for developing novel and inspired designs for hotels and villas, mostly along the country’s western and southern coastlines. He conceived Sri Lanka’s first ever boutique hotel in the early 1970s – Villa Mohotti, now The Villa Bentota – as well as a plethora of resort hotels and villas from Negombo to Tangalle. Visits to and stays in many of his creations are included in this Bawa tour. <br/><br/>Beginning at Jetwing Lagoon in Negombo, the new incarnation of Blue Lagoon Hotel, Sri Lanka’s original resort hotel designed by Geoffrey Bawa, the tour heads up to the Cultural Triangle and a stay at another of Bawa’s unique structures, Heritance Kandalama, Asia’s very first luxury eco hotel, which is hidden amongst natural foliage inhabited by monkeys and birds overlooking serene Kandalama Lake near Dambulla. Travelling south through the Hill Country with overnight stops in Kandy and Ella, the architectural tour continues around the south and west coasts, initially staying at Jetwing Lighthouse close to Galle fort, where Bawa manages to create an atmosphere reminiscent of Moorish palaces, ocean liners, manor houses and colonial villas all at once. The tour finishes at Heritance Ahungalla near Bentota, the refurbished and modified version of Bawa’s original Triton Hotel. <br/><br/>Visits to Bawa-designed town houses and lunch at his former office in Colombo as well as many of his larger projects along the west coast will be complemented by guided tours of the medieval capital of Polonnaruwa, Sigiriya rock fortress and Dambulla cave temples. A tour of the house and gardens at Lunuganga, which were lovingly created over several decades by Geoffrey Bawa as his vision of a tropical garden idyll, is one of the lasting legacies of Asia’s most famous architect.",

On the way, stop off at Tea Bush Hotel at Ramboda Falls, a 2012 project by Palinda Kannangara Architects. On arrival, amble around the ‘City of Lights’ and enjoy a little piece of England in the tropics! Transfer to Nanuoya railway station for a scenic train journey to Ella in the southern Hill Country. Overnight at 98 Acres Resort & Spa, which is a luxury retreat with spectacular views in an idyllic location at the southern end of the Hill Country. Surrounded by the eponymous scenic tea estate in Uva Province, it was constructed with the emphasis on eco-friendliness and sustainability. The uniquely designed resort of spacious chalets mostly made of recyclable materials blends well with the natural surroundings. Discarded railway sleepers form decks and walls, rough-hewn granite lends simple elegance to floors, and traditional thatched roofs of locally-sourced Iluk straw add to the rustic splendour. Popular all year round, the resort is blessed with exquisite countryside, breath-taking panoramas and local nature trails."

The overall architecture creates an atmosphere resembling Moorish palaces, ocean liners, manor houses and colonial villas. The hotel is sited on a rocky promontory with stunning views across the Indian Ocean to Galle fort. The lounges and restaurants carry memories of old rest houses and planters’ clubs, while the terraces and verandas confront the relentless crashing of the waves and provide contrasting areas of shelter and tranquillity."

There are no other activities planned today, so you're free to arrive in Negombo at any time. If you'd like an airport transfer, you'll need to arrive into Colombo's Bandaranaike International Airport (CMB), which is a 30-minute drive from our hotel. If you miss the welcome meeting, your tour leader will inform you of any essential information as soon as you catch up.

We'll head out on a jeep safari in the hope of spotting the elusive leopard.

Rising dramatically from the central plains, the UNESCO-protected ruins of this 5th-century 'Sky Fortress' are one of Sri Lanka's major attractions and an impressive feat of engineering skill. The fortress was built in just seven years as a fortified palace atop the granite peak, to protect the reign of merciless King Kassapa who had assassinated his father and deposed his brother. Before our final ascent to the summit, we'll pass between a set of enormous lion paws carved out of the rock - all that remains of an ancient gateway that gave Sigiriya, the 'Lion Rock', its name. From here a series of switchback steel stairways ascend to the top. Once at the 200-metre/656-foot summit, we can take in the magnificent views of the surrounding jungle and countryside. We return to our hotel in time for a late breakfast. After a chance to have breakfast and freshen up, we leave the hotel at around 11am and we'll drive for around two and a half hours to Kandy. Sitting on a plateau 500 metres/1640 feet above sea level and 112 kilometres/69 miles northeast of Colombo, Kandy is, in climatic and cultural terms, a world apart from Colombo. Serving as the capital of the last Sinhalese kingdom until falling to the British in 1815, it's a place of cultural and spiritual importance. Buddhists from all over the world come here specifically to visit the Temple of the Tooth, the Dalada Maligawa. The costly jewelled shrine of the Holy Tooth, said to be Buddha's left canine, is kept on the upper floor of the original building. This relic was brought from India 1,500 years ago and every year, at the time of the August full moon, it is paraded around the town as part of the Perahera Festival. On arrival, we'll have free time to explore this historic town. You might like to visit the Temple of the Tooth or take a short tuk-tuk ride out to Peradeniya Botanical Gardens."

The Fort was built by the Portuguese and Dutch partly, later took control by the British. In 1870 the British destroyed the Fort for urban development, and then they rebuilt some of the remaining buildings within it now. Colombo Fort is home to Fort Railway Station, President's House and Presidential Gardens, a palatial neo- classical building which was originally the home of the British Governors and is now the residence of Sri Lanka's president. The Lighthouse Clock Tower situated in the Chatham Street commissioned by the wife of Governor Sir Henry Ward in the hope that it would teach the Ceylonese to be punctual. Around here is good for shopping tea, souvenirs, and exchange money. Independence Square is known as one of the most prominent locations in Colombo. It is commonly used as a place where Sri Lankans come together in unison for significant national celebrations and cultural activities. The Independence Commemoration Hall is also used to host ceremonies that mark national unity. This unique and outstanding monument positioned in the heart of Sri Lanka’s commercial capital Colombo, commemorates the country’s independence from foreign rule. Sri Lanka gained independence on the 4th of February 1948 from the British who were the final colonial rulers of the country. Opposite the Presidential Secretariat (old Parliament) is the Colombo breathing green space known as Galle Face. Here every walk of life comes for relaxing time. Just to sit on the grass and watch the sunset over the Indian Ocean. Next to Galle Face is the grand Renaissance-style structure of Galle Face Hotel, South Asia’s leading Grande Dame, and the Galle Face Hotel is testimony to both Sri Lanka’s colonial past and its independent present.

No place in Sri Lanka has generated as many theories and legends as the 180m monolith, set amidst stunning scenery. Then drive to Polonnaruwa which takes around 1hour. Visit the ancient ruins of Polonnaruwa which is the second most ancient kingdom of Sri Lanka. Polonnaruwa is divided into 4 areas. The visit starts with the Kings Palace and Baths.

It takes approximately 30 minutes. Your guide will buy your entrance fee and climb with you. There are approximately 200 steps. The best time to climb is in the early morning or the late afternoon to avoid the heat. You will need to cover your knees and shoulders – and access the inner chambers barefoot or with socks. You will find socks in the basket inside the vehicle and a sarong in case you need one. The entire visit takes approximately 1.5 hours. Transfer to Kandy and this transfer takes approximately around 2.5hours. Check-in to Kandy House. The Kandy House is a carefully-renovated old colonial 'Walauwa' (ancestral mansion) in the spice-growing hills that surround Kandy. Its completion heralded what the hill-country-capital had been waiting for so long: a brilliant small boutique hotel capable of offering stylish and private accommodation and attentive personal service in a beautiful natural setting. The inspired refurbishment, with its white interiors, polished hardwood floorboards, jackwood staircase, Dutch-style antique furniture and careful injections of colour, has been a triumph."

Visit the Temple of the Relic, Sri Dalada Maligawa or the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic is a Buddhist temple in the city of Kandy, Sri Lanka. It is located in the royal palace complex which houses the relic of the tooth of Buddha.

Amangalla, owned by the exclusive Aman group, offers the most refined accommodation in Galle, its colonial-style buildings looking down soberly on the activity below. It consists of an amalgamation of buildings dating back over 400 years, once used as an HQ for the Dutch commander and his officers in the 17C and later as a billet for British soldiers. In 1865, the New Oriental Hotel was born and in its heyday on either side of the Second World War there were no more sought-after or daring parties in Sri Lanka. Aman Resorts then undertook a sensitive and complete refurbishment. From the day it opened, in 2005, it has offered excellent old-world luxury, superb food, arguably the best spa in the island and exceptional service. Galle Fort walk with a local. Start the walk from the new entrance of the Galle Fort and wander along three of the 14 bastions, all with mount canons to protect it from outside invasions. Each bastion has its unique set of characteristics – the moon bastion showcases 19 canons, the largest number in the fort and the Black Fort which was believed to have housed firearms and gun powder. Stroll through cobblestoned pathways and navigate the cafes, hotels and charming old houses owned by generations of Galle families to get an insight in to their lives, culture and history."

You will be accompanied by a local naturalist, whose wealth of knowledge on the local bird and reptile life is as impressive as it is humorous. Sit back, and enjoy the ride as you pass along river banks, through canals, under bridges and by local village hamlets. Children will race up to the river bank to wave. Grey fish eagles swoop by. Water monitors lazily cling to low branches after a big meal, while others zip through the waters in search of unsuspecting prey. The ride passes through rubber and cinnamon plantations, and even a few low bushes of tea can be spotted from the back yards as you float on by. The ride will stop by where small mounds of coconut husk can be seen drying up in the sun; one of many places where coir rope comes to life from the humble coconut husk. From here you will mount your bike and begin a 9km breath-taking ride through rural Galle and the heart of the south. Whizz by paddy fields and through small villages, past humble markets where the villagers trade and end up at a cool mud hut for refreshing herbal teas and traditional breakfast or cooking lessons with some traditional rice and curries, made in the ways of the past. From here you can choose to ride back to a pickup point or be driven back to the drop off point."

Today Anuradhapura is one of the world’s major archaeological sites in the world. It is covered area about 40 km² and an UNESCO World Heritage Site. This sacred city was established around a cutting from the 'tree of enlightenment', the Buddha's fig tree, brought there in the 3rd century B.C. by Sanghamitta, the founder of an order of Buddhist nuns.

The history of Thanthirimale dates to the 6th century BC, when Prince Vijaya and his men set foot on the island at a spot that came to be called Thambapanni, meaning bronze sand. After meeting Kuveni, the princess of an indigenous tribe, and settling there, Vijaya and his group moved further inland to build a kingdom. The route they are believed to have taken was along a river named Malwathu Oya. Location: Mannar Hotel : Breakfast & Dinner"

        "description": "Mannar: Mannar is known as an Island, infect it is a peninsula formed in a shape of a tongue. At Talaimanar, the westernmost tip of the island, it is almost connected to the Dhanuskodi, the easternmost tip of peninsula of Southern India by a reef of corals submerged in the Palk Straits. Apart from the thin strip of land that joins the peninsula to the mainland, Mannar Island is also connected by the causeway over the shallow waters forming a 3 km stretch of A14 Madawachchiya –Talaimannar main road. The small fishing port of Mannar is located on the south-eastern shore. After breakfast you will take boat trip to see the Adams Bridge. This is the closest point to India from Sri Lanka. This mythical bridge has many legendry tales and linked with Ramayana. It is a mere 36kms across to the Rameshwran in South India. In between there are 16 sand banks, 8 of which belong to Sri Lanka and 8 to India. The Sri Lankan Navy operate almost daily (weather permitting) boat trips to the sand banks. After an easy 45 minute trip following the Mannar coastline and about 10kms out to sea you will see the banks just above the water line. You land on one of the banks and the surreal landscape is very special. Hundreds of gulls are resting on the banks as you approach Geological evidence suggests that this bridge is a former land connection between India and Sri Lanka, made with chain of limestone shoals surrounded by a shallow sea of one to 10 meter depth. The earliest map that calls this area by the name Adam’s bridge was prepared by a British cartographer in 1804, in reference to an Abrahamic myth, in which Adam used the bridge to reach a mountain, which the British identified with Adam’s Peak, where he stood repentant on one foot for 1,000 years, leaving a large hollow mark resembling a footprint. Late afternoon you can visit the town and Allirani fort, built by the Portuguese in 1560 and taken by the Dutch in 1658 and rebuilt; its ramparts and bastions are intact, though the interior is largely destroyed. Formerly the town was renowned as a centre of pearl fishing. In the heart of Mannar there is a famous Biobab tree 19,5m in diameter planted around year 1477 by Arabian sailors from Zanzibar.

        "description": "Jaffna: After breakfast you will visit Nallur Kandaswamy Temple, this fascinating Hindu temple also known Kovil in Tamil and shrine. It is dedicated to God Murugan – (God of Tamils). Nallur was part of once thriving Jaffna Kingdom. The Portuguese who captured Jaffna in 1560 demolished the Temple in 1621 leaving no traces of it. The temple then stood at Sankili Thoppu on the eastern side of the Point Pedro Road (The site was later used for erecting a Christian Church). Jaffna again fell to Dutch in 1658. They were more tolerant on religious freedom and the temple was allowed to be rebuilt in the current location in 1734 by Don Juan Mappana Mudliyar as a humble temple dedicated to lord Murugan. This impressive temple is now fully restored. The temple hosts an enormous and spectacular Hindu festival for over 25 days in July/August, which climaxes on the twenty fourth with parades of floats and displays of self-mutilation by entranced devotees. In the afternoon you will explore Jaffna Fort – Clock Tower – Jaffna Library. You will then proceed to Oddtumadam, through Araly Road, Karainagar – Casuarina Beach . The return journey will be through Mathagal – Keerimalai Tank – Mavettapuram Knathasami Kovil (Historical Temple) – Thellipalai Amman Kovil (Historical Temple) – Chuunakam – Kantharodai and finally through KKS Road to Jaffna University and back to the Hotel. The ancient Jaffna Fort is the second largest existing fort in Sri Lanka. Originally built by the Portuguese in 1619 and re-built and expanded by the Dutch during the second half of the 17th and the 18th centuries to facilitate trading activities of Sri Lanka’s northern region indicate not only of Jaffna’s strategic importance to Europeans but its significance throughout Sri Lanka’s history. Nelson in his book Dutch ‘Fort in Sri Lanka’ claimed that ‘’ it was, as a technical fort, everything was done to the latest design at each successive stage and final result was the strongest fortress in the East, the perfect defensive design in the days of powerful and destructive solid shot artillery of limited effective range. In Britain, fully comparable places are to be found only at the towns of Berwick , at Fort George neat Inverness, at the citadel of Plymouth at Tilbury Fort on the Thames approaches to London. There are many fine artillery fortifications from the same period around the Indian Ocean. Yet it is doubtful whether in it’s technically perfection and its completeness, Jaffna can be surpassed’.

It is not only known for its great kings who ruled the city for almost 225 years independently until the British took over in 1815, but it is also the place where the Sacred Tooth of Lord Buddha is laid in a magnificent temple. Strategically nestled amidst three mountain ranges, Kandy was initially built in this location as a natural fortress against attack. Kandy was not an easy target for the foreign invaders who could gain the control of coastal areas of the island without too much loss. Kandy’s main architectural monuments date mainly from the 19th Century when King Sri Vikrama Rajasinghe, the last King of Kandy, constructed many new buildings. At the time of the eventual surrender of Kandy to British Rule in 1815, when King Rajasinghe was captured, imprisoned and finally deported to India where he died in 1832. In the morning you will visit The Temple of the Tooth & Buddhist Museum, Sri Dalada Maligawa dates back to the 16th century, though most of the present buildings were built in the 19th century. Venerated as the most important object in the Buddhist world, the Sacred Relic of the Tooth of Buddha is enshrined at the Temple. Brought from India 2500 years ago, it is said that the possessor of the Relic had the right to rule the country. The Relic is kept in a gold casket and stored amidst great security in the Inner Chamber.

    "generalInfo": "Travel north to experience a very different Sri Lanka with its vast lagoons full of migrant waders, donkeys and baobabs, Tamil script and Hindi songstresses, bicycles and Brahman cows. Since the declaration of peace on the island in 2009, the north and east of the country have opened up and developed, but not too much – yet. So now is the time to visit on your very own tailor-made holiday. Our suggested itinerary takes in Mannar Island, Jaffna, the east coast around Trincomalee and the Cultural Triangle. <br/><br/>The flat lands of the north-western coastal plain are similar to the dry zone regions of the southeast until you reach the causeway. Here everything changes with the typical scrub jungle giving way to a vast lagoon, mud flats, wading birds and… donkeys!<br/><br/>Mannar Island is home to thousands of migrant birds from October to March. In the area, Thantirimale is an ancient village and temple complex. Other sites of interest include Mannar and Arippu Forts, Doric House, Talaimannar port and lighthouse, and Thiruketheeswaram temple.<br/><br/>Venturing further north to Jaffna you immediately appreciate that you have arrived in a different land with Tamil script adorning hoardings, Hindi songs resounding in the streets and bicycles dodging meandering sacred cows. Jaffna has recovered well from the ravages of war and, while it isn’t a city of many ‘must see’ sites, the real appeal of the area is the ethereal nature of its environs and the innocence of its people.<br/><br/>Nallur Kandaswamy Kovil is one of the island’s most holy Hindu temples and the focus of a spectacular annual festival. Also within the city are the reconstructed library, a World Heritage Site, and the renovated fort. Further afield are the islands of Nainativu, site of important Hindu and Buddhist temples, and windswept Delft, home to wild horses of Dutch origin. <br/><br/>Bearing east, you arrive at Trincomalee (or Trinco), which is blessed with one of the largest and deepest natural harbours on the planet and the envy of past conquerors. Just north along the coast is Nilaveli, a relatively quiet beach area.<br/><br/>Fort Frederick is a 17th century Portuguese-built city bastion, magnificent views and legends surround Swami Rock, and the imposing Koneswaram Kovil is one of the most holy Hindu temples on the island. China Bay has been a naval base since time immemorial and now a museum.<br/><br/>The island’s Cultural Triangle accounts for six of the country’s eight World Heritage Sites. Although these sites are principally of an historic interest, they are by no means cold, stony monuments since all of the dagobas and stupas are still places of worship and veneration for locals, which makes them profoundly atmospheric and full of life.<br/><br/>Anuradhapura was the first capital of ancient Lanka in the 3rd century BC. Mihintale is where Buddhism was introduced to Sri Lanka and the enigmatic setting makes a visit unforgettable. The unique rock fortress of Sigiriya is a national icon, despite its origins as a usurper’s pleasure palace!",

    "generalInfo": "This may be a small group holiday to Sri Lanka but its carefully crafted itinerary thinks big, with an eclectic mix of both cultural and natural highlights as well as some wonderful adventure activities packed into two weeks.  <br/><br/>From the first day you are immersed in ancient heritage, one of the first stops on our tour of the island being Dambulla ancient cave complex. These are no ordinary caves either, five of them being packed with valuable religious icons. More cultural wonders located in spectacular places await, including the giant and beautifully imposing fortress at Sigiriya, and one of the country’s finest ancient kingdoms and UNESCO World Heritage Sites at Polonnaruwa.<br/><br/>From ancient sites to fine wildlife sights, we spend time out in the magnificent Yala National Park, where we take a game drive to search for some of its treasures, including elephants, sloth bears, wild buffalos and rare leopards. Birdlife isn’t rare, however, with over 200 species flying around the park’s forests and wetlands.  There is much more birdlife to be seen on our day at Giritale Tank, ancient reservoirs that are now beacons for birdlife with everything from kingfishers to kites.  <br/><br/>You'll also spend a few days in and around Kandy, in the heart of the country, a city that is famous for having been ruled by the Kings of Kandy since the 15th century. It has a wonderful combination of post colonial architecture here and in the surrounding hill country plantations, but also sacred sites such as the Temple of the Tooth which contains a sacred tooth belonging to the Buddha. Another important urban stop is Galle, on the south coast, where life revolves around the old fort founded in the 16th century by Portuguese colonists and now a maze of places to shop, eat, stay and enjoy the coastal ambience. <br/><br/>Getting out onto the hills and wilder areas of Sri Lanka is also an option on this holiday with trekking opportunities through the rainforest region of Kitulgala, and an option to go white water rafting here too when the waters are high enough. The Adam’s Peak trek here is certainly high and tough enough for those willing and able to take on this four hour ascent of this 2,243m sacred summit through the night in order to be there for sunrise. Another more accessible trek is at Horton Plains, a 2000m high plateau where we go trekking through misty forest where sambar and purple faced monkeys roam. Leading, finally to World’s End one of the country’s most stunning viewpoints.  <br/><br/>Another added bonus for travellers on this holiday is the chance to go whale watching on their free day, if they are lucky enough to be visiting between November and April. This is peak season to see the high numbers of blue whales and other cetaceans that visit the waters off Dondra Head on the island’s southern tip.",

The scenery is beautiful and the best way to explore is on foot. We take a three to four-hour guided walk (5.5mi/9km) through the picturesque rolling grasslands, spanning through various landscapes and elevations, where we hope to encounter monkeys along the way. We also visit World’s End, where the ground drops 3,445ft (1,050m) to the plains. For a more detailed terrain description of Horton Plains walk, please see our \"Is this trip for you\" section within the Trip Notes. Following this, we catch a train from the highest railway station in the country – within 90 minutes we drop from 6,198ft (1,889m) to 3,599ft (1,097m). The train travels through cloud forest into tea plantations, with breath-taking views of the lush valley below. We get off at Ella railway station and continue by road to Ella Gap where we have spectacular views of the coastal plain nearly 3,280ft (1,000m) below. Almost the entire southern part of the island is in view and (on a particularly clear day) the shimmering ocean is visible. We travel to Kataragama on the plains; this is our base for visiting the best-known national park in Sri Lanka, Yala. Accommodation: Mandara Rosen (or similar)"

The park, which is primarily shrub jungle with several salt and freshwater lagoons, has one of the highest concentrations of leopards in the world. We explore the lesser-visited Block 5 area, which has denser vegetation than the open plains but the same chances of seeing the elusive leopards and sloth bears, all without having to compete with multiple other game vehicles. Please note, the sanctuary may be closed for four to six weeks from September to October, allowing park authorities to check the welfare of the animals. We therefore go to a nearby alternative, usually Udawalawe National Park. Accommodation: Mandara Rosen (or similar)"

Around a 60- to 90-minute drive south west of Kandy is Taylors Hill, a spectacularly sited boutique hotel set in acres of landscaped gardens. With just five bedrooms, this century old former planter’s residence is redolent of the past and comes with a TV room, a snooker room, extensive gardens and plenty of outdoor activities such as tennis, badminton, croquet and swimming. There are bicycles for exploring the locality and a dedicated nature guide. Nearby is Sri Lanka’s very first tea plantation, the historic Loolecondera Estate, former home of Ceylon Tea legend James Taylor; the hotel’s naturalist will take you on a tour and pack you a picnic to enjoy in Field No. 7, home to Sri Lanka’s oldest tea bushes. Alternatively, couples might like to stay at The Kandy House, a striking manor house 20- to 30-minutes from Kandy (accepts the over 12’s only).

This region is a stunning natural tapestry of verdant mountains carpeted in neatly arranged tea estates, which date back to the British colonial era. Although there are many scenic drives, taking the Main Line train option offers a unique perspective to enjoy this destination. Here you have two options and both of these hotels, operated by Teardrop Hotels, are similar in that they are extensively refurbished former tea estate manager’s bungalows with four or five rooms apiece, butlers, superb food, contemporary comforts and gardens with swimming pools. The bungalows are surrounded by tea fields and attractions include tea factory visits, tea estate walks, waterfall visits and scenic picnics. Goatfell is located to the north west of Nuwara Eliya, a former British-era Hill Station, while Nine Skies is located in Demodera, near Ella, a little further south. Travel time Kandy to Kandapola/Demodera: 3 hours/4 hours. Stay 2 nights at either Nine Skies/Goatfell."

With barely another soul to be seen on the beach here, this is a great alternative destination for relaxing in tranquility beside the sea. The villa was built by legendary architect Geoffrey Bawa, and was his last private commission before he died, which makes the property extra special. The hotel has body boards and surf boards that can be used, and also offers deep sea fishing trips. You can also climb to the top of Mulkirigala Rock, an ancient Buddhist temple. From here, it’s also possible to day trip to Udawalawe National Park (elephants), Bundala National Park for migratory and resident birds, and the Kalametiya Sanctuary. Travel time Kandapola/Demodera to Tangalle: 5.5 hours/3.5 hours. Stay 3 nights at The Last House."

From here you can wander the fort’s famed cobbled streets at will or discover hidden crevices with local guides.

You’ll stay at Water Garden – Sigiriya, one of the region’s newest boutique hotels, which is within eye-sight of one of the island’s most photographed attractions, Sigiriya. This former rock-top fortress dates back to the seventh century, and is home to superb examples of ancient hydro engineering as well as well-preserved frescoes. Hike up to the summit for incredible views. The hotel’s rooms are all freestanding villas, and offer plenty of space – the most indulgent have private plunge pools – and there’s also a lovely spa. Other notable local sights include Dambulla’s Cave Temples while further afield you could try your luck seeking out elephants in Minneriya National Park, or visit Polonnaruwa or Anuradhapura, two former ancient capitals, and both World Heritage Sites.

Food is lovely, the pool is wrapped by jungle and rooms are classic yet comfortable. Further afield (a 60-90-minute drive south west of Kandy) is Taylors Hill, a spectacularly sited boutique hotel set in acres of landscaped gardens that would suit more adventurous couples. With just five bedrooms, this century old former planter’s residence comes with a TV room, a snooker room and plenty of outdoor activities such as tennis, badminton, croquet and swimming. There are bicycles for exploring the locality, a dedicated nature guide and you can picnic at Sri Lanka’s very first tea plantation, historic Loolecondera Estate, former home of Ceylon Tea legend James Taylor.

Demodera is close to better-known Ella (15-minutes away), yet is a secluded and much quieter place to stay. Nine Skies is located nearly a kilometre above the station, and the station itself is famous for the 360-degree loop of track that circles around and under the station. Railway enthusiasts will also love walking to (or riding across) the nearby Nine Arch Bridge, after which the bungalow was named. The bungalow has been beautifully refurbished and offers plush contemporary comforts including butler service, excellent food and a garden with swimming pool. Attractions include tea factory visits, tea trails, waterfall swims and hill walks. Travel time Kandy to Demodera (Ella): 4 hours. Stay 2 nights at Nine Skies."

Strategically nestled amidst three mountain ranges, Kandy was initially built in this location as a natural fortress against attack. Kandy was not an easy target for the foreign invaders who could gain the control of coastal areas of the island without too much loss. Kandy’s main architectural monuments date mainly from the 19th Century when King Sri Vikrama Rajasinha, the last King of Kandy, constructed many new buildings. At the time of the eventual surrender of Kandy to British Rule in 1815, when King Rajasinha was captured, imprisoned and finally deported to India where he died in 1832.

At the time of the eventual surrender of Kandy to British Rule in 1815, when King Rajasinha was captured, imprisoned and finally deported to India where he died in 1832.

    "generalInfo": "This two week Sri Lanka family holiday offers families a rich and varied range of activities, excursions and things to do all within a relatively short distance of each other which cuts down on travel time and the ‘are we there yets?’ Opportunities to rest, relax and enjoy the scenery come thick and fast on this tailor made trip, with everything from waterfalls and tea plantations to beaches and rainforests providing an exotic backdrop from where to search for wild animals and fabulous photographs. Cultural sites are just as fascinating and beautiful as their natural equivalents with the statues at Sigiriya, the ancient ruins of Polonnaruwa and numerous remote jungle villages bound to inspire the imaginations of young Lara Crofts and Indiana Joneses.<br/><br/>Thanks to a customisable itinerary this family holiday puts you in the driving seat with giant Buddha statues and hidden caves one day followed by river camps and hot coal dances the next. This style of trip will appeal to families who like to be flexible and depending on the age range of your children, we can help you organise a unique and really special tour that everyone will remember long after the tans have faded.<br/><br/>The south coast, for instance, is ideal for families who prefer beach time within quieter districts with white sands and whale watching the perfect recipe for a day well spent. Alternatively, hiking deep into the Knuckles mountain range and spending nights in remote mountain villages may well appeal to other families who love the thought of plotting their own path and distances leading to waterfalls, paddy fields and those all important mountain views.<br/><br/>No matter what you’re looking for from this family holiday in Sri Lanka one thing is for sure enjoying some cool down time in the converted small boutique hotels amongst the highland tea plantations is a real joy and there’s nothing better than a Sri Lankan welcome to make you all feel right at home. Sri Lankans love children and you’ll find the smiles grow if you’ve got kids in tow, with stall holders, hoteliers and local people falling over themselves to ensure you and your family are made to feel well and truly welcome.<br/>",

One of today’s highlights is the famous train ride to Ella – a true bucket-list experience. Considered one of the most beautiful train journeys in the world, this ride winds through rolling hills, misty forests, and quiet rural villages, offering a front-row seat to the breathtaking landscapes of the hill country. Train travel in Sri Lanka can be unpredictable, with seasonal timetable changes and occasional delays or cancellations, particularly in the tourist carriages. We’ll do everything we can to secure seats and confirm availability in advance, but a little flexibility might be needed on the day. By late afternoon, we’ll arrive in Ella – a chilled-out mountain town known for its cool climate, hiking trails, and welcoming atmosphere. Spend the evening as you like: take a walk through town, try some local food, or relax and soak up the fresh mountain air."

This gentle trail is great for all ages and offers incredible panoramic views over Ella’s rolling hills and valleys – a picture-perfect moment to capture with the family. After breakfast back at the hotel, we’ll begin our journey down to the south coast, with a key stop along the way: Handunugoda Tea Estate. No trip to Sri Lanka is complete without diving into its tea heritage, and this family-owned estate offers a fascinating insight into how tea goes from leaf to cup. We’ll walk through the lush tea fields, tour the working factory and museum, and learn all about the production process. As a bonus, the estate also grows cinnamon, coconut, and rubber – giving you a full flavour of southern Sri Lanka’s agricultural life. By late afternoon, we’ll reach the coastal town of Hikkaduwa – your new home by the sea. With golden beaches, chilled cafés, gentle waves, and a coral-rich bay full of marine life, it’s the perfect place to relax and recharge after your time in the highlands."

Although we believe it captures many of Sri Lanka’s highlights, both cultural and coastal, national parks and wildlife. Driven by your own driver and expert local guide, you will stay at a carefully selected mix of locally owned accommodations. <br/><br/>Starting in Colombo, we take you straight to the beach at Negombo on the west coast to be revived after your journey and to slowly but surely adapt to the laid back lifestyle of Sri Lanka. Moving on to the cultural segment of your tour, you will spend several days in Sri Lanka’s famous Cultural Triangle, based in a hotel in Polonnaruwa, an ancient kingdom with an incredible array of 10th century temples and palace ruins. From here, you will also visit Sigiriya’s incredible rock fortress and the cave rock complex at Dambulla. <br/><br/>The middle section of your trip is when we recommend you take in the centre of Sri Lanka, staying in the ancient city of Kandy, famous and revered for the Temple of the Tooth. And from this busy spot into the cooling hill stations and tea plantations. Similarly cooling is Horton Plains National Park, further south, where you can hike into mountainous, mist covered forest, with stunning waterfalls en route.  Followed by more tropical wonders at Ella, which you can reach by train, and where you can hike up to Ella’s Rock or Little Adam’s Peak for the most stunning views. <br/><br/>Heading further south, one of the highlights of this trip for many is Yala National Park where a jeep safari will take you deep into the habitats of elephants, sloth bear, wild buffalo, sambhar elk and deer. And, most famously, leopard, with Yala boasting the highest, concentrated leopard population in the world. Although sightings are rare. <br/><br/>You will certainly have earned your few days at Unawatuna beach where you will stay just a quick walk from the shore. We also recommend one final stop at Galle, the magnificent 16th century fort town built by the Portuguese and now a buzzing hub of culture, markets and fine cuisine. <br/>",

Experience the wonderful Pidurangala Ancient Cave Monastery to see the sunrise. Before King Kashyapa constructed his fortified palace upon Sigiriya, several monks resided within the royal grounds to be. To accommodate his kingdom in the clouds, the king graciously relocated the monks to the adjacent rock formation of Pidurangala in the 5th century AD, where he built a humble temple and monastery amidst a religious complex of Dagobas and temples at its base. Today, Pidurangala serves as an alternative or additional climb to Sigiriya with panoramic views of the ancient fortress and the surrounding landscapes. Enveloped by foliage from all sides, the gentle ascent consists of irregular steps that lead to a landing which houses a large reclining Buddha statue, now considered to be the oldest one built in brick within Sri Lanka. Beyond the landing, your adventure is led by no defined path, but a natural instinct that draws visitors to the open summit of Pidurangala and its breath taking vistas of the region. Afterwards you will travel to Kandy. Travel time approximately 2 hours. Evening you can have a soft walk at Kandy tour. Kandy is a beautiful historical city in the citadel of the country. It is not only known for its great kings who ruled the city for almost 225 years independently until the British took over in 1815, but it is also the place where the Sacred Tooth of Lord Buddha is laid in a magnificent temple. Strategically nestled amidst three mountain ranges, Kandy was initially built in this location as a natural fortress against attack. Kandy was not an easy target for the foreign invaders who could gain the control of coastal areas of the island without too much loss. Kandy’s main architectural monuments date mainly from the 19th Century when King Sri Vikrama Rajasinha, the last King of Kandy, constructed many new buildings. At the time of the eventual surrender of Kandy to British Rule in 1815, when King Rajasinha was captured, imprisoned and finally deported to India where he died in 1832.

Kandy is a beautiful historical city in the citadel of the country. It is not only known for its great kings who ruled the city for almost 225 years independently until the British took over in 1815, but it is also the place where the Sacred Tooth of Lord Buddha is laid in a magnificent temple. Strategically nestled amidst three mountain ranges, Kandy was initially built in this location as a natural fortress against attack. Kandy was not an easy target for the foreign invaders who could gain the control of coastal areas of the island without too much loss. Kandy’s main architectural monuments date mainly from the 19th Century when King Sri Vikrama Rajasinghe, the last King of Kandy, constructed many new buildings. At the time of the eventual surrender of Kandy to British Rule in 1815, when King Rajasinghe was captured, imprisoned and finally deported to India where he died in 1832. In the Afternoon you will visit The Temple of the Tooth & Buddhist Museum, Sri Dalada Maligawa dates back to the 16th century, though most of the present buildings were built in the 19th century. Venerated as the most important object in the Buddhist world, the Sacred Relic of the Tooth of Buddha is enshrined at the Temple. Brought from India 2500 years ago, it is said that the possessor of the Relic had the right to rule the country. The Relic is kept in a gold casket and stored amidst great security in the Inner Chamber. Afterwards you will see Traditional Kandyan Dance – Kandy, Sri Lanka’s second largest city is home to a Sinhalese cultural tradition of which Sri Lankans are justifiably proud. Rich in colour and agile in their movements, the Kandyan Dancers evoke images of pageantry and traditions past. Lively and exuberant, spellbinding and hypnotic, a Cultural Show is a spectacle to remember with its nimble dancers, energetic drummers and fireproof firewalkers Location: - Kandy Hotel: Bed & Breakfast"

A well-planned monastic complex included caved temples, bathing pools, lovely ponds and Asia's oldest surviving landscaped gardens. The \"Lion stairway\", the \"mirror wall\" and the \"water gardens\" are its other highlights.

It is one of the world’s oldest forms of healing and treatment. You will find some of the best Ayurveda practitioners in Sri Lanka. Ayurveda is a well known treatment for stress, diabetes, migraine, asthma, arthritis, immune system and high blood pressure.

SPICE GARDENS – Spices have long been important in the commercial history of Sri Lanka. With so many spices and herbs growing on the island’s shores, it is unsurprising that they were used to barter and trade between the sea-faring merchants, and have been a main export of Sri Lanka down through the ages. For centuries the indigenous herbs and spices have been used for both medicinal purposes and in traditional Sri Lankan cuisine. To visit a Spice Garden is to open up your senses to smells and tastes, old and new. Cinnamon, ginger, vanilla and cardamom are just some of the spices available in the numerous Spice Gardens between Dambulla and Kandy. Afterwards you will visit The Temple of the Tooth. Sri Dalada Maligawa dates back to the 16th century, though most of the present buildings were built in the 19th century. Venerated as the most important object in the Buddhist world, the Sacred Relic of the Tooth of Buddha is enshrined at the Temple. Brought from India 2500 years ago, it is said that the possessor of the Relic had the right to rule the country. The Relic is kept in a gold casket and stored amidst great security in the Inner Chamber. In the afternoon you explore the Kandy City & markets. It is great place for shopping or just walks around the Lake and enjoys the beautiful scenery and narrow streets. In the evening you will see Traditional Kandyan Dance – Kandy, Sri Lanka’s second largest city is home to a Sinhalese cultural tradition of which Sri Lankans are justifiably proud. Rich in colour and agile in their movements, the Kandyan Dancers evoke images of pageantry and traditions past. Lively and exuberant, spellbinding and hypnotic, a Cultural Show is a spectacle to remember with its nimble dancers, energetic drummers and fireproof firewalkers.

It’s a verdant, tropical island, that’s both rich in culture but also in natural beauty and wildlife. Our tailor made Sri Lanka holidays can pick and mix from the best of this diverse country, which boasts nine World Heritage Sites, 14 national parks, 86 species of mammals, including elephants and leopards, lush hill country where tea is grown and an Indian Ocean coastline with sandy beaches and swaying palms. No wonder Marco Polo described Sri Lanka as “undoubtedly the finest island of its size in the world”.<br/><br/>For our tailor made Sri Lanka holidays we have developed a unique online holiday planner to enable visitors to create their own itinerary. Sophisticated and user-friendly, the holiday planner offers an opportunity to create individual tailor made holidays to Sri Lanka at your leisure! You are able to explore and plan your own route, excursions and activities, as well as choose the type and style of accommodation that suits you best. A 15-day sample itinerary for one of our tailor made Sri Lanka holidays is given below, but the real choice is yours and an amazing variety of tailor made Sri Lanka holidays are available. <br/><br/>Temperatures remain pretty much the same throughout the year in Sri Lanka, because the island sits just north of the equator, but rainfall varies widely season to season. The best time to come is between the main rainy seasons, which affect different sides of the island at different times. In the south, southwest and hill country, November to April is the best time to come, when the southwest monsoon has finished. In the north and east, October to February is when the northeast monsoon occurs. In this part of the island, it’s better to come when it's dry but hot from April to September. Throughout the year, the hill country always feels much cooler, thanks to its higher elevation.<br/>",

This Dry Zone region has mostly dry thorn scrub, interspersed with small dusty glades – the ideal habitat to view elephants, Sri Lanka's largest mammal. The park does have a varied landscape, however, from parkland to dense jungle on the plains, scrubland with rocky outcrops and several streams, small lakes and lagoons. The picturesque ocean frontage to the east has wide beaches and high sand dunes. A former hunting reserve, which was transformed into a nature park in 1938, Yala National Park, also called “Ruhuna”, is currently home to over 390 elephants, several of which are tuskers, and about 120 leopards, reportedly the highest density of leopards in the wild anywhere in the world. Watching elephants go for their bath at sunset or seeing leopards laze about on the rocks at dusk are the most popular natural spectacles at Yala National Park. However, you may also see other species of mammals such as sambar and spotted deer, wild boar, buffalo, musk deer, black bear, the unique small Loris, toque macaque and langur monkeys, jackal, mongoose, porcupine, civet cat, anteater, and the enigmatic sloth bear. Over 150 species of birds have been recorded in Yala National Park, including the Sri Lankan Junglefowl, White-bellied Fish Eagle, Painted Stork, Black-necked Stork, Lesser Adjutant, Pompadour Green Pigeon, Orange-breasted Green Pigeon, Brown Fish Owl, Red-faced Malkoha, three species of bee-eaters, and large numbers of waders (including three species of pratincole and two thick-knees).

This newly built five-bedroom boutique hotel by Teardrop Hotels is a contemporary interpretation of a tea planters home. Each of the five bedrooms are unique, with views of the lake and/or the tea fields and jungle that edge the garden. The feel is very much like a country home with butlers on hand to tend to guests and a superb chef to prepare meals. The climate in the hills is cooler, especially at night, and a roaring fire adds plenty of romantic atmosphere every evening. The hotel has a small swimming pool and activities include walks through the tea estates, scenic picnics, waterfall trails, lake boat tours and visits to a tea factory.

On your way, you could go via Nuwara Eliya to check out the colonial-era sights of this former British Hill Station and pause there for lunch. Around town are allotments bursting with leeks, potatoes, carrots and other vegetables and the region is also well known for growing strawberries.

Demodera is close to better-known Ella (15-minutes away), yet is a secluded and much quieter place to stay. Nine Skies is located just above the railway line, and the station itself is famous for its 360-degree loop of track while nearby is the Nine Arch Bridge, after which the bungalow was named. The bungalow has been beautifully refurbished and offers plush contemporary comforts including butler service, excellent food and a garden with swimming pool. Attractions include tea factory visits, tea trails, waterfall swims and hill walks. Travel time Castlereagh Reservoir to Demodera: 4 hours. Stay 2 nights at Nine Skies."

        "description": ": Our tour starts today in Negombo, a coastal town that's famous for its fishing industry and golden sands. The perfect introduction to Sri Lankan life, Negombo is a busy coastal town with a lively fish market and traditional ketti-maran (catamaran) fishing boats scudding across the waters - the capital, Colombo, is a short distance away, too. Head down to the water to catch the sunset and spot locals bringing in the day's catch. For those arriving in time, our tour leader plans to meet you in the hotel reception at 6pm for a welcome meeting and for those that wish, there is the chance to go out for dinner. There are no other activities planned today, so you're free to arrive in Negombo at any time. If you'd like an airport transfer, you'll need to arrive into Colombo's Bandaranaike International Airport (CMB), which is a 30-minute drive from our hotel. If you miss the welcome meeting, your tour leader will inform you of any essential information as soon as you catch up. If your flight arrives earlier in the day, you might like to head to the beach or make use of the hotel facilities which include a swimming pool overlooking the Indian Ocean."

        "description": ": A three-hour drive north today takes us to Wilpattu National Park. En route, we'll visit a nearby fishing village which uses traditional-style outrigger canoes, known as 'oruvas'. Depending on the season, we might spot 'toddy tappers' climbing coconut trees to collect sap from the flowers along the way, too. The sap they collect is used to make Arak - a local whisky-type spirit. Despite its location in Sri Lanka's dry zone, Wilpattu National Park boasts nearly 60 lakes and is renowned for being home to leopards, elephants, and sambar deer. We'll head out on a jeep safari in the hope of spotting the elusive leopard. We choose to visit this park, rather than the more touristy Yala National Park further south because we believe it offers our customers a better experience. You can spot the same animals here as in Yala, however it's less crowded, making our visit more enjoyable and responsible. Leaving the park, we'll drive onwards to nearby Anuradhapura, where we'll spend the next two nights."

        "description": ": This morning, we'll travel 12 kilometres/8 miles to the mountain peak of Mihintale. It's believed that this was the site of a momentous meeting between the monk Mahinda and King Devanampiyatissa, introducing Buddhism to the country. Exploring Mihintale involves climbing a flight of shallow stone steps, and a short final section with uneven steps carved into the bedrock and a handrail leading to the summit. There are excellent panoramic views from the top across the entire surrounding landscape. In the afternoon, we'll explore the ancient capital of Anuradhapura - a UNESCO World Heritage Site famous for its well-preserved ancient ruins and considered to be Sri Lanka's first capital. One of the oldest continually inhabited cities in the world, it was founded around 500 BC. Its golden age began around 260 BC when the King and his people converted to Buddhism. The city became vast, spreading over many miles. There were hospitals for the sick, hostels for travellers and artificial reservoirs to ensure a good water supply. Of great interest are the 2,200-year-old Sacred Bodhi-Tree; the Brazen Palace, once a nine-storey residence for monks; the 4th-century Samadhi Buddha masterpiece and the Ruvanvalisaya Dagoba - a 90-metre/295-foot-high dome-shaped stupa towering over the surrounding countryside."

        "description": ": Travelling towards Giritale today, we'll stop to view the magnificent Standing Buddha of Aukana, which reaches 12 metres/39 feet high. Sculpted in the 5th century by a master craftsman, it's still relatively isolated in its jungle setting. Our next stop is Dambulla, where a series of caves have been turned into temples dating from the 1st century BC. This UNESCO World Heritage Site still attracts scores of worshippers. After climbing the hill we'll visit five separate caves, which contain a large number of Buddha images, as well as sculptures of Hindu Gods. After enjoying a traditional Sri Lankan lunch of curry and rice, we'll drive on to the small town of Giritale - our base from which we'll explore Polonnaruwa. Our hotel for tonight is beautifully situated, overlooking the 7th-century, man-made lake. Our total journey time today is approximately 3.5 hours."

        "description": ": This morning, we'll explore the ancient city of Polonnaruwa, Sri Lanka's second capital city which reached its height of glory in the 12th century, when it was a thriving commercial and religious centre. The city has maintained many of its spectacular buildings and monuments, with arguably the most impressive being the Quadrangle. This sacred precinct originally housed the tooth relic. It contains a superbly decorated circular shrine which is one of the most ornate buildings in the country. The neighbouring audience hall and bathing pool are also worth a visit. Close by, the curious round structure of the Circular Relic House has a beautifully preserved moonstone carved at the foot of a flight of steps. Another famous feature of this deserted city is the group of carved images of the Buddha, known as Galvihara. These four colossal figures are all hewn out of solid granite and the Reclining Buddha alone is no less than 14 metres/46 feet long. After our visit, we'll continue driving towards our accommodation. In the early afternoon, we'll have the option to take a jeep safari in either Minneriya or Kadaula National Park, in search of herds of wild elephants. Your tour leader will be able to advise you of the likelihood of elephant sightings on the day. The parks are also home to a large array of birdlife, including painted storks."

        "title": "Climb Lion Rock at sunrise; drive to Kandy",
        "description": ": We'll have an early start this morning as we plan to climb Sigiriya ahead of the crowds and while it's still relatively cool. Rising dramatically from the central plains, the UNESCO-protected ruins of this 5th-century 'Sky Fortress' are one of Sri Lanka's major attractions and an impressive feat of engineering skill. The fortress was built in just seven years as a fortified palace atop the granite peak, to protect the reign of merciless King Kassapa who had assassinated his father and deposed his brother. Before our final ascent to the summit, we'll pass between a set of enormous lion paws carved out of the rock - all that remains of an ancient gateway that gave Sigiriya, the 'Lion Rock', its name. From here a series of switchback steel stairways ascend to the top. Once at the 200-metre/656-foot summit, we can take in the magnificent views of the surrounding jungle and countryside. We return to our hotel in time for a late breakfast. After a chance to have breakfast and freshen up, we leave the hotel at around 11am. The drive to Kandy should take around four hours including stops for lunch, to see a woodcarving centre at Naula and a spice garden."

        "title": "Explore Kandy. Discover the Temple of the Tooth and Peradeniya Botanical Gardens",
        "description": ": Sitting on a plateau 500 metres/1640 feet above sea level and 112 kilometres/69 miles northeast of Colombo, Kandy is, in climatic and cultural terms, a world apart from Colombo. Serving as the capital of the last Sinhalese kingdom until falling to the British in 1815, it's a place of cultural and spiritual importance. Buddhists from all over the world come here specifically to visit the Temple of the Tooth, the Dalada Maligawa. The costly jewelled shrine of the Holy Tooth, said to be Buddha's left canine, is kept on the upper floor of the original building. This relic was brought from India 1,500 years ago and every year, at the time of the August full moon, it is paraded around the town with great celebration in the Perahera Festival. This morning's sightseeing includes attending the Temple of the Tooth Ceremony and a visit to the serene Royal Botanical Gardens in Peradeniya. For lunch we have included a visit to a social enterprise run by women who are either differently abled or come from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. The cafe gives them a chance to earn a meaningful income. In addition to the meal, there is a small on-site workshop where guests can see the women crafting handmade products, which are sold in the adjoining shop. The afternoon is free to continue exploring the busy highland town at your own pace. In the evening, for those interested there is the option to watch a performance by the famous Kandyan dancers, complete with impressive costumes and graceful dances, accompanied by a thundering drumbeat."

        "title": "Drive to Dalhousie for a night ascent of Adam's Peak",
        "description": ": After a free morning, we'll drive three and a half hours to Dalhousie in the foothills of Adam's Peak. Here, we'll have the opportunity to ascend this sacred mountain, known locally as Sri Pada. A depression at the top of the peak is said to be Buddha's footprint and, each year, thousands of locals climb to the top for sunrise. Setting off at around 2am, we'll join pilgrims for our ascent. There is a stone staircase which we'll follow right to the top. It can be tough on the legs, and some may find it physically challenging, but you can go at your own pace, take your time and savour the experience shared with pilgrims. We plan to reach the top in time for sunrise and take time to soak up the spectacular views that surround us. The ascent involves around 900 metres/2952 feet of ascent and descent, with many flights of steps (some of which are steep) and is about 5 kilometres/3 miles in each direction. On busy days, we'll set out a bit earlier, shortly after midnight. Please note that on rare occasions the sheer volume of local pilgrims is so great that the final stages of the ascent may be extremely busy, and it may not be possible to reach the summit. For anyone not wanting to climb the peak, there will be free time to explore the small town of Dalhousie or to relax at our guesthouse and you will have a night of sleep while the others are sharing the trek with local pilgrims In Dalhousie, we'll stay at the Punsisi Resthouse. It is a little basic although the rooms are clean and spacious with ensuite bathrooms. Staying here enables us easy access to Adam's Peak and the pilgrims add to the atmosphere in town. A number of the rooms are located in another more recent building some way up the hill behind the main building, accessed on foot by a series of steps. Porters will be able to help with your main luggage. There are some simpler rooms located in the main building and if you prefer to be allocated one of these room then please speak to the Tour Leader before check in. Please note any change of room is dependent on availability."

        "description": ": Returning from the peak this morning, we'll enjoy a well-earned late breakfast and some time for a shower before setting off on a three-hour, scenic drive to Nuwara Eliya. This part of Sri Lanka is an important tea-growing area and plantations stretch over rolling hills for as far as the eye can see, interspersed with the occasional tea-making factory. We plan a visit to a tea estate close to Nuwara Eliya to learn about the process of picking the leaves and creating the perfect cuppa. Known as 'Little England', Nuwara Eliya is reminiscent of Britain with its red telephone boxes, Victorian colonial architecture and pretty rose gardens - relics from its era as a hill country retreat for any homesick Brits. The cool climate provided a sanctuary in which they could immerse themselves in familiar pastimes, such as polo, golf and cricket."

        "description": ": After a relaxed breakfast this morning, we'll drive the short distance to Nanu Oyu to board our train for the scenic journey to Demodara. The train winds through tea plantations and we'll take the chance to soak in the dramatic views of the valley below as we cross the Nine Arch Bridge (also known as the Bridge in the Sky). The train ride takes approximately four hours, and we'll then have another short drive to Ella, our stop for tonight. Train tickets are in very high demand and the process of securing tickets is affected by corruption. We always try our best to get our reservation confirmed, but on the rare occasion that this is not possible, you will continue the journey in our private vehicle. Please note that the train lines were damaged by Cyclone Ditwah in November 2025 and trains are unable to run. It is anticipated that it will take 6 months or more to repair this damage. Please ask the Tour Leader on arrival for the latest update or contact us if you want more information."

        "description": ": This morning, we'll visit the nearby Ravana Ella Falls, one of the widest waterfalls on the island, before continuing south descending from the hill country until we reach the southern plains. We'll make a stop and walk a short distance to see a 15-metre/51-foot image of the Buddha carved into the rockface, known as Colossi of Buduruvagala, rising majestically above us along with other Mahayana statues. Our journey continues with a two-hour drive to Udawalawe. Designated as a national park in 1972, Udawalawe covers 31,800 hectares and is surrounded by mountains, a mix of rolling grasslands, teak plantations, rainforest, and scrub. Renowned for its large herd of elephants, the park is one of the best places in Sri Lanka to see them and is also home to deer, wild boar, buffalo, jackal, and leopard. The resident bird population is also second to none, including a magnificent collection of birds of prey, chief among them the impressive, white-bellied sea eagle. In the afternoon, we'll head out to explore the park by jeep as well as paying a visit to the Elephant Transit Home where orphaned elephants are cared for until they're old enough to be released back into the wild. Tonight, we'll sleep in a fixed-tented camp close to the banks of the Rakwana River. The camp is comfortable with twin beds, simple ensuite bathrooms and mosquito nets, and waking up next to the river is ideal for a spot of early morning bird watching."

In the afternoon, we'll visit the pretty coastal town of Galle and en route we might be lucky enough to see the famous stilt fisherman balancing precariously above the ocean. An important trading centre since ancient times, the fortifications that can be seen in Galle today were built by the Portuguese and then the Dutch between the 16th and 17th centuries. The fort ramparts of this UNESCO World Heritage Site protect the harbour and a myriad of fascinating old houses, churches, and warehouses. Today, the town has a strong arts vibe, with foreign and local artists, writers, photographers, designers, and poets drawing inspiration from their surroundings. Boutique shops and cafes around the town showcase their work. There's a lot to explore in the town and simply wandering its streets is a great way to see the sites while soaking up the unique atmosphere. If you feel like you haven't spent enough time here after the tour, don't worry, you'll have the opportunity to come back tomorrow."

We'll spend the afternoon exploring Sri Lanka's capital city. We'll wander around the historical 'fort' area, now the business district, whose buildings are like a slice through Colombo's colonial history, and visit the Pettah neighbourhood, famous for its bustling open-air bazaars and markets. We'll also visit the most important Buddhist temple in the capital, Gangaramaya, which is an oasis of calm in an otherwise frenetic city. Finally, we'll end our trip by the Galle Face Green, an urban park along the seafront where locals gather to play cricket."

After your welcome meeting, your leader will take you to a local restaurant for a seafood dinner. Sri Lankan food is famous for its rich scents, spices and flavours, and this evening you’ll find out why as you sample some local favourites like pol sambol (a tasty coconut dish) and roast paan (crispy roasted bread)."

Morning is the best time to visit the market – your leader will help you navigate the organised frenzy of vendors displaying things like crabs, lobsters and squid. Then, say goodbye to Negombo and make the drive to Dambulla, where you'll spend the next three nights. Settle into your hotel and in the late afternoon, head out for one of the highlights of any visit to Sri Lanka – the magnificent UNESCO World Heritage site of the palace of Sigiriya (Lion Rock). This dramatic rocky outcrop, rising from the surrounding plains, is topped by a ruined palace. It's a good workout to get to the top, but the sight makes it well worth it. Your leader will share stories of the ancient civilisation who once lived atop the rock as you climb. In the evening, return to Dambulla for a Sri Lankan style barbecue. Tuck into a delicious array of fresh grilled fish, meat and vegetables, and watch a demonstration on how to make chilli and coconut sambol, so you can recreate the taste of Sri Lanka at home."

Pay a visit to the Sri Maha Bodhi Tree Temple – home to a sacred bodhi tree planted in 236, believed to be the oldest human-planted tree in the world.

It is dedicated to God Murugan – (God of Tamils). Nallur was part of once thriving Jaffna Kingdom. The Portuguese who captured Jaffna in 1560 demolished the Temple in 1621 leaving no traces of it. The temple then stood at Sankili Thoppu on the eastern side of the Point Pedro Road (The site was later used for erecting a Christian Church). Jaffna again fell to Dutch in 1658. They were more tolerant on religious freedom and the temple was allowed to be rebuilt in the current location in 1734 by Don Juan Mappana Mudliyar as a humble temple dedicated to lord Murugan. This impressive temple is now fully restored. The temple hosts an enormous and spectacular Hindu festival for over 25 days in July/August, which climaxes on the twenty fourth with parades of floats and displays of self-mutilation by entranced devotees. In the afternoon you will explore Jaffna Fort – Clock Tower – Jaffna Library. You will then proceed to Oddtumadam, through Araly Road, Karainagar – Casuarina Beach .

Nelson in his book Dutch ‘Fort in Sri Lanka’ claimed that ‘’ it was, as a technical fort, everything was done to the latest design at each successive stage and final result was the strongest fortress in the East, the perfect defensive design in the days of powerful and destructive solid shot artillery of limited effective range. In Britain, fully comparable places are to be found only at the towns of Berwick , at Fort George neat Inverness, at the citadel of Plymouth at Tilbury Fort on the Thames approaches to London. There are many fine artillery fortifications from the same period around the Indian Ocean. Yet it is doubtful whether in it’s technically perfection and its completeness, Jaffna can be surpassed’.

        "description": "Kandy: Sri Lanka's second largest city of Kandy is a beautiful historical city in the citadel of the country. It is not only known for its great kings who ruled the city for almost 225 years independently until the British took over in 1815, but it is also the place where the Sacred Tooth of Lord Buddha is laid in a magnificent temple. Strategically nestled amidst three mountain ranges, Kandy was initially built in this location as a natural fortress against attack. Kandy was not an easy target for the foreign invaders who could gain the control of coastal areas of the island without too much loss. Kandy’s main architectural monuments date mainly from the 19th Century when King Vikrama Rajasinha, the last King of Kandy, constructed many new buildings. At the time of the eventual surrender of Kandy to British Rule in 1815, when King Rajasinha was captured, imprisoned and finally deported to India where he died in 1832. The most visited places of cultural, religious and natural interest in Kandy are the Sri Dalada Maligawa and the Peradeniya Botanical Gardens. The incomparable Perahera celebration, a procession of more than 100 elephants, is held every July/August here. In the afternoon you explore the Kandy City & markets. It is great place for shopping or just walks around the Lake and enjoys the beautiful scenery and narrow streets. KANDY LAKE – Built in 1806, Kandy Lake was constructed in order to bring more beauty to the Palace of King Sri Rajasinghe. In the centre of the Lake a small island was built to enable the King to be rowed out and relax whilst surveying his kingdom. The Queen’s Bathing House is set on the edge of Kandy Lake. Kandy Lake is sometimes called ‘Milky Sea’. After breakfast you will visit The Temple of the Tooth & Buddhist Museum. Sri Dalada Maligawa dates back to the 16th century, though most of the present buildings were built in the 19th century. Venerated as the most important object in the Buddhist world, the Sacred Relic of the Tooth of Buddha is enshrined at the Temple. Brought from India 2500 years ago, it is said that the possessor of the Relic had the right to rule the country. The Relic is kept in a gold casket and stored amidst great security in the Inner Chamber. The Temple complex is made up of numerous buildings most of which are highly decorated with paintings and carvings depicting Buddha. Rich in history and tradition, the Sri Dalada Maligawa is a religious centre where daily worship is a colourful and joyful way of everyday life. At several times throughout the day different services are held and with the large numbers of worshippers present, it is clear to see why Buddhists are so piously devoted towards the Sacred Tooth Relic. Spine-tingling traditional drumming to be heard coming from the Inner Chamber, will signal that the ceremonial opening of the window for the public viewing of the casket with the Relic within is just about to begin. We conclude our Tour before the Drumming commences. In the afternoon you explore the Kandy City & markets.

When the British eventually wrested control of the Kandyan Kingdom in 1815, the site at Peradeniya was a Royal Pleasure Garden, apparently being enjoyed by the last Queen of Kandy. In typical fashion, the British were quick to establish their own indelible stamp on this lush corner that exists in the cradle of a deep bend in the wide and languid river, the Mahaweli. Initially managed by Alexander Moon, the gardens started as little more than a coffee and cinnamon plantation. Today, spread over a sprawling 147 hectares, they are home to some 4,000 species from all corners of the earth. There is a pungent and fascinating spice garden which provides a fine introduction to the long-practiced medicinal science of Ayurveda and an exceptional orchid house sheltering some 300 varieties.

Covering a total area of 65,000 square kilometres, it lies close to the subcontinent of India but couldn't be more different. <br/><br/>Buddhism laid the foundations for the ancient culture of this island nation and this is evident in the magnificent architecture and sites that are around today. From the ancient 5th-century rock fortress at Sigiriya, the home of early Buddhist monks, to the temple complex near Kandalama, the influence of Buddhism is still evident in the lives of the people that live around these ancient sites and on the island in general. <br/><br/>Sri Lanka's abundant wildlife, unique birdlife and diverse topography are arguably one of the island's greatest attractions. There aren't too many places on this earth that can boast having the highest leopard population density in the world! With diverse topography ranging from prehistoric rock and mud plains, to moist monsoon forests and marine wetlands, Yala National Park offers you the opportunity to see these magnificent cats on safaris that can last for up to seven hours! <br/><br/>Not to be left behind the leopards, the awesome elephants at Minneriya National Park boast some of the largest free-roaming herds on the subcontinent. Also at the National Park are endemic species of Gray Hornbill and Hanging Parrot. For the more water inclined, Sri Lanka's east, west and southern coasts offer a diverse range of scuba dive options from historic wreck-dives to a fascinating diversity of reefs and marine life. But on this experience, Whale watching off the Coast of Mirissa is a definite must do! <br/><br/>Colonialism left its mark on this small island nation and the results can be seen in the plantation-rich and culturally distinct mountain regions of Ella and Kandy. <br/><br/>We believe a journey through this tropical island isn’t complete without a rail experience. Some of the most scenic rail roads exist on this compact Indian Ocean Island and we’ll have you experience one of them. Situated in Central Sri Lanka you’ll experience a journey from Kandy through fascinating countryside, culminating in the tea country of Ella!<br/><br/>Capping the trip is the historic and atmospheric Galle Fort with it’s lovely walking and culinary trails that we curate through.",

This Sri Lanka tour and beach holiday will take you on an unforgettable journey to the country’s beaches, heritage sites and National Parks.<br/><br/>This holiday is based at different beachside locations depending on the prevailing monsoon season: Ahungalla and Negombo on the west coast from November to April, and Uppuveli and Passikudah on the east coast from May to October.<br/><br/>Heritance Ahungalla is a luxury beachside hotel designed by Geoffrey Bawa, Sri Lanka’s most celebrated contemporary architect, and it commands an unbeatable position on a long stretch of golden sandy beach lapped by the Indian Ocean on the island's southwest coast. <br/><br/>Jetwing Sea is a contemporary west coast resort that blends the finest of tropical luxury with traditional Sri Lankan hospitality on the buzzing beach strip of Negombo. The hotel is committed to several sustainable initiatives which empower the local community, harness the potential of the surrounding environment, and deliver a fulfilling experience of responsible tourism.<br/><br/>Trinco Blu by Cinnamon is located in Uppuveli just north of Trincomalee on a protected white sandy beach on the island's east coast. The resort opens directly onto the beach to the shallow calm clear waters of the Indian Ocean from its private grounds, which include an infinity swimming pool, two restaurants and a bar. A variety of water sports are available, including a PADI-certified dive centre.<br/><br/>Maalu Maalu Resort &amp; Spa is conceived as a traditional Sri Lankan fishing village, or ‘Waadiya’, with the simple eco-friendly architecture being inspired by the wooden-clad dwellings of a typical fisherman’s hut. The rooms and adjoining public areas are designed to seamlessly blend with the surrounding environment. The resort is positioned directly on the beachfront of Passikudah Bay, one of the east coast's most attractive sandy beaches. <br/><br/>As well chilling out on the beach, you’ll also get to explore the Cultural Triangle, visiting Kandy, the Dambulla cave temples, the medieval capital of Polonnaruwa and Lion Rock at Sigiriya, all World Heritage Sites. A jeep safari in Minneriya National Park is also on the agenda, and here you’ll see a myriad of birds and beasts including elephants, leopards, toque macaques, purple faced langurs, sloth bears, sambar and spotted deer.<br/><br/>Sri Lanka lies just north of the equator so temperatures remain almost constant throughout the year (around 27C around the coast). The best time to visit the west coast and the Cultural Triangle is from November to April after the southwest monsoon has finished, while the east coast is best from May to October.<br/><br/>However, even during the monsoon season the rain passes through quickly, although the sea is rougher than during the dry season. The advantage is that there are fewer tourists on the island, and the traditional and generous Sri Lankan welcome is always there!<br/>",

Yapahuwa Rock Fortress –Many historians compare Yapahuwa to the Sigiriya rock fortress but note that it was built on a much smaller scale. In 1272, King Bhuvenakabahu transferred the capital from Polonnaruwa to Yapahuwa in the face of Dravidian invasions from South India, bringing the Sacred Tooth Relic with him. Following the death of King Bhuvenakabahu in 1284, the Pandyans of South India invaded Sri Lanka once again, and succeeded in capturing Sacred Tooth Relic. Following its capture, Yapahuwa was largely abandoned and inhabited by Buddhist monks and religious ascetics. Remarkable masterwork of Yapahuwa remains an ornamental stairway that conducted the royal palace. Surrounding vistas of breathtaking beauty enriches the climb to the top; rambling jungle, rolling hills and sunbathed rocks combine to create a picture-perfect tableau. Afterwards you will visit, Avukana is 39 foot tall and 10 feet width statue and it’s carved out of one single rock, and is the tallest Buddha statue in existence today.

Since British times Peradeniya has become one of the finest botanical gardens in Asia. When the British eventually wrested control of the Kandyan Kingdom in 1815, the site at Peradeniya was a Royal Pleasure Garden, apparently being enjoyed by the last Queen of Kandy. In typical fashion, the British were quick to establish their own indelible stamp on this lush corner that exists in the cradle of a deep bend in the wide and languid river, the Mahaweli. Initially managed by Alexander Moon, the gardens started as little more than a coffee and cinnamon plantation. Today, spread over a sprawling 147 hectares, they are home to some 4,000 species from all corners of the earth. There is a pungent and fascinating spice garden which provides a fine introduction to the long-practiced medicinal science of Ayurveda and an exceptional orchid house sheltering some 300 varieties.

It is commonly used as a place where Sri Lankans come together in unison for significant national celebrations and cultural activities. The Independence Commemoration Hall is also used to host ceremonies that mark national unity. This unique and outstanding monument positioned in the heart of Sri Lanka’s commercial capital Colombo, commemorates the country’s independence from foreign rule.

With its Dutch colonial architecture, flavourful seafood, and proximity to the capital, Negombo offers a perfect blend of relaxation and cultural exploration. If your flight arrives earlier in the day, you might like to head to the beach or make use of the hotel facilities which include a swimming pool and gardens overlooking the Indian Ocean. Head down to the water to catch the sunset and spot locals bringing in the day's catch. For those arriving on time, our tour leader plans to meet you in the hotel reception at 6pm for a welcome meeting, followed by a cocktail on the beach to celebrate the start of our journey and to meet your fellow travellers. For those that wish, the leader will arrange to have dinner together, most likely at the hotel's great restaurant. If you miss the welcome meeting, your tour leader will inform you of any essential information as soon as you catch up. If you'd like an airport transfer today, you'll need to arrive into Colombo's Bandaranaike International Airport (CMB) airport, which is a drive of around 30 minutes from our hotel. As part of our Upgraded range, we also offer a complimentary transfer to those who have made pre-tour accommodation arrangements through Explore, regardless of your arrival day. For a welcome and relaxing introduction to Sri Lanka the Jetwing Blue is a 5-star hotel located on the golden beaches of Negombo, overlooking the India Ocean. Open spaces and minimalist design define the style. Facilities include a large pool, bar, restaurant, gym and spa.

Rising dramatically from the central plains, the UNESCO-protected ruins of this 5th-century 'Sky Fortress' are one of Sri Lanka's major attractions and an impressive feat of engineering skill. The fortress was built in just seven years as a fortified palace atop the granite peak, to protect the reign of merciless King Kassapa who had assassinated his father and deposed his brother. Before our final ascent to the summit, we'll pass between a set of enormous lion paws carved out of the rock - all that remains of an ancient gateway that gave Sigiriya, the 'Lion Rock', its name. From here a series of switchback steel stairways ascend to the top. Once at the 200-metre/656-foot summit, we can take in the magnificent views of the surrounding jungle and countryside. We return to our hotel in time for a late breakfast. In the late morning we visit a typical village to learn more about local life in this region. After a look around and a ride in a typical tractor drawn cart, we'll be treated to a traditional Sri Lankan lunch with various curries and rice.

It's still an important place of pilgrimage and, perched atop a rocky hill, offers panoramic views of the surrounding countryside. After this visit we leave the north-central plains behind and journey south to the capital of the highlands. The drive should take around three hours, including a visit to a spice and herb garden en route where we also stop for lunch. Sitting at 500 metres above sea level and 112 kilometres northeast of Colombo, Kandy is, in climatic and cultural terms, a world apart from Colombo. Serving as the capital of the last Sinhalese kingdom until falling to the British in 1815, it's a place of cultural and spiritual importance. We should reach our hotel for check in around 3pm and there'll be some free time to have a look around this bustling city or just relax. Later this afternoon we explore the old town on foot. Buddhists from all over the world come here specifically to visit the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic, the Dalada Maligawa, considered a symbol of spiritual significance and national pride in Sri Lanka. The bejewelled shrine of the Holy Tooth, said to be Buddha's left canine, is kept on the upper floor of the original building. This relic was brought from India 1,500 years ago, and every year, at the time of the August full moon, it's paraded around the town with great celebration. The Mahaweli Reach 5-star hotel is located on the banks of Sri Lanka's longest river, in the suburbs of Kandy around 5 kilometres from the old town. The free-form swimming pool is surrounded by mature trees, grounds and two wings with rooms spread over five floors. There's a restaurant, bar, modern gym and snooker room from a bygone era. International cricket teams often stay here when playing in Kandy and the snooker room has a collection of signed bats."

Our onward journey is through beautiful mountain scenery as we drive into the Central Highlands. Reaching up to 2,500 metres in elevation the climate is somewhat cooler, though still tropical, and the lush vegetation is interspersed by countless historic tea plantations and factories. After around three hours driving we reach Nuwara Eliya, nestled in the heart of Sri Lanka's hill country. Known as 'Little England', Nuwara Eliya is reminiscent of Britain with its red telephone boxes, Victorian colonial architecture and pretty rose gardens - relics from its era as a hill country retreat for any homesick Brits. The cool climate provided a sanctuary in which they could immerse themselves in familiar pastimes, such as polo, golf and cricket. In the late afternoon you can join our tour leader on a walk to see the sights. This evening there is the option to have dinner at the historic Hill Club, established in 1876 by British coffee planters. Formal attire is needed, but it's possible to hire a jacket.

Apart from some steps to reach Baker Falls, which can be skipped if you prefer, the rest of the terrain is mostly gradually ascending or descending and there is a 2 kilometre/1.2 mile gradual ascent back to the entrance. We should get back to the hotel at around noon and for those who prefer not to join the visit to the national park, you can enjoy a free morning in Nuwara Eliya. Later this afternoon we'll go to a local tea plantation where we can learn more about tea production in Sri Lanka, the estates, the pickers and the process of making tea with a factory visit, all ending with a refreshing cup of the good stuff."

It's here that we'll jump into local tuk tuks that will take us through rural scenes to a viewpoint of the famous Nine Arches Bridge built for the Victorian-era railway network. We have included an early lunch after which our journey continues as we drive down to the southern plains, reaching our permanent tented camp in the late afternoon. It'll be a quick turnaround before we head to Kataragama Shrine to witness the atmospheric evening pooja (religious ceremony). This sacred pilgrimage site is revered by Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims and indigenous Vedda people. Spending tonight in a rural location and closer to nature allows us a different experience as well as convenient access to Yala National Park's less visited entrance. This semi-permanent tented safari camp has comfortable tents that are fitted with proper beds, a fan, ensuite toilet, basin and shower.

        "description": ": Yala National Park, situated in the southeast of Sri Lanka, is renowned for its diverse wildlife and rugged landscapes. It's the country's most-visited national park, known for its population of leopards, which are best spotted during early morning and evening safaris. The park is also home to elephants, sloth bears, crocodiles and a rich variety of bird species - making it a prime destination for wildlife enthusiasts and nature lovers alike. We rise early around 5.30am for our morning 4WD safari and take a boxed breakfast with us. We'll enter via the Galge or Karagamuwa entrance which allows us to access the less visited parts of the park. Afterwards there'll be some time to freshen up and check out before we start our journey to the coast. The drive to Galle will take around two and a half hours and we proceed directly to our hotel after which there is some free time to enjoy the pool or relax and have lunch. Later this afternoon we'll visit Galle Fort for a walking tour of this charming town, steeped in history and culture. An important trading centre since ancient times, the fortifications that can be seen in Galle today were built by the Portuguese and then the Dutch between the 16th and 17th centuries. The fort ramparts of this UNESCO World Heritage Site protect the harbour and a myriad of fascinating old houses, churches, and warehouses. Today, the town has a strong arts vibe, with foreign and local artists, writers, photographers, designers, and poets drawing inspiration from their surroundings. Boutique shops and cafes around the town showcase their work. There's a lot to explore in the town and simply wandering its streets is a great way to see the sites while soaking up the unique atmosphere. Tonight we sleep in the Jetwing Lighthouse, a 5-star hotel located three miles from Galle Fort on a headland with superb views over the Indian Ocean. Bawa's design means it has a minimalist elegance, style and character. Facilities include two pools, a restaurant, bar, gym and spa."

    "generalInfo": "Sri Lanka is a one of the most culturally rich holiday destinations in the Indian Ocean, mixing Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim and Christian faiths and traditions. Colonial powers – Portuguese, Dutch and British – likewise have left their mark. Diverse landscapes provide a plethora of habitats for world class wildlife, whilst white-sand beaches afford an off-duty playground for visitors and residents alike. Island cuisine is first class, distinct flavours providing an enlivening culinary subtext to any visit. Beneath its idyllic surface, Sri Lanka’s past has been challenging at time, having suffered a succession of travails, not least a long-running civil war, fortunately now in the distant past. Sri Lanka’s landscape is awash with fabulous archaeological and natural wonders so that, whilst we do not entirely shun the iconic sites that so many enjoy here, we have sought out little-visited and fascinating corners of the island to offer you a unique combination of experiences and memories to cherish and regale. On this tour you will travel through the central and southern regions of the country exploring areas that are not on the well-trodden tourist path, such as Ritigala archaeological complex engulfed by the jungle in scenes akin to the set of an India Jones adventure, and the fascinating rural villages around Dunagaha, introducing much-needed funds into local economies. Along the way, enjoy the stories and experiences of local characters from former tea planters to a snake naturalist! For the wildlife elements, you will stay clear of the jeep-packed thoroughfares of Yala National Park and take peaceful alternatives away from the crowds.  This tour of Sri Lanka doesn’t insulate travellers in an all-inclusive international cocoon. The island’s sometimes difficult past validates its reality. In fact, it is a key factor in the reasons for visiting now in a land where you may be assured of a warm welcome from the locals.",

The plateau’s sudden end is famously known as ‘World’s End’, a stunning near 880m drop. Visit a Tea Factory en-route to the hotel and learn the process of tea. The production of tea involves a tedious procedure of plucking, withering, rolling, oxidizing and drying – a process that requires heavy machines and plenty of manpower. Workers were shipped over from Tamil Nadu in India to maintain the plantations, and these people, an often overlooked ethnic minority in Sri Lanka, are still the main employees in the tea industry today."

Once back at the hotel, relax by the poolside and take in the peaceful surroundings. Afternoon game drive at Udawalawe National park. Uda Walawe, in Sri Lanka's south-central sector, is the area that most resembles an African game park. Wildlife reports say there are about 500 elephants in the park and they often roam in herds of up to 100. Leopards, buffalo, deer and sloth bears keep them company along with mongooses, bandicoots, foxes, water monitor lizards and crocodiles. A half-day tour in your own private jeep with driver and guide is the best way to see the 30,821 hectares of protected area parked on the Uda Walawe Reservoir."

    "generalInfo": "Explore the diverse and wonderful country of Sri Lanka in search of Blue Whales (100% success rate), Asiatic Elephants (100% success rate) and Leopards (at least one seen every time we enter Yala and Wilpattu National Parks on our past safaris).<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/><br/>Sri Lanka is fast becoming one of the best wildlife watching destinations in Asia. Home to huge populations of leopards, sloth bears and Asiatic elephants as well as a mind boggling array of bird species (many endemic) and some incredible endemic mammal species too. It has also become a top whale watching destination in recent years with a new population of blue whales being discovered here. This tour explores a couple of Sri Lanka’s largest national parks and offer great chances to see leopards, Asiatic elephants, water buffalo, sloth bears as well as many of Sri Lanka’s large mammals. But we also delve deep into the rainforests of Sri Lanka’s oldest protected area, the incredible and diverse Sinharaja Forest. Here it is possible to see 24 of Sri Lanka’s 26 endemic bird species as well as purple-faced langurs, giant squirrels and many species of reptiles. But the wildlife watching doesn’t end there as we also head off the southern coast of Sri Lanka and to a very rich whale watching area. Here you have the chance to see up to 10 different species of whale and dolphin on this expert guided, full board wildlife watching holiday. We have perfected this itinerary over the years and have a great success in finding leopards (100% to date) and one seen every time we enter Yala and Wilpattu National Parks as of April 2013, we also regularly find endemic bird species such as Serendib owlet and Serendib frogmouth as our local guides know their common roost locations. And since we started conducting whale watching we have a perfect success rate (100%) of seeing blue whales on our previous tours and we don’t put this down to chance. We also make sure that the whale watching boat we use for all our excursions is accredited by the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society (WDCS) and they abide by international whale watching guide lines. We are determined to make sure that the whale watching here is done in a way that means that there can be whale watching here for decades to come and that the whales do not suffer. This is a true wildlife exploration of this incredible and diverse country.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner). There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned vehicles with an excellent local driver for all transfers. We use two brilliant full time guides; first a professional zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) will escort you on all your excursions and also a very knowledgeable English speaking local guide who will also act as driver for all transfers. Your zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) escort is an expert in Sri Lankan as well as Indian Subcontinent wildlife (predominantly mammals) as well as their biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. One of the joys of having a zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) escort is that you will not miss these sightings as well as being able to search out some of the harder to see species that sometimes elude other safari goers. For our safaris and jungle walks we use some of the best and most knowledgeable local guides as well as our zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) and for our whale watching trips from Mirassa we use the only certified and accredited whale watching boat in Mirissa. With years of experience in finding the whales and dolphins of the area, they know the exact areas the whales usually locate and their ability to spot whales at distance is phenomenal to see. All the excursions including jeep safaris, guided walks and whale watching trips as well as sightseeing entrance fees are also included. We have tried our best to include as much wildlife watching time in the field as possible and include more as standard than any other tour operator around. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on blue whales which are available to watch throughout the tour.<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>Season – late November to mid April. <br/>This time of year is the winter and typical dry season for Sri Lanka, this is a very good time to visit the national parks of Yala and Wilpattu as the temperatures are quite comfortable. However for the maximum chances of seeing leopards and other elusive wildlife in Sri Lanka would be when it starts to get a little hotter; towards the end of March and into April, however be aware that this is not the best time to see blue whales off the Mirissa coastline. So we recommend the beginning of March for this itinerary.<br/><br/>Why Choose This Tour:<br/><br/>•\tWhilst the standard itinerary below states 2 days each in Wilpattu, Sinharaja, Yala and Mirissa we are very flexible to add in days in locations and of course take days off if you wish. Whatever your budget we will look to add as much time in the field as possible.<br/>•\tWe not only use local expert guides with years of experience in finding mammals, birds as well as spotting the blows of whales at distance. We also interpret and add to your understanding of the movements and behaviours of all of the animals we see here. We also use a professional zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who has experience working with and terrestrial mammals as well as studying whales and dolphins all over the world, this all helps us in interpreting the behaviours we see as well as identifying the species in the area.<br/>•\tIf requested we can bring equipment such as a hydrophone (to hear the whales under the water) and also an underwater camera which will attempt to film the whales and dolphins underneath the waves. <br/>•\tIf requested we can also bring with us equipment like camera traps and night vision gear to help us get footage and sightings of hard to see animals after dark.<br/>•\tWith the help of the zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) escort you can also have snorkelling trips along the coral reefs close by to Mirissa. <br/>•\tWe use the only certified and accredited (by the WDCS) whale watching operator in Mirissa and as a result we make sure that every time we go out on the water we are abiding by the international whale watching guidelines and regulations. These are set up to help protect the whales and the boats and also lead to the sustainability of the whale watching industry and most importantly the whale population. <br/>•\tWe are also involved in the design, implementation and monitoring of a new whale watching protocol for Sri Lankan operators. I was recently (May 2012) invited to a conference at the Sri Lankan High Commission in London to help promote and discuss the sustainable development of whale watching in Sri Lanka. It shocked me that I represented the only tour operator there.<br/>•\tAll the above reasons give this tour a perfect success rate (100%) of seeing blue whales on our previous trips.<br/>•\tWe also have a 100% success rate of seeing leopards and Asiatic elephants every time we enter Yala and Wilpattu National Parks. <br/>•\tWe have an unrivalled network of experts and guides all over Sri Lanka that are able to find and observe animals like leopards, Asiatic elephants, water buffalo, Sri Lanka green pit vipers, Sri Lankan blue magpies, Serendib owls, fishing cats, red slender loris, yellow-spotted mouse deer, jungle cats, rusty-spotted cats and hundreds other endangered, rare or endemic species throughout this magical land. Whether it is Yala, Udawale, Sigirya, Wasaguma, Wilpattu, Sinharaja and many other wildlife watching locations you want to visit we can arrange it. Please inform us if you wish to add a Sri Lankan extensions to this itinerary below and we can provide an excellent wildlife watching itinerary and quote for you.<br/>•\tUnlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Location:<br/><br/>We travel to a few different locations around Sri Lanka and explore 4 very different ecosystems, firstly Wilpattu on the north east coast and this is a very open wetland forest, we then head to the tropical hill forest of Sinharaja for some of the best birding in South Asia and then we head to the coastal plains and forests of Yala and the highest concentration of leopards in the world. We then head to the coast and the continental shelf just south of the village of Mirissa and into one of the most reliable locations for blue whale watching in the world. <br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>Whilst most of the itinerary is based from a jeep and boat, there is a full day of walking in Sinharaja and this walking can be strenuous as it is hilly and the weather may be hot. We would require a good level of walking fitness and the ability to walk in high humidity and heat for over an hour.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment. But here is a brief outline of the basics: We recommend you bring along your own binoculars or spotting scope (although the ocean spray can be a problem on the boats) as well as appropriate clothing; which should be light and airy clothes for warm weather as well as a waterproof coat as it may rain whilst on the boat. Insect repellent is handy as there can be mosquitoes about during the evenings and nights. Any medication, books or other items of a personal nature is of course up to you to bring along. Oh and please bring plenty of memory cards or film for your camera. Also do not forget sun cream, sun hat and sun glasses as the sun can be strong here during the day. Also if you have your own mask, snorkel and fins they are always good to have as the snorkelling is great.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 16 Years Old.",

We will try and find some of the rarest mammals in the world here such as wild water buffalo and one of the last remaining populations of wild Asiatic elephants before having a lunch break inside the park during the middle of the day before continuing in the afternoon.

We will either drive from Anuradhapura through the heart of the central hills (past all the tea growing plantations) and arrive at Rathnapurna, where we will check into our accommodation and after some lunch leave for a jeep safari into the rain forest. Or we will drive direct to the forest and meet the Mahoora camping team who will transfer us to a camp-site in the heart of the forest. Sinharaja Forest Reserve is the best place in Sri Lanka to find many endangered species such as the Indian giant squirrels, Sri Lankan blue magpie, green-billed coucal, red-faced malkoha, purple-faced langurs and green pit vipers. There are also leopards here which make for an excellent sighting if we are lucky enough. Either way we will explore the forest with a jeep safari along a single footpath which dissects the forest.

Including white-faced starling, Sri Lanka scimitar-babbler, Sri Lanka blue magpie, Sri Lanka yellow-eared bulbul and Sri Lanka grey hornbill. This place really is a heaven for birders.

This is by far the best time to try and see the most spectacular animals around Sri Lanka. The whales and dolphins. Here we will board our whale-watching boat and head out into the International Whaling Commissions protected zone in the Indian Ocean. Here we have the best place in the world for blue whales, they pass here as they migrate from their feeding grounds on the north-east of Sri Lanka to the south west point of the Arabian Sea. But as well as blue whales, sperm whales are here in large numbers and we usually see various beaked whales, spinner dolphins, striped dolphins and Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins; making this a true cetacean hotspot. After the whale watching trip we will eat lunch and drive to Yala National Park (3-4 hours); here we will check into our accommodation where the rest of the day is at your leisure and the evening meal will be at the accommodation. However if we are already at Yala we will again rise early and head out into the national park again for a morning jeep safari. We may have a picnic breakfast or have breakfast back at the accommodation. The morning is an excellent time to spot sloth bears and leopards as they are often walking around after a nights hunting.

        "description": "This morning, we transfer (just over one hour) to the 10th-century capital of Sri Lanka: Polonnaruwa. On arrival, we swap to two wheels for our cycle tour of the ancient capital of the Sinhalese. There are many Buddhist relics and ruins here, dating from a 1,000 years ago when Sinhalese culture reached its zenith. The city flourished in the 12th century after the decision was made to move the capital from Anuradhapura, so it was further from incursions from southern India. The ruins are therefore younger and better preserved than those at Anuradhapura. At a leisurely pace, enjoying the cool breeze we visit many of the temples, palaces, huge dagobas (Buddhist stupas) and remarkable Buddhist sculptures. We stop for lunch in a rural village, which breaks up the journey and is a great opportunity to experience traditional Sri Lankan food. In the afternoon, we visit Minneriya National Park where we take to 4x4s to explore and observe elephants in their natural habitat. Although there is generally a good chance to see elephants all year round, Minneriya is famous for the “Gathering” of wild elephants. A seasonal phenomenon between July and September, which draws hundreds of these majestic creatures to the reservoir, creating a remarkable wildlife spectacle.

Since British times Peradeniya has become one of the finest botanical gardens in Asia. When the British eventually wrested control of the Kandyan Kingdom in 1815, the site at Peradeniya was a Royal Pleasure Garden, apparently being enjoyed by the last Queen of Kandy. In typical fashion, the British were quick to establish their own indelible stamp on this lush corner that exists in the cradle of a deep bend in the wide and languid river, the Mahaweli. Initially managed by Alexander Moon, the gardens started as little more than a coffee and cinnamon plantation. Today, spread over a sprawling 147 hectares, they are home to some 4,000 species from all corners of the earth. There is a pungent and fascinating spice garden which provides a fine introduction to the long-practiced medicinal science of Ayurveda and an exceptional orchid house sheltering some 300 varieties. A number of the wider pathways are tree-lined, including the classic “Avenue of Palms” which has the aesthetic power to transform a simple stroll into an event. In the evening you will see Traditional Kandyan Dance – Kandy, Sri Lanka’s second largest city is home to a Sinhalese cultural tradition of which Sri Lankans are justifiably proud. Rich in colour and agile in their movements, the Kandyan Dancers evoke images of pageantry and traditions past.

In Evening the hotel shares a habitat with the elusive Grey Slender Loris, a nocturnal primate hidden in the scrublands beyond your dwelling. Known for its protruding eyes and nimble limbs, the loris scavenges for insects and berries above the trees on a moonlit trail that has been carefully designed for you to observe the rare creature in its natural habitat. Accompanied by hotel resident naturalist, a quiet evening walk takes you through the streams and bamboo bridges of our lush forest eco-system to the Loris Information Centre and Conservation Site. Equipped with harmless red light emitting headlamps that reflect off the characteristic eyes of our resident loris population, your silent search may even be prized with a close-up encounter of this fleeting species. About the size of a chipmunk with long, pencil-thin arms and legs, this shy, furry, nocturnal primate is found in the tropical forests of Southern India and Sri Lanka and grows to between 6 and10 inches in size. It has a round head dominated by two large, close-set brown eyes that seem as big as dinner plates in its small and somewhat bemused-looking face. These peepers flank a little, long snout, which ends in a heart-shape nose. Dark, browny-black circles of fur surround the eyes, like spectacles, and it has relatively big, round ears poking out of its grey fuzz, all adding to its appeal.

This lush, tropical paradise was known to Arab traders as Serendib – hence the word ‘serendipity’, meaning discovery by happy accident – and for a small island, it has much to offer visitors interested in nature and wildlife. <br/><br/>Sri Lanka’s very own Big Four are here – leopard, sloth bear, elephant and blue whale – and this 15-day trip includes all the highlights of this environmentally diverse country. Sri Lanka’s 86 species of mammals, more than 400 bird species and colourful array of flowering plants and trees are all found within its 21 National Parks and in the surrounding Indian Ocean, which is alive with mighty blue and sperm whales, as well as large pods of dolphins. <br/><br/>The itinerary below is just a suggestion. We can also tailor make wildlife holidays to Sri Lanka and you can enjoy using our online holiday planner to piece together your own itinerary at your leisure. Explore and plan your route, excursions and activities from the comfort of your armchair, and also select the style of accommodation that appeals to you most. <br/><br/>The best time to come to Sri Lanka is between the main rainy seasons. Thanks to its position just north of the equator, the island enjoys an almost constant temperature throughout the year, but rainfall varies widely. In the south, southwest and Hill Country, the best time to visit is from November to April, after the southwest monsoon is over. However, the north and east are affected by the northeast monsoon during this period and are dry but hot from April to September. The Hill Country remains a lot cooler throughout the year.<br/>",

Similar to Sinharaja, the lowland rainforest around Kitulgala is one of the best spots to see endemic bird species on the island. For example, the Sri Lanka hill munia, chestnut-backed owlet and Sri Lanka small barbet are all resident here, and the green-billed coucal is certainly easier to see at Kitulgala than in Sinharaja. Other birding highlights include the Sri Lanka orange-billed babbler, black eagle, scarlet minivert and blue magpie. (Packed lunch provided) Kitulgala has become the adventure capital of Sri Lanka with white-water rafting, canyoning, flat-water and white-water kayaking, canoeing, hiking, and mountain biking all on offer. For the faint-hearted, there is Belilena Cave close by, which is one of the larger prehistoric caves on the island, where the 30,000-year-old skeletal remains of 'Balangoda Man' (Homo sapien balangodensis) have been found in addition to microliths, bone implements, and food remnants."

Of all Sri Lanka's national parks, this best rivals the savanna reserves of Africa, with herds of elephants, wild buffaloes and sambar deer, and leopards. There are about 500 elephants in the park in herds of up to 100 individuals. Udawalawe National Park is known to be the best place to see wild elephants in Sri Lanka, because of the elephant-proof fence surrounding the reserve, which prevents elephants from escaping and cattle from getting in. There are also populations of spotted and barking deer as well as wild boar. Other mammals include toque macaque and common langur monkeys, silver-backed jackals, sloth bears, toddy and civet cats, and mongooses. For bird watchers, there are large numbers of warblers, together with the usual low country birds in forested areas, and a variety of raptors. Water birds found on the reservoir include rare visitors and breeding residents such as the Indian cormorant and osprey. Notable endemic species are the Sri Lanka spurfowl and junglefowl, Malabar pied hornbill, Sri Lanka grey hornbill, and the brown-capped babbler."

This Dry Zone region mostly has arid thorn scrub, interspersed with small dusty glades – the ideal habitat to view elephants, Sri Lanka's largest mammal. The park does have a varied landscape, however, from parkland to dense jungle on the plains, scrubland with rocky outcrops and several streams, small lakes and lagoons. The picturesque ocean frontage to the east has wide beaches and high sand dunes. A former hunting reserve, which was transformed into a nature park in 1938, Yala National Park, also called “Ruhuna”, is currently home to over 390 elephants, several of which are tuskers, and about 120 leopards, reportedly the highest density of leopards in the wild anywhere in the world. Watching elephants go for their bath at sunset or seeing leopards laze about on the rocks at dusk are the most popular natural spectacles at Yala National Park. However, you may also see other species of mammals such as sambar and spotted deer, wild boar, buffalo, musk deer, black bear, the unique small Loris, toque macaque and langur monkeys, jackal, mongoose, porcupine, civet cat, anteater, and the enigmatic sloth bear. Over 150 species of birds have been recorded in Yala National Park, including the Sri Lankan Junglefowl, White-bellied Fish Eagle, Painted Stork, Black-necked Stork, Lesser Adjutant, Pompadour Green Pigeon, Orange-breasted Green Pigeon, Brown Fish Owl, Red-faced Malkoha, three species of bee-eaters, and large numbers of waders (including three species of pratincole and two thick-knees).

North of the shore stands the Udawattakele Nature Sanctuary, which encompasses nearly 255 acres. The sanctuary brushes against the edges of the Temple of the Tooth and the nearby suburbs of the upland region, reaching an altitude of 377 feet above the lake’s shores. The dense forest hides Buddhist monasteries and cave dwellings. Orchids blossom in the canopy amongst the various species of ferns. Layard’s parakeets chirp in the cool morning air. Their green collar nearly blends into the emerald hues of the leaves. Mouse deer feed on the underbrush, and the toque macaques rustle the branches as they leap from the trees. You can take your time amongst the marvels of the landscape, enjoying the search for burrowing Indian boars or giant flying squirrels before venturing south into the refreshing tea-growing region. Travel along the scenic road with your private transfer, enjoying the endless greenery and undulating hills of the tropical landscape. Small waterfalls form along the edges of the roadway, disappearing behind the sprawling jade tea fields. You arrive at your resort-style accommodation overlooking the forest, hills, and tea plantations of the region.

After an early breakfast, you meet your guide in the lobby and venture to the base of Adam’s Peak, one of the most religious sites in Sri Lanka, standing at more than 7,350 feet above sea level. The layer of mist washing over the peak in the early hours of the morning dissipates with the sun. You take to the trail, following in the footsteps of pilgrims eager to reach the top of Sri Lanka’s holiest site. Your guide carries a collection of roti, chips, and bananas. You follow the trail at your own pace, enjoying the majesty of the endless greenery and the spiritual ambiance emanating from the rock formation crowning the summit. Buddhists believe the rock to be the footprint of Buddha. Hindus believe it to be the footprint of Shiva. Muslims and Christians believe the rock to be Adam’s first footprint after exile from Eden. After descending the peak, you continue through the tea country, passing the terraced plantations and soaring forest trees to visit local towns at your leisure. If you have the inclination, you can make your way along the trails leading to Devon Falls.

The scent of the ocean air will give way to the sweet coconut aroma that drifts downward from the palm trees. The trains pass through the countryside with bright colors painted on the outlining cars. You will travel through the gorgeous scenery and greenery of the countryside, venturing along dangling fronds, towering grasses, and rising hills. Upon arriving in Kandy, you will notice the glistening waters of the lake that shimmer at the heart of the city. A cool breeze will rustle the leaves of the surrounding tropics as women in silk saris glide through the streets amidst the elegant colors. Markets brim with spiced aromas and eager vendors calling out to passersby. The city has acted as the provincial capital since the early 19th century after the British capture of the Sinhalese Kingdom. After settling into the comforts of your accommodation, you can set out to view a performance of the traditional Kandyan dancing and drumming. Your iconic performance will begin with the pulsating rhythm of the drums. Dancers will call out with jovial cries as they twirl in traditional costumes.

The returning sunlight glints against the golden roof of the Temple of the Sacred Tooth, named for the Buddhist relic within the sanctuary. The complex was erected in the late 16th century and attracts pilgrims dressed in white and bearing lotus blossoms or frangipani. A sweet fragrance emanates from the fresh flowers that devoted visitors bring in tribute, and the interior temples have lavish interiors decorated with inlaid wood accented with ivory and lacquer.

Wild cinnamon fills the air with a lingering spice. Layard’s parakeets call out to one another in the disappearing morning dew.

The sanctuary reaches the escarpment known as World’s End, famous for its dramatic drop of nearly 2,890 feet. The views overtake the villages that are wrapped around the tea plantations, and the valley floor is rich with tall grasses that lead to the southern coast.

Butterflies flutter around the cloud forest where sambar deer hide amongst the scattered trees before grazing on the prairie. You will follow the trail that leads to Baker’s Falls, formed by a Walawe River tributary.

They pull up the roughage from the ground and push against the neighboring trees to mark the area. Elephants were used for domestic, commercial, and religious purposes around Sri Lanka for thousands of years and remain a prominent symbol of status. The elephants in the orphanage are mainly calves and adolescents, still unsure of their size and place in the greater landscape.

The thin layer of morning mist burns away with the returning sun, leaving residual dew along the hillsides leading to the mountain lakes. After breakfast, you make your way to a local tea factory known for producing the tea once eponymous to Sri Lanka, known as Ceylon. The plantation carries more than a century and a half of history embodied in the methods of cultivation and the architecture of the manor. Take to the fields with your guide, meeting with professional tea harvesters. Women wrap a cloth around their heads, as protection from the sun, before strapping a wicker basket to their backs. They quickly harvest bushels of leaves by snipping the vines from the bush and putting the plant into their baskets. They average more than 30 pounds of tea per day. Your guide leads you through the history and process of tea, from harvest to storage, and eventually drying. The drying room carries the herbaceous aroma of the leaves resembling the dried tea with which you are familiar. At the end of the tour, your guide teaches you the art of steeping tea, from the precise temperature of the water to the ratio of tea to water needed. Before sampling the tea, your guide first tells you to find the bright, floral aroma drifting out of the perfect cup."

        "description": "Before the day breaks, adventurous travelers follow their guides to Adam’s Peak, one of the holiest sites in Sri Lanka, to view the sunrise over the Buddhist temple at the summit. At breakfast, you find the familiar herbaceous aroma of steeping Ceylon tea before stepping out onto the scenic roads connecting you to Yala National Park. Before reaching the park, you stop to view Kirindi Oya, a waterfall reaching a height of 380 feet. The sound of rushing water echoes through the encircling trees. The terraced rocks behind the falls shimmer with orange and red hues that contrast the whitewater and emerald forest. A thin layer of spray rises from the wading pool below. You continue to Yala National Park and settle into the comforts of a resort nestled beside the border of the nearly 34,600 acres of protected nature. The biodiversity embodies the grandeur of pristine wildlife with dry forests and reservoirs, jungle brush and marshlands. Step aboard an open-air jeep to venture into Yala for a celebrated night drive in search of sloth bear and crocodiles, Asian elephants and toque macaques."

        "description": "The wildlife sanctuary echoes with life with the sounds drifting through the trees and over the morning plains. Toque macaques ruffle the tree branches as they leap through the canopy. The Sri Lankan swallow twitters around your luxury camp, calling out to passing birds in the refreshing light. You venture out into the park before breakfast on a morning game drive in search of the animals for which Yala National Park is best known, the elusive leopard. The refuge has a leopard density larger than any national park in the world. The big cats are most active in the mornings and evenings, avoiding the heat of the midday. Your guide points into the trees at a Malabar pied hornbill. The black and white plumage contrasts the yellow beak and adorning horn for which the bird is named. The bird can grow up to 26 inches in length and perches on the branches with a regal quality. You find a mugger crocodile lounging in the sunlight on the banks of a marsh. The crocodile has an ominous presence and can grow up to 16 feet in length. It opens its mouth to help absorb the sunlight, showing its collection of sharp teeth. The jeep slowly steers away from the marsh and into the plain, where a leopard skulks through the grass, nearly blending in with the golden strands."

        "description": "The swallows return to chirping in the morning light as the macaques amble through the canopy once again. The excitement of Yala National Park brims in the return of the daylight with elephants parading through the plains and stopping at the edge of the reservoirs for water. After breakfast, your private transfer meets you and escorts you to the beachside city of Galle, which is celebrated for its preserved Dutch colonial architecture. You take a moment to settle into the comforts of your stately accommodation, first erected in the late 17th century under Dutch rule. The attention to renovated detail offers a combination of comfort and captivating history. You have a view of the red-tiled rooftops to the indigo and sapphire hues of the Indian Ocean. Your guide meets you in the lobby of the hotel, eager to lead you through the preserved arcades and walls of the 16th-century colonial fortress that continue to stand on a promontory surrounded on three sides by crashing ocean waves. The Portuguese first erected the edifice in 1588 before the Dutch overtook the complex near 1650. Your guide descends from residents of the fortress, providing a unique perspective on the history and evolution of the complex and city. The busy trading port turned the streets of Galle into a melting pot of culture for more than three centuries. The British constructed the main gate in the late 19th century to allow heavier flows of traffic into the old city center. The heavier fortification is due to the wall’s position facing the land. The British coat of arms decorates the exterior of the Old Gate, with the interior coat of arms referencing the Dutch East India Company, accompanied by the inscription date of 1669."
