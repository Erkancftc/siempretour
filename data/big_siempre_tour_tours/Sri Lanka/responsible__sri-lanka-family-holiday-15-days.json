      "description": "NEGOMBO: Arrive into Colombo International Airport and head straight to The Wallawwa to recuperate amidst startlingly peaceful surroundings.

      "description": "SIGIRIYA: From The Wallawwa, make your way up into Sri Lanka’s historic Cultural Triangle, so-called for the collection of World Heritage Sites and significant attractions located up here. You’ll stay at Water Garden – Sigiriya, one of the region’s newest boutique hotels, which is within eye-sight of one of the island’s most photographed attractions, Sigiriya. This former rock-top fortress dates back to the seventh century, and is home to superb examples of ancient hydro engineering as well as well-preserved frescoes. A hike up to the summit, where the views are incredible, is a definite highlight of this trip. Younger children might wish to sit this out though, and can instead enjoy the hotel’s own water gardens – the swimming pool and separate kid’s pool. The hotel’s rooms are all freestanding villas, and offer plenty of space. Other notable local sights include Dambulla’s Cave Temples while further afield you could try your luck seeking out elephants in Minneriya National Park, or visit Polonnaruwa or Anuradhapura, two former capitals. Travel time Negombo to Sigiriya: 4 hours. Stay 3 nights at Water Garden - Sigiriya."

      "description": "KANDY: Travel south from the Cultural Triangle to Kandy, a university town home to the Temple of the Tooth – Sri Lanka’s most sacred shrine – the Botanical Gardens, the British Garrison Cemetery and a tea museum. Around a 60- to 90-minute drive south west of Kandy is Taylors Hill, a spectacularly sited family-friendly boutique hotel set in acres of landscaped gardens. With just five bedrooms, this century old former planter’s residence feels like a family home and comes with a TV room, a snooker room, a kids play area, extensive gardens and plenty of outdoor activities such as tennis, badminton, croquet and swimming. There are bicycles for exploring the locality, a dedicated nature guide and nearby is Sri Lanka’s very first tea plantation, Loolecondera Estate, former home of Ceylon Tea legend James Taylor. Travel time Sigiriya to Deltota (Kandy): 4 hours. Stay 2 nights at Taylors Hill."

      "description": "DEMODERA (ELLA): Travel to the western Hill Country, which is equally spectacular yet has a different feel. On your way, you could go via Nuwara Eliya to check out the colonial-era sights of this former British Hill Station and pause there for lunch. Around town are allotments bursting with leeks, potatoes, carrots and other vegetables and the region is also well known for growing strawberries. You could also take the train to Demodera from Hatton, which offers one of the most spectacular routes through the Hill Country. Demodera is close to better-known Ella (15-minutes away), yet is a secluded and much quieter place to stay. Nine Skies is located just above the railway line, and the station itself is famous for its 360-degree loop of track while nearby is the Nine Arch Bridge, after which the bungalow was named. The bungalow has been beautifully refurbished and offers plush contemporary comforts including butler service, excellent food and a garden with swimming pool. Attractions include tea factory visits, tea trails, waterfall swims and hill walks. Travel time Deltota (Kandy) to Demodera (Ella): 4.5 hours. Stay 2 nights at Nine Skies."

      "description": "YALA NATIONAL PARK: Travel south to Yala National Park and to Noel Rodrigo’s Leopard Safaris. After reaching Wellawaya, just beyond Ella, you could make a small detour to Buduruwagala – a series of seven well-preserved Buddhist figures carved into sheer rock. Yala National Park is the island’s premier wildlife preserves, home to a dense population of leopards, as well as elephants and sloth bears. Camping at the edge of the park is a magical once-in-a-lifetime experience that all the family will enjoy; Noel Rodrigo’s Leopard Safaris has family tents, and aside from game drives there are wildlife art classes and animal identification games for the kids. Travel time Kandapola (Nuwara Eliya) to Yala National Park: 4.5 hours. Stay 2 nights at Noel Rodrigo’s Leopard Safaris."

      "description": "GALLE: Travel west along the picturesque cove-sprinkled southern coastline to Galle, famed for pretty beaches, a 17th century Dutch fort and a cosmopolitan vibe. Here you’ll stay at Why House, an idyllic country-style boutique hotel with big garden and expansive swimming pool. The hotel has an excellent restaurant (with plenty of kids items to choose from, or dishes that can be customised), and there are many others in the local area. Aside from sculpting sandcastles on one of the region’s pretty beaches (the nearest is just a few minutes away), family activities include guided bicycle rides along scenic rural inland lanes, boat trips (on Koggala Lake), seasonal whale and dolphin watching or surfing. Travel time Yala National Park to Galle: 4 hours. Stay 4 nights at Why House."
