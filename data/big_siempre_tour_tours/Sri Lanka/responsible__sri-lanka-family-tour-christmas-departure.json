      "description": "Colombo-Negombo: Ayubowan – and welcome to Sri Lanka! After landing in Colombo, your journey begins with a short transfer to the relaxed coastal town of Negombo, just 20 minutes from the airport. This first afternoon is all about settling in – whether that means unwinding by the pool, dipping your toes in the Indian Ocean, or taking a gentle stroll along the beach. Come evening, why not dive straight into Sri Lankan flavours? Try a traditional curry and rice, or sample Kottu – a sizzling street food dish made with chopped roti, vegetables, and plenty of spice. It’s a local favourite for a reason! You’ll also meet your Adventure Leader and fellow travellers for a welcome briefing, where we’ll walk you through the trip, go over safety info, and get you excited for the journey ahead. For now, take it slow, shake off the jet lag, and enjoy this laid-back start to your Sri Lankan adventure."

      "description": "Negombo-Habarana: After breakfast, we’ll kick off day two of your Sri Lanka family adventure with a visit to the famous Negombo fish market, known locally as ‘Lellama’. Set right on the beach, this lively market is the hub of the local fishing community. Watch as fishermen haul in their morning catch, experience the fast-paced auction atmosphere, and get a glimpse of everyday life in coastal Sri Lanka. From here, we hit the road and make our way to Habarana – a peaceful rural village surrounded by lush greenery, lakes, and rice paddies (approx. 3.5 hours). On arrival, we’ll jump straight into an immersive village experience. You’ll hop aboard a traditional farm tractor, paddle across a scenic lake in a canoe, wander through the fields, and meet the locals who call this beautiful place home. After all that exploring, we’ll settle in for a well-earned, home-cooked lunch. Made from fresh, local ingredients using traditional techniques, you’ll get to see (and taste) how Sri Lankan meals are lovingly prepared – just as they have been for generations."

      "description": "Polonnaruwa: After breakfast, the morning is yours to enjoy at your own pace. If you're feeling adventurous, you can opt for a visit to one of Sri Lanka’s most iconic landmarks: Sigiriya. This ancient rock fortress, built by King Kashyapa in the 5th century, rises dramatically from the jungle and rewards climbers with incredible panoramic views and a glimpse into Sri Lanka’s royal past. Travelling with little ones or just after a gentler climb? Pidurangala Rock, right next door, offers a quieter route with equally impressive scenery – and fewer steps. Later in the afternoon, we’ll come together and head to the ancient city of Polonnaruwa – Sri Lanka’s second-oldest kingdom and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. We’ll explore the ruins by bike, weaving through centuries-old temples, palaces, and sacred statues that tell the story of a once-glorious royal capital. After a big day of discovery, we’ll make the one-hour journey back to the hotel to unwind, relax, and gear up for the next leg of the journey."

      "description": "Dambulla Cave Temple: We’ll start the day with a visit to the awe-inspiring Dambulla Cave Temple – one of Sri Lanka’s most impressive UNESCO World Heritage sites. Tucked into a towering rock face, this ancient cave complex is filled with over 150 Buddha statues and vibrant murals, offering a fascinating glimpse into more than two millennia of spiritual history. After exploring the caves, it’s time to take things slow with a relaxing break back at the hotel. Whether you fancy a swim, a quiet moment with a book, or a quick power nap, the midday hours are yours to enjoy at your own pace. In the late afternoon, get ready for a real adventure as we head out on safari in Minneriya National Park. Known for its large herds of wild elephants, the park is also home to deer, crocodiles, and an incredible variety of birdlife. Keep your eyes open – you never know what you might spot! The evening is free for you to unwind however you like, ready for another great day ahead."

      "description": "Kandy: After breakfast, we’ll set off on a scenic 2.5-hour drive to Kandy – Sri Lanka’s cultural heart and hill capital. Nestled among lush green hills, Kandy is a vibrant mix of tradition and modern life. This afternoon, we’ll dive into it all with a guided tour of the city. Wander through bustling local markets, enjoy a peaceful walk along the lakefront, and explore one of the country’s most revered sites: the Temple of the Tooth. Once the royal residence of ancient kings, this sacred temple now houses a relic believed to be the tooth of Lord Buddha – making it one of the most important religious sites in Sri Lanka."

      "description": "Kandy-Ella: After breakfast, we’ll begin a scenic journey up into Sri Lanka’s lush highlands, making our way toward the picturesque town of Ella. The drive takes around three hours, but with sweeping views, tea plantations, and photo stops along the way, the time will fly by. One of today’s highlights is the famous train ride to Ella – a true bucket-list experience. Considered one of the most beautiful train journeys in the world, this ride winds through rolling hills, misty forests, and quiet rural villages, offering a front-row seat to the breathtaking landscapes of the hill country. Train travel in Sri Lanka can be unpredictable, with seasonal timetable changes and occasional delays or cancellations, particularly in the tourist carriages. We’ll do everything we can to secure seats and confirm availability in advance, but a little flexibility might be needed on the day. By late afternoon, we’ll arrive in Ella – a chilled-out mountain town known for its cool climate, hiking trails, and welcoming atmosphere. Spend the evening as you like: take a walk through town, try some local food, or relax and soak up the fresh mountain air."

      "description": "Ella-Hikkaduwa: Day 7 of your Sri Lanka family tour begins bright and early with a rewarding hike up Little Adam’s Peak. This gentle trail is great for all ages and offers incredible panoramic views over Ella’s rolling hills and valleys – a picture-perfect moment to capture with the family. After breakfast back at the hotel, we’ll begin our journey down to the south coast, with a key stop along the way: Handunugoda Tea Estate. No trip to Sri Lanka is complete without diving into its tea heritage, and this family-owned estate offers a fascinating insight into how tea goes from leaf to cup. We’ll walk through the lush tea fields, tour the working factory and museum, and learn all about the production process. As a bonus, the estate also grows cinnamon, coconut, and rubber – giving you a full flavour of southern Sri Lanka’s agricultural life. By late afternoon, we’ll reach the coastal town of Hikkaduwa – your new home by the sea. With golden beaches, chilled cafés, gentle waves, and a coral-rich bay full of marine life, it’s the perfect place to relax and recharge after your time in the highlands."

      "description": "Galle & Hikkaduwa: This morning (or afternoon – we’ll go with the group flow), we’ll set off on a walking tour of the iconic Galle Fort, one of Sri Lanka’s most charming UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Picture cobbled streets, ocean views, and a unique blend of colonial history and laid-back island life. Originally built by the Portuguese in the 16th century, Galle Fort is a fascinating fusion of European architecture and South Asian flair. As you wander past centuries-old ramparts, the lighthouse, the clock tower, and colonial churches, you’ll also find trendy cafés, art galleries, boutique shops, and beautifully restored villas. It’s a perfect mix of old-world charm and modern-day cool. The rest of the day is yours to enjoy back in Hikkaduwa – whether that’s hitting the beach one last time, squeezing in a scuba dive, or tucking into some incredible seafood. And now, for the grand finale – exclusive to this tour date! It’s New Year’s Eve, and we’re going big. Expect a night to remember, with a celebratory dinner, fireworks on the beach, and plenty of fun for the whole family. It’s the perfect way to ring in the New Year in style!"
