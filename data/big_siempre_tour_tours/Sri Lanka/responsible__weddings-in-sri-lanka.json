  "generalInfo": "Arranging a wedding in Sri Lanka will give you a truly memorable start to married life. On this 15-day tailor made tour you’ll exchange your vows at Kahanda Kanda, a gorgeous boutique hotel set on a 12-acre tea estate just outside the heritage city of Galle. You’ll have a couple of days at leisure before the ceremony itself, so there’s plenty of time to explore the local rice fields and beaches, returning each evening to sleep in your plush suite, which comes complete with a private pool and garden.  <br/><br/>Your wedding day can be tailored to suit your preferences, but it will include the ceremony and a private reception, including a photographer, wedding cake, champagne and dinner. All paperwork will be arranged for you.  <br/><br/>After your wedding day you’ll head off to celebrate your vows, visiting Yala West National Park, Hill Country and Kandy, and staying in chic boutique hotels on beautiful grounds in each location.  <br/><br/>The above is a sample itinerary. We specialise in bespoke tailor-made weddings in Sri Lanka, so you can choose from a variety of different locations and customise your ceremony according to you wishes. A Sri Lankan ceremony performed on a special decorative marriage dais (Poruwa) perhaps? Or celebrate with dancers and beating drums? After tying the knot, you can choose to spend your honeymoon in Sri Lanka or head to the Maldives for some island pampering.  <br/>",
