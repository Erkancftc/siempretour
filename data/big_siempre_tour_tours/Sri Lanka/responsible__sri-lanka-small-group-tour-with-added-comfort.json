      "description": "Ayubowan! Welcome to Sri Lanka. When you arrive at Bandaranaike International Airport in Colombo, you’ll be met by a representative and transferred to your hotel in nearby Negombo. Here, you’ll meet your leader and fellow travellers at a 6 pm welcome meeting. If you arrive early, maybe take some time to relax on the beach under the blue sky. After your welcome meeting, your leader will take you to a local restaurant for a seafood dinner. Sri Lankan food is famous for its rich scents, spices and flavours, and this evening you’ll find out why as you sample some local favourites like pol sambol (a tasty coconut dish) and roast paan (crispy roasted bread)."

      "description": "Rise early this morning for a visit to the Negombo fish market. Morning is the best time to visit the market – your leader will help you navigate the organised frenzy of vendors displaying things like crabs, lobsters and squid. Then, say goodbye to Negombo and make the drive to Dambulla, where you'll spend the next three nights. Settle into your hotel and in the late afternoon, head out for one of the highlights of any visit to Sri Lanka – the magnificent UNESCO World Heritage site of the palace of Sigiriya (Lion Rock). This dramatic rocky outcrop, rising from the surrounding plains, is topped by a ruined palace. It's a good workout to get to the top, but the sight makes it well worth it. Your leader will share stories of the ancient civilisation who once lived atop the rock as you climb. In the evening, return to Dambulla for a Sri Lankan style barbecue. Tuck into a delicious array of fresh grilled fish, meat and vegetables, and watch a demonstration on how to make chilli and coconut sambol, so you can recreate the taste of Sri Lanka at home."

      "description": "Today, you‘ll head to Anuradhapura, the northern point of Sri Lanka’s ‘cultural triangle’, which also contains Polonnaruwa to the east and Kandy to the south-west. This area is bursting with stunning temples and sites of cultural and religious importance. The city of Anuradhapura is one of the country’s most historically significant places and its first ancient capital. Take a step back in time as your leader guides you through the giant stupas of Ruwanweliseya and Jetawanaramaya, and ponder the rise and fall of ancient civilisations as you explore crumbling temples and ruins. Pay a visit to the Sri Maha Bodhi Tree Temple – home to a sacred bodhi tree planted in 236, believed to be the oldest human-planted tree in the world. Stop by the ancient temple of Isurumuniya and see its beautiful carvings that tell stories that are thousands of years old. Return to Dambulla for an evening at leisure."

      "description": "After breakfast, you’ll make your way to Polonnaruwa to continue your explorations of the cultural triangle. Following Anuradhapura as the Sinhalese and Chola capital in the 10th century, the area is strewn with ancient riches. Discover well-preserved temples, tombs and stupas in Polonnaruwa’s Quadrangle complex – it’s not hard to imagine what this place looked like in all its former glory. Visit the remains of the seven-story palace built by King Parakramabahu, the rock temple of Gal Vihara, the giant stupa of Rankot Vihara and the ancient Buddha image house of Lankatilaka, covered in intricate carvings and housing a towering statue of Buddha. Stop by the incredible statue of Parakrama I, at 10 m tall this is a truly impressive sight.

Along the way, stop off in the city of Matale where you will visit a local spice garden and learn about the spices that have played such an important role in Sri Lanka’s cultural heritage. Continue to Kandy where you’ll have a free evening to explore. Though it’s the second-largest city in the country, Kandy maintains a laidback atmosphere. Maybe take a stroll around the city’s centrepiece lake or ask your leader to recommend a favourite restaurant."

      "description": "Depart Kandy and board a morning train bound for Nuwara Eliya. Situated deeper into tea plantation country, Nuwara Eliya sits at an elevation of 1800 m, making it one of the coolest regions in Sri Lanka. Once favoured by the Scottish and the English, remnants of the past can be seen in sculpted gardens and manor homes decorating the city. When you arrive, explore the charming town at your own pace before heading to your accommodation. Tucked away among tea plantations and scenic hills is the Grand Hotel – a gorgeous National Heritage Property first established in 1891 and your Feature Stay for the next two nights. A nod to the region's history, rooms are classically decorated with all modern amenities. At its core is the hotel’s sustainable practices – they’ve eliminated single-use plastic and are striving for a zero-waste future. This afternoon, enjoy a high tea experience at your hotel. Converted from the former home of a British governor, the hotel now offers an impressive selection of tea paired with finger food and confectionery.

If touring the factory inspires a thirst, you’ll have the chance to sample some of the final product yourself. Head back to the city to sit down for a well-deserved lunch at the prestigious Nuwara Eliya Golf Club – one of the oldest golf clubs in Asia."

In the evening, head to Yala National Park – Sri Lanka's premier wildlife reserve. Here, you’ll board a 4WD for a safari through open grasslands, lush forest and lagoons. Your guide will carefully listen out for the rustling of concealed animals that would go unnoticed by those not in the know. There's a good chance of spotting crocodiles, elephants, monkeys and buffalo and if you’re lucky, you may even spot a leopard – the park is considered one of the best places in the world to see these elusive big cats. After a day of wildlife spotting, retire to your resort for dinner. Located near the less-visited back gate of Yala National Park, your accommodation offers quick access to wildlife without the large coaches frequently found at the front gates."
