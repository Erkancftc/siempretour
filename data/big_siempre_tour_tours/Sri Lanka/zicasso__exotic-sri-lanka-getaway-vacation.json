      "title": "Negombo – Welcoming Beach View",
      "description": "The streets of Colombo bustle with activity. The bazaars in Pettah Market brim with vibrant hues emanating from saris and the swirling textures of unique geometric designs. The aromas of turmeric and coriander linger around the marketplace. Your flight lands at Bandaranaike International Airport. Your private transfer greets you upon your arrival and leads you to the endless movement of rickshaws overlooking the sapphire waters of the Indian Ocean. You travel north to Negombo, where the gold sands shimmer beneath the drifting sunlight. Outrigger canoes rest on the shoreline with their loose sails rustling in the breeze. Fishermen use the waters from the ocean and the lagoon to catch lobsters, crabs, prawns, and various types of fish. Remainders of the European colonial days decorate the streets and overlook the edges of the lagoon. The scent of cinnamon seems to linger from the days in which the Dutch utilized the area for the spice trade. You settle into the luxuries of your beachside resort, enjoying the sands shaded by palm trees and lounge chairs residing by the refreshing waters of the pool. Your room has a pristine view of the lush tropical landscape, allowing you to open the window and find the semi-sweet scent of the ocean breeze. Your guide meets you in the lobby after you have time to freshen up, and leads you on a relaxed tour through the town to view the remnants of the colonial past and the continued traditions of local culture, beginning at the 17th-century ruins of the Dutch fort."

      "title": "Negombo – Dolphins in Paradise",
      "description": "Fishermen return to the shoreline early in the morning with the outrigger canoes. Sails rustle in the returning breeze and guide the boats back to the sand before the fishermen take their fresh catches to the market. At breakfast, you find the aroma of coconut emanating from the traditional roti cooking on flattops around town. After the meal, your private transfer escorts you to the marina in Kalpitiya to board a large schooner bound for the open water. As the boat weighs anchor, sea spray mists from the hull, leaving thin drops of the ocean water on your cheeks. Your heart beats with excitement with the promise of dolphins and whales, with pods traveling along the Sri Lankan shores between April and November. Your captain points into the distance where five dolphins arch out of the ocean. The spinner dolphin can grow up to longer than seven and a half feet and weighs nearly 175 pounds. Their pale gray hues glisten in the sunlight as the water slides off their slick skin. The moment is pure majesty as the collection of dolphins playfully leaps out of the ocean, often performing feats of acrobatics, which attributes to their name. Upon returning to the shore, you have the remainder of the day to enjoy the glowing coral at Bar Reef, the largest coral reef in the country."

      "description": "At breakfast, the scent of freshly brewed coffee helps accentuate the aroma of coconut milk emanating from the kitchen. The traditions of coffee in Sri Lanka date back to the 19th century, with cultivation peaking in 1870. After the meal, you make your way onto the water to reach a boat bound for a downed Royal Air Force fighter plane lying at the bottom of the sea. The sea breeze rushes through your hair as the boat weighs anchor beside the pristine snorkeling and diving location. You don your mask, flippers, and snorkel, and jump into the ocean. The warm water laps against your skin, leaving traces of salt on your shoulders. You float effortlessly along the surface of the water, using your fins to propel you forward. The reef reaches a depth of up to 65 feet and wraps around the edges of the fighter jet, which was downed more than 50 years ago. Sunlight pierces the surface of the water for remarkable visibility. Moray eels peek their heads out of the coral hill, and marble rays effortlessly glide along the underwater current. The splendors beneath the sea reflect the paradisiacal wonders spread across the island."

      "title": "Colombo – Discovering the Dutch Canals",
      "description": "The morning light filters through the windows of St. Mary’s Church in the heart of Negombo, returning the faded pink hues of the chamber. The unassuming exterior hides the marvelous paintings adorning the ceiling of the nave. After breakfast, you board a small boat to traverse the canals crisscrossing a total distance of more than 70 miles, stretching from Puttalam to Colombo. Walkways and colorful homes line the canals alongside moored speedboats. Church spires protrude above the slanted red-tile rooftops. Trees dangle their branches downward, shading the banks of the canals away from town. The vibrant plumage of pied kingfisher shimmer against the backdrop of emerald leaves. Cormorants spread their wings in the sun to dry their feathers after dipping into the water in search of food. Locals pass on motorbikes or foot, waving to the boat. Storks perch on a patch of reeds. You continue to make your way through the maze and marvels of the canals, discovering the unique avifauna and fishing culture before returning to the shores of Negombo. As you reach the edges of the lagoon, you find a monitor lizard perched on a rock, enjoying the quiet morning light. Your private transfer greets you in the hotel lobby after your journey and escorts you south back to the endless movement along the streets of Colombo."

      "title": "Hikkaduwa – The Advantage of Paradise",
      "description": "In the morning, rickshaws return to the streets of Colombo. The waves of the Indian Ocean lap against the quiet gold shores set beside the verdant grasses of Galle Face Green, a beachside park encompassing 12 acres. The colorful Khan Clock Tower in the Pettah Market resembles a candy cane, representing the vibrant culture and history of Sri Lanka’s capital. After breakfast, your private transfer leads you away from the urban décor of Colombo and to the oceanfront allure of Hikkaduwa. Coconut palms shade the golden sands. The Indian Ocean shimmers with turquoise and sapphire. After settling into the comforts of your hotel overlooking the sparkling water, you step onto the sand. The warm, powdery texture massages your feet. Meet your private surfing instructor for an introductory lesson to the sport, learning the basics of balance and movement before hitting the water. Lay on the board while on the sand, learning to pop up at a moment’s notice, planting both feet onto the board at the same time. After practicing on the sand, you take to the water. The cool temperature wraps around you, protecting you from the tropical sun. Between November and March, the waves can reach nearly 10 feet tall. Your instructor has you practicing on the smaller waves until you burst from the lying position, and ride the whitewater back to shore."

      "description": "Pilgrims make their way in the morning light to the Buddhist temple of Seenigama Vihara. The temple stands on its own island and offers special oils made of chilies and pepper for victims of theft seeking retribution. After breakfast, you make your way to the town of Galle, which overlooks the Indian Ocean. You can see the 300-year-old Dutch Fort standing on a promontory surrounded by water on three sides. The exotic ambiance blends with the charms of colonial architecture. Boutique shops and quaint cafes fill the historic grounds of the fortress spanning its nearly 90 acres. Fishermen sit atop hanging posts dug into the shallow waters of the shoreline. They linger in the morning and evening, casting their lines into the water from above to lure the fishes without hitting any obstacles. The British coat of arms tops the entrance of the old Gate. The inscription of the Dutch East India Company continues to decorate a standing stone, accompanied by the date 1669. Two lions and a rooster adorn a portion of a wall that served to support the former spice warehouse. Make your way to the Historical Mansion Museum to view the artifacts filling the shelves and display cases of the gallery. The former Dutch residence is not actually a museum but an antiques shop presenting colonial objects, including antique typewriters and fine china traded by the Dutch East India Company. For a stunning view of the coastline, you can venture to the top of the lighthouse, which stands nearly 60 feet tall, offering a cherished view of the sapphire waters."

      "description": "The morning light washes over the pools inside the Turtle Hatchery. Surfers take to the water to ride the waves curling off the shore. After breakfast, your private transfer meets you at the hotel and escorts you north to the beachside town of Beruwala. The destination embodies tropical paradise along the Golden Mile of the beach. Beruwala is also the preeminent center for Ayurveda treatments in Sri Lanka, nestled between the seductive sound of rolling waves and the verdant beauty of tropical gardens. You enter into an Ayurveda spa dedicated to providing luxury, comfort, and soothing treatments. The scent of fresh herbs fills the spa. White pebbles adorn the floor of a handmade steel footbath. The aroma of jasmine creates a soothing ambiance in which you easily settle. The belief of Ayurveda stands for the mind-body connection dating back more than 5,000 years. You lay on the massage table with the aroma of various herbs filling the room. You can hear the ocean lapping at the shoreline. Your private masseuse lets the therapeutic oils seep into your skin, with a light caress. You can feel how smooth your skin has become. The massage is designed to study the person’s aches, pains, and sensitivities, evoking a gentle surge of emotion."

      "description": "At breakfast, the familiar aroma of coconut permeates the dining room. The sweet and luscious scent accentuates the coffee and freshly cooked roti. The city comes to life in Pettah Market with locals eager to wander the aisles of colorful produce or linger beneath the dangling vibrant saris on sale. People filter into a historical café located inside the antique Dutch Fort, surrounded by boutique shops and popular restaurants. The interior features colonial décor with walls lined with books telling about the history of Sri Lanka and tea. The alluring aroma of crepes and cakes emanates from the kitchen. Your private transfer collects you at the hotel lobby when you are ready, escorting you to Bandaranaike International Airport for your flight home."
