  "generalInfo": "Discover the wild side of Sri Lanka on a private adventure packed with unforgettable wildlife encounters. From majestic elephants roaming freely to blue whales surfacing off the southern coast and playful spinner dolphins off the western coast, this trip offers incredible experiences and great value. Run by an independent UK ATOL-protected specialist operator with our own people on the ground in Sri Lanka.<br/><br/>Begin with an overnight flight from the UK (or pickup in Colombo) and travel south of Galle. You will take a boat trip from nearby Mirisssa in search of whales and dolphins — one of the few places on Earth where blue whales can be seen year-round. <br/><br/>Next, you’ll be driven inland to Uda Walawe National Park, where you’ll enjoy a safari among elephant herds and visit the Elephant Transit Home, where orphaned calves are cared for and released back into the wild. Continue to Minneriya, famous for its seasonal gatherings of large elephant herds.<br/><br/>Along the way, explore Sri Lanka’s cultural treasures: climb the iconic Sigiriya “Lion Rock”, wander through ancient Anuradhapura, and marvel at the sacred Bodhi tree. <br/><br/>Round off your adventure in off-the-beaten-track Kalpitiya, where you can see hundreds of playful spinner dolphins as well as have a boat trip on the fringes of Wilpattu National Park, Sri Lanka’s largest wildlife reserve.<br/><br/>This itinerary can be customised.  You can even add more national park action at Yala National Park and nearby Bundala (perfect for bird lovers). Just make an enquiry. We work 7 days a week.<br/><br/>Photos used with thanks to travellers G Baxter &amp; F Barrington",

Then it's onwards. The Kalpitiya penisula is off the tourist trail and the island you're staying on certainly is, but it was much more inhabited during the times of Dutch rule, a fact which even many in Sri Lanka didn't realise. Relax in your room, spot the birds in the garden, have a swim in the pool (watch out for the monkeys!) or walk along the beach."
