This unique and outstanding monument positioned in the heart of Sri Lanka’s commercial capital Colombo, commemorates the country’s independence from foreign rule. Sri Lanka gained independence on the 4th of February 1948 from the British who were the final colonial rulers of the country. Opposite the Presidential Secretariat (old Parliament) is the Colombo breathing green space known as Galle Face. Here every walk of life comes for relaxing time.
