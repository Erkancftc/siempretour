  "generalInfo": "On this northern discovery Sri Lanka holiday you’ll explore the lesser-visited side of this beguiling island. Instead of heading for the beaches and towns of the south, you’ll make your way north to the Jaffna Peninsula, a region that still bears the scars of the country’s violent civil war. <br/><br/>After arriving in Negombo, you’ll travel north to Wilpattu National Park, where you can look out for leopards, sloth bears, elephants and numerous bird species, but without the crowds that are sometimes present in the country’s southern parks. <br/><br/>Moving on, you’ll explore the ancient city of Anuradhapura, as well as the beautiful Mannar and Delft islands; both the site of ruined colonial forts, and the latter home to wild ponies. You’ll also spend time in Jaffna, a lively and fascinating city with a mix of Tamil culture and colonial heritage, and visit the war museum at Mullataivu to learn more about the devastating civil conflict. <br/><br/>Next, you’ll spend time at the beach in Trincomalee, visit Polonnaruwa, Sri Lanka’s former medieval capital, view the frescoes on Sigiriya Rock and take a jeep safari in Minneriya National Park, before finishing your tour in Colombo.",

      "description": "Wilpattu National Park (Approximate driving time 3.5 hours) - We depart after a relaxing breakfast and journey north to Wilpattu National Park. Compared to parks in the south of the country, Wilpattu receives relatively few visitors which ensures a more enjoyable and less hectic safari experience and hopefully less impact on the biodiversity of the park. After lunch on the outskirts of the park we take an afternoon safari in this wilderness area where if we are lucky we may be able to spot Leopard, Elephant, Sloth Bear and many other species as well as many different bird species. Overnight Big Game Park Wilpattu (non-air-conditioned tent) or similar (BLD) Kindly note that Wilpattu is more dense and more off the beaten track than most Sri Lankan parks. Wildlife is very much around but sightings cannot be guaranteed."

After the safari we return to camp for breakfast before continuing to Anuradhapura, the first ancient kingdom of the Sri Lankan kings.

Lunch will be taken in a landmark colonial building which has played host to many dignitaries including the Queen. Later we travel back to the West coast and a forgotten gem, isolated Mannar Island.

      "description": "Mannar Island - This morning, after an early breakfast we visit the fish market in Mannar. Fishing is the main stream of income on the island and a visit to the fish market gives a great insight into island life. Mannar is renowned as being the source of the best dried fish in the country. Our exploration of fascinating Mannar Island continues with a visit to the ancient Hindu temple - Thiruketheeswaram Temple. Continue to Doric Bungalow, once a grand building and the house of the first British Governor of Ceylon in 1801. Overlooking the Indian Ocean, it is considered as one of the first buildings in the country built to a classical architectural plan. Also visit the ruins of the Dutch Fort in Arippu which in its heyday was at the core of the lucrative pearl fisheries. If time allows we can walk on the beach and observe enormous mounds of shells left over from the past. Later this afternoon we drive to the very tip of Mannar Island to the outpost of Talaimannar. Ferries once departed to India from here but now the village has a slightly eerie feel to it and it is a base for the Sri Lankan Navy. From the railway station you can walk the recently restored railway line right to the sea where the lighthouse marks the end of Mannar Island. Overnight Palmyrah House (BLD)"

      "description": "Mannar – Jaffna – (Driving time today approximately 3 hours) - This morning we travel to the far North to the city of Jaffna, just now starting to open up after the civil war and is a stark contrast to the much more touristic south of Sri Lanka. On arrival we check in the hotel after some rest, lunch will be arranged at a local Jaffna home and this is a great opportunity to exchange cultural values and a glimpse into the lives of an ordinary family. Our local Tamil guide will be with you to assist with translation. A special ‘kool’ or traditional soup will be served first followed by ‘Pittu’ made from coconut and rice flour usually served with crab curry, fried prawns, dhal curry and other local delights in a real Jaffna feast.

      "description": "Island exploring – Delft Island - Off limits for years due to the civil war the islands off the Jaffna peninsula are rewarding places to cruise to and visit. Today we will visit the island of Delft where wild ponies roam the landscape and the coastline is blessed with beautiful waters and white sand beaches. During the 1 hour crossing by local ferry, the Tamil guide will explain some of the difficulties and challenges of living on such remote islands. Although around 6000 people live on Delft Island this windswept island feels largely deserted. Our tour of the island will take us to the abandoned Dutch fort and a 1000 year old temple and a huge Baobab tree. We also visit the Pigeon Hole, the Dutch Tower, and the ruins of stables used in colonial times by the British and Portuguese to breed horses. Enjoy a local lunch today with an island family where you can learn how to cook traditional Sri Lankan food. The eerie rustic charm of Delft can hardly be put into words, and a trip to this isolated outpost that gazes out towards India is a real privilege. Later we return to Jaffna by ferry. Overnight Fox Kandy, Jaffna or similar (BLD) Note – On sunny days it can be fiercely hot on Delft Island. Please dress accordingly and ensure you are protected from the sun and wear a hat."

We explore some of the interesting features in the lower sections of the site such as the Royal Gardens and the water gardens. We then visit the remarkably preserved frescoes situated about half way up the rock before the final staircase climb to the top of the rock where the reward is breathtaking views for miles in every direction.

Overnight Kassapa Lion Rock or similar (BLD OPTIONAL - This morning you will set out on a village cycling tour which explores the lifestyle of the local villagers. This experience is all about the PEOPLE because after all, it’s people that makes places beautiful. You start off by going along the inner village roads where it’s good to keep an eye for birdlife. The experience doesn’t really have a script and is not staged, so you will be visiting different houses where certain cottage industries takes place. Some of the stops includes a place where they make bricks out of clay, a house where coir brooms are produced, a quick stop at the house of the village dancing teacher to observe some of the traditional dancing steps and also a stop at a house where a grandma produces a traditional ayurvedic oil. Along the way you will also stop for a local snack with a Tea served in a coconut shell. These are all local experiences which you probably won’t experience back at home. The final stop will be at a village house where you get to taste a mouth-watering traditional Sri Lankan rice and curry lunch prepared by Dilini, a lady from the village. Notes: Your cycling guide for the trail will be a villager from the area itself and fluent English doesn't come to them naturally. But he will make up for it with his typical Sri Lankan hospitality and in-depth knowledge of the area. The trail is approximately 12 KMs in distance and anyone with decent fitness and cycling balance can manage it since it's mostly flat terrain. Please let us know at the time of booking if you would like this included. Additional charges apply."
