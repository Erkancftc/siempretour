A UNESCO World Heritage site, this was the capital of the Indian Chola Dynasty after Anuradhapura was conquered in the late 10th century. These ruins are close together and generally in much better repair than those you’ve seen so far. When the heat of the day has eased, you'll visit more palaces, temples and stupas, including the massive stone Buddhas. You'll also visit the museum, which has scale models of many of the buildings, to show how they would have existed in their time."

On the way, there's the option of stopping at one of the region's wonderful spice gardens for lunch and to learn about the medicinal properties of ingredients used in cooking and treatments.
