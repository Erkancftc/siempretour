  "generalInfo": "There’s no better way to get to know a place, to understand the culture and ways of life there, than by exploring it in the company of someone that’s actually from the area. This Cyclades islands tour, taking you from Paros to Naxos and Santorini, is led by a Greek tour leader, with tours of each island provided by guides who live on these picture-postcard perfect islands. <br/><br/>With the rest of your group (numbers are limited so that you can stay in small, sometimes family-run accommodations) you’ll enjoy a fascinating introduction to the islands’ history, nature and cuisine, with carefully chosen activities and excursions that take you well beyond the regular tourist route.<br/><br/>Your tour begins, as so many wonderful holidays in Greece do, in Athens, and the opportunity to visit one of the world’s most iconic landmarks: the Acropolis. Having got to know the rest of your group and tour leader over dinner, you’ll then head on to Paros. Journeys between islands on this Cyclades tour are exclusively by ferry: more relaxed, more enjoyable, and importantly, far more eco-friendly than flying.<br/><br/>Paros is a lovely island with a distinctive character which will be revealed by a guided tour that takes you around its narrow streets and out to the beautiful coast via peaceful villages, olive and pine tree groves, and Venetian castles.<br/><br/>As with all of our small group trips, this Cyclades islands tour follows a set itinerary – however plenty of time is set aside for you to do your own thing, so on Paros you might spend a day on the beach, hike along the coast a little, or head out to the nearby island of Antiparos, a favourite haunt of celebrities and royalty.<br/>Naxos is unique among the Cyclades in that it is self-sufficient – all food on the island is grown and produced there, with no imports. You’ll explore the produce of Naxos through a series of organised visits including an olive oil museum tour, a tour of a kitron distillery, and likely most enjoyable of all, a hands-on cookery lesson from a local chef during which she’ll show you around the organic garden from where she gets her own ingredients.<br/><br/>Santorini, where you’ll spend your final few days, is a gloriously beautiful, volcanic island. Pack suitable walking footwear as you’ll hike to the island’s caldera for some spectacular views, learning as you go how the volcanic activity that shaped the island has also blessed it with wonderfully rich soil. The proof? It lies in Santorini’s superb wine industry, which you’ll explore through tastings at a handful of the island’s small, family-run wineries. <br/><br/>The Cyclades are, unsurprisingly, among the most popular Greek islands. For those looking to go beyond the beaches and resorts, however, this holiday gives you an incredibly satisfying introduction to their unique culture. <br/>",

      "description": "Kalimera! Welcome to Greece. Your adventure begins in Athens, Greece’s capital. There’s a lot to experience in this ancient city, so arriving a few days early is highly recommended. When you arrive at the airport, you’ll be met by a local representative and transferred to your hotel, where you’ll have a welcome meeting at 6 pm. If you arrive early, you might like to visit Athens’ iconic Acropolis or walk around the National Garden. After your meeting, get a taste of Greece’s celebrated cuisine during dinner with your group at a local restaurant and perhaps toast the beginning of the adventure with a glass of ouzo."

      "description": "This morning, you’ll be transported to Athens' port at Piraeus, where you’ll board a ferry to Paros – a beautiful and relaxed island with a layered history. Ferries are a great way to travel between the islands and are essential to many remote islands in Greece's archipelagos. In the afternoon, get to know Paros during an island tour with a local guide. Start off in Parikia, the island’s main town, where you’ll visit the Ekatontapiliani church, also known as the Church of a Hundred Doors. Drive across the island, passing by ancient marble quarries and verdant hills, to Marpissa for a visit to a cultural centre to learn about island life from a group of local women. Carry on to Naoussa – a village known for its whitewashed alleys, Venetian castle and scenic port. Then join your tour leader for a taste of Greece’s favorite street food — the iconic souvlaki wrap, or gyros, freshly made and tucked into soft pita bread. Delicious vegan options are also available."

      "description": "The day is yours to uncover more of Paros’ charms. There’s certainly no shortage of things to see and do on the island. You might like to take a guided morning hike along the coast – starting off at a fishing village and weaving through some of the island’s best beaches. In the afternoon, you’ll have the option to visit the nearby island of Antiparos – a favourite secret holiday spot for royals and celebrities. Or maybe you’d like to spend the day relaxing on one of Paros’ many beaches, cooling off with dips in Aegean Sea. Speak to your leader for more information about the activities on offer today and for tips on how to make the most of this island."

      "title": "Naxos.",
      "description": "Say goodbye to Paros this morning and catch a short ferry to Naxos. The largest of the Cyclades islands, Naxos has something for everyone – from beaches to an Old Town and hundreds of years of Venetian history. Take some time to settle in, then regroup in the late afternoon to learn about the town. Visit the Portara with a local guide – the giant marble doorway is the only remaining part of an unfinished temple of Apollo from 530 BC. Naxos is unique in the fact that it is the Cyclades’ only self-sufficient island, meaning all produce is grown and available on the island without imports. Because of this, the cuisine is hyperlocal and differs to the rest of the country. Try it for yourself this evening during a group dinner, where you will learn all about the regional specialties."

      "description": "Drive to Kaloxylos in the heart of the island’s biggest olive grove and one of the oldest in the world. Here, tour an olive oil press museum to learn about the importance of olive oil to Greek culture and traditional extraction methods. After your visit, you’ll put your new knowledge to good use as you travel to the nearby village of Galini for a hands-on cooking class. Meet with a local who will share her culinary knowledge with the group, leaving you with recipes you can cook up at home. First, collect fresh ingredients from your host’s organic garden and learn about cultivation and farming on Naxos. Then put the ingredients together to create a Naxian dish from scratch, enjoying the fruits of your labour for lunch. The evening is free for you to explore Naxos at your leisure. Your tour leader will be on hand to provide recommendations. For a tase of the island’s culture, perhaps sample the beloved local Kitron liqueur which has a history stretching back to the 19th century and is produced exclusively on Naxos."

      "description": "Today is free to explore more of Naxos as you wish. You may like to head to one of the island’s beaches or discover more of its history at a local museum. The Archaeological Museum of Naxos in Chora Naxos dates back to the 17th century and houses artefacts from the Neolithic to the early Christian periods, and the Geological Museum of Apeiranthos digs up the natural history of the island. If you’re after a sweet treat, walnut cake flavoured with local kitron is an excellent regional specialty. Your leader will be on hand to help tailor a day that suits your interests."

      "description": "Depart Naxos in the morning and catch a ferry to Santorini. When you arrive in Santorini's capital, Fira, you’ll be met and transferred to your Feature Stay hotel – a whitewashed building in traditional Cycladic style, El Greco Resort wraps around the year-round swimming pool. Featuring modern, spacious rooms, this hotel also sits in a prime location for exploring Santorini. It’s only a short walk from the Archaeological Museum of Thera, so perhaps head there to learn about how previous civilisations lived on the island. Tonight, make sure you catch Santorini's world-famous sunset."

      "title": "Santorini.",
      "description": "In the morning, embark on a hike along Santorini’s legendary caldera. The island you see today is what remains from a huge volcanic explosion that destroyed the early settlements and created a geographical caldera. The natural beauty of this caldera is what makes Santorini such a special place. Your walk will take you along the north-western rim of the caldera, passing steep cliff faces and amazing views along the way. The walk ends in the town of Oia, built on a steep slope inside Santorini’s volcanic caldera. Famous not only for its scenery, Santorini’s microclimate and volcanic soil make it a top spot for wine production. Sip your way around the island with two special stops – the Symposium Cultural Centre, where you’ll learn about Greek wine and try it in traditional cups, and a family-run winery, where you’ll discover more about the history of wine production and taste the different varieties yourself alongside a food pairing."
