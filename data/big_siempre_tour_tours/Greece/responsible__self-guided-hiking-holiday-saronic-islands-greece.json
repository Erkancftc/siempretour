      "description": "Walk from Agios Nektarios to Agia Marina | 11km: The walk from Agios Nektarios to Agia Marina is one of the most beautiful trails of the Saronic Islands. Start at Agios Nektarios monastery, located in the centre of the island, which you can travel to by bus or taxi. The Monastery was built for Holy Nektarios who died in 1920. Thousands of pilgrims come here every year. After your visit, walk a short distance to the old town of Paleochora, located on top of a hill. In the Middle Ages, this was a busy town and you can still see the remains of 38 Byzantine churches, some remain well preserved but most in ruins. From Paleochora, the walk continues via a ridge with ruined windmills to a scenic viewpoint. Walk back down through ancient olive groves to Mesargos and, from this village, walk on rural roads and dirt tracks to Agia Marina nunnery. Shortly after, Temple of Aphaia comes into sight. After you visit this ancient Greek Temple, walk down a wide track to the seaside resort Agia Marina. From here you return to Aegina town by public bus or taxi. Walking for the day: 4h, 11km, ­climbing 400m descending 550m; Accommodation: Hotel Danae or similar;"
