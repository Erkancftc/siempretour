Your tour will culminate at Cao Dai Temple, which is an exemplary display of Caodaism and a community that believes all religions should be valued equally. The highlight of your visit will be witnessing the Caodaist people, who will be adorned in various colored robes and pray within the ornately decorated temple that features dragon-shaped pillars and a sky blue ceiling.

      "title": "Ho Chi Minh City – Trace Back Vietnam’s Past",
      "description": "Ho Chi Minh City is a destination that is imbued with iconic highlights that represent Vietnam’s turbulent past, both the dramatic disasters and gripping victories that occurred during the Vietnam War. This iconic period of history and, more specifically, the reunification of the country post-war will reveal itself to you as you journey with an experienced guide to the admired monuments and museums that are situated within the city’s diverse districts. Restored military vehicles, such as Huey helicopters and M48 Patton tanks, stand on display outside the War Remnants Museum while a collection of black and white stills hang on its interior walls. The trials and tribulations will have never felt as real as they will when you peruse the fascinating exhibits and are completely absorbed by the intriguing wartime stories. Afterward, you will find yourselves crossing underneath the royal palm trees that envelope the 1960s-designed government building, which is known as the Reunification Palace. Its abandoned halls, which you will wander, evoke a hair-raising atmosphere that perfectly encapsulates the feelings that were experienced by officials in 1975 when Communist tanks rolled up onto the gardens. Though steeped in history, its antiquated decor creates an eye-catching display of decades-old Vietnamese architectural design by which to remember your expedition. Finally, you will tour Ho Chi Minh City’s History Museum for a more dated look into its heritage. What was once a French-colonial country house is now a museum that houses ancient artifacts and relics that date back to the Bronze Age. You will be astounded to explore its treasure trove of gems before you make your way to a delicious restaurant for dinner."
