You’ll also spend a day cycling around a quieter part of the city, by the river. From Hanoi it’s on to Halong Bay, but not for just a whistle-stop tour of this spectacular destination: you’ll board a beautiful junk boat for an overnight cruise, the best way to admire the bay’s stunning limestone karsts.<br/><br/>Next, an overnight train to Hue is a great experience for all the family as you move further south, continuing on after a little more rural sightseeing by bike to Hoi An. This lovely town is a cultural highpoint of the trip, and the perfect place to pick up a few souvenirs in the markets.<br/><br/>From Danang you’ll take a short internal flight to Siem Reap, your final destination of the trip and a chance to unleash your family’s Indiana Jones spirit, as you spend a few fascinating days exploring the ancient temples of Angkor. Kids of any age will love playing amid the ruins and tree roots, and be amazed by this UNESCO World Heritage Site’s treasures. <br/><br/>Still not entirely convinced?

For diving, we usually direct visitors to the PADI 5-star Rainbow Diving Centre (because they’re good - we don’t ask for, or receive, commission). There are many restaurants along the beach offering a variety of cuisines: the Louisiana Café is good, and has a large swimming pool free of charge. There are many more restaurants and cafes, both international and Vietnamese, in the town itself, quite a few bars and a few ‘night clubs’ (i.e. disco’ in Vietnam), and some interesting shops. Other places to visit are the museum devoted to Dr. Yersin (a much-loved foreigner who created the Pasteur Institute in Nha Trang and founded the city of Dalat) and the Long Son Pagoda. Climbing the steps behind the pagoda takes you to a massive statue of Buddha and spectacular view of Nha Trang and the bay. The cathedral and the Oceanographic Institute are also worth a look."

Finally, we'll stop at a local stall for a traditional Vietnamese coffee (brewed coffee served sweet with condensed milk) where we can also sample 'Banh Mi' - a Vietnamese take on the humble French baguette - freshly baked and packed with a combo of traditional and more exotic ingredients. Our walk winds up at the so-called 'secret weapons' bunker'. A small unassuming 'tube house' with a trap door in the floor that hides a basement stocked full of rifles, grenades and ammunition. The bunker played a key role in the TET Offensive of 1968, it was the base from which the Viet Cong's \"Team 5\" launched their assault, and its location was only revealed after the end of the war.

Next, we walk to the Hoa Lo Prison, where Vietnamese, as well as American and French prisoners of war, were once held. Then it’s on to the Huu Tiep Lake, better known as ‘B-52 lake’, where the wreckage of a US B-5 bomber can still be seen. Around noon we stop to enjoy Hanoi’s traditional bun cha, made with grilled pork and rice noodles. In the afternoon, we visit the Temple of Literature, built in 1076, where Vietnam’s first university was established to educate Vietnam's royalty, mandarins and members of the elite – a fascinating glimpse into the country’s past. Here we provide a traditionally-dressed graduate/model for more controlled shooting scenarios. Later in the afternoon, we visit Hanoi’s railway tracks for the sunset and shots of daily life activities. This is peculiar to this city as the railway tracks are sometimes located just metres away from the entrance doors of people’s houses, thus offering some unique photographic opportunities. Recent news suggests that we may not be able to approach this the traditional way, but we’re working with our local guide to see if we can find another angle. If not we will visit Tran Quoc Pagoda for sunset."

The Reunification Express is an iconic train journey nowadays, out of service for many of the war years, the  restoration of this line from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City in 1975 was also part of the reunification of the Vietnamese people after years of war. <br/><br/>The train journey is a hop on, hop off experience and so we actually spend most of our nights in small, locally owned hotels, with two nights on the sleeper train, and one night on a boat. Our holiday starts in Hanoi, the fascinating 100 year old capital city, where we have plenty of time to soak in the atmosphere. From here we head out to Halong Bay, which is where our night on a boat takes place, giving us plenty of time to enjoy the iconic sights of this marine karst landscape, with giant boulder islands emerging from the waters and sun setting over floating villages. <br/><br/>Back on land, we start our rail journey heading south on an overnight sleeper train to Hue, the old capital of the Nguyen Dynasty and where we have two days to explore in detail, some of it from the back of a motorbike. From Hue to Hoi An, by bus this time, where we have a few days to enjoy this town that feels like a leap into the past. Where streets are lit by lanterns, crumbling colonial architecture is still evident, tailors and artisans sell their wares and the car free streets are ever bustling. <br/><br/>We then take another train to the coastal town of Nha Trang, which is more about enjoying sandy beaches, snorkelling around coral reefs and enjoying superb food at waterside restaurants and bars. One more overnight sleeper train journey to Ho Chi Minh City brings this trip to a close, taking plenty of time to enjoy this historic city, formerly known as Saigon, and where can spend hours on end immersed in the likes of Ben Thanh Market, Chinatown, visiting its Taoist temples, the Reunification Palace and the very moving War Remnants Museum. While here, we also take a trip out of town to visit the extraordinary landscapes of the Mekong Delta, where the water dwelling culture is very much in contrast to urban Vietnam, which you can see on a boat trip through the paddy fields and floating markets.<br/>",

To get there, we rise early for the approximately four-hour drive and, upon arrival, board a traditional junk sailing boat, which is also our home for tonight. After launching, we enjoy a seafood lunch on deck and drift among the forested pinnacles. We also stop at a beach where we can hike up to a viewpoint (it’s quite steep but the vistas are worth it), plus there’s time for a swim in a small sectioned-off area. Additionally, an optional kayaking trip (extra cost) may be available depending on weather conditions. Back on board, we can pull up a chair on the top deck and watch the sunset together, perhaps with a cold drink from the bar. When it’s time for bed, we have the comforts of twin-share cabins with private bathrooms. Accommodation: Overnight boat"

    "generalInfo": "This is a two week, tailor made tour that is all about seeing Vietnam off the beaten track. Vietnam holidays are fast becoming dominated by multinational tour operators, but our small locally owned company is passionate about bringing visitors into the Vietnam that we know and love. To spend time in the rural villages around Pu Luong and the Central Highlands, with different ethnic groups and cultures that make up Vietnamese people, and showing off the natural heritage wonders and biodiverse beauties of their country. <br/><br/>The Pu Luong region is a protected Nature Reserve, made up of luscious limestone hills where rivers and waterfalls have carved up an idyllic landscape. We lead guided hikes through the ancient forests and valleys here, stopping at villages along the way where we are welcomed in to eat and sleep in authentic homestays. The hiking is not too strenuous, and we follow a gentle pace stopping to identify the local flora and fauna en route, with over a thousand plant species, 39 of which are endangered. <br/><br/>In contrast, you will find the Central Highlands very different, with elevated landscapes, plateaus with great panoramic views and also home to seventeen different communities living in the mountains. Following the ancient ‘gong’ culture, where the gong instrument plays a huge role in ritual and custom, their unique rong houses with their definitive towering roofs are a fascinating local feature. Our time here is spent hiking through ancient forest, swimming in waterfalls or lakes and enjoying time at locally owned accommodation.  <br/><br/>Using domestic flights for ease of transport, we spend the final days of this Vietnam holiday far out on the Con Dao archipelago in the South China Sea. A protected nature reserve, not only do the tropical forests and beaches proffer magnificent hiking  but this quiet, untouristy  island’s culture of fishing and history as a penal colony makes for a fascinating stay. As does the turtle watching (April-Oct) and snorkelling. <br/><br/>This Vietnam tour has been crafted with the more adventurous traveller in mind. One that is seeking out an authentic Vietnam, remote and biodiverse landscapes. With some trekking involved, it is not particularly recommended for families with young children, although it may appeal to teenagers who don’t want the usual tourist experience, but to delve deeper into Vietnamese rural culture. As a tailor made itinerary, we are more than happy to discuss all your interests to make this the perfect Vietnamese experience for you and your fellow travellers. Regarding the best time to visit Vietnam, we recommend Jan-May and late Sept-Dec, as the rainy season falls between these dates. <br/>",

Eo Ken village is far from the beaten track, high on the side of a mountain. It’s a stiff climb requiring stamina and much effort. We’ll allow plenty of time, and your guide will assist you, but if you feel it’s too much you just say so and you’ll return to the lower slopes. You’ll be surprised when you sample the villagers’ hospitality and their competence in serving and preparing meals. The explanation is that the Pu Luong trekking route is a good example of effective collaboration between foreign NGOs (non-governmental organisations), mainly Flora and Fauna International (FFI - a UK-based environmental charity), local authorities and individual communities. Apart from assisting families to convert their homes to be able to host visitors, they are taught recipes, cooking techniques, and other hospitality requirements.

It is built on stilts and has a most unusual thatched roof, sweeping upwards as much as 20 metres from low wooden walls. In many villages, fire risk has led to the replacement of the thatch with corrugated iron - more practical, but obviously less aesthetic. In this village, the Rong House is traditionally built. The complicated burial rituals of the Ja Rai are also of great interest. They involve internment in family tombs surrounded with grotesquely, and sometimes humorously, carved wooden effigies - there are examples in the cemetery of the village you’ll be visiting."

Bao Dai, the last Emperor of Vietnam, built a bridge across the falls - the remains are still visible among the undergrowth. The forest on the other side of the falls is old, with huge trees and full of birds. Alternatively, you could visit the town’s small Ethnology Museum and then walk a short distance to A Co Thon, an Ede ethnic minority group village. A Co Thon village is remarkable. Despite its location almost in the centre of the city, surrounded by Kinh ethnic majority households and farms, the Ede people’s traditional buildings and many of their ethnic customs are still prominent. During the 1950’s, French Catholic missionaries helped the Ede families to update their homes to include modern conveniences and standards of hygiene, and more efficient farming techniques, but simultaneously retaining their traditions of architecture and ceremonial. The result is one of the very few examples of ethnic groups that have achieved a comfortable standard of living in the Vietnamese social mainstream without being assimilated. Ask your guide to let you hear some Ede music – its very unusual and very closely linked to traditional rituals."

The bunker played a key role in the TET Offensive of 1968. There's time to explore the house and bunker, filled with decommissioned weapons and photographs, news clippings and memorabilia from wartime."

We'll explore the town on foot, walking through its narrow streets lined with centuries-old houses and Chinese Temples. We'll then make our way to the dock where we board our specially chartered river boat. Travelling along the backwaters by boat is by far the best way to see the delta, passing villages of stilted houses, abundant rice fields and a variety of cottage industries as we go. Before lunch, we stop at Tan Qui Dong, famous for its perfectly manicured floating flower gardens. Lunch will be served onboard, with delicacies such as 'elephant ear fish' available with a selection of locally sourced produce. We end the day by docking outside our night stop, the Ut Trinh Homestay. Set amongst manicured gardens, our homestay comprises of light and airy twin rooms with en-suite facilities (toilets and hot showers). The décor is traditional and reflective of this region, and there is a large communal living area and dining room. It is here we can get to know our hosts whilst we help them to prepare a selection of local dishes for tonight's dinner."

Can Tho is the centre in which farmers, fishermen and tradespeople come together to sell their products, and of course to buy for themselves and their families.

    "generalInfo": "Don’t pack too many books for this holiday because you’ll never be bored. From the moment you arrive in Ho Chi Minh City to when you say goodbye to your group and tour leader in Hanoi two weeks later, there will be countless memorable moments to savour. <br/><br/>You’ll tour the Mekong Delta on sampan rowing boats, and by tuk tuks, stopping at a coconut farm to sample some tropical fruits and homemade jams. Outside Ho Chi Minh City you’ll explore the famous Cu Chi Tunnels for an immersive introduction to life as a Vietcong soldier during the Vietnam War. In Dalat, in the southern highlands, you’ll have a lovely visit to a family-run coffee farm, and one of the tastiest brews you’ll ever enjoy. <br/><br/>Two of the major highlights of this Vietnam in depth tour comes towards the end. First, a flavoursome cookery experience in Hue with a local chef. Wander the market to pick up ingredients, before heading back to their home for a lesson in how to cook some traditional Vietnamese dishes. And the following day, having flown to Hanoi, you’ll sit down for a performance of Hat Xam. This North Vietnamese folk music, typically performed by blind people, was all but wiped out in the Communist era, and is still very rare today. Your visit directly helps the artform survive.<br/><br/>All this, and we haven’t even mentioned an overnight cruise in the magnificent Halong Bay aboard a junk. Dinner will be served on deck as you soak up stunning views of the bay’s karsts and islands. You can even hire kayaks to get a little closer.<br/><br/>You’ll eat at local restaurants throughout – there are very few ‘chain’ places here anyway – and stay in locally owned hotels, helped by a maximum group size of just 12. And for every holiday sold, a donation is made to an organisation that offers education and vocational training to Vietnamese people with disabilities. Like water gently flowing through the Mekong Delta, your trip spreads the financial benefits of tourism wherever it goes.<br/>",

Vietnam is 1600km long and travelling from north to south gives us time to explore not only some of its classic sites but also get far off the beaten track. <br/><br/>Classic sites on this Vietnam holiday include its great cities of Hanoi, the thousand year old capital, Hue and Hoi An both of which feel like a leap back into the past, and Hoi Chi Minh City, formerly known as Saigon and which needs little introduction. <br/><br/>As well as its great cities, we get a chance to explore the country’s landscape wonders, travelling with a variety of transport so that we are able to take it all in properly. We spend a night on a private charter boat on Halong Bay, the UNESCO World Heritage Site which is also the world’s largest marine karst landscape and home to many waterside communities. We also take a sleeper train through some of the tropical rural areas of the country, and go cycling through the exquisite rice paddies and environs of the Mekong Delta. <br/><br/>It is good to step off the beaten path in Vietnam sometimes, not only to see some of its lesser known natural heritage spots but also its historic ones. Consequently we spend time at Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park to take in its massive karst limestone terrain and cave systems, as well as Bach Ma National Park with its mix of coast, misty mountains and tropical valleys. Here, as in many places that we visit, we will learn about the impacts of the Vietnam War, visiting memorial sites and also the DMZ zone and Vinh Moc Tunnels .

Here, you can find an eclectic mix of the traditional and the new, where pagodas and markets compete alongside the trappings of Vietnam's newly discovered entrepreneurial spirit. For those arriving on time today, our tour leader plans to meet you in the hotel reception at 4pm for the welcome meeting and to take us on the walking tour. The tour will take in some of the central sights of the city, including the Opera House (formerly South Vietnam National Assembly), Hotel de Ville, Notre Dame Cathedral and the impressive French-style edifice that is the GPO building. If you'd like to receive a complimentary airport transfer today, you'll need to arrive into Tan Son Nhat International Airport (SGN), which is 30 to 40 minutes from the hotel. Please note that if you wish to join the afternoon orientation walk today, you must arrive at the hotel by 3.30pm. If you're booking your own flights, we recommend giving yourself at least 30 minutes to clear the airport. From the airport to the hotel is around a 30-minute drive, so the latest your flight can arrive is 2pm. Should you miss the welcome meeting, our tour leader will leave a note at the front desk to inform you of any essential information."

Poignant reminders of what the Vietnamese refer to as the American War can still be seen amongst the buildings and artefacts of the old US Embassy, as well as the remarkable Reunification Palace and the emotive War Crimes Museum. Another option is to join an excursion out to the infamous Cu Chi Tunnels. The infamous tunnels were an underground command base which was a major part of the 1968 Tet Offensive. If you're up to experiencing the claustrophobic conditions the Viet Cong lived in, there's the opportunity to crawl through a small, specially adapted section of the tunnels. Be warned, the tunnels are low and narrow and can be claustrophobic. A full day's visit to the colourful Mekong Delta can also be organised, where we can witness local life as we navigate the narrow waterways on traditional sampans and stop off to visit some of the fascinating cottage industries still practised today."

The greater Halong Bay area is one of Southeast Asia's most spectacular natural attractions, whose staggering beauty has seen it listed as one of the eight natural wonders of the world. It presents an extraordinary vista of hundreds of limestone islands (over 1600 at last count) that rise from the jade-green waters of the bay like the scales of some great submerged dragon. In fact, Halong means 'where the dragon descends to the sea' and local legends tell of a time when this rugged landscape was created by the pounding tail of a dragon as he ran from the mountains into the waters of the bay below. Taking to the waters, we board our junk and set sail, passing the floating village of Cai Beo which has been used as a home for the bay's fishermen for generations. The plan for this morning is to sail through this stunning seascape, stopping off to swim and visit some of the limestone caverns that pepper the landscape. There's also the option to hire a kayak to get even closer to some of the rugged coastline and hidden caves. We disembark from our boat around lunchtime and drive back to Hanoi, a journey of around two hours. Returning to Hanoi, our tour leader will take those who wish on a short orientation tour of the city, wandering the streets of the city's Old Quarter, whose narrow streets are named after the various crafts and specialities of the city's artisans: Paper Street, Silk Street, Basket Street etc. This practice dates back to the 13th century, when the city's original 36 guilds established themselves here, adopting a street each to differentiate them from their neighbours. The maze of alleys and streets is fascinating to explore on foot and the area is known for its interesting 'tube' houses, where the narrow frontages give way to long rooms. Here, the pavements are littered with food sellers tempting passers-by with all manner of noodles, snacks and stir-fried delights from shoulder panniers."

You can visit his museum and this austere mausoleum, said to resemble that of Lenin in Moscow, or perhaps take another walk through the streets of its Old Quarter. The city's French Quarter is a great place to explore by bicycle, its colonial architecture is a rich contrast to the more frenetic pace of the old city.

Continuing our rowing trip, we witness the alluring beauty of colorful stalactites which give the grotto its name. We then row our sampans back to a stilt house in Tho Ha Village and drive back to our hotel, where we spend the rest of the day at our own leisure."

Spend time kayaking and cruising around the green waters of Halong Bay, soak up Vietnam’s history via the fabulous food and architecture of Hue, with perhaps a cruise on the Perfume River, too. In Hoi An, see the mix of influences that have made this city so gorgeous – a touch of France here, a bit of China there – get some clothes made by one of the city’s famous tailors, or hop on your bike to cycle through rice paddies. Now it’s time for the coast. Head to Phan Rang for relaxed beers on the beach, before finishing off your unforgettable 10 days in Ho Chi Minh City, a busy urban hub where life happens on the street and the food is spicier, sweeter and more varied than in the north.<br/><br/>This is the perfect trip for young people who enjoy some independence. You’ll be travelling with a small group of up to 16 people, all aged between 18 and 29, and will have plenty of free time in each location.

There are over 14,000 artifacts in the museum’s care, including a bronze statue of a reclining Vishnu. When you step into the courtyard you will find four lotus pools. The garden is a virtual outdoor exhibition filled with bas-reliefs and stone work that date between the 6th and 11th centuries. Your tour through the history of Phnom Penh continues and the tremendous images of the country’s empirical grandeur will follow you."

The elegant accommodation is situated near the Old French Quarter and is just a short distance away from the Angkor complex. Soon you will come to the treasured history of Angkor Wat. The afternoon sun casts a golden hue over the sandstone. A forceful bridge connects the mainland to the courtyard. You venture through the entrance gate and feel like you have stepped back in time. Angkor Wat is the best preserved example of Khmer architecture in the country. It is easy to look upon the magnificent scale of the structure and have your breath taken away. The famous temple was constructed in the 12th century as a symbol of the king’s connection to Vishnu. The central tower stands taller than the four that surround it. Enter into the second gallery and find a continuous relief. The images tell the story of the Mahabharata epic."

You notice the stone elephant trunks running along the walls. Bayon Temple is the most famous sanctuary in the complex. It was built in the 12th century and blends Buddhist and Hindu imagery. It is located at the center of the walled city and is meant to represent the intersection of heaven and earth. The stupas are not just stone towers but also contain the enigmatic smiling faces of a single enlightened being."

Each home is built on stilts that allows for the intermediate rise and fall of the lake throughout the seasons. The local villagers are friendly and gracious. You can see a number of sampans winding through the water. Some boats look to carry fishermen while other boats ferry children to and from shore.

The locals enjoy the rich and almost chocolaty flavor. In certain neighborhoods you can find people mixing the coffee with condensed milk to add a thick and sweet cream to the rich and dark drink. After breakfast your guide meets you at the hotel. There is an abundance of history and culture to see. One Pillar Pagoda is an historic Buddhist temple that was constructed in the 11th century. It hovers over the serene waters of a lotus pond. The temple is quaint but impressive. A stone staircase leads up to the sanctuary’s entrance. Its roofs slope and curve in a quintessential example of ancient Vietnamese architectural design. The surrounding trees rustle in the breeze. The lotus pond is quiet and perfectly still. It feels so far removed from the movement of the city even though you are in the city’s center. The Temple of Literature is nearby and is home to the university that was started in the 11th century. It is the oldest university in Vietnam. The old university and the temple, the pagodas and the courtyard have become an oasis in the large city, filled with tranquil atmosphere and pristine scenery. In the center of the Garden of the Stele you will find a walled pond known as the Well of Heavenly Clarity. Two halls border the well and contain 82 steles, each one sitting on the back of a tortoise."

Hanh Cave stretches over half a mile through Hanh Mountain. When you enter the grotto you find Three Girls Temple. The beauty of the cave speaks to the legend of the grotto’s namesake. Stalactites catch the light and beam a rainbow of colors along the stone. The water current drifts slowly. The interior looks like a palace made of natural stone and has been polished by time.

You can experience the traditions that combine both garden and restaurant, which allows the ambiance of the flourishing plants to add to the delicacies of Hue’s imperial cuisine. At the center of the citadel, you will find the Purple City, also known as the Forbidden City. It was constructed in the 19th century by order of Emperor Gia Long.

The tomb is a rectangular structure that leans against the mountainside and stands atop 127 steps. Large stone dragons form the side walls of the lower steps.

The courtyard is gold and colorful. The fountains are unique and ornate. One fountain replicates a winding and flying dragon placed over the serene water. The hall is filled with a number of statues and bronze drums that are decorated with Chinese characters. Though the hall once served as a place to gather and celebrate, it now serves mostly as the city’s largest and most decorative temple. In the nearby city of Danang you will visit the Cham Museum which houses over 300 sandstone sculptures dating back to the 4th century. The museum is located inside of a building embellished with traditional Cham elements.

The fountain sprinkles water in gentle arches. The palace was completed in the 1870s with a façade that extends over 240 feet. When you enter the palace and come to the basement you are intrigued by the décor that recreates an old war room, from the desk to the walls. Old communications devices remain intact and in working order, which adds an ambiance to the room that is more than just decoration.

You’ll taste and taste some more, this being almost like a tapas-style hop between stalls. You will indulge in rice noodles as finger food, freshwater crab, barbecued pork with rice vermicelli, served with pickled vegetables, papaya, and a vinegary fish sauce. Along the way, you’ll visit the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum, properly discover the Old Quarter, and learn why Anthony Bourdain fell in love with the North Vietnamese cuisine."

        "description": "You take an early flight to a sleepy city. Hue is the ancient imperial capital, and the remains can only suggest as to what was here before – so much was lost during the 1968 Tet offensive. Spend most of today on a historical tour, walking through the Imperial Citadel, visiting the tombs of ancient leaders, and admiring the country’s most important Buddhist monument. This evening, you sit down to a dozen courses of local Hue food, sharing the meal with a royal artist who lived through the city’s great changes. There’s bun rieu cua , crab paste sitting on a tomato broth soup. Then bun bo hue , a spicy soup that you’ll see all over the country – it’s always best in the place it originated. Over dinner and tea, you explore the stories of Hue’s past and find your regional favorite from a region that has forever shaped the country’s cuisine."

Cross Hai Van, a mountain pass that is usually closed to the public, then roll into Hoi An. Of all the stops in Vietnam, this quaint town is a perennial favorite. It’s the home of cau lao, a pork and noodle soup embellished with deep-fried croutons. Wonton is also popular here, and you’ll learn both dishes in a colorful local kitchen – it’s a quiet cooking class that involves as much tasting as it does cooking. Late afternoon is the perfect time to explore the old city of Hoi An, its mix of old architecture and insight into Vietnam’s past – Japanese, Chinese, French, plus various others."

Return to Hoi An for a second breakfast and some free time to explore the town, perhaps best spent by sitting at a cafe terrace watching local life unfold. This afternoon, you delve deeper into Vietnam’s seafood culture, learning and tasting the dishes that are popular all along the coast – like crab spring rolls and fermented fish sauce. As you will have learned by now, there’s always a soup and a healthy splash of chili and lemongrass."

Think sticky rice, big and bold flavors, lots of fresh coffee, and an abundance of herbs – basil, coriander, chili, cinnamon, star anise. Tasting the food is part of exploring the city as Saigon opens its heart today. Visit an old market where food practically tumbles from the haphazard stalls. Walk through the old French streets to small atmospheric cafes, where the coffee is served with sweet condensed milk. Sink your nose into the backstreets and really explore what made Saigon such an evocative name and place. Then toast to Vietnam this evening with dinner at one of the country’s most celebrated fine dining restaurants – it’s part of the new wave of Vietnamese dining."

Food is integral to the culture here, served up in alleyways from dawn until long past dusk. Everything is fresh and vibrant, yet the beauty comes from the harmony of flavors. The most commonly used ingredients in the cuisine are coconut, palm sugar, chili, salted fish, lemongrass, and exotic array of other spices. A local guide takes you to two neighborhoods known for their food, a chance to hop between stalls and pick out many of Thailand’s most iconic dishes. The cuisine here started on the streets, so that’s the way you must start your culinary adventure. Over these two days, there will be plenty of time to see the sights as well, such as old temples and floating markets. There are giant Buddhas, riverside scenes, and so much to ignite the imagination. Over the last two decades, Thai cuisine has garnered international acclaim, and Bangkok has seen an explosion of fine dining restaurants. The ingredients are similar to the streets but the setting is entirely different, plus there’s a contemporary twist on traditional variations. Your two-day masterpiece of spices also takes you to the city’s top two restaurants, including a meal at a restaurant that’s inscribed in the World’s Best 50 Restaurants list."

After the fast-paced adventure so far, Thailand’s cultural capital is a place to unwind and really slow down. For centuries it was cut off from the world, accessible only on the back of elephants, or by a three-week river journey from Bangkok by the river. So it wasn’t adulterated by Western changes and kept its old-world spirituality intact long into the 20th century. Chedis stand in a redolent state of ruin. Red-robed monks walk serenely between temple buildings. Incense adds itself to the aromas. Most of the old walled city is pedestrianized, a lovely place to walk or bicycle, especially around dusk time. Of course, there is the food, Chiang Mai a hotbed for regional flavors coming from all across northern Thailand. Touch down today and start by exploring the colors and smells of raw products. Waroros Market is your best first stop, the place where locals go to buy their kafir lime leaves, dried worms, and dried chili. Small stalls serve up perennial favorites, giving you first tastes of sticky black jelly ( kala mare), crispy fried pork skin ( kaeb moo) , and sweet yellow noodles. Some flavors you’ll love, others you might not be fond of. You’ll start to understand the diversity of gastronomy in this corner of the world, something that often contrasts preconceptions of typical Thai food."

Take this one step further by attending a two-day cooking school that provides an immersion in how to balance flavors, use your nostrils, and substitutes ingredients that you might not find available at home. It’s relaxed and informal, more of a getting together than a series of lessons. The idea is to experiment and discover for yourself, allowing you to take the secrets back with you. Start with the raw ingredients and how they come together in basic Thai dishes, like chicken green curry, Thai fish cakes, and hot and sour prawn soup. Then get a little more experimental with water chestnuts in coconut milk and a spicy papaya salad. On the second day, you learn the art of making a Thai curry paste, pestle and mortar grinding the ingredients into the start of a local staple. Perfect this part of the cuisine, and there’s hardly a dish in Thailand you can’t make. Chiang Mai curry is the local favorite, but you’ll also learn Panang pork curry, fried fish chili, and basil curry, plus how to keep the rice fluffy or sticky dependent on what it accompanies. With cooking during the day, you have free time to explore Chiang Mai during the evenings. One essential experience is included, being invited into a temple at sunset for a spiritual blessing. It’s the sort of experience that makes complete sense when you’re in a destination like Chiang Mai."

It’s a day packed with flavors, and you’ll return to Chiang Mai just in time for sunset above the city when a carpet of color brings this 12-day tour to a close.

The church’s twin steeples rise 190 feet into the air. The Central Post Office was built in the later 19th century and contains looping arches and an intricately designed marble floor. You feel like you have been transferred to central Paris until you see the large portrait of Ho Chi Minh that hangs at the far end of the building and watches over the gallery.

The Tam Ky house is a celebration of both architecture and history. Built in the late 18th century, the house was constructed in a pipe shape with an interior divided into various apartments that served specific functions. The front of the house was used for storefronts while the rooms near the river were used for imported and exported goods. You can see the delicately carved wood within the home decorating the rooms with dragons and fruits. For lunch you will enjoy the quintessential flavors of cao lau , a regional dish only found within the city. The combination of noodles, pork, and local greens creates a unique and delicate balance of richness, succulence, and herbs you would be hard-pressed to find elsewhere."

        "description": "The morning light glints off of the water and shines along the Japanese Bridge. After breakfast, your guide will meet you in the hotel lobby and take you to the cluster of five hills known as Marble Mountains. The limestone and marble are carved with caves and tunnels along with temples decorating them and making them a site of pilgrimage for many locals and visitors from all around Vietnam. From the summit, you can look out over China Beach and see the sapphire water of the South China Sea glistening with opulence. Your day continues in the Cham Museum of Danang before venturing over the majestic landscape of the Hai Van Pass. The hills roll into the mountains that peak into the sky while tumbling down to the seaside. The land is draped in lush emerald greenery while the sea is washed with iridescent blue. In the afternoon you will enjoy lunch at a local restaurant where fresh seafood allows you to savor the exceptional and diverse flavors of the country. You arrive in Hue with a visit to the Forbidden Purple City; it is located inside the Citadel and dates back to the 19th century under the reign of Emperor Gia Long. Almost entirely destroyed during the Tet Offensive of 1968, what does remain highlights the strength and dedication of a past empire. Your night will be spent within the luxuries of the Asia Hotel located close to the calm banks of the Perfume River and at the center of all that the city has to offer."

You come to the river and board a dragon boat. The colors and detail of the boat are stunning, from the blue scales of the dragon to its multi-colored strands of hair streaming from its half-ferocious, half-jovial glare. Drift along the Perfume River, the mist rising through the air filling the warm morning with a cool scent. The Tien Mu Pagoda has become an icon of Vietnam and Hue, with large concentric hexagons climbing into the air. However, it is the tombs of the emperors Minh Mang and Khai Dinh that tend to mesmerize people. Modeled after Beijing’s Forbidden City, the 19th-century royal constructions span six square miles with 10 gates and stone walls that are around six feet thick. The atmosphere is calm and embracing, steeped in regal architecture and sensational artifacts. After a quick transfer to the airport, you will arrive in Hanoi, the capital city of Vietnam.

        "description": "There is a considerable difference between the emotive city rush of Hanoi compared to the sleepier city of Hue. However, the energy of the streets is compelling and captivating, bringing traditional culture to modern neighborhoods. Motorbikes venture down the roads, bicycles rush alongside the streets, and women wearing conical hats and carrying flat, rounded baskets filled with limes hustle along en route to the market. With a culture that dates back 1,000 years the mixture of preserved buildings and skyscrapers allows history and modernity to coexist. After breakfast your guide once again meets you, ready to show you the sensational highlights of Hanoi. The mausoleum sits in Ba Dinh Square looming over the open plaza with large stone masonry and firm angles. Behind the structure itself is a path that leads through the lush dangling vines of a botanical garden to the billowing yellow façade of the old Presidential Palace. The French Colonial architecture harkens back to a different era. The charming house on stilts at the edge of the pond, once an electrician’s house, became the presidential residence of Ho Chi Minh. The scent of the garden’s greenery and pond bring moisture and earthiness to the air and to the legend of the Ho Chi Minh."

Limestone karsts add to the gilt of the sky and tower over the surface of the water like the skyscrapers of Hanoi that you left beyond earlier in the day. The cool breeze sweeps across your cheeks and the sweet scent of the water surrounds you. Thousands of islands are situated within the archipelago including Dau Go Island where a colorful cave can be found displaying stalactites and stalagmites that rise and fall over 60 feet. The sunlight causes a shift in the hues of the stone, from yellow to green, blue to gold. At Titov Beach you can step into the bay and feel the cool, soothing water rush against your toes. The powdery sand is pressed up against the water on one side and lush greenery on the other. In the evening you will return to Hanoi with the relaxed energy of a stunning day staying with you."

With over 1,000 years of history blossoming within the neighborhoods it’s hard to know where to start. Your guide brings you to the most notable landmark of the city, the imposing stone structure of Ho Chi Minh’s Mausoleum. The almost temple-like architecture is fixed with strong masonry and rigid angles overlooking Ba Dinh Square. Later you will come to One Pillar Pagoda. The beautiful temple rises from the center of a square lotus pond, ascending on a single pillar and resembling a blossoming lotus flower. Constructed in the 11th century, it has become one of Vietnam’s iconic temples and is accessible by a graceful stone staircase rising to the terrace."

With thousands of islands along the archipelago sculpted by the elements and time, you look into the emerald waters that make up the Gulf of Tonkin without reservation. Cruising through the charm of rising limestone karsts with the mist in your face will eventually bring you to Sung Sot Cave, also known as Surprise Cave. The colors of the rock walls change with the reflected light bringing bright green and even purple hues draping across the deep grotto. The ceiling hovers around 90 feet tall and leads to various halls. One such hall features stalactites that dangle in a variety of shapes and look as though they melted from the stone; there is nothing but natural majesty to captivate you. In the evening the boat will anchor along a quiet cove where the sound of the tide brushing against the rocks will lull you to rest."

The Ethnic Market around Lao Cai is known for its collection of villagers that come from all over the mountainside to sell, barter or buy. The scent of effervescent produce mixes with earthy aromas. The colorful textiles that the women wear and vend are diverse, unique, and elegant, fitting with their particular cultures which are often unseen by outsiders. Flower Hmong people almost glow with the pinks, greens, yellows, and blues of their wardrobes, including the intricate shawls wrapped around their shoulders and the angled headscarves worn over their hair. Roots and brushes are displayed in the expansive and jovial market beside woven bags and paintings. After lunch you will come to Sapa, a sleepy hillside town that stands just above the morning mist creating a distinctive picturesque quality along the mountainside. The altitude often brings a chillier evening to the city, but offers a perfect excuse to indulge in the sweet and comforting flavors of a hot chocolate."

H’mong villages speckle the mountainside and create sensational terraced rice paddy fields that rise up the landscape texturing the scenery. Water buffalo graze along the seemingly endless greenery. Your guide brings you to a variety of villages where the children are both excited and anxious as you traipse through their open yard. However, both children and adults alike are thrilled to see new faces and welcome you into their village. The homes are built by compressing earth and raw material into formidable building blocks. When you make it to the nearest road you will be met by a jeep and taken to Ban Ho Village, home to a Tay tribe. They welcome you into their home with grace and curiosity. Their village is positioned at the foot of a mountain and is filled with ambience of friendliness. The women wear skirts and blouses often embroidered with intricate geometric shapes. In the quiet evening of the mountains you can rest within the hospitality of Ban Ho Village."

The early hours of the day are yours to indulge in Hanoi once more before you are whisked to the airport and find yourself within the charming and once grandiose Imperial City of Hue. Your guide meets you at the airport, and soon you are drifting along the tranquil surface of Perfume River on a dragon boat. The boat is adorned with two brilliant serpents with maniacal smiles that are radiant against their blue scales. The concentric hexagonal layers of the Thien Mu Pagoda create one of the oldest religious buildings in Vietnam dating back to the early 17th century. Rising atop the hill on the north bank of the river, the seven tiers each represent a different step on the path to enlightenment. A short boat journey brings you to the magnificent tomb of Emperor Minh Mang. Modeled after Chinese architectural concepts, the emperor’s tomb sits within a six-square-mile complex constructed in the 19th century. The beauty of the complex is not just in its architectural marvels but also in its tranquility. Walk along the cobblestone paths, over the footbridge that feels almost level with the pond, and then climb the stairs of the double terrace to the entrance of Minh Mang’s tomb. The opulent attention to detail in the entirety of the complex brings awe along with beauty."

What was once the former imperial seat of the government is now filled with a vast collection of historical temples, pavilions, walls, and gates. The main southern gate was constructed in the 19th century by Emperor Minh Mang. The central door and bridge were exclusive to the emperor. The Forbidden Purple City sits at the center of the complex behind the Thai Hoa palace which was almost completely destroyed during the Tet Offensive of 1968. The history of the citadel dates back hundreds of years and also to contemporary times bringing a deeper connection to what was left behind."

At times it looks like you ascend above the clouds and you notice the mountain peaks in the distance standing over the mist before it dissipates. Arrive in Danang to visit the Cham Museum. The indigenous Cham have roots that date back to the second century while the museum boasts a collection of terracotta and stone artwork that dates back to the seventh century. The building itself is a blend of French and Champa architecture surrounded by budding flowers, dangling leaves, and simple turrets; known symbols of the Hindu religion. The museum is famous not just for its grand collection of Champa era artwork, but also for being the only museum specifically dedicated to Cham history. Its halls are filled with images of Ganesh and Shiva, tigers, and Vishnu. After a relaxing visit to China Beach you will find the charm of Hoi An comforting in the evening."

The Hindu temple dates back to ancient Champa and can be viewed within the ruins that stand surrounded by impressively green jungle and tall mountaintops. Similar to the sandstone ruins of Banteay Srei in Cambodia, walking through the collection of temples is both peaceful and somewhat energizing within the reach of such vast history. The intricate carvings on the temples’ sides range from images of gods to myth all woven into history on the surface of the stone. The deep red shimmer of the stone stands out against the growing foliage and makes you feel as though you have discovered this ancient world."

The day is at your whim and pleasure, giving you the opportunity to spend it resting in the sand with your fingers sliding into the softness, or golfing along the palm tree studded course if you so desire. For a spectacular view of the coastline you could enjoy a snorkeling tour that takes you just off of the reef. The coral is as iridescent as the fish, some of which are striped at angles and others glow neon yellow. Turtles glide through the water, coursing through the still and glassy current beneath the surface. The world within the sea is as stunning and interesting as the world above it. The cool saltwater is refreshing while the sun warms your skin giving you a perfect balance, a magnificent ambiance, and a fabulous first full day along the shore."

This former capital of South Vietnam could be called the most modern city in the country. The skyline reaches higher and farther than one you have seen thus far. However, the essential ambiance of the country, that of culture and flavor, is alive and well in the depths of the city center, around the Saigon River, and extending outward beyond the reach of the skyscrapers’ shadows. The city dates back to the reign of the Khmer and has been evolving ever since. The sensual aromas of ginger and garlic dance through the eclectic streets.

The streets showcase what once gave the title of “Pearl of the Orient” to Ho Chi Minh City. Within the remarkable history you find a bright red light shimmering off of the stone of the Notre Dame Catholic Church.

The riverbanks are lined with fringed palms while you watch the iconic image of locals paddling down through the water on shallow skiffs while wearing conical hats to shield themselves from the sun. Visit the celebrated bonsai garden where the pine scent of the trees reaches the soft earthen aroma of the riverbanks. Rows of bonsai flourish in the atmosphere along the Mekong, their strong but malleable branches reaching outward and upward. Delicate flowers blossom within the garden.

Monkeys meander along the walkway to the modern temple that sits atop the front ridge. They scamper away the closer you come.

From ST 2 ½ to Psar Nath you will find a concentration of artistry, from galleries to shops, giving a Bohemian feel to the neighborhood that helps illuminate the present lives of the city situated within a shadow of a troubled past. In the outer circles of the city you will find Wat Banan, one of the best-preserved temples which sits atop a hill overlooking the trees. The dates of completion and the builders are unknown. Many carvings survive along the central tower, vested in prayer, within the quiet hills at the top of the climbing stone steps. The stupas are remarkable in their size and shape, as tall as the trees and almost brighter than the bark. In the late afternoon you will return to the charismatic streets of Battambang and enjoy the little private slice of Bohemia."

Your private transfer takes you on the journey that spans over 100 miles and teems with sensational landscape along the way. Villages can be seen within the trees, stacked on stilts with straw roofs, ladders helping rid the villagers of the distance between ground and door. Chickens scatter about, clucking along the dusty patches of dry land. The colors in the distance shift from green to brown, patches of grass and clearing. On the way to Siem Reap you journey deeper into the culture of Cambodia within the lives of those outside of the cities and find grace in the difference.

You, however, understand how stunning Angkor Thom will be in its early morning emptiness and prefer to stroll through the ancient walls of the complex in unadulterated privacy. The 12th century city is known for the great Bayon Temple and may have been populated by around one million people at its peak. The ruins run over a mile on a single side, containing stone temples and bridges lined with marvelous statues that represent gods and demons. In the early light you find the sight peaceful and ethereal. The large stupas resemble karsts rising into the air adorned with faces that watch out over the open square. As you step closer it looks to have been modeled after a mountain, rocky and textured, large and looming, each stone purposeful and elegant. The sound of gongs and chants mix with the scent of morning dew and incense. The sun has risen and your exploration of the grand temples of Angkor has just begun."

The pediments are large, standing taller than the entrances sharply adorned with entire scenes of mythology. Although the relative height and size isn’t as large as Angkor, the coloration, dimensions, and adornments bring awe and inspiration to those who visit. You can find a secluded nook within the rising towers, noticing one of the many guardian figures sitting around the stairways and gods are pressed into the geometric designs around every door.

From the exquisite lime zest to the chili paste, the succulent noodles to the deeply rich soup, you have ventured through the winding roads and climbing countryside, experiencing the diverse tastes of each region and the familiar flavors of the Vietnamese tradition.
