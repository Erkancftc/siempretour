      "title": "Hanoi – An Intriguing Juxtaposition of the Old and the New",
      "description": "You will meet your private transfer shortly after you have landed in Northern Vietnam and journey across luscious boulevards toward your luxury hotel in Hanoi, which is the capital of Vietnam. The city is steeped in history and presents a gorgeous glimpse of the locals’ vibrant lifestyle that is proudly highlighted along its spirited streets. Furthermore, its old-world, colonial charm is matched by an atmosphere of opulence, which exudes from the premier experiences that can be found within its borders. You will enjoy the best of both worlds as you uncover the historical highlights and luxurious appeal of Hanoi’s sought-after attractions, and it will all begin from the supreme comfort of your astonishing accommodation. Your first afternoon in Hanoi will provide you with a taste of Vietnamese culture as you make your way to pivotal heritage sites that are peppered across the city. Hoan Kiem Lake boasts a stretch of tranquil water, which will sparkle under the midday sun and is flanked by gorgeous trees and shrubbery. Rising from a grassy bank in the middle of the lake stands Ngoc Son Temple, which is an antique piece of architecture that showcases ancient values, and you will access it via the Huc Bridge. You can peruse through its elaborately decorated walkways and marvel at the wonderful displays of historical admiration before capturing a few incredible images to commemorate your visit. Revolutionary leader Ho Chi Minh played a momentous role in the country’s history, and monuments have since been constructed in his honor. One such edifice, the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum, lies within Hanoi, and a brief visit will bring you closer than ever to Vietnam’s past. The mausoleum’s marble walls house the remains of Ho Chi Minh, and his preserved body is still visited by hundreds of locals every day. Although modest in design, the granite site is instantly recognizable, and it resonates a humble aura. You will be introduced to the distinct flavors of Vietnam the following day on an extensive culinary tour that will lead you around the city. Your day will begin amid the bustle of an authentic morning market, where delicacies are served in abundance and locals mingle over a cup of coffee. You will catch whiffs of Pho , a noodle soup that is synonymous with Vietnamese cuisine, as it boils and hear the buzzing sounds of coffee beans being grounded as you tuck into your specialty dish for a taste of tradition. Afterward, you will venture to a recognized culinary school to learn timeless cooking techniques from professionally trained chefs. Blending an array of hearty flavors, you will savor the mouth-watering fruits of your labor before certifications of commemoration are awarded to you. To conclude your day of dining, you will tour the prestigious restaurants that are sprawled across Hanoi and be accompanied by your knowledgeable guide. You will then transfer to award-winning establishments for palatial experiences of Vietnamese cuisine, where you will sit down to discuss the culinary arts with a collection of esteemed head chefs. Your final day in Hanoi will leave nothing to be desired as you transfer to the ancient village of Duong Lam. Your private guide will usher you to a bicycle collection point, where you will be provided with the opportunity to ride through the winding streets of the peaceful village. Tradition will unfold before your eyes as you capture images of the age-old architecture that lines the pathways before settling in with a friendly local for a customary tea ceremony. The aromatic experience will fill you with vigor and leave you feeling great appreciation for the long-established rituals that embody the country’s spiritual philosophies. You will then make your way back to Hanoi in the afternoon for a candlelit dinner at a classy restaurant that overlooks the city."

      "title": "Sapa – An Adored Landscape of Archaic Origins",
      "description": "There is a vast assortment of cultures within Vietnam, and many people who embrace them come together in the prolific highlands of Sapa. The region features staggering mountain ranges that are blanketed by emerald forests, and atop many of these peaks, you will immerse yourselves in the local lifestyles of long-established villages during your stay. You will board an exceptional train in Hanoi that will be bound for the base of these gorgeous, limestone crests, which is where your world-class resort will be located. Your private railway cabin, which will be fitted with comfortable beds, will afford unparalleled vistas of the countryside that will unfurl well into the distance. You will soon step out into the chilly embrace of the fresh Sapa climate and feel the sensations of the crisp air as it fills your lungs. Pollution will be unapparent as you make your way through the serene green belt to your accommodation, giving you a sense that you are truly stepping back into a time where nature reigned. The morning will bring with it a brilliant sunrise over the lofty precipices, which will peak through your decorous room’s blinds and beckon you for a day of adventure. Your private guide will collect you in your lobby after you have feasted on a glorious breakfast spread, and you will transfer to Thac Bac’s gushing natural highlight of the Silver Waterfall. From its tremendously flowing water that seems to form the shape of a white dragon against its foliage-covered walls to its sweeping views of the flourishing forests of Hoang Lien National Park, it is breathtaking in every regard. Images will fail to accurately capture the unspoiled atmosphere although they will serve as memories of your experience under the pounding silver-colored stream of the falls. Sapa’s rugged terrain is entirely enchanting because, beyond the craggy rock formations that constitute its mighty cliffs, it features golden rice terraces that cascade toward gentle rivers in grassy valleys. You will stroll across the highlands to the soundtrack of the rustling leaves and chirping birds nearby on a tour that will be designed to showcase the picturesque landscape in its entirety. Your wilderness immersion will continue after your trek up Ham Rong Mountain to Tram Ton Pass, where you will be blown away by the ever-shifting climate that envelopes the winding roads. Afterward, you can meander to the melody of the wildlife as it comes to life. Goats may bleat from mountain tops as roosters crow from farms. Before you set off for your next destination, you will be provided with the opportunity to become more familiar with the locals who inhabit this region. The Hmong people form a large community in Sapa, and their traditions bleed over into many facets of the lifestyle here. You will be whisked away to an ancient village, where you will be amazed by their devotion and contentment to rural living. Dirt roads form aisles where brightly decorated shops sell trinkets and curios, the residents adorn multi-colored skirts that are embroidered with intricate patterns, and their wooden houses feature thatched roofs that are atypical of suburban living. You will be invited into a family home for the unique chance to dine on traditional, family-cooked meals with them. With your knowledgeable guide to help translate, you will connect with ease and help prepare a selection of Hmong dishes that you are unlikely to find anywhere. With the afternoon to enjoy at your leisure and a gourmet dinner at your resort to round off your evening, your stay in Sapa will soon come to a captivating close."

      "title": "Cao Bang – Experience the Highlights of the Highlands",
      "description": "Cao Bang, much like Sapa, boasts idyllic landscapes that are off the beaten path and will provide you with a wealth of memories to cherish when you return home from your adventure through Northern Vietnam. You will transfer across the rugged terrain with ease as you sit back and catch some sleep inside a spacious private vehicle. Soon, you will find yourselves peering out at the thriving countryside from your secluded balcony in your stylish boutique suite. There is very little in terms of modern, industrial, or commercial development, which makes this stop an entirely relaxing place to rest your heads while also getting in touch with the wilderness that surrounds your chic accommodation. One of the primary highlights of Cao Bang and arguably the entire Northern region of Vietnam is the Ban Gioc Waterfall, and you will venture there on your first day of exploration. The falls are 300 meters wide, which makes it the fourth largest waterfall across the globe. Within this astonishing valley of luscious color, turquoise torrents leap from the summits of the crescent-orientated cliffs toward momentous pools of water. From a wooden riverboat that is positioned at the base of the waterfall, you will gaze up in awe at the natural display while capturing remarkable photos of the breathtaking scenery. Nature’s immaculate sights will continue to reveal themselves as you continue to Nguom Ngao Cave, where you will brave the depths of the cave system and be rewarded with bewildering exhibits of archaic stalactite formations that hang from the cavern ceilings. During this experience, your knowledgeable guide will share insightful information that pertains to the ancient cave system and the mysteries in which it is shrouded. Finally, before you journey to your next destination, you will learn more about Ho Chi Minh and delve deeper into his iconic life at the Pac Bo Historical Complex. The dignified pilgrimage site will bring you to the bonsai-brimmed memorial that honors his story, the cave in which he spent time in hiding, and the calming river where he is said to have written classic pieces of poetry. You will leave Cao Bang having unearthed important facets of Vietnamese culture and having captured picturesque images of its topography."

      "description": "This morning, you will board another luxurious train that will embark for Hanoi, which is where you will interchange with a private vehicle and venture to Mai Chau. Atop a jungle-coated hill in Mai Chau lies a pristine ecolodge with splendid bamboo bungalows that you will revel in over the following few nights. Traditional Vietnamese decor embellishes the lodge, while a modern touch adds a sophisticated flair to your palatial suite.

Otherwise, you can have some time to yourself and unwind because you will have a full day to discover the rural beauty tomorrow. With so many delightful activities under your accommodation’s belt, you will not have to leave the alluring borders of its farmlands to immerse yourselves in Mai Chau traditions. You can spend your morning soaking up the sun as you traverse flourishing rice fields to a chorus of cows who graze the grass. With each step across the exuberant terrain, you will gently fall into the rhythm of the locals and start to feel like one yourself. The trail will bring you to a nearby farm, where friendly residents will invite you to share in some active discovery, which will involve showcasing your green thumb and lending a helping hand. Afterward, you can treat yourself to an invigorating, Vietnamese massage under the shade of emerald palms before watching a flamboyant Vietnamese dance performance by a group of talented locals who will be dressed in colorful folk clothing. You will be able to sip on authentic rice wine throughout the show and tuck into exquisitely prepared dishes for an unbelievable end to your day. Your final day in Mai Chau will be yours to enjoy at your own pace. From sunrise to sundown, the atmosphere will be peaceful, and there is not much noise other than the melodies of wildlife as it goes about its day. Whether you wish to stroll through the golden rice terraces or weave your way toward a local market in town, there is nothing that will pull you out of this serene setting and aura of equanimity."

      "title": "Ninh Binh – Discover the Spirit of the Countryside",
      "description": "Stunningly diverse and bursting with cultural character, Ninh Binh is the final stop on your heritage tour across Northern Vietnam. You will retreat to an upscale resort within the Red River Delta that is encompassed by rice fields and expresses the apex of traditionally-inspired, luxurious design. From the tastefully furnished villas to the tree-flanked infinity pool, every aspect of your resort will breathe grandeur. Situated outside of the city district, you will treasure the peaceful serenity and fresh air that blankets this premium resort. The evening will bring with it a remarkable sunset that you may catch a glimpse of while you savor a sumptuous Vietnamese supper of outstanding quality. The culture and history in which Ninh Binh is steeped are delightfully represented at today’s coveted destination of Bai Dinh Temple, which is an immense spiritual complex that you may find familiar if you have seen the latest installment of the Kong movie franchise. Within its intricately crafted walls, you will discover ancient Buddhist art and images that spotlight the sacred heritage that underpins the complex’s construction. You can continue your exploration in Tam Coc, which is a nearby town that forms part of the Trang An Scenic Landscape Complex UNESCO World Heritage Site. Here, you will board a traditional sampan boat and breeze down the calm river that is far removed from the hustle of the city streets.

You will continue through the roof of the cave and stand atop the mountain, looking out over the vast spread of emerald water and the verdant valleys. Before you return home, you will enjoy one last Vietnamese breakfast that will be complete with an array of delicacies that have been prepared at an admired Ninh Binh cafe. You will then fill up in style with scenic vistas before you meet your private transfer to make your way back to Hanoi with plenty of time to catch your plane.
