  "generalInfo": "An exciting safari experience exploring the diversity of the lesser travelled South Eastern African countries. This tour is not for the fainthearted, and requires some patience; the travelling can be slow, some nights the accommodation is basic, however the journey offers amazing scenery and fantastic highlights, well worth the long travel days. We recommend malaria prophylactics. A safari for travellers with a sense of adventure. <br/><br/>DEPARTS: LUSAKA on Saturday at 16:00pm, ENDS: Lilongwe on Sunday at 11:00am.<br/><br/>Highlights<br/>* Lower Zambezi–canoeing<br/>* South Luangwa NP–game walk &amp; 4WD game drives<br/>*Mulanje Massif–tea plantations, hiking<br/>*Liwonde–boat cruise&amp; game drive<br/>*Lake Malawi–snorkelling &amp; island beaches<br/><br/>Overnight- 12 nights on safari we stay at chalets, tented lodges and guest houses, with en suite facilities.3 nights camping–for 1 night we “camp wild” without fences in the wilderness on an island in the Zambezi and 2 nights in a formal campsite in Liwonde.(we will provide tents, mats and chairs, but you will need to bring your own sleeping bag).Meals -15 breakfasts, 14 lunches &amp; 8 dinners are included. Of which,12 breakfasts, 1 lunch and 4 dinners are provided by the lodges. The remaining included meals are prepared by the crew at the vehicle &amp; enjoyed around the campfire. Transport - Due to the sometimes-demanding road conditions you travel in a Safari truck with 12 seats. Potholes, speed bumps (!) &amp; rain-damaged gravel roads are characteristic of the areas we travel through and can make driving slow and bouncy. However, we pass through roadside villages and thus have the opportunity to witness the local lifestyle. For the game drives in South Luangwa we use open-sided 4WD vehicles with local guides. Limited participation - An essential part of your safari is some participation. From carrying your own bag to cleaning your window and packing the truck in the morning–it’s all part of your adventure. For the longer days if everyone puts in a little effort the trip will run smoothly. Where the tour leaders provide meals we ask that clients help (on rotation) with washing up.<br/>",

      "description": "MULANJE MASSIF: We tour one of Malawi’s famous tea plantations in the Thyolo region before making our way to our lodge in Mulanje. Mount Mulanje’s bare rock flanks tower to almost 3002m, dwarfing all that surrounds it, and influencing cloud patterns in the area, making it an important source of rain water at the head of almost every river in this part of southern Malawi. Formed about 130 million years ago, the first European to see the Massif was David Livingstone in 1859, but archaeological investigation reveals evidence of human activity since the Stone Age. We take a day walk on the slopes to see the streams, waterfalls and towering peaks.[lodge BLD ]"
