We stop at the fortress-like Church of St. Augustine in Paoay and move on to Museo Ilocos Norte, housed in the old Tabacalera (tobacco factory) where government-controlled tobacco was stored in the Spanish colonial period. Drive past the Abolition of Tobacco Monopoly Monument at the town plaza and pause briefly at St. William's Cathedral and its Sinking Bell Tower. We will then drive to visit the Malacañang of the North, the former lakeside residence of ex-dictator Ferdinand Marcos and his family when they visited Ilocos Norte, his home province. Later, transfer to the airport for our flight back to Manila (PR 2199 2100/2200) where we will transfer to our hotel on arrival. Overnight at The Bayleaf Intramuros Hotel or similar. (BL)"

Your 13-day itinerary ends at El Nido on Palawan; the 17-day back at Manila.<br/><br/>This is an 18-40s holiday, but not as you know it. Travel with a great group of likeminded people, with a maximum of 22 travellers on each trip, and plenty of solo travellers, too. You’ll be accompanied by an experienced group leader. <br/><br/>Activities include canyoning, hiking, and, of course, lying on the beach (and in some of Busuanga’s hot springs). There are also plenty of snorkelling opportunities, including at Moalboal, home of hundreds of thousands of sardines – swimming and observing them forming an enormous bait ball (whilst keeping your eyes peeled for passing turtles) is an experience to remember. <br/><br/>The crowning glory of this beautiful Philippines island tour is a three-day boat expedition between Coron (Busuanga Island) and El Nido (Palawan Island). All aboard a traditional Banca boat, with its distinctive outriggers. You’ll laze on board during the day, and at night you’ll sleep in traditional Filipino huts in remote locations under the stars. This expedition reaches areas that don’t get many tourists; your stay directly benefits the small communities who live here. <br/><br/>If you stick around for the 17 days you’ll get to explore more of Palawan Island, including Puerto-Princesa Subterranean River National Park, where a river runs underground through bat-filled caves – an adventurous end to a fantastically memorable trip.",

Once known as the 'Pearl of the Orient', Manila was occupied by the Spanish in the 16th century as part of their growing empire. It went on to witness Chinese insurrections, a British occupation, a war against the Spanish and the Americans, and some of the bitterest fighting of World War II. Today, it's one of the most populated cities in the world. For those arriving on time, our tour leader plans to meet you in the hotel reception at 6pm for a welcome meeting, followed by dinner on the roof of a hotel in Intramuros for those who wish to join. There are no other activities planned today, so you're free to arrive in Manila at any time. If you'd like an airport transfer today, you'll need to arrive into Ninoy Aquino International Airport (MNL), which is a one-hour drive from our hotel. If you miss the welcome meeting, our tour leader will catch you up as soon as possible - you can meet them in the hotel lobby on the morning of day 2. If your flight arrives earlier in the day, you might like to visit the National Museum of the Philippines Complex, which houses the Fine Arts Museum, Natural History Museum and Anthropology Museum. It's less than a 20-minute walk from the hotel, and admission is free."
