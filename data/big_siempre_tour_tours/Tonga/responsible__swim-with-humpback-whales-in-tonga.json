  "generalInfo": "Each winter, the spectacular South Pacific Humpback whales migrate to the sparkling clear waters of the idyllic islands of Vava'u, Tonga from the feeding grounds in Antarctica's icy seas to mate and give birth. <br/><br/>Join us for an awe-inspiring opportunity to be in the beautiful crystal clear water with the humpbacks, snorkelling quietly next to mothers, newborn calves and male 'escorts', hearing their beautiful, haunting songs as you gaze into their eyes in the water. <br/>Feel the exchange of trust of a humpback mother as she allows her calf to swim and twirl next to you under water. <br/>The 'heat-runs' are very exciting and really get your adrenalin rushing - these are groups of males in pursuit of a female or fighting for supremacy in the group! <br/><br/>With 5 nights accommodation in one of the best resorts in Vava'u and with 4 days of whale-watching, you will have the time for many of these experiences! We do our best to make sure that your time with us is the best you can possibly have!  <br/><br/>The Tongan Beach Resort is right on edge of a pristine sandy beach, on the edge of the humpback whale nursery. Some days, humpbacks can be seen from the resort!<br/>Each Beachside room is spacious. Double/Single rooms have King beds with an ensuite bathroom and a verandah. Twin rooms have 1 Queen and 1 large single bed and ensuite bathrooms and a verandah water and triple room is 2 bedrooms with 1 x Queen/2 x single beds. All rooms are air-conditioned and have fans.<br/>The Bar and restaurant is right on the beach and just off the beach are some coral 'bombies' inhabited by tropical fish and exquisite corals. <br/>There are kayaks available to the guests.  <br/>Its just a 15 mins taxi ride to town to restaurants, clubs and bars.",
