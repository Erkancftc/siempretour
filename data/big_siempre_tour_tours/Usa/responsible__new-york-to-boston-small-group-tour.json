      "description": "Boston: Welcome to the USA and the start of your East Coast adventure! Spend the morning exploring Boston at your leisure, then meet your Adventure Leader and group in the afternoon at the entrance of HI Boston hostel. Here, you'll get to know your fellow travelers and receive a trip briefing, where you’ll learn about the exciting journey ahead and safety tips for your time in the U.S. Your first adventure kicks off with a walk along Boston’s historic 2.5-mile Freedom Trail, which connects 16 nationally significant landmarks. Along the way, you’ll see sights like Park Street Church, Boston Common (the oldest public park in the U.S.), Faneuil Hall, and the North End, Boston's famous 'Little Italy.' Don't miss the chance to grab a world-renowned cannoli at Mike’s Pastry! Next, we’ll hop on the T (Boston’s subway) to visit Fenway Park, home of the Red Sox. If the team is playing at home, your tour of the park will be swapped for tickets to a live game (this happens about 50% of the time)! The evening is free for you to explore. Stay in the Fenway area for a fun night of vintage bowling or head to a nearby bar for live stand-up comedy. The night is yours!"
