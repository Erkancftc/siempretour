There are several optional tours available, including a thrilling alligator swamp tour, during which you travel north to the town of Slidell to board the swamp boat for two hours, navigating on the West Pearl River and into the Honey Island Swamp. There are over a million alligators in Louisiana, so keep an eye out! You may also see turtles and exotic birds among the cypress trees of the swamp. Your tour leader will be able to help with any reservations you wish to make. There is plenty to do in New Orleans come evening, not least enjoying some of the many live performances that take place nightly. This includes Preservation Hall, where top jazz musicians play every evening to a small audience in an intimate space – be prepared to wait in line. There will also be the chance to step out of the city and explore the wild river swamplands of Louisiana, where you can head out by boat beneath the cypress trees in search of alligators.

A guided tour of the mansion and self-guided tours of the grounds, which includes slave quarters, stables and a carriage house, provide an in-depth understanding of the region's deep-rooted links to slavery. Departing the estate, we follow the river road north to the first established settlement on the Mississippi. Natchez, the original capital of the Mississippi Territory, was at the heart of the trade in enslaved people and is the birthplace of the Mississippi riverboat. There is free time to wander the historic district where there are more than 50 antebellum homes and historic churches. Also worthy of a visit is the Under the Hill area made famous by Mark Twain or discover one of the most interesting cemeteries in the South. Accommodation: Guest House Natchez (or similar)"
