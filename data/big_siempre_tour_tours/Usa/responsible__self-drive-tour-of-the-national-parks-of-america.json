In Utah, Zion National Park is a wonderful place for walking and in Colorado, where this tour begins, you’ll find spectacular mountain ranges, iconic Monument Valley, and the Puebloan Indian houses of Mesa Verde National Park. Wyoming, further north from here, is all about cowboy culture of the Wild West, characterised by never-ending grasslands and tiny Western towns. Over in South Dakota, see the landmark memorials of Crazy Horse and Mount Rushmore, and discover the Native American heritage here. You’ll also spend time in iconic Yellowstone National park, a place of spurting geysers and abundant wildlife. Other highlights include Grand Teton National Park, home to huge peaks, deep lakes and buzzing town of Jackson.<br/>",
