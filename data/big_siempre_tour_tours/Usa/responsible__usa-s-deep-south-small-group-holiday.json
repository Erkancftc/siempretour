      "title": "Join trip in Charlotte",
      "description": ": Our tour starts in Charlotte, the largest city in North Carolina and our gateway to America's Deep South region. For those arriving on time, our Tour Leader plans to meet you in the hotel reception at 6pm for the welcome meeting and for those that wish, there is the chance to go out for dinner. There are no activities planned today, so you're free to arrive at any time. We don't provide arrival transfers on this tour, but information on how to reach the hotel will be provided in your final documentation. Our hotel is situated near the airport, offering ease of access upon your arrival and a comfortable place to rest up before our journey begins. Charlotte is a bustling modern city so if you do arrive early enough, a taxi is the easiest ways to access downtown less than 10 miles away where you could visit one of many great museums such as The Mint Museum or The Harvey B. Gantt Center for African-American Arts + Culture. Alternatively, a ride along the CATS Blue Line Streetcar from downtown can lead you the Noda Arts District. Out here, restaurants like The Goodyear House can make the journey worth the effort with their take on southern staples like shrimp & grits or spare ribs. Our itinerary allows us limited time in the city, if you'd like to see more, we recommend adding an additional night's stay pre-tour. Contact our sales team to book accommodation."

      "title": "Drive to Chimney Rock State Park and walk in the Appalachian Mountains",
      "description": ": After our welcome briefing this morning, we leave Charlotte behind as we head up into the forested hills of North Carolina and into the heart of the Blue Ridge Mountains. We stop off at Chimney Rock State Park, offering panoramic views of Hickory Nut Gorge atop the 535 million year-old monolith rock for which the park is named. We spend a few hours on foot hiking along trails that lead to waterfalls, and which burst into life in late spring and summer with colourful rhododendrons and hydrangeas, whilst a visit in autumn/fall will offer beautiful vistas of burnt orange and reds. The walk will be 2-3 hours in length across undulating terrain, and will cover a distance of approximately 10 kilometres. Please note that due to effects of the storms of 2024 and Hurricane Helene which passed through Asheville and its surrounding areas, we may have to change the exact location of this walk, but there are a variety of great alternatives available throughout this region of Appalachia. We will then continue onto Asheville, arriving in the late afternoon. Asheville boasts a thriving arts community, a vibrant downtown and numerous historic and architectural attractions. You may wish to enjoy some authentic southern cuisine tonight in one of the local restaurants."

      "description": ": This morning has been left free with a variety of options to choose from. You could explore some of Asheville's famous sites, including the Thomas Wolfe Memorial and the Basilica of Saint Lawrence along with a stroll through the River Arts District. It's also possible to visit Biltmore Estate, a southern-style mansion that is the USA's largest privately-owned home. Optional walks in the nearby Blue Ridge Parkway are also available. This afternoon we will take a walking tour between three of Asheville's best craft breweries. Having been previously crowned as 'Beer City USA', Asheville's beer scene consistently ranks within the top five spots in all of the US, with its numerous microbreweries, craft beer houses and friendly bars. We soak up some of this lively atmosphere this afternoon as we take a guided walking tour through town taking in a few of the breweries along the way. The tour samples a variety of styles of beer and shares insight into the craft beer process, as well as taking in some of the local sights along the way. In addition to beer, Asheville is also one of the nation's fastest growing culinary hot spots, so after the tour there's the opportunity to soak up the drink with some hearty food from one of the many establishments here (not included)."

Our drive travels through the heart of the Great Smokey Mountains National Park, an important part of the Appalachian mountain chain which contains a wide diversity of plant and animal life. We arrive into Nashville in the late afternoon, and after some time to freshen up we'll take a short orientation walk of the downtown area and Broadway, the spiritual home of country music with its iconic honky-tonk bars. Here we can experience all that Nashville, the country music capital of the world, has to offer, with plenty of bars offering excellent live music, and you may also want to drink some Jack Daniels whiskey, a proud product of Tennessee."

      "title": "Drive to Memphis, included barbecue lunch and visit to the Civil Rights Museum",
      "description": ": Shifting gears today, we travel from Nashville on to Memphis, one of the cultural heartlands of the Deep South, which is recognised throughout the world for the community's historical contributions to art and culture in the US. In the culinary world, Memphis is well-known for its regional style of barbecue, with BBQ masters across the south competing here in a variety of eateries, each offering their own unique flavour. We'll stop for lunch at one of Memphis' legendary barbecue joints, where we can sample some mouth-watering, finely marinated meats (or portobello mushrooms), which are slow-cooked in pits and smothered in a rich and smoky sauce. This afternoon we visit the Civil Rights Museum, which documents some of the key moments in US history. Housed in the former Lorraine Motel, the location of Martin Luther King's assassination in 1968, the museum depicts the fight for equality from the 17th century right through to the present day, reflecting on pivotal moments like the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the March on Washington which have helped progress the Civil Rights Movement. This evening we can enjoy live music along Memphis' famous Beale Street. Legendary forefathers such as Louis Armstrong, Muddy Waters and B.B. King helped to put Beale Street on the musical map."

      "title": "In Memphis; optional visit to legendary Graceland, Elvis Presley's home",
      "description": ": Today is a free day to uncover how Memphis became the birthplace of Rock 'n Roll. With plenty of historical sites and museums to choose from, one of the most popular options is, of course, a trip to Graceland, the home of 'the King', Elvis Presley. Elvis lived here for 20 years and died at the estate in 1977. Hence Graceland is forever styled in '70s decor. The guided tour takes in all aspects of this opulent mansion, including the Jungle Room which includes an indoor waterfall. It was originally built as a den and was later converted into a recording studio, where Elvis recorded his last two albums. Other options include seeing Memphis by water on a riverboat tour, or a trip to Sun Studios, where singers such as Johnny Cash, Roy Orbison and, of course, Elvis recorded. This evening, there's another opportunity to sample the city's vast culinary array and your Tour Leader can assist you to pick from the many live music venues across the city."

      "title": "Drive along the Blues Highway to Clarksdale, Mississippi. Check out a local juke joint",
      "description": ": Today we travel along Old Highway 61, more commonly referred to as The Blues Highway. Our destination will be Clarksdale, Mississippi at the junction of Highways 61 and 49. Legend has it that it was at these crossroads where Robert Johnson, the godfather of the blues, sold his soul to the Devil. Johnson's music later went on to influence some of the most highly regarded artists and musicians in modern history, from Bob Dylan to Eric Clapton. Known as the birthplace of Delta Blues, Clarksdale is the premier city for the preservation of the arts and music of the Mississippi Delta as we will see with a visit to The Delta Blues Museum. The rest of the afternoon is free, where we can soak up this uniquely American experience of blues culture in one of the 'juke joints' found here, an all but nearly extinct style of music venue that once existed throughout the Mississippi Delta."
