  "generalInfo": "Every year the endless plains of the Serengeti play host to the Great Migration, one of nature’s most unforgettable events. Against the backdrop of some of Africa’s most spectacular landscapes, millions of wildebeest cross the savannah in search of fresh grazing, bringing in their wake an array of equally hungry predators.<br/><br/>Enriching the classic northern Tanzanian safari circuit, we'll combine authentic Maasai exchanges and opportunities to get out of our vehicle and closer to breathtaking nature with safari highlights such as witnessing the Great Migration. Not far from Mount Kilimanjaro, the journey begins in Arusha before making our way through Tarangire National Park and the Ngorongoro Conservation Area on to the vast plains of the famous Serengeti National Park in search of some of the rawest wildlife experiences available. Three full days in the Serengeti National Park is the climax to a journey that includes private bush breakfasts, Maasai hospitality, coffee plantations tours and rainforest hikes, while staying in a range of stylish, sustainable lodges and camps.<br/><br/>Far from your average safari, this is a journey for adventurers wishing to explore these iconic landscapes beyond the established safari tracks, venturing deep into the heart and soul of this wild, untamed land.",

This morning we have a chance to explore something of the nearby crater lake by canoe. Surrounded by dense rainforest, Lake Duluti is home to a number of bird species, as well as impressive monitor lizards often found basking along the shores of the lake. After returning to the lodge for some downtime and lunch, we head out again in the afternoon for a guided walk through the nearby rainforest."

In spite of its vast array of wildlife though, it sits slightly apart from the more popular northern safari circuit, affording us a more authentic and less crowded experience. After an early morning game drive we continue on towards Karatu and the forested slopes of the Ngorongoro Crater, where we break our journey with lunch at the historic sanctuary of Gibb’s Farm. Continuing on to our next lodge, we'll take some time to settle in, before visiting a nearby coffee plantation for a tour this afternoon."

The afternoon has been set aside for optional activities and personal exploration, which might include mountain biking through the nearby villages or simply relaxing and enjoying the breathtaking panoramas from the lodge’s pool.
