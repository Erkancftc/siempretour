    "generalInfo": "This is the ultimate journey: from the deep rumble of elephants in a lush paradise, across plains teeming with life’s relentless pulse, to the quiet strength of the Elephant cow heard in a sunken garden, and finally, into the hopeful embrace of a child’s smile. It is an expedition that changes you, leaving the dust of the plains on your boots and the indelible mark of Africa on your soul.<br/><br/>Then, you step onto the rim of Ngorongoro Crater and gaze into a lost world. This sunken Eden cradles the highest concentration of mammals on Earth. But here, one creature stands as a quiet symbol of resilience: the black rhinoceros. Spotting its prehistoric silhouette is a rare and poignant privilege, a direct encounter with a species fiercely guarded by dedicated rangers against immense odds. Witnessing this ancient survivor is a humbling reminder of our shared duty to protect the fragile threads of existence<br/><br/>Serengeti is not merely a plain; it is a living, breathing stage for the planet’s most profound drama of congregation. During the Great Migration, the horizon itself seems to move, pulsating with the sheer density of life. Over a million wildebeest, a relentless, grunting river of brown, flow alongside hundreds of thousands of striped zebra, their patterns creating a dizzying mosaic of movement. This staggering population is a raw, unfiltered spectacle of survival, of predator and prey playing out an ancient dance on grasslands that stretch to the very edge of the world.<br/><br/>",

The road leads west, then south-west, skirting around the Monduli Mountains before crossing the eastern branch of the Great Rift Valley to the north of Lake Manyara. The road then climbs over the western ridge of the Rift Valley and ascends to the elevated Ngorongoro region. Approximate journey time 4 hours, depending on the exact start and end points. Route details and journey times may vary depending on road conditions. Discover the Ngorongoro Conservation Area. Initially incorporated into the Serengeti National Park, the Area is not a National Park. It was founded in 1959, following a conflict between the National Parks and the Maasai, as a nature reserve to protect a unique wildlife but also as a haven for the Maasai. Its name comes from the warriors of the tribe once living in the crater: the Likorongoros (which was distorted to Ngorongoro by the German colonists). The Ngorongoro Conservation Area covers approximately 8288 km2, 890 km2 of which is montane forest covering part of the crater wall. Ngorongoro offers a wide range of habitats: wetlands, grasslands, forests, streams and savannas ... The crater itself covers about 260 km2. A World Heritage Site, it is in fact a caldera, caused by the collapse of a massive volcano nearly 2.5 million years ago. During the descent into the crater you will enjoy a spectacularly panoramic view of the interior of the crater. Even from the top of the crater wall you'll notice the first large herds as dark spots on the landscape. The crater boasts the largest animal density in Africa with some 20 000 animals including around 55 species of mammals, ostriches, Kori bustards, dwarf flamingos, crowned cranes, zebras, gazelles, warthogs, wildebeest, hartebeest ... all are present. Eland, jackal, black rhino and some servals are also among the principal inhabitants. The Ngorongoro Crater is further home to many predators such as hyenas, lions and leopards. Cheetahs, giraffes, hartebeest and impala, however are missing. Visit a Masai Village in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area. The Masai arrived in this region approximately 200 years ago and today there are over 42 000 tribal people living in Ngorongoro alongside their cattle, donkeys, goats and sheep. They have the right to roam freely through the area and during the rainy season they move to the open plains while in the dry season they set up their homesteads in the adjacent bushland and mountain slopes. The Masai continue to follow a traditional way of life that includes living in harmony with nature and animals and their livestock can sometimes be seen grazing alongside wildlife on the open plains. Their homesteads are arranged in bomas, where huts are clustered in a circular shape and surrounded by thorn tree branches for protection, and during your visit you can learn more about their culture and lifestyle.

        "description": "Ngorongoro Crater - Serengeti National Park- Set off on a 4x4 morning game drive as the sun sparkles on the lush plains of the Ngorongoro Conservation Area. This pristine and protected region is simply stunning in the morning as the freshness of a new day brings life to the Ngorongoro Crater, and the immense plethora of animals that take shelter there begin to stir and graze. Within the crater itself there are over 25 000 large animal species and herbivores such as zebra, eland and Grant’s and Thompson’s gazelle can be found in huge herds. The area is also rife with buffalo while elephant and reedbuck roam higher up near the rim of the crater. Bird varieties are extensive and your guide will point out the many varieties that you will come across during your morning game drive while white pelican and greater and lesser flamingo can be admired on Lake Magadi within the crater. Drive from Ngorongoro to the Serengeti. The road leads north-west. Leaving behind the fertile highlands area with its coffee and tea plantations it passes into the open planes of the Serengeti where Masai pastoralists co-exist with the African wildlife. Approximate journey time 3 to 5 hours, depending on the exact start and end points. Route details and journey times may vary depending on road conditions. Discover the Serengeti National Park. Created in 1951, the Serengeti (from Siringet, meaning \"endless plain\" in maa, the language of the Maasai) is one of the largest parks in Africa. Covering an area of 14,800 km2, it abuts the Ngorongoro to the east and the Masai Mara (Kenya) to the north. This is a magical place both for the beauty and diversity of the landscapes (plains, acacia savannah, hills, large forested areas) and for the variety of animals. The Serengeti National Park is home to a considerable wildlife population in all seasons: gazelles, antelopes, giraffes, buffalos, zebras, jackals, warthogs, monkeys ... all are gathered here. Elephants, hippos, crocodiles are also among the main residents of the park. Over 500 species of birds have been identified including ostriches, bustards and secretary birds. The park is also famous for its many predators: more than a thousand lions, hundreds of cheetahs, many hyenas and some leopards have been recorded. If the lions are more visible near the rivers (especially near the Seronera River), cheetahs and hyenas are more at home in the plains. Unleash your wild side on an afternoon 4x4 safari in the Seronera region of the Serengeti National Park. This area of the Serengeti offers a fantastic abundance of game viewing where it is not difficult to find all of the Big Five on one game drive and waterholes attract animals like magnets. Lion, giraffe and antelope roam freely across the open savannahs, while rhino stay close to the safety of the forest bush, and leopard and cheetah can be caught napping in the branches of acacia trees. As your game drive moves into the early hours of the evening, these predators begin to stalk the plains and large mammals such as buffalo take shelter in riverine vegetation. Fulfil your African safari dreams on the plains of the immense Serengeti while watching vultures feast off carcass remains and beautiful crowned cranes moving regally through the grasslands.

Approximate journey time 5 hours, depending on the exact start and end points. Route details and journey times may vary depending on road conditions. Discover Lake Manyara National Park. Set between the cliffs of the Rift Valley and the alkaline lake of the same name, Lake Manyara National Park covers some 320 km2. Its name derives from the Maasai word \"emanyara\", the name of a plant growing all around the lake and used by the local people to protect their homesteads. Dominated by the Rift Valley escarpment, Lake Manyara National Park presents a diverse flora. Thus, whereas the north is dominated by dense tropical vegetation (giant mahogany, wild palms), vegetation in the south becomes sparser before giving way to grassland and swamps near the lake. Covering an area of about 50 km2, this lake is a favorite with flamingos and waders. Some 350 species of birds have been identified including thousands of Egyptian geese. The park also offers all kinds of wildlife: giraffes, buffalos, zebras, baboons, monkeys or elephants, all are present. If you are lucky you might even spot lions in the trees. Perched in the acacias to better see their prey, the park is famous for these tree climbing lions. Track down tree-climbing lions on an afternoon 4x4 safari in Lake Manyara National Park in your tour vehicle. Small, yet filled with splendour, this park is a delight to explore, consisting of 11 different ecosystems that support one of the highest biomass densities of large mammals in the world. Among them are Lake Manyara’s famous tree-climbing lions, and although you may see lions in trees in other parks, it is a real speciality in Manyara. It is believed that the lions developed this habit in order to avoid pesky biting flies, but whatever the reason it is a unique sight to behold as well as a likely one on your afternoon game drive as these late-night predators take to trees for an afternoon nap. Traverse through the savannahs, marshes and evergreen forests as you seek out elephant, hippo, giraffe, buffalo, zebra, wildebeest and so much more. Overnight at Manyara. Meals Full Board"

Old hunting grounds declared a National Park in 1970, Tarangire is the sixth largest park in the country. Its name comes from the Tarangire River, which runs through the park from south to north. Covering an area of 2600 km2, Tarangire has an amazing diversity of plants (sausage trees, acacias tortelli ) but is best known for the huge baobab trees dotting its rocky slopes. The park also offers a very diverse fauna. Many birds have been identified including lapwings, African hoopoe, kingfishers, ostriches, Kori bustards, secretary birds, vultures and marabou storks. The savannah of the Tarangire National Park is also home to many animals. Thus, although the park is best known for hosting one of the largest concentrations of African elephants, it also houses many other residents. Impala, waterbuck croissant, buffalo, hartebeest, Cape eland, kudu and hyraxes live there. Lions, leopards and cheetahs are also present but are harder to see because of the tall grass.

    "generalInfo": "Tanzania is a theater of raw, unscripted drama for the wildlife photographer. It’s the tension before a river crossing, a million hooves churning dust into gold. It’s the intimate moment of elephants communing by a Tarangire river, their ancient eyes holding galaxies of wisdom. It’s the explosive chase on the Serengeti plains, where survival is measured in heartbeats. Within Ngorongoro’s crater walls, life is condensed into a breathtaking frame—predator and prey on a stage millions of years old. This is photography that captures the wild’s unyielding pulse, its brutal beauty, and its timeless soul.<br/><br/>Your journey begins where the giants walk. In Tarangire National Park, you don’t just see elephants—you are immersed in their world. This is home to the highest elephant population density in Tanzania, where monumental herds move with ancient, seismic grace through a landscape of surreal beauty. The air is filled with their deep, resonant rumbles and the dazzling chorus of over 550 species of amazing birdlife. All of this unfolds beneath the watchful gaze of ancient, colossal baobab trees, their silhouettes painting a scene of timeless, scenic grandeur against the vast African sky.<br/><br/>From the baobab-dotted plains, you ascend to the roof of the world and peer into Ngorongoro Crater. This is not a view; it’s a vision. The scenic majesty of this unbroken caldera, a self-contained Eden, takes your breath away. Within its walls thrives the world’s densest concentration of larger mammals, a breathtaking micro-kingdom. Here, your search turns to one of Earth’s rarest sights: the critically endangered black rhinoceros. Witnessing this prehistoric survivor is a testament to fierce, ongoing preservation, a profound encounter with conservation in action.<br/><br/>Then, the horizon expands infinitely. The Central Serengeti reveals itself as the vibrant microcosm of the entire Serengeti ecosystem. This is the stage for the eternal drama of predator and prey, where lion prides reign over rocky kopjes and cheetahs survey the golden grasses. It is the enduring, year-round heart of the wild.<br/><br/>Finally, the journey culminates in the Northern Serengeti. In the dry season, this rugged, remote land transforms into the ultimate great migration refuge. Witness the Mara River’s dramatic, churning crossings, where thunderous herds of wildebeest and zebra brave crocodile-infested waters in a desperate, thrilling push for survival. It is raw, unfiltered nature at its most powerful and poignant.<br/><br/>This curated safari is a passage through the definitive icons of Africa—from elephant kingdoms and sunken Edens to the eternal plains and the river of life itself. It is the greatest wildlife sequence on Earth, experienced in its full, majestic spectrum.",

After lunch, we will continue with a game drive until 12 before driving out of the crater to get back to the camp. Sighting of rhinos in the dry season is quite challenging because their favourite pasture is dry and short; usually, the rainy season is the best time to see them as they wander more widely because of abundant food almost everywhere.

    "generalInfo": "This Tanzania safari and beach holiday is the perfect package of game watching and coastal paradise. After arriving in Dar es Salaam, you will take a light aircraft south to the Selous Game Reserve. Although the Selous doesn’t have the worldwide reputation of the Serengeti, it is even larger at 45,000 square kilometres with wonderful wildlife populations, yet far fewer visitors.<br/><br/>You will spend several days in the Selous, with three days of game viewing activities choosing between game drives, boat safaris and walking safaris. The reserve is home to elephant, buffalo and antelope, as well as lion, leopard, wild dog and zebra. Hippo, crocodile and a stunning array of birdlife call the waterways of the Selous home, and the lagoons are where you will get to see the skeletal leadwood trees poised beautifully. The photographic opportunities here are second to none.<br/><br/>You will be staying at a safari camp located on the Rufiji River. The rooms have traditional canvas siding but are set on raised platforms with thatched roofs. They are semi-permanent structures, with ensuite facilities and a shaded veranda looking out at the river. You can also opt for  a deluxe tent, which have private plunge pools overlooking the river. There is a communal pool area for guests, also shaded, so a perfect place to rest in the heat of the midday sun.<br/><br/>Boutique hotel in Zanzibar<br/><br/>You will take a light aircraft flight out to the Tanzanian island of Zanzibar on day six of this itinerary, although as this is tailor made we can of course tweak it to suit your preferences. Zanzibar is an idyllic island in the Indian Ocean that boasts an eclectic mix of cultures as well as stunning beaches. Our choice of accommodation for your holiday is Breezes Beach Club, on the island’s southeast coast. This is one of the island’s best beaches. <br/><br/>The resort itself has been designed with great care and style, using a mix of Swahili, Arabic and Indian influences all of which claim heritage on the island. Breezes has a choice of bars and restaurants, a large swimming pool and a magnificient white sand beach with palm trees, the lapping sea and plenty of sunbeds. The rooms have all of the mod cons including air conditioning and ensuite facilities. Both accommodations on this holiday work closely with the community.

You could also explore another area of Zanzibar, the enchanting Jozani Forest in the south of the island.

Each offers something unique. Tarangire National Park delivers a Big Five safari with varied landscapes, diverse bird species, and relatively few visitors.<br/><br/>The Ngorongoro Crater is the busiest of the three destinations in this itinerary, but with expert guides, you’ll descend into the crater early in the morning, before the crowds arrive, and have the opportunity to enjoy other activities such as hiking and authentic cultural experiences with the local Maasai community.<br/><br/>Finally, Rubondo Island National Park, which is perhaps the most unique of the three. This small island within vast Lake Victoria is almost entirely covered by pristine forest. It is home to just one camp; the only other human inhabitants are researchers studying the island’s habituated chimpanzees. Guests can enjoy game drives, birdwatching, boat safaris, catch-and-release fishing, and even join rangers on chimpanzee treks.<br/><br/>Throughout the journey, you’ll stay in luxurious lodges, each set in a prime location to maximise your game-viewing opportunities and offer breathtaking views across the wilderness.",

    "generalInfo": "Discover Tanzania’s wildest, most off the beaten track areas, with this Selous safari and Mafia Islands diving holiday. It’s a perfectly paced mix of wildlife spotting and island relaxation, with four nights in Selous Game Reserve in the south of the country, followed by six nights on the Mafia Archipelago, where remote sandy beaches are perfect for relaxation and the clear seas are a diver’s paradise. <br/><br/>Selous is Africa’s largest game park, just a 40 minute flight from Dar es Salaam. It’s home to huge populations of buffalo and lion, and is one of the few places in Africa where you have a good chance of spotting rare wild dogs. In addition, you’ll come across masses of wildebeest, zebra and impala, and it’s possible to see herds of 50 or more giraffe drinking from lakes during the hottest part of the day.<br/>As well as game drives in the morning and evening, there’s the option to take a walking safari and boat trip on the Rufiji River and lakes. You’ll be accompanied by an expert wildlife guide and you have the freedom to choose what you’d like to do each day – they are all included in the price.<br/><br/>After your safari, take a short 40 minute flight to the remote and almost unknown Mafia Islands in the Indian Ocean. The islands are covered in rainforest and grasslands, with tiny villages dotted here and there, and barrier reefs out to sea. A large part of Mafia Island itself is a protected Marine Park and you can explore its biodiversity by snorkelling and scuba diving, through coastal forest walks and bird watching. Learn about Swahili village life and traditional culture, too, by visiting its villages.<br/><br/>The best time do this itinerary is mid June to late October. This is the dry season, game viewing is good and the climate is comfortable. <br/>",

The great diversity of Serengeti wildlife is evident here—look for buffalo, hippopotamus, elephant, giraffe, antelope, Thompson’s and Grant’s gazelle, and lions. If you are there during the spectacular wildebeest migration, you will be more than astonished. In the late afternoon we venture out in another game drive. Everywhere there are animals, monkeys and, yes, birds…but look closely and you will be thrilled to see the huge jungle cats—lion, leopard and cheetah—watching the world go by. And go by it does. Rhino, gazelle, antelope and massive elephants by the hundreds. Animals in the trees, flying, camouflaged in the bush, in rivers and in streams. This is the adventure of a lifetime!

Be prepared for some remarkable views down into the crater. The caldera of Ngorongoro marks the ancient walls of a collapsed volcano, which was probably once the size of Mt. Kilimanjaro. Nowadays, the completely enclosed circular crater is some twelve miles across, with steep walls of over 2,000 feet. We are at an altitude of approximately 7,500 feet above sea level, the highest point on our trip. After our time on the lower plains, the cooler air here is refreshing. During the afternoon, enjoy a short nature walk to learn more about the local fauna, or just stay at the lodge/camp to admire the view.

The lovely crested crane (similar to a peacock) can be found in great profusion here and maybe you'll spot a bat-eared fox. The balance of predator and prey in this extraordinary ecosystem is so precise that animals seldom leave. Our exact route is decided on the spot by our expert safari guides, depending on where the animals are. An insider's tip: bring plenty of film-you may never take better wildlife photos anywhere else. Ngorongoro Crater is said to be one of the natural wonders of the world. A spectacular game haunt, the 102-square-mile crater is a perfect caldera, one of the largest on earth. Millions of years ago a smouldering volcano collapsed, creating the crater and as a consequence, thousands of animals amidst its many types of vegetation have grown here over the centuries. Over 30,000 animals live here: prides of lion, elephant, leopard, cheetah, giraffe, gazelle by the thousands, and multitudes of wildebeest. Uniquely beautiful, we will never see anything like it again! We spend a memorable morning exploring the crater's breadth and depth and returning to the lodge/camp for a late lunch. Enjoy the afternoon at leisure. The views from our lodge/camp are outstanding and there are various outlooks from which you can survey the crater. Tonight, as we delight in another delicious meal at this exceptional lodge/camp, we are once again stunned by the beauty of the orange sunset that hovers in the wild African sky, signalling the end to another unforgettable day on safari.

The park varies from rolling grassy plains to open woodlands and rocky outcrops cut by the Rufiji River – the lifeblood of the park, whose tributaries form a network of lakes, lagoons and channels that offer a superb method of game viewing especially during the dry season (from June to October).  Selous hosts Tanzania’s greatest population of elephants as well as being one of the few areas you can see  African wild dogs.  You will  also get the opportunity to explore Ruaha National Park which  derives its name from the Great Ruaha River that flows through the Rift Valley on the eastern part of the Park creating spectacular gorges.   Finally visiting  Mikumi National park, the 4th largest in Tanzania and a great spot for big game viewing as well as bird watching.  <br/>Exploring on foot, by boat and by 4WD and sleeping in tents you will get a true appreciation of the best Southern Tanzania has to offer.  <br/><br/>Selous Game Reserve<br/>Selous Game Reserve, Africa’s largest protected area uninhabited by man, offers the lucky few visitors an experience in absolutely wild and unspoiled bush.

Ruaha National Park has a varied and fascinating terrain with wild fig trees, rare baobab forests and gorges of glowing orange sandstone. Compared with Selous, here you won’t find big grassy plains nor lakes (so you won’t be able to do safaris by boat). The Great Ruaha River contain swirling rapids and deep pools crowded by dozens of crocodiles and hippos fighting each other. Ruaha is a good place to spot predators. In fact, apart from lions, jackals and hyenas, we saw a group of wild dogs hunting.<br/><br/>Private Tailor made trip available from June-November and a Group Departure in October",

The park varies from rolling grassy plains to open woodlands and rocky outcrops cut by the Rufiji River – the lifeblood of the park, whose tributaries form a network of lakes, lagoons and channels that offer a superb method of game viewing especially during the dry season (from June to October).  Selous hosts Tanzania’s greatest population of elephants as well as being one of the few areas you can see  African wild dogs.  You will  also get the opportunity to explore Ruaha National Park which  derives its name from the Great Ruaha River that flows through the Rift Valley on the eastern part of the Park creating spectacular gorges.   Finally visiting  Mikumi National park, the 4th largest in Tanzania and a great spot for big game viewing as well as bird watching.  <br/>Exploring on foot, by boat and by 4WD and sleeping in tents you will get a true appreciation of the best Southern Tanzania has to offer.  <br/><br/>Selous Game Reserve<br/>Selous Game Reserve, Africa’s largest protected area uninhabited by man, offers the lucky few visitors an experience in absolutely wild and unspoiled bush. The park varies from rolling grassy plains to open woodlands and rocky outcrops cut by the Rufiji River – the lifeblood of the park, whose tributaries form a network of lakes, lagoons and channels that offer a superb method of game viewing especially during the dry season (from June to October). Selous hosts Tanzania’s greatest population of elephants. <br/><br/><br/>Ruaha National Park<br/>Due to its’ distance from any major city, very few tourists visit this park. Ruaha National Park has a varied and fascinating terrain with wild fig trees, rare baobab forests and gorges of glowing orange sandstone. Compared with Selous, here you won’t find big grassy plains nor lakes (so you won’t be able to do safaris by boat). The Great Ruaha River contain swirling rapids and deep pools crowded by dozens of crocodiles and hippos fighting each other. Ruaha is a good place to spot predators. In fact, apart from lions, jackals and hyenas, we saw a group of wild dogs hunting.<br/><br/>Private Tailor made trip available from June-November",

Amongst its lonely plains, sweeping sand rivers and swathes of woodland, elephants occur in large herds.  There are an abundance of predators: lions, leopard, hunting dog, hyena.  And great crocodiles in the Ruaha river, the Park’s lifeblood.  It’s also fantastic walking and driving country for the guides, who have the freedom of these vast, diverse tracts of land.<br/><br/>The Selous Game Reserve is popular with wildlife connoisseurs – for its remoteness, and being situated within the largest game reserve in Africa.  The Rufiji River is its life force – full of hippos and crocodiles … the eleven million acres of bush, woodland, hills and grassland a diverse eco system.  To be in the Selous is to suddenly walk onto a hidden riverbank, and see the flash of a leopard leaping the rocks on the opposite bank, to watch from a treetop hide as a herd of elephant silently crosses a waterhole, and to come upon a pack of African hunting dogs alone on their kill as you round a curve in the river.

The scenery is spectacular as we travel around the rim of the Ngorongoro Crater and transit through the Ngorongoro Conservation Area. We'll pass several Masai homesteads before arriving at Olduvai Gorge, where in 1959, anthropologists Dr and Mrs Leakey discovered the remains of an almost intact human skull named 'Nutcracker Man'. It was this, together with other discoveries, that contributed to the further understanding of early human development. Olduvai Gorge and the fossils that it contains give a unique insight into the role this part of the world played in human evolution. We'll have a packed lunch in the courtyard of the Olduvai Gorge visitor centre, before walking around the museum. A local guide will then talk us through the ages of the gorge while we look out over the valley below. Later today, we'll enter the Serengeti at Naabi Hill Gate. Serengeti is a Masai name that means the 'endless grass plains' and it's through these plains interspersed with granite outcrops that we'll travel to our lodge. Once in the Serengeti, we'll move slowly through the park, keeping a close eye out for game as we head to the central Seronera area. We'll have a warm welcome at our Serengeti camp as we settle in to our canvas tents, surrounded by the sounds of nature."

The crater provides a unique wildlife spotting experience and is home to the Big Five. Among the animals to watch out for are elephants, lions, cheetahs, buffalo and rhinos. The perennial marshes also teem with birdlife. The crater itself, technically classed as a caldera, owes its existence to the violent fracturing of the Rift Valley over 15 million years. At one time a volcano occupied this spot that then became extinct and collapsed into the empty magma chamber beneath it leaving only the gigantic natural basin which is now considered a veritable 'Garden of Eden'. After our half-day game drive in the crater today, we'll return to the farmhouse in time for lunch and the afternoon will be at leisure to relax after our early start."

Tarangire has the greatest concentration of wildlife outside of the Serengeti ecosystem and is part of a larger ecosystem that extends further south into the Masai steppes. The permanent water sources in the park result in Tarangire being home to the largest elephant populations in Tanzania, where during the dry season over 300 elephants can be seen digging for water in the riverbeds. The park is also home to the shy fringed-eared oryx and the gerenuk antelope that are not seen in other parks. We'll head out for an afternoon game drive, before travelling to our camp.

In order to develop our unrivalled range of combined wildlife watching holidays, our guides and colleagues around the world have spent years searching out the world’s best wildlife watching locations as well as visiting some seldom visited areas. This dedication has led us to create this comprehensive safari which visits nearly all of the important wildlife watching locations within Tanzania. <br/><br/>By visiting both the wonderful and world famous Serengeti plains and the largely enclosed Ngorogoro Crater this safari holiday of Tanzania visits the range of locations and offers the levels of diversity that you can see on this trip. <br/><br/>All of our tours are guided by our own professional zoologist (where available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) so you are sure to be in the best hands possible for the best sightings as well as a great network of local guides in East Africa who have developed a great range of wildlife watching locations where the rarest species are commonly seen. Also to try and make sure that we will see as many of the wildlife that Tanzania has to offer, including Lions, Rhinos, Elephants, Leopards, Cheetah and many more. On this trip we will spend many hours during the early morning and late afternoon on jeep safaris and also after dark each night (where possible) we will head out with high powered spotlights and start the search for nocturnal species. <br/><br/>One of the reasons why our wildlife watching holidays are unique is that our background (as a company) is from a scientific and zoological standpoint and so have a great network of colleagues and contacts all over the world who are the people on the front line in search of the best new locations for wildlife watching. All of these reasons and many more make us experts in arranging safaris and are able to tailor a safari to any location to try to find your targeted species. All you have to do is to get in touch with your budget and your group size and where you would like to go to try and find rare and elusive species.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner (where mentioned in the itinerary)). There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers and open top 4x4 vehicles for all safaris. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) will escort you on all your excursions and also very knowledgeable English speaking local guides who have decades of experience working and guiding throughout Eastern Africa. Your zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) escort is an expert in mammal biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge of where some of the most elusive African animals are; as well as having years of experience in bringing people out to see Africa’s big five and its hundreds of other species safely. We also include all vehicle safaris, guided walks, spotlighting drives, cultural performances, cultural activities, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the African bush or some other wildlife watching activity. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour.<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>We recommend August as a great time for this trip as the wildlife is abundant at this time of year and the weather is not too hot and drier than other times of year. But we can run the trip at other times of year; just note that the price quoted here is based on the low season, we can and do run this tour at other times of year, the wildebeest migration can also be included, please ask for specific quotes for different times of the year.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>•\tAll of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by a zoologist (where available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) as well as local naturalist guides, drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge. <br/>•\tWe can offer you spotlighting trips after dark, where this is possible with local constraints and permissions.<br/>•\tWe can also bring thermal imaging and night vision equipment as well as spotting scopes (on request) to also aid in finding the nocturnal mammals after dark and scan the horizon for harder to see species.<br/>•\tWe use camera traps (where available) which will increase the chances of getting close up pictures and movies of rare animals and other rare nocturnal wildlife.<br/>•\tExplore a huge ranger of ecosystems and protected areas across two of the world's greatest wildlife watching destinations.<br/>•\tImmerse yourself into the wonderful life of the local Masaai people and see how their famous coloured beads are made and also see how they and their cattle interact and live alongside the wildlife of the African plains and valleys.<br/>•\tAll the above reasons give this East African safari holiday a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. <br/>•\tWe have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Eastern Africa so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the Big Five, gorillas, chimpanzees and hundreds of other species throughout Eastern Africa.

Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>•\tUnlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour travels to both the Serengeti and Ngorogoro Crater in Tanzania during this short but comprehensive wildlife watching safari.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The majority of wildlife watching is all done from the 4x4 safari vehicle so any fitness level can participate. There are very few walks involved and all do not require any special physical fitness.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 Years Old.",

Once on the ground, you will begin your Tanzanian safari trip with a game drive. The Serengeti is one of the world’s best known wildlife reserves due to its high volume of animals and its being home to one of the best known lions to ever have been conjured: Simba , from the “The Lion King.” The warm afternoon smells of dry grass and soft earth. Traverse the grounds with your well-informed guide, who will point out the varieties of wildlife that linger in the bush. Keep your eyes open for that herd of elephants wandering along the horizon. Their large, gray forms loom large on the horizon and larger still when close to the vehicle. Their tusks droop and point, reflecting the sunlight with a slight sparkle. Stray leaves sometimes dangle from their tusks as if the elephant is saving some foliage for later. They stand tall in the cooling sky as the sun fades over the horizon. The elephants become a shadow in the coming darkness, before fading away in search of a watering hole."

        "description": "As the lush green grass of the Serengeti begins to fade to a dry gold, the wildebeest move between the vast flatlands of the Serengeti and the continuous green of various areas of Kenya in what is called “The Great Migration.” Rise and shine in the depths of wildlife, within the heart of the Serengeti, where the sound of birdcalls in the sunrise is enough to remind you that the world around your campsite is open and inviting. It is the same world that beckons you to explore, calling you to rouse yourself from bed, enjoy the soothing warmth of your morning coffee, and dive back into your vehicle after breakfast to see more. Along either side of the vehicle you can see the limitless plain inhabited by the likes of millions of wildebeest stretching as far as the eye can see. Some linger along the roadway, grazing on the fading grass, staring at you as you watch their beady eyes and long horns, thin legs and long bearded chins dip to the earth and tear the grass from the drying terrain. Their bodies are made to migrate, able to run for long periods of time, their legs thin but strong allowing them the jump blockades like fallen trees or large riverbanks. The wildebeest travel in a line, the sound of clopping hoofs almost deafening. As they run, dust jumps into the air. Their guttural cry mixes into the cacophony. The bright stripes of zebras can be seen mingled into the gray crowd of wildebeest. You pull out your binoculars, stretch your eyes to the horizon, and search for the end of the gray mass, but you can’t see one. The wildebeest seem just as endless as the Serengeti, and you are in the middle of them, in the middle of the vast golden ocean of the plain with no end in sight."

        "description": "Begin your day with a delicious and hardy breakfast before embarking on a morning game drive. The open space of your campsite, along with the welcoming water tanks, is often an inviting proposition for local elephants; after all, an elephant never forgets. On this morning you may wake up to one of the few extraordinary scenes of the large, gray mass of an elephant dipping its long trunk into the water tank in the cool of the morning. The trunk lifts and contorts, sucking up the water and spraying it into the elephant’s mouth and over its body. Delight in your morning meal, watch the elephant drink, bathe, and wander back into the wild before you follow its lead and depart the camp. The early morning visit from the elephant is never enough when the Serengeti is your morning playground. Search through the tall grass for the white tips of Jackal tails, listening for their high-pitched yip. They resemble a medium sized fox and are most often seen in pairs, for they mate for life. Wave goodbye to the golden plains of the Serengeti as you end your morning game drive. Make your way to Olduvai Gorge. The afternoon sun warms the world giving the area the aroma of freshly baked clay. Just like the air, the rim of the gorge resembles clay, its rim a rusty red from the oxidized sand that shimmers in the sunlight. The layered colors of the gorge rim, along with the large monolith in the gorge’s center, showcases the evolution of the topography, having been carved out by two rivers cutting through the rough terrain. Here you will visit the oldest fossils of human life to ever have been found. These fossils gave the scientific world reason to believe that mankind originated in Africa before sprawling to other continents. The museum offers many other fossils and exhibits as well, from the animals that graced the area, prospective life of ancient mankind, to what the gorge may have looked like before it was carved by Mother Nature. Once you have filled your mind with information, and your belly with lunch, continue on your way to the Ngorongoro Crater’s rim. The scent of fresh grass lifts into the cool breeze of sunset. The gentle wind rustles the trees. And even in the crimson light of the setting sun you can see down into the crater watching the distant color of Lake Makat glitter."

        "description": "The morning mist that continuously keeps the crater fresh and green fades in the morning light. The sun peaks through the gray bringing in a welcome and satisfying warmth. The crater is 25 meters across and brimming with wildlife. The grass beams in the sunlight; specks of dew sparkle in the bright light of the morning. The grass remains green year round keeping the grazers happy and the need to migrate at bay. The predators remain plump and content because of the dependable herbivore population. Once deep inside the crater, you will be able to see the exceptional wildlife up close and active. Clans of hyena wander through the green field. Their necks extend and their heads hang low. Their ragged fur is speckled a dark brown. The females grow larger than the males and tend to be more dominant. The hyenas’ cackle can be heard in the distance when the air is still, as they call to one another. Watch them pass along the road in search of an easy hunt, being very opportunistic predators, or an easy meal, being known to mostly scavenge. The lush vegetation of the crater extends out and up to the crater’s rim as you follow the colors and exit Ngorongoro Crater knowing that what you have witnessed is unparalleled, unable to be traded for anything in the world, unable to have a price placed upon it. Continue your journey from the crater to the Mto wa Mbu village market. Here you will find a variety of goods that you can dawdle over in search souvenirs or a taste of the local customs and environment. The rich blues, reds, and greens stand against one another in a collage of Maasai clothing displayed to catch your eye. Plantains grow as large as a wildebeest’s head, their vibrant green just as awe-inspiring. A mixture of newly carved wood and freshly picked fruit fills the market area. Woodcarvings are presented based upon size, and can be made or modified to your liking. The most popular being carvings of the Big Five: elephants, rhino, leopard, lion, and buffalo. Wander around the Mto wa Mbu market, watch the distinct colors of the fresh fruit glow in the deepening sunlight, explore the various souvenirs, and get a taste of the local shopping customs as vendors tell you, “looking is free” and are always ready for, and expecting, a negotiation."

After breakfast you will head out to explore the depths of Lake Manyara National Park. The orange and gold sky fills the distance until you see Lake Manyara no longer reflecting the gold of the sun but shining bright pink in the morning air. Known for its birdlife, flamingos are exceptionally prevalent at the lake, and they shine as bright as the sun along its shore, if the sun were indeed pink. Their necks tangle and twist amongst one another, their sharp, black beaks dip into the clear water and dig for fish. As you drive along, bumping through the track roads, pay attention to the trees for Lake Manyara is also known for its tree-climbing lions. Lazing comfortably among the branches, their golden fur stands out against the deep bark, their tails dangling down and swishing in the cool air of the shade. The lions climb the trees to better see the terrain, searching for signs of prey that would be invisible to them in the high brush of certain areas. Between the tree-dwelling lions and the flock of flamingos, there is a collection of color and movement that swirls through and around Lake Manyara."

The Great Rift Valley does stretch from the Jordan Valley all the way down to the Mozambique and this is where you find yourself standing, looking down on Tanzania’s lowland. The rim of the rift extends into the distance looking similar to a mountain range. Today you will have the opportunity to explore the culture of Tanzania on a walking safari through villages that remain connected to their culture through current practices and a determination to keep their history alive amongst the constant push of the modern world. From woodcarving to fishing, the region is full of a mixture of historic tradition and current economic practices, including plans for a geothermal power generator. Many of the people that reside in the Great Rift Valley are Maasai, known for their migratory nature. They remain traditional in their dress, in their customs of cattle and goat herding, and their traditions of being large-familial, patriarchal polygamists. They are incredibly friendly and inviting to those curious about the Maasai culture and desiring to learn more. The children shout in excitement, crowd around you and guide you to their boma , the surrounding gate of their village. Stay a moment and hear the children sing with joviality. The goats bleat, the cows moo and you have experienced another treasure of Tanzania: its local people."

Leopard tortoise meander across the grass, their shells a rich yellow decorated with dark spots and swirls, resembling the coat of a leopard. Starlings sing in the trees, their blue feathers iridescent in the sunlight. The quieter beauty of the Great Rift Valley and of Tanzania is shown as you slow down for a moment and pay attention to what you may have once sped past. Try to slow down time as much as possible to linger in your final moments in the Tanzanian wild. Eventually time will speed up once again, your last day exploring Africa coming to an end.

Admire the manes that flow in the breeze then continue the game drive, to another more active pride. The lionesses are on the move, crawling through the grass and approaching a herd of Thomson’s gazelle. Follow them, admiring the stealthy hunter and watching the apprehension cast across the antelopes’ eyes. Later on the game drive, you find their rivals, a cackle of spotted hyenas that are as effective hunting as they scavenging. Game drives here always encounter the predators and you’ll be getting used to seeing the cats hunting over these 12 days. Grumeti is the longest standing and most recognizable of Tanzania’s private concessions. Bordering the west of Serengeti National Park, it’s along the great wildebeest migration route and dissected by the Grumeti River. This is the Serengeti’s Western Corridor and the abundance of resident predators is astonishing. Only three luxury lodges operate in this huge reserve, creating an almost unrivaled exclusivity. On today’s morning and afternoon game drives, it’s extremely rare to come across another vehicle as only guests at the lodges are permitted to explore this area.

        "description": "National parks and private concessions have very different rules. Conservation is the primary focus of both. Higher numbers of visitors to a national park mean the authorities must be strict on controlling where visitors go, thus preserving the authenticity of the landscape. Concessions assist conservation by controlling the number of visitors. This enables the rules to be more relaxed. Notably, you’ll be able to drive off the trails, as the landscape will have time to fully recover. So you don’t just see a leopard in a tree or a cheetah in the grass. You drive closer until you’re almost under the leopard’s tree or high above the spotted brilliance of the cheetah. Likewise, when the vultures are circling, you’re able to move through the grass and discover the action around the carcass. Private concessions also create remarkable opportunities. Masai warriors lead you on walking safaris across the plains, following the prints of zebra until you’re virtually amongst the herd. With their red blankets flowing in the wind, these tribal landowners are the perfect guides to narrate the wilderness. And they’ll bring you moments of pure exhilaration on the plains. Although this is big cat country, it’s also possible to go on horseback safari, with experienced riders able to journey along with the herds. A safari in the private concessions isn’t just about game drives. Every day you’re able to customize your program with a range of activities, following your mood and interests at all times."

With a flask of coffee in hand, you stop at the Grumeti River, where a large pod of hippos go through the morning ritual of grunting and barging. A jackal scurries past and then jumps away from the banks after spotting the sunbathing crocodiles. A fish eagle descends from the tree and you watch it fly above an epic herd of buffalo. Hyenas, golden cats, and interesting antelope you’ve never heard of; the Serengeti creates dreamy images of the big cats battling with wildebeest and zebra, but it’s also home to a wonderful diversity of life. Today is fully flexible and you can choose the program that suits the mood. The game drives are personalized, so you can head out in the morning for a couple of hours, or stay out all day on an intrepid adventure across the plains. Like yesterday, you’ll be staying at one of the newest luxury options in the Grumeti Reserve. Your canvas and glass suite overlooks a waterhole and the Grumeti River is just a stone’s throw away.

They’re scattered, a mass of hairy antelope covering dozens of square miles; you can drive for 15 minutes and not come to the end of the herd. A little further behind are the zebra, flocked together in a beautiful mass of black and white. Get closer and you pick out the details; loving couples, calves with softer stripes, powerful males flexing their shoulders with a brief gallop. And then the predators come into view. Lions watch the show from the rocky outcrops ( kopjes ), picking out potential meals. Leopards and cheetahs are seen stalking, keeping an eye on the same menu. Hyenas are following the great wildebeest migration, using their incredible stamina to keep pace, then ripping apart the individuals that are weak from exhaustion. The great wildebeest migration mostly takes place in the Serengeti and around 1.5 million animals are on the move. It’s an organic phenomenon with routes changing every year; herds move in clusters, hundreds of thousands of them mowing down the fresh grass as they journey north. Many camps are on the route. But the migration moves quickly, so within two weeks the wildebeest and zebra come and go. Mobile camps are a more guaranteed way to be amongst the migration as they pack up and move location with the herds. While they’re located within the national park, they offer the exclusivity more recognizable with a concession. For these two days, you’ll be hearing the rumble and watching the drama from the camp. An evening campfire and Masai warriors help keep the big cats at a safe distance, while a private guide takes you on game drives amongst the herds. You’re never more than a ten-minute drive from thrilling action. Lions chase zebra, hyenas take down a gazelle stuck in the mud, leopards scamper off with a limp carcass in their jaws. Sometimes you hear a yelp and within moments, you find lions tearing apart a wildebeest. At another moment, you’re close enough to watch the hunt play out and the lionesses pounce on a zebra calf. Although mobile, the camp is also luxurious and you’ll have a level of comfort that seems unexpected given your remote location."

Your camp is located on one of these, where your rock and thatch cottage enjoys supreme views across the Serengeti. It’s a particularly majestic vista at sunrise. Just like in Grumeti, the daily program is fully flexible and you’ll be able to tailor the adventure to your liking. Journeys through the woodland add a new charm and you’ll follow the bulldozing trails left by rampaging elephants. Beneath the canopy is an ideal place to spot leopards, the beautiful hunter draped across the high branches, overlooking the opportunities for a meal.

At other times, the darkness is absolute and the driver stops the vehicle. You listen for action and then hone in on the sounds, using a high-powered spotlight to reveal the big cats on their evening rounds. The Serengeti is a very different place after dark and it feels like you’re in a completely new destination, especially when the silhouetted elephants march past the vehicle.

In 2014, they were opened to the public and are now the proprietors of a sole camp. The privacy is unparalleled as there isn’t another camp within an hour’s drive of yours. Only 16 daily guests get to explore the area and the camp is booked out many months in advance, as safari connoisseurs seek to experience the exclusivity and wildlife of Namiri Plains. The migration passes through here from November to January, but for all months of the year, there’s a wonderful cast of resident herds and predators. And just like the other stops on this itinerary, it feels like you have the Serengeti all to yourself. You’ll drive here from Loliondo for three days of exceptional safari. Safari is incredibly authentic here. Wildlife has hardly seen vehicles before and their behavior is completely unaffected by tourism. Researchers continue to track the big cats and they’ll join you on game drives, imparting their extensive knowledge of both the landscape and the resident predators. Their understanding makes experiences with the cats almost guaranteed and you’ll quickly come to discover the movements of local leopards and cheetahs. Activities are restricted to game drives and there remains some control over where you can go; remember, this is still a very important place for wildlife research and conservation. Morning and afternoon game drives bring exceptional intimacy with the cats, and throughout the rest of the day, you sit back and admire the plains from your spacious canvas suite."

        "title": "Serengeti – Tracking the Herds on the Famous Grass Plains",
        "description": "From Ngorongoro, the trail will descend onto the endless grass plains of the Serengeti. Lions live around kopjes , which are rocky outcrops that look just like The Lion King. Leopards and cheetahs will be easy to spot in the low grass, and sometimes you can see these spotted cats on a hunt. Some sections of the grass will be empty with no animals in sight. Then, you will cross a ridge, and there will be tens of thousands of grazers that will dot the plains in a patchwork of smells and sounds. Wildebeests will rut and gallop enthusiastically, while zebra will huddle together in herds of black and white stripes. There is life everywhere, and you will have two days to experience the Serengeti’s bounty. Your camp will be on the grasslands and moves with the seasons, so it will always be within reach of the great wildebeest migration. Game drives typically last all day, and they are like living out a Disney movie. The other reason the Serengeti is good for kids is that they can be involved in spotting animals. Open plains with short grass make game viewing very easy, so that the children can see elephants or giraffes on the horizon, and the guide can take you to them. Similar to yesterday, the game drives will be private and flexible, so you can decide how far and how long you want to stay out."

        "description": "Today, you will take a safari flight to Zanzibar Town before a one-hour transfer takes you to Bwejuu. You will check into the resort, and a soft ocean breeze will rustle through your windows. Palms will rise high above the beach, casting shade over the bungalow. Dipping your toes into a private plunge pool, you can look out towards the beach and realize that is not even 20 meters away. Back inside, your bungalow will have two bedrooms along with a large living area that will be equipped with the mod cons, which includes Wi-Fi, television, air-conditioning, and a minibar. Mosquito nets will canopy the beds, and all the rooms will be furnished in an Arabic style that is elegant, yet simple. Sun loungers will await on your private verandah along with day beds above the plunge pool. It will all be well shaded, although you can quickly be in the sun should you wish, either at the beach or the main pool. Usually, it is the setting that impresses when you arrive at Bwejuu and Paje. Listed as one of Conde Nast’s top 30 beaches in the world, it will be a feast of tropical colors and seclusion. Sometimes you will not believe how quiet the beach is. Even with its newfound fame, there will not be many visitors here, nor will there be any high-rise resorts. Everything is low-key and laid-back, so even though this is a family resort you will not be surrounded by screaming children all day."

        "description": "The children’s club runs a flexible program and is suitable for all in addition to a childminding service that is also available at your resort. For younger kids, the program will mostly be about being safe while playing around your resort and on the sand. Older kids have more to choose from, including various ball and water sports, plus the chance to go kayaking on the lagoon. Timings will not be fixed either, so your children can try it out for 30 minutes, stay there the whole day, or plan a sports activity while you escape to the spa. Indulgence will come easily here and settling into the spa will seem like such a natural thing to do, especially once you know the children are taken care of. You can walk to the beach, and you will not be hassled. Although the beach is not private, it does not need to be. There will not be enough other people to crowd the sand, and the beach is so vast that there is space for local fishermen as well. At low tide the lagoon will become ankle to knee deep, so you can wade out with the kids to look for fish and crabs. At almost all times the waters will feel more like a bath than an ocean, which is perfect for splashing or throwing a ball around. However, do note that there are clumps of coral all over the sea bed, so it will be worth bringing water shoes to avoid mishaps. Today will be flexible, and you can create your own program at the resort and on the lagoon."

        "description": "All your days in Bwejuu will be flexible, and your trip can be adjusted when you arrive. Visiting the monkeys of Jozani Forest is just a suggestion for day seven. It is a 20-minute drive, and a good way to break up the beach time. Sykes monkeys are easiest to spot, and they will appear friendly and mischievous, staring at you with curious grins. Often times, whole troops come to the forest floor and cross the walking trail. It can be pretty humorous with young kids, watching the facial reactions of the two different primates. Endemic to Zanzibar and Jozani Chwaka Bay National Park, there are only around 1,000 of these colobus monkeys left in the wild. Dazzling white beards and hair tufts help them stand out from the forest canopy. As javelins of light pierce the canopy, their ochre back fur will turn a lovely shade of red. Mostly, you must look for their tails, which curl down from the highest branches. These monkeys are naturally bashful, so it will be best to stay quiet and patient. After a while, the colobus will move, and then you will be treated to a show of nimble climbing and elegant movements. If you are lucky, one or two may come down from the canopy. Even if not, there is only one place in the world you can see these old-world monkeys, so just being able to a glimpse of them is special."

You can paddle on the lagoon in kayaks, or snorkel at some of the small reefs in places where you can still touch the ground. You can take strolls along the beach, going up to Paje and possibly even Jambiani. You may also decide to just lie back beside the pool or splash about in your plunge pool. One great option for older children is to go swimming with dolphins in Kizimkazi. It is not Sea World. You jump into the ocean and swim with wild dolphins, which will prove to be a sunrise experience that is magical for all ages."

        "description": "Smells will guide you through a spice plantation where you will smell the delectable scents of ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla. Zanzibar is nicknamed the Spice Island although these spices are not native. Traders brought them from around the world, and they thrived in the tropical climate. Some of the plantations remain active, and you can take a tour of the different fields, learning how each spice grows and what it can be used for. It will be an interactive and educational tour and will be followed by the chance to pick your own fruits from the tree. Not just bananas and oranges, but strange fruits not seen at home like starfruit and jackfruit can be picked and harvested. Even to see that oranges are sometimes green and not orange can be eye-opening for the children. After checking out of the resort, you will head straight to a spice plantation this morning, which will only be a journey of around one hour. After a tour and some snacks, you will stop in the Mangapwani Slave Chamber where important tales about slave trade will be told in a murky, gloomy cave. It is the sort of place that makes you happy to be alive and healthy, living in the 21st century. Shortly after, you will be in Stone Town, staying at a hotel that is located just outside the old and confusing maze. You will be on the coast once more, next to all the history and culture with a swimming pool and resort-style facilities."

A few more steps forward and you will not be able to see these compass points anymore. You will have entered a labyrinthine zone of pedestrian alleyways, where evocative sights and sounds greet you at every corner. Traders pull carts of seafood, and donkeys sometimes get in the way. Stores of dusty antiques will fill one side of a lane, and a small television set can be found in a town square for people to watch their favorite soap opera together. Tea sellers will shout out and send lovely aromas into the air. For over a thousand years, this town of coral houses has absorbed different influences. It is part Persian, part African, and a little bit European. On a guided tour, you will explore the most interesting parts of this history and culture, including stops at the Hamamni Baths, Malindi Mosque, slave trader Tippu Tip’s House, and the exoticism of the Darakani Bazaar. After lunch at the old post office, you will visit out the House of Wonders, which is the most impressive Stone Town palace with the most engaging of the town’s museums inside. Cultural tours are not always too engaging for children, but there is always so much going on in such a small space that Stone Town will always leave an impression."

        "description": "Heading back onto the water, you will sail in a traditional wooden dhow on a private family tour. Crafted from wood to a design that has been unchanged for almost a millennium, dhows are romantic vessels for exploring Zanzibar’s waters. You will cruise past deserted sandbanks and small uninhabited islands as if you are a famous explorer. You will stop at coral outcrops for a snorkel should you wish with reef sharks being among the highlights. With a private sailing trip, your children can have an opportunity to steer the boat, learning the different knots and how the sails work. Everyone can sit back on the deck, watching the water change color through the day. Around midday, you will dock at Prison Island. It will not look like a prison at first. It will look more like paradise, or an almost deserted island of white sand and palm trees. Here, you can relax on the beach as the guides cook up a barbecue lunch, perhaps taking the chance to poke around the shallows for crabs and other critters. You can also take a walk along the wooden pier, or use of the facilities at a resort, including a swimming pool and places to change. There is a ruined prison on the island and it is worth a little look. The big highlight will be a group of almost 100 Aldabra tortoises. Weighing over 500 pounds, these giants will wander slowly around the island. One of them is even thought to be 200 years old! It will be easy to get close to such slow-moving creatures, and the tortoises always amaze, regardless of your age. You will spend most of the afternoon on Prison Island before sailing back to Stone Town where Forodhani Gardens will be an ideal place to visit on your final night. This is where local families come to hang out and grab a bite to eat along the shore with the smell of barbecued squid in the air."

        "description": "A cacophony of birdsong greets you at Lake Manyara. Storks guard the entrance to the forest canopy, welcoming you with raucous chants. Their calls become muffled as you wind deep into the forest, to be replaced by the hooting of baboons. The bossy primates are everywhere, scampering across the forest floor and climbing up the trees. Mothers cradle hairless babies while the presence of the big males raises goosebumps on your arm. Also in the forest, you’ll see elephants and giraffes, plus the unique sight of lions that climb trees. Draped across the high branches, they have the perfect vantage point for inspecting the dinner menu. Earlier today, you’ll land at Kilimanjaro International Airport and transfer onto a small domestic flight to Lake Manyara. The game drive starts immediately as you wind through the trees and take in the exoticism of wild Tanzania. Winding trails lead onto a lake filled with hippos, then across to the opposite side of the park, where your decadent treehouse awaits. Magnificent suites are perched in the mahogany forest, built on stilts above a permanent waterhole. Throughout the evening, you can lounge on the private verandah and watch a whole procession of wildlife come for a drink. Safari is an adventure, but over these seven days, you’ll also realize that a safari is also a dreamy, relaxed getaway."

Journey through the forests and the vehicle is just a meter away from giant elephants, including young bulls that flap their ears in displays of power. The world’s largest baboon population is a continual highlight, as is the grandeur of the natural setting. With its scorched cliffs and thick magical forest, Lake Manyara is one of Africa’s most picturesque parks. You’re able to see a lot in a compact area, which is ideal on your first full day on safari.

Sometimes the runway has to be cleared of wildlife, an indication of the remoteness of the landscape. Touch down on the plains, and you’re immediately surrounded by wildlife, with zebra and wildebeest herds dappled across the panorama. Gaze out, and you’ll see elephants along the horizon, plus the long neck of a giraffe that seems to point towards the sun. It’s a short game drive to your safari camp, an elegant and unpretentious camp that is all about the wildlife experience. Rather than opulent extras, this tented camp maximizes the immersion in nature. You’ll be watching and listening to the animals all day and through the night. The camp still has plenty of luxuries, and you’ll be surprised at how comfortable it can be when you’re so deep in the wilderness. Picture spacious bathrooms with hot showers, day beds for watching the wildlife, and a luxury bed raised above a wooden floor. Today you follow a flexible game drive program, exploring the splendor of the central Serengeti plains. There’s always drama on a game drive, either big cats prowling around or battles within herds. But there’s also charm as you discover the intimate details."

You soar across the plains and gaze down on the rumbling herds, admiring the famous patchwork of colors. Wildebeest are spread over a mammoth area, while zebra form blurring lines of black and white. Nomadic elephants also provide a focal point, as do the herds of buffalo that are followed by balls of dust. Rising at sunrise, you drift for a couple of hours before touching down to a glass of champagne. Then the day follows your private game drive program. You have complete flexibility and can spend the full day exploring, taking a picnic and seeing vast areas of the Serengeti. Or you can stick closer to the camp for a more tranquil safari day. Stop beside the glistening rocks and find a lion pride in their domain, with two young cubs playing beside snoozing parents. Watch the drama at a waterhole, where a herd of startled gazelle suddenly runs from a crocodile. Hippos grunt in the water and one is furious about something, suddenly charging out of the water and thudding into the distance. The vehicle offers a raised vantage point so that you can unearth the camouflage of leopards and cheetahs in the grass. Sometimes you can see them, but the ungulates are oblivious. Watch patiently as the hunter dips its neck and creeps closer with solemn precision. Tension rises as the sentinel raises the alarm and the cheetah tries to pounce. It’s over in an instant, and this time the Thomson’s gazelle got away. But with six days in the Serengeti, there’s a chance of witnessing a hunt."

This is when lions and leopards love to prowl and is the best time of the day for seeing predators on the move. Return to the camp for brunch then fly to the private Grumeti Reserve, for a very exclusive Serengeti experience. Sharing an unfenced border with the Western Corridor, this reserve can only be entered by guests staying at one of the reserve's luxury lodges. It’s rare that you’ll see other vehicles and there won’t be anything artificial interrupting your photos. Over the next two days, you continue a privately guided safari program, although there are some new activities available. Masai warriors lead you on walks, their red blankets flowing in the breeze as they impart their ancestral knowledge of the plains. It’s safe, and it’s exhilarating, the grasslands packed with animals, as you become just another mammal. Vehicles can be noisy and scary, so the smaller animals skip away when they hear them approach. But on foot, you’re almost silent. Zebras inspect you with curiosity, wildebeest gallop past just a few meters away, and occasionally you wander past elephants, giraffes, and buffalos. While these are animals you’ve seen before, a walking safari provides a completely fresh perspective, further building up the complete jigsaw of Serengeti experiences."

It’s a very peaceful journey, a chance to absorb all the sights and sounds from a unique vantage point. Experienced riders can increase the thrill and canter up to the herds, then gallop across the open plains. The proximity is breathtaking as hooves kick up dust and you become a part of the landscape. Like the walking safari, this is a very safe safari activity. The Masai have been living on these animal-filled plains for many years. They use their intimate understanding of the environment to plot a route away from the big cats. Game drives also have an added highlight in the Grumeti Reserve. You’re permitted to leave the trails and bump across the virgin grassland. This helps to get you closer to some of the most revered scenes. Drive over to a lion pride that’s tucking into a zebra, the limbs getting torn apart as the vultures circle overhead. Spot a cheetah in the grass and come to within a respectful distance, where you also find a young cub. Stop next to a buffalo herd, and you’re close enough to hear them hissing with every exhaled breath. Then find a leopard lurking in a tree and get close enough to admire its resplendent blue eyes.

Take in the panorama, and it's almost impossible to believe that such a place exists, that 30,000 wild mammals could occupy the remains of a volcano. And as you're inspired by this scale, a buffalo herd marches by, making their daily journey into the crater. The safari has already started, even though you're just gazing out from the lodge.

A lion pride greets you, a male's mane flowing as the females stalk a small herd of gazelle. Into the woodland, you find the old elephant bulls, huge tusks curving skyward with stoic pride. Now across the crater floor, finding two rhinos on their bashful morning journeys. They plod along, bringing up goosebumps as they roam past the vehicle; by mid-morning, the rhinos are likely to have retreated into the privacy of the bush, away from any accessible trails. Drive slowly, watching the wildebeest that gallop around comically and admiring the zebras that huddle in picturesque groups. Find a hyena scurrying towards the flamingos in the lake, then get close enough to a buffalo herd to hear their hissed breathing. By 9 am, you'll have seen at least a dozen different mammals, so stop for a picnic coffee by a second lake, watching the hippos as they rise and fall in the water. Ngorongoro is an oasis of life, and this single game drive is likely to fulfill so many preconceptions of an African safari.

It extends at every angle, flowing beyond the horizon like an unbroken carpet woven by nature's reverie. Clumps of black dapple this carpet, large herds of zebra and wildebeest that graze on these famous plains. Even when you visit outside the great wildebeest migration months, there is always a staggering number of wildebeest, zebra and Thomson's gazelle in the Serengeti. As the grasslands support the ungulates, the ungulates support the predators, helping to maintain a very healthy population of big cats; it won't take long to spot your first Serengeti lion pride. En route to the Serengeti, you stop in Olduvai Gorge, where ancient humanoid fossils reveal where Homo sapiens evolved from; it's another inspiring reminder of the age of this landscape. Then the game drive explores the Ndutu area in the south of the Serengeti, where flat plains are dappled with herds and the sporadic trees make an excellent hideout for leopards. You're quickly immersed in the rhythm of the grasslands, following the scents to find big cats in their hideouts, or using the open panorama to spot elephants, giraffe, and buffalo herds on the move. Tucked away in this remote and pristine area, your camp provides a classic safari-under-canvas experience, while also offering all the necessary comforts; wooden decking for watching the plains, hot showers, Western toilets, and comfy beds.

Everything is still, the guide cuts the engine, and the scene plays out. As the lions get closer, a sentinel raises the alarm, causing the zebras to panic. Undeterred, the lions emerge from their hideout, four of them ushering the herd towards the higher grass. Snapping and snarling, they cajole the zebra into their ambush, isolating a young female. Can they catch her? Out of nowhere, another lion jumps from the high grass, taking down the zebra in a few seconds of spiraling dust and strangled yelps. Even from the raised vantage point of the vehicle, you hadn't seen this stealthy lioness remaining in the grass. Inching closer to the kill, you watch the big male bite into the carcass, ripping through the skin and coming up with a blood-splattered mane. He roars, a low rumbling grunt that warns the other males away. Yet that doesn't deter the hyenas; hearing the signal they come in a pack, joining two jackals who are already attempting to steal small pieces of flesh and bone tossed from the carcass. When you visit the Serengeti, you don't simply see the animals. You see scenes like this one, with different species and herds revealing an ancient rhythm. As with all days in the Serengeti, today's game drives are flexible. Choose to spend the whole day on the plains, taking a picnic lunch to pools filled with hippos.

Lose track of the hyenas, the menacing predator that seems to be everywhere the herds are. Then find lions perched on their kopjes, the rocks that protrude above the plains. A pride drapes itself across the rocks, a few peering out and the rest slumbering in the sun. But travel to the next kopjes and you see the lions descending towards a passing herd. The central area is a natural place to stop on any Serengeti safari, mainly due to its location. Many distinctive areas are accessible from here, helping you respond to the nuances of the migration and track the biggest herds. Clumps of forest provide a haven for elephants and giraffes, while a series of pools provide guaranteed hippo sightings. Most of all, this central area helps to showcase the Serengeti's sense of space. You can drive for four hours in any direction and still be on the grasslands, still be filling your eyes with more and more herds. Like in the Ndutu area, your camp blends into the environment and helps maintain your immersion in the landscape."

        "description": "From the Serengeti to the spice island, a light aircraft transports you between the two World Heritage sites. In less than two hours, you've swapped the grasslands for the maze, and you're opening all the senses to the ambiance of Stone Town. Fresh fish sizzles on street barbecues, the shouts of fruit traders echo through the alleys; exquisite wooden doors reveal a decorated history, and every turn brings a new color. While the Stone Town can be visited on a day tour, it's most seductive experience comes in the late afternoon and evening, when the labyrinthine streets reveal their local flavor. You'll be greeted at the airport and transferred to a boutique hotel on the edge of the maze, with a guide giving you a quick orientation and offering dinner recommendations."

        "description": "Just outside Stone Town, the spice plantations and slave caves show both the proud and shameful stories. For almost a millennia, Zanzibar was the crossroads for goods entering and leaving Africa. Spices and tortoise shells went to China; cultures mingled during interaction with Arab traders, and the slave trade continued from Zanzibar long after it was outlawed. Visiting the plantations and mysterious caves provides an insight into how Zanzibar shaped Africa and the world. It's a half-day tour, followed by a relaxed afternoon at the hotel, either lounging at the pool that overlooks the Indian Ocean or exploring the surrounding streets."

While a series of luxury hotels are found in the north, it's on this quiet eastern coast where Zanzibar's private retreats are located. Relax in the boutique luxury of your lodge, dip your toes in the turquoise waters, enjoy a spa treatment, and let the exotic colors of the Indian Ocean gently lull you into slumber.

With the beach, warm waters, and overwhelming sense of tranquility, it's easy to spend your days escaping into the exotic Zanzibar atmosphere. One excursion is highly recommended, and the early wake-up call is always rewarded. Pods of wild dolphins come to feed in the Kizimkazi Bay at dawn, before playing in the surrounding waters as the sun comes up. Boats take you out to them, and you jump in, a whole pod swimming past in unison. The dolphins are quick and you can't keep up, so jump back in the boat to another point where you can join them in the water. This isn't SeaWorld. There is no touching or fancy dolphin tricks. But as you wait in the ocean, a whole pod elegantly comes past, with some dolphins barely a couple of meters away from you. You'll return to the lodge by mid-morning, where the rest of the day is about snoozing in the sun."

        "description": "Lake Manyara's flying residents provide a noisy start to your safari experience. Over 300 individual bird species can be spotted in the park, but it's the raucous hornbills that try to dominate the soundtrack. After breakfast you'll have a short drive to Lake Manyara National Park, where the hornbills aren't the only birds vying for your attention. Thousands of flamingos wade in the shallows of the lake, forming a pink blanket that's the centerpiece of this national park. They're joined in the water by large pods of hippos, the playful beasts resting from the sun or rolling around the muddy embankments. Lake Manyara offers an ideal first African safari. It offers an eclectic mix of animals, but the winding woodlands ensure that you rarely see any other safari trucks. By the lake, and in the grassy clearings, you'll get your first glimpses of Africa's largest mammals. Buffalos return your stare, their bushy frames usually providing tick one on your Big Five list. African elephant bulls wander alone, graceful creatures that can be distinguished from Asian elephants by their larger size and ears. Even from a distance you can see that their ears are shaped like a map of Africa. Giraffes silently munch on the high trees, the most elegant of creatures adding their own unique colors to Lake Manyara. In the clearings these great mammals are easy to spot, but in the thick forest there is also a remarkable concentration of wildlife. You'll be immersed in this animal world as you spend two nights deep within the mahogany forest. This intimate experience will bring the wildlife to you. Listen to bird song from your enchanting treehouse, watch baboons troop past from the balcony, and savor the chattering of bush babies and monkeys in the trees. Sumptuous meals and local drinks are included as are game drives in the park. You'll have a long afternoon game drive on day two before morning and afternoon game drives on day three. Stealthily resting in the trees is another of Lake Manyara's unique residents. In the dense forest the safari truck stops. The engine is cut off. Your guide is pointing, but as you scour the trees with binoculars you can't find what he's so excited about. A quick movement almost makes you jump. Was that? Was it? It's a lion's tale, swinging from a branch. You definitely don't need the binoculars, this lion is just meters away,and it's been watching you the whole time. Unique to Lake Manyara and Tarangire, these graceful tree climbing lions are the highlight of a safari here. If you're lucky you'll also get glimpse of the other predators that hide in these trees: leopards and cheetah."

You'll do a game drive en route to Tarangire National Park, spotting the diverse assortment of animals that wander between Lake Manyara and Tarangire. Impalas and wildebeest stand impassively as you drive past, while elephant herds can be seen around the fringes of Tarangire. Once inside the park their numbers grow, great herds, 300 strong, providing a surreal viewing experience. From a distance it's their size that's impressive. But admire them from up close and the herd teems with charming interactions. Babies test their boundaries under a mother's watchful eye. Youngsters are getting used to their power, comically chasing warthogs away from water holes. Large males dictate the herd's movements, leading their family across a landscape that's dotted with spectacular baobab trees. Nestled into a secluded area of Tarangire, settle into your luxury tent that is lifted on stilts and surround an enormous baobab tree. A stunning infinity swimming pool overlooks a water hole, guests and mammals watching each other as they enjoy water for very different reasons. From the lodge verandah, a vast savannah offers prime wildlife viewing. Zebra herds wander past, each set of black and white stripes as unique as a person's fingerprints. Waterbuck and giraffe can be spotted on the horizon, and on a long game drive you'll be getting much closer to these gracious mammals. Lions lurk in the baobab trees, elephants cover the trail, while the sight of a bat eared fox reveals one of the park's rare residents. During the night the sound of rustling perforates through the thick canvas tents. Lying in large double beds you wonder what it could be. A set of animal footprints will reveal the culprit in the morning."

Even by East Africa's lofty standards, this inactive volcano is a freak of nature. Known as Africa's “Garden of Eden,” the Ngorongoro crater floor is home to a permanent population of 30,000 mammals. But from above it's a bird that catches the eye, innumerable flamingos turning the lake pink, their shocking color juxtaposed against the rich green landscape. On day five your afternoon isn't scheduled, and some might enjoy savoring the view and relaxing in the tranquil surroundings of your lodge. This is one of Tanzania's most sublime lodges, and it immaculately blends local Maasai tradition with modern luxury. A butler quietly caters to all your needs while Maasai warriors ensure no wildlife gets too close. From your intimate wooden deck you can watch the Ngorongoro procession. First a small herd of zebra descends into the crater. Then a large bull elephant. Now three Maasai herdsmen carrying spears. On this relaxed afternoon, others might prefer walking along the crater rim or making a visit to a local Maasai village. Whatever you choose, it's an afternoon indulging in a world that hasn't changed for hundreds of years."

        "description": "Anticipation hangs in the air as the first blades of light tinge the morning sky. Descending the steep crater slopes you head into the world's largest intact caldera for a full day on safari. An eerie silence accompanies the fading mist, and the crater's residents are on full alert. Morning time offers ideal hunting conditions and lion prides are roaming through the crater, considering what's going to be on the breakfast menu. Perhaps a waterbuck that's hiding in the Lerai forest, or an old Thompson's gazelle that stands lonely and fearful. No, this lion pride is after a feast. A common eland usually weighs over half a ton and their distinctly straight horns provide a dangerous defense. But the proliferation of lions in the crater is partly explained by their superior hunting skills. It's extremely rare to visit Ngorongoro Crater and not see at least a couple of lion prides. They could be lazing in the shade, their stomach's full and their glorious manes just meters from the safari truck. Or you could have front row seats as they stalk and pounce on prey. Nowhere else in the world can match Ngorongoro Crater's sheer concentration of wildlife. Six different habitats provide havens for a distinct cast of residents. In the forest you'll find some of Africa's largest elephants. Beside a lake you can stop for a picnic lunch and admire hippos and many thirsty antelopes. Out on the grassy savannah watch hyenas search for an easy meal. Then the ferocious horns of a buffalo give a clue as to why they're regarded as the most dangerous of the Big Five. With good luck you'll also spot leopards, the elegant cats silently creeping out of the trees. Many times it's difficult to know which way to look. The crater walls encase a landscape that can be easily scanned and admired with binoculars. Have a look, spot something new, and then slowly approach it for prime viewing. Over a roaring evening fire you call the day's events, struggling to remember each of the unique sightings from the crater floor. Yet there is one that will always linger in the memory. A pair of black rhino slowly plods through the grass, their telltale horns proudly pointing skyward. Critically endangered, there are only around 5,000 of these majestic animals left in the wild. As they come near the safari truck there are shrieks of excitement. Shaking hands fumble with the camera. Eyes are wide open and fixated. Then silence descends over the safari truck as everyone serenely watches the rhinos wander past. Ngorongoro Crater offers one of the few places in the world where you can see the entire Big Five in just one game drive. Hopefully, the rhinos will have completed the set."

        "title": "Serengeti National Park - Stunning Safari in the Famous Serengeti",
        "description": "From the enclosed haven of Ngorongoro you head onto the endless grass plains of the Serengeti. Whereas Ngorongoro is compact and concentrated, the Serengeti is vast and wild. These plains are home to the Great Migration, and during the early months of the year, your accommodation will be surrounded by giant herds of zebra, Thompson's gazelle and wildebeest. Over 2 million wildebeest migrate around the Serengeti, and the size of these herds is often unbelievable. They cover the grass, turning the plains into a great patchwork quilt of hoofs and swirling dust. From a distance it's a staggering sight, tens of thousands grouped together for safety. A closer inspection reveals that there are perhaps hundreds of thousands in just one herd. It's a staggering sight, and it gets better from up close. Baby wildebeest are carefully guarded, a cheetah accelerates and pounces on a lame male, while a sudden fearful jump causes half the herd to blindly panic. After leaving Ngorongoro Crater you'll first stop at Olduvai Gorge, an area which holds an integral key to human evolution. Fossils and tools indicate that this site was occupied by Homo habilis and Homo erectus, and the two million years of history in this gorge offer a humbling interruption to the wildlife viewing. This was where early man developed and without Olduvai Gorge perhaps none of us would be here today. Kusini has a secluded and remote location in the Serengeti, offering idyllic vistas and private game viewing. While parts of the Serengeti can get crowded with safari trucks, at Kusini you won't have anything on four wheels to scar your photographs. Don't worry if you're not arriving during the Great Migration, the Serengeti is a spectacular sight at all times of year. Flat landscape and clean air offer exceptional visibility across the plains, meaning that the Serengeti's unique life is easily viewable from your balcony. Three giraffe necks stand out against the horizon, while the size of elephant and buffalo make them easy to spot from a distance. Klipspringer emerge from the nearby woodland, while zebra and Thompson's gazelle pass by so frequently you barely turn your head. At nighttime the action continues, although it’s often the sounds rather than the sights that alert you to something meandering past the camp. These plains offer impeccable hunting conditions. Leopards and cheetahs join the lion prides, an abundance of big cats all finding easy meals in this plentiful landscape. With solemn precision a leopard dips his neck and blends into the grass. It's waiting. Its actions are calculated and careful. Watch too many wildlife documentaries and you'll be forgiven for thinking that a hunt lasts just a couple of furious minutes. Out in the Serengeti there's a good chance of watching how it really unfolds, including the drawn out skillful approach, the brief shock of the unsuspecting herd, and then the sudden ferocity of an attack."

        "description": "After seven days on safari, the final part of your vacation reveals another of Tanzania's unique wonders. For over 1,000 years Zanzibar has ignited the imagination of travelers. Pristine white sand is surrounded by the turquoise waters of the Indian Ocean, fringed by postcard perfect palm trees. The island offers a soporific loop of beach perfection, the gentle waves and mellow atmosphere enough to lull anyone into hibernation. Time becomes irrelevant as you settle into Zanzibar's beachside rhythm, each day offering a slow blend of relaxing, swimming, reading, and indulging in your sumptuous surroundings. You'll fly from the Serengeti to Zanzibar, where you'll be met and driven to your luxurious accommodations. You will be staying on the quiet Bwejuu- Paje Beach, a strip of sand that Conde Nest Traveler Magazine named as one of top thirty beaches in the world. Your five night stay is on an all-inclusive basis in a villa. Decorated in a boutique style that evokes Zanzibar's rich heritage, your villa and resort offers unrivaled levels of intimacy and exclusivity on the island. Your 193 square meter villa has a large private terrace and plunge pool as well as two bathrooms and a large living area. On Zanzibar Island it's easy to unwind and do nothing. But this island has fascinated visitors for more reasons than just the beach. Out in the ocean, beneath the water, a tropical collection of fish dance for anybody out snorkeling or diving. Pungent smells take people on a fragrant journey through the island's unique spice farms. Prison Island doesn't sound appealing. It was once used to house rebellious slaves and witnessing the remains of the prison is both poignant and harrowing. But the main attraction today is the endangered Albadra giant tortoises that wander along the sand. Every stay in Zanzibar should include a visit to the UNESCO World Heritage Stone Town. Haphazard streets create a disorientating labyrinth that takes you on an atmospheric journey through the past and present. Intricate wooden doors reveal homes with a rich past, old men push carts laden with oranges, while the smell of fried goat wafts through the luring alleyways. On one corner stands a Hindu Temple. Nearby, the simplicity of the Malindi Mosque has a calming effect. Walk around another corner and admire the 19th century Cathedral of St Joseph, Zanzibar proving how different cultures can peacefully coexist."

        "description": "Having explored Tanzania’s mountainous region, today you will begin explorations through the African bush. This portion starts in the tranquil and serene Lake Manyara National Park. You will drive to the park from Arusha over the course of the morning, arriving in time for lunch, followed by an afternoon game drive. The park itself revolves around a sparkling alkaline lake, which is frequently coated by pink flamingos. These soda lakes are characteristic of the Great Rift Valley and attract phenomenal populations of both resident and migratory birds. Ornithologists will want to do little more than set up under an acacia tree with a pair of binoculars, gazing at the skies above. The woodlands that surround the lake are also fascinating, largely because they house a population of rare tree-climbing lions. Found in only a handful of parks in Africa, these nimble lions are often seen swinging their tails from the branches of a tree. Drive along the escarpments and valleys, tracing the Tarangire River that feeds into this lake. These stunning vistas will stand in contrast to those seen as you ascended Kilimanjaro, revealing another facet of Tanzania."

        "description": "This morning, excitement will build as you depart Lake Manyara and begin your journey towards the Serengeti. This region is significant for much more than solely its wildlife, which will become apparent over the coming days. We will first detour through the town of Mto Wa Mbu, where a number of Tanzanian tribes assimilate. Dominated by Masai warriors, this community has organized a cultural tourism program that shares the rich and varied local cultures with visitors. Take a tour through an authentic Masai homestead, or stop to peruse the crafts and beadwork made by local women. Be sure to sample a few different varieties of bananas, as these are the main export of the region. Intrepid eaters may even wish to sample a local stew, if curious about the flavors of local cuisine. Carrying on, you will also detour past the Olduvai Gorge, one of the world’s most important paleoanthropological sites. It was here that Mary and Louis Leaky discovered some of the oldest known hominid remains in the 1960s. These Zinjanthropus bosei remains date back over 1.75 million years, while fossilized footprints date back over three million years. Few areas provide greater insight into human evolution than this particular gorge. Swing past the visitor’s center for additional information, before continue on westwards towards the Serengeti. You will emerge onto the golden plains in the late afternoon, with just enough time for an evening cocktail and bush dinner, before you sleepily collapse into bed."

Rise early and hop in your vehicle with a packed picnic breakfast to explore the wilderness while it is at its most active. Venture out across the plains with an expert local guide, who will spend the day helping you locate the coveted cast of the Big Five. Watch as elephants tear leaves off acacia trees, while giraffes look onward from above the treetops. Seek out a lion lazing quietly in the shade, while rambunctious cubs circle the pride. You will undoubtedly find yourself perpetually surrounded by herds of ungulates, including countless zebra, gazelle, and buffalo. If timed correctly, you may even be lucky enough to drive through the epicenter of the Great Wildebeest Migration. Spend time along rivers and beside watering holes, observing the species that come by for a drink. Keep your eyes peeled for crocodiles and hippos, which are often found lazily bobbing and lounging along the shore. Spend the entire day exploring as much of the park as possible, or, return midday for some indulgence and relaxation at the lodge property. No matter how you choose to structure your day, be sure to seek out the perfect sundowner location where you can enjoy a local cocktail as the sunset fills the sky with color around you. Drift asleep tonight to the sound of the wild, keeping an ear open for the cackle of a hyena or the grunt of a buffalo, as that will be a perfect conclusion to this magical day."

Spend a few final hours traversing the plains in search of your favorite species, and those yet to be seen. For those craving a new perspective on the terrain, this may be the perfect opportunity to embark on a romantic and luxurious hot air balloon ride over the savanna, complete with a champagne picnic breakfast as you descend. Floating high above the plains is one of the few ways to truly grasp the expansiveness of the area – and to experience the total tranquility of it all. In the mid-morning, you will return to the vehicle to drive back through the Ngorongoro Crater. You will stop at a lodge perched on the edge of the crater, with phenomenal views of the crater floor below. Ngorongoro was formed an estimated two to three million years ago, when an ancient volcano collapsed in on itself, creating this expansive caldera. Today, it is the largest inactive caldera worldwide and is home to vibrant populations of wildlife. The crater floor is often stippled with ungulates grazing on the lush grasses, while one of the world’s densest populations of lions looks onward. Sitting on the edge of the escarpment at sunset with a sundowner in hand will make for yet another epic conclusion to a day. Before the sun disappears entirely and the sky is engulfed with stars, peer down to the crater floor, in anticipation of tomorrow’s adventure."

The lush vegetation of the crater will contrast the days prior, drawing back memories of your early days on Kilimanjaro. As you approach the crater floor, the landscape shifts to vast grassland with a large lake in the center. Unsurprisingly, these fertile fields seasonally attract large herds of zebra, wildebeest, and impala as part of the Great Migration. As the day wears on, begin your journey back up the opposing slopes to the surrounding highlands. Here, you will have impressive views of this volcanic landscape, with Mount Lengai looming off in the distance. Soak in a few final moments looking out across this stunning caldera over a picnic lunch in the bush, before returning to Arusha by road."

Stone Town has played a significant role in east African development, acting as a meeting ground for Arab, Persian Indian, European and African merchants, and traders. Swahili culture emerged as a result of this vibrant fusion and remains a protected pride of the island today. Architecture, culture, and cuisine are markedly different from that of the mainland, and today will be your chance to explore it. Whether you opt to explore the historical monuments of this Swahili town, dive into the spices and flavors that characterize the island, or simply wander the cobbled streets poking in stores and alleyways, today will be yours to design. That said, some of the highlights of Stone Town include a visit to the Palace of Wonders, an opulent former Sultan’s residence since converted into a museum for Swahili and Zanzibari culture. Having played a significant role in the slave trade, a tour through the city’s Old Slave Market is another worthwhile endeavor. Navigating the tiny underground chambers provides a chilling and unforgettable insight into the horrors of the island’s dark history. Restaurants are rich and varied throughout the town, with endless opportunities to taste local flavor. Take the day to lose yourself in the history and culture of this singular city, ensuring of course that you migrate to an oceanside bar for the sunset."

Set out on a guided tour that exposes your senses to fields of cloves, black pepper, cardamom, cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon, and lemongrass. Pause in fields of breadfruit and jackfruit to sample the island’s fresh tropical fruit, before carrying on north towards the island’s beach capital.

Having explored all the major destinations in Tanzania, today will be the perfect opportunity to unwind and reflect upon your journey. There is no better place to do this than from the shade of a palm tree on a soft white sand beach. As turquoise and teal waters lap up around your feet, enjoy a final day with a great book and a cocktail in hand. Of course, if you happen to be an underwater enthusiast, forget the day of reflection and hop on a local dhow for a snorkeling, diving, or sailing trip! You still have one more day to squeeze in a few final activities, and a sailing trip through the smooth Indian Ocean on route to sublime diving and snorkeling spots is an absolute must. Return to the island as the sun sets, and sip on a final mojito while you order an impossibly fresh seafood feast. Fall asleep to the sound of waves splashing up on the shore, as a warm tropical breeze blows through your room.

Through the branches come pairs of inquisitive eyes, then expressive faces, grins, and frowns revealing what each chimp thinks about you. As you walk into a forest clearing, the troop comes into view. Nimble toes wrap around branches, fingers skillfully open seeds, every face conveys emotion, and you quickly get lost in the details. Even though there may be 40 or more chimpanzees in the troop you are visiting, it is easy to spend 20 minutes watching just two.

Hippos are plentiful, clusters of them barreling around the shallows as they assert their authority. In the reeds, you spot lurking eyes, a lioness lying in wait. Not far away, you see the gazelle, the sentinels straining to hear, then alerting the herd to gallop away.

Close-by is the wildebeest, virile males bucking and galloping in a show of authority, spreading their enthusiasm to the herd. A cheetah is perched on a rock, surveying the scene for later. On a kopje, a large rocky outcrop, is a pride of lions, ten draped across the scorched yellow granite. Elephants and giraffes are also constants here where the flat grasslands make it easy to spot their giant frames. Hyenas are another species that always seem to be around, scurrying past with a look that combines mischief with intent. Over these two days, you enjoy private game drives in the Serengeti. Dawn and dusk hours should be maximized as this is when the cats are more active, and the chances of seeing a hunt are elevated. You could stay out all day, exploring vast swathes of the Serengeti. Or you can return to the camp for lunch where you sit in the shade and watch the herds graze on the plains below. This safari is not about the animals. It’s about the interactions.

Morning and afternoon game drives weave along rutted tracks, leaving behind lingering impressions of the wilderness; lion manes ruffle in the breeze as a herd of gazelle is tracked through the grass. A buffalo herd protects its young and stares down inquisitive visitors; a leopard arrives unannounced and a frail wildebeest becomes the dinner menu.

        "title": "Tarangire – A Treehouse Above the Elephants",
        "description": "Tanzania's safari airlines catapult you from national park to national park, the planes soaring above herds then touching down in more expanses of untrammeled wilderness. Lions and leopards continue to mark the adventure in Tarangire National Park, although this time you're likely to see them in the trees, not on the ground. It takes a keen eye to deceive their camouflage; your guide provides it and points to a tail that swings in the foliage. The journey to your treehouse is already a game drive, one that scans for big cats and gets distracted by herds of eland, hartebeest, and oryx. One spectacle approaches from the periphery and becomes center-stage; over a hundred elephants march as one between the thick-trunked baobab trees. Old bulls proudly point their tusks, trunks swing from the face of impish babies, and the gentle group plod imbues both grace and power. Arrive at Tarangire Treetops and it's time to climb trees. Nested into immense baobab and marula trees, standing some five meters above the landscape, your spacious wooden suite overlooks the water and makes for a serene escape in Tarangire. All day and all night, a parade of mammals arrives here to drink; their gentle slurping can be heard from your vast verandah. Indulge, admire, relish the natural immersion, then an afternoon game drive tours the popular hangouts of hippos, elephants, and more. As you might expect, evenings are particularly mesmeric here, wildlife slowly coming to say hello as the two of you wallow in your own treehouse."

        "description": "Today's game drive tours Tarangire, covering almost 100 miles as it weaves through acacia parklands, large floodplains, river scenes, and swamps that dazzle with endemic bird life. Each corner brings fresh scenes; a rhino wandering lonely across brittle plains, buffalo herds roaming in forested foothills, ostrich sprinting across grasslands, and giraffe feeding from the acacia branches. Traversing the diverse ecosystems provides a lasting perspective of Tanzania's rugged beauty and ticking off the complete Big Five is a serious possibility on this single game drive. Continue the game drive until you loop back to the tree house and a second evening of bliss in a hidden corner of Tarangire."

        "description": "Tanzania's natural splendor is well documented. But in a country of such remarkable attractions, there will always be those delights that slip under the radar. Lake Natron is dictated by volcanic activity and spurts silver ash that cascades into the lake's waters. What was once a flamingo breeding ground is now a scene from a fairytale, the pink birds perfectly preserved in a casing of lava. From Tarangire you will travel by road to Lake Natron, taking a delightful journey past Lake Manyara and into the volcanic north of the country. Stop for a bountiful lunch en route and then spend the afternoon exploring this bizarre natural spectacle. Spend the night at a community-run guesthouse nearby. While this might not have the luxury of the treehouse, it's a comfortable and cute place to sleep that affords genuine interaction and insight into local Maasai village life."

        "description": "Zanzibar Island has a compelling history, the Indian Ocean sands explored and plundered by competing explorers. Its Stone Town epitomizes the juxtaposition of influences; Hindu temples peacefully stand beside whitewashed mosques of elegant beauty, cathedral remains tower above labyrinthine alleyways of intrigue, British colonialism blends with thick wooden Persian doors, and the competing influences form a town that's been awarded UNESCO World Heritage status. Your hotel is nestled amongst the enchantment, hidden down streets that dance with the vibrancy of local life. Just walk out of the hotel door and there's a feast for the senses: smells of freshly barbecued fish, the call to prayer floating across rooftops, a thousand different faces saying hello on the street. The hotel interiors scream of boutique indulgence and your window opens onto Stone Town, affording magnificent views over the red rooftops. A private guide is included for these two days and a personalized itinerary can be planned. Treat the nose to a thorough workout at the spice plantations. Discover a corrupt history as you're guided around the old slave houses and veiled caves from which profit was made. Head out to an Indian Ocean beach and sip cocktails on the white sand, traditional wooden dhows rocking in the water. Evenings bring further charm. Night markets serve fragrant seafood smells to the promenade and there's always a crumbling stone building softly illuminated by moonlight. Zanzibar's Stone Town runs at a slow and relaxed pace and you'll easily slip into its rhythm. It's a place for quaint exploration and then curling up in bed with the flickering sounds of the streets gently wafting through the window."

        "description": "Zanzibar isn't the only Tanzanian island cast adrift in the Indian Ocean. Pemba is less known and evokes images of yesteryear. Development on the island is kept to an absolute minimum and the coastline remains virtually untouched by concrete. It's an island that serves up absolute solitude, nothing but the odd local fisherman floating past as you laze away the days in a cute beachfront cottage. Palm trees sway, the sand tweets beneath your feet, and sapphire waters seem to redefine notions of underwater visibility. If Zanzibar is the famed beach vacation then Pemba is the unknown rustic escape, a barely inhabited island with hardly a road or modern building. It's a short flight over from Zanzibar and then a transfer across the island to your cottage, idyllically located on the sand at Fundu Lagoon. A tropical blanket of green submerges your accommodation and there's barely the need for footwear. Don't think that this remoteness means any less luxury. Gourmet meals are brought to your room, usually with a strong emphasis on freshly caught seafood and local produce (think lobster direct from the ocean and seasonal delights plucked from the trees). All drinks are included and there's few better moments that lounging on the beach with a sundowner in hand, admiring the wooden fishing boats as they slowly sail past on the breeze. It feels like you've got your very own Indian Ocean beach. So drift away and float on a carpet of serenity, time becoming irrelevant and the outside world far away. For a romantic island break there is perhaps no finer place; the same idolized beauty of more famous Indian Ocean islands, just without another set of footprints in sight. Enjoy, indulge, and these three days can easily feel like a lifetime in an alternative place."

The light aircraft takes you from Arusha in the east to the Serengeti's Western Corridor and the Grumeti Reserve, providing a poignant impression of how expansive and untouched the Serengeti really is. Touch down and visit the equestrian center, where 16 horses provide an extensive choice for your week-long adventure. English and Western-style saddles are available, and the guides have a wonderful knowledge of their horses' behavior, helping match you to a suitable ride. A walled riding track helps you get to know the horses before the afternoon is spent exploring the area around Sasakwa Lodge. Occasional animal encounters offer first safari sights, but the focus of the ride is on preparing yourself for the expedition to come. Get comfortable on the horse, brush up on your skills if you've been a long time out of the saddle, and become familiar with the rugged landscape you'll be traveling across. You will be staying at the flagship property of Grumeti, providing opulent accommodation with sweeping views over the Serengeti.

        "title": "Grumeti Reserve (Serengeti) – Mobile Camps and Galloping Across the Famous Grass Plains",
        "description": "Hooves rumble past, and you join their orchestral drum beat, galloping across the plains, kicking up dust as you go. On horseback, you're just another four-legged mammal, drawing the inquisitive stares of the landscape's residents. Over a thousand zebra congregate together, and you ride towards them, slowly at first then picking up speed as the herd begins to split. Wildebeest are rutting, bucking comically as if trying to unseat an invisible rider. Some appear oblivious and rush past right in front of the horse. In the distance, you spot elephants and giraffes, giant nomads that wander serenely along. As you're riding, there's a buffalo herd on the move, and you veer well clear, the guide indicating that these are testosterone-fueled bachelors; a little later you can bring your horse to within a few meters of the female buffalo. Over these three days, you ride across wild Serengeti, joining the four-legged mammals in traversing the thrilling grass plains. It's rare to go even a few minutes without spotting wildlife; perhaps Thomson's gazelle, kudu, hartebeest, or another antelope that watches you pass with an expression of curiosity. Set off in the dawn light and ride in the day's coolest hours, usually for four to five hours. The speed is flexible, and the horses are well adapted to the long journeys; they are not sprinters but have an exceptional ability to maintain a prolonged gallop. You're riding where vehicles can't go, crossing the grasslands and heading deeper and deeper into the wilderness. Each night is spent at a different mobile camp; a simple yet comfortable accommodation that's enveloped by the Serengeti's calls. You'll have flushing toilets, hot showers, four-poster beds and all the necessary amenities for a night in the bush. When an evening fire crackles, you hear hippos grunting and the odd lion roaring, evocative sounds that remind everyone of just where you are. So is it actually safe to horse ride through such famous big cat country? Absolutely. Remember, local people have lived with these animals for generations, and their intimate understanding of animal behavior helps make your trip exceptional. Your guides and trackers are constantly evaluating clues, choosing a route that avoids the realm of a hungry predator. When witnessing the bigger animals, your guides immediately understand whether it's safe to ride closer or best to stay clear. Evening fires keep the hyenas away, and the horses are guarded by local Maasai warriors, who have guarded their own cattle on these plains for centuries. After the morning rides, you rest at the camp, taking lunch and a few hours to relax as the heat of the day passes by. The afternoon rides are shorter, more like horse walks designed to bring personal encounters with a variety of wildlife. Sometimes you don't even need to be on horseback to see the mammals as elephants or giraffes roam straight past the camp. Into the evening and the night sky takes over, resplendent stars glistening in a landscape without roads or buildings. Rock asleep with nature's lullaby then wake to find a small antelope herd grazing beside your spacious tent. Horses are saddled up, breakfast is eaten, and you're off once more, horse riding across the Serengeti."

        "description": "You kick up more dust on the long ride to your beautiful accommodations. Join the zebra herds then overtake them, cantering to a scattering of Thompson's gazelle that inhabits the open plains. From June to November, the grass is short here, meaning you can easily see the different mammals from a distance. So ride up to the antelopes and admire their individualized expressions, then ride away from a lion pride that's a couple of miles away. Don't worry, lions are actually fairly lazy and won't be interested in chasing anything such a distance away; plus, when their bellies are full, they wouldn't even travel fifty meters to inspect their visitors. The legs might be a bit sore by now as the rough and rugged landscape provides a horse riding challenge. A trip to the spa quickly helps you reenergize, a 60-minute massage followed by time to relax around the pool and gaze across the plains. There is no riding this afternoon. Instead, the time is spent enjoying the lodge's facilities and returning to luxury lodge accommodation. There's still more horse riding to come, but the wild expedition has come to a close."

        "title": "Grumeti Reserve (Serengeti) – Flexible Horse Riding and Game Drive Program",
        "description": "Stop the horse on the bank of the Grumeti River and watch the show, hippos barging around and elephants splashing water on the opposite bank. Ride onto the plains and surround yourself with wildebeest, enjoying their curious nature. Giraffes are easy to spot, and you can ride to within ten meters. Over these days the horse riding continues, with rides focusing on intimate wildlife encounters. You'll return to the lodge after each ride. Encountering such a variety of large mammals requires good horse riding skills and this itinerary is not suitable for beginners. You must be confident enough to control the horse and recognize if it has been spooked or is uneasy. Most importantly, you must be able to steer the horse in the direction you want to go, even if it has been unsettled by the presence of an elephant or buffalo herd. The program is flexible over these two days, and most visitors opt for morning horse rides and afternoon game drives. It's also possible to horse ride all day or swap the four legs for four wheels and enjoy full-day game drives (this may be an option if the previous days of riding have taken their toll on your muscles). While horse riding avoids the cats, game drives go in search of personal encounters with the predators that lurk in the grass. You swap herbivores for carnivores, following the scent of drama in Grumeti. This private reserve is an integral part of the Serengeti ecosystem, and there are no fences, so you enjoy the same wildlife as in the main national park. Game drives are enhanced by exclusivity as only guests at one of the reserve's three lodges can explore this land. In addition, drivers can take you off the trail, making every encounter feel closer than ever. A tail swishes and you spot a leopard hiding in an acacia tree; the driver bumps across the grass until you've just a few meters away. Vultures are circling, and you head across the plains, finding a tense battle between three bachelor lions and a hyena cackle. Lions are unconcerned by your presence, and four lionesses wander around the safari vehicle, checking you out from all sides. Then there are the tranquil sights, like a cheetah perched on a rock, surveying the dinner menu without revealing his hunger. Or a rare wildcat that disappears into the grass. Spending time on game drives often brings real hunting scenes, perhaps lionesses stalking their prey or a carcass hanging limply from a leopard's jaw. Then after the adventure comes the lodge, a decadent place to stay and take in the splendor of the Serengeti."

Elephants dot the horizon, majestic figures shaped as iconically as the baobabs. A black-backed jackal scampers past, closely followed by the day’s first spotted hyena. Scattered to the west are hartebeests and impalas, along with some impressive horns that belong to greater kudu males. Despite the park covering an epic scale, wildlife is tightly concentrated and follows predictable patterns. Everything must stay close to the Great Ruaha River, the lifeblood of the landscape, and the epic stretch of water where big cats lay ambushes and large males fight for the right to breed. So game drives by the water encounter prolific levels of the big game, from the famous predators to some of Africa’s lesser-known treats. A herd of Lichenstein’s hartebeests stands proudly, rumbustious figures that are far shyer than you would expect. Handsome sable and roan antelopes flitter around the trees, two of Africa’s most elusive ungulates. It’s easy to find lions on the open plains. Sometimes you encounter a pride beneath a tree, the lionesses opening half an eye before snoozing. Other prides are on the move, heading towards the river as raucous baboons alert everyone to their presence. And when you head into the corners of the park, there’s a good chance of finding wild dogs, those rare hunters that many safari goers spend years trying to find. In this remote park, you’ll rarely see another person, and you’ll quickly unearth the wonder of wild Africa."

Four really stand out and are likely to be the focus of your first day of game drives. Reddish bands distinguish the Cookson’s wildebeest while clear black and white markings reveal the Crawshay’s zebra.

And you have a prime view directly from the four-poster bed. Over these two days, you follow a flexible program of game drives, with many options and routes dependent on your mood. It’s easy to spend a full day on the dusty tracks, uncovering the varied habitats and the mammals from both East and Southern Africa. Or you can stick close to camp, the shorter drives punctuated by languid hours of sitting back and watching nature’s show unfold. South Luangwa is one of few African national parks that allows and encourages nighttime drives. The adventure takes on new allure after dusk, opening your senses to sights and sounds that are hidden throughout the day. Moving slowly with a high-powered spotlight, you find leopards and other cats on the prowl, and then follow the hunters towards scenes of tension and unending theater. This regular opportunity to drive at night essentially makes South Luangwa two destinations in one (night and day). Also, the park is a harmonious mix of East and Southern African big-game atmospheres. You’ll quickly realize why this is Zambia’s showpiece safari destination, yet you’ll continue to enjoy the privacy and relative lack of visitors that this whole itinerary is all about."

Just imagine the silence, the sense of escapism, the feeling of traveling miles away from the last vestiges of civilization and manmade life. While walking safaris aren’t unique to North Luangwa, having such a dedicated space is unique to Zambia and a real celebration of untouched Africa. Like the game drives, the pace if leisurely and you have local guides and trackers ensuring the experience remains very safe. This 2-day walking safari option includes one night at a luxury fly camp in the park. You’ll follow animal prints, learning all about tracking and how to identify the clues left on the land. Cookson’s wildebeests roam past elephants, and occasionally giant buffalo herds block the trail. Prolific birdlife accompanies you on the journey, from giant eagle owls to the shimmering wings of the white-winged starling.

So yes, this is adventurous, but at heart, African safaris are very relaxed vacations. Rather than spending the night in the city of Dar es Salaam, it is better to fly to your safari immediately. After customs and immigration, a light aircraft will fly you to Ruaha National Park, where the open savannah is a bucolic place to rest and relax. When you are ready, a short game drive will reveal some astonishing scenes because wildlife begins to gather close to the water in the late afternoon."

You will touch down on a remote airstrip, transfer to a camp nearby, enjoy some quiet afternoon time, and then discover another ecosystem on an afternoon game drive.

By late morning, it will be much quieter as the scorching heat causes everything to slow. This is when you will head back to camp and relax, perhaps taking a snooze after lunch. Later in the afternoon, as the heat begins to fade, it will be time to go exploring once more. At this time, there is usually a lot of life around the water as animals come to drink and predators lurk in the tall grass. This rhythm of two game drives per day will be common throughout your safari vacation. Each drive will explore different areas of a park, and the contrasting habitats will bring contrasting experiences. Today, you will follow antelope around freshwater swamps as hippos barrel out to graze on the banks. In acacia woodland, you will search for leopards and admire big elephant bulls that can pull down trees. Out on the plains, the rhinos will graze seemingly safe from danger. Yet, when they head towards a watering hole, there can be drama. Monkeys will call out, impala will scurry away, warthogs will speed past, and only then will you see the lions elegantly emerging from the grass.

In the woodland, you will not see the animals as easily, but they will not see you coming, so there will be a thrilling proximity to many of the sightings. Woodland fills most of the park, and the lions make themselves conspicuous. Here, they climb and live in trees, a behavior that is relatively unique to this park. In think acacia branches, they can snooze an afternoon away, one eye always open to their surroundings. As you emerge from the trees buffalo will gather on the plains. There will be wildebeest and zebra, plus unruly hippos and tiny dik-diks. After the game drive and lunch at camp, you will leave the park, ascending an hour westward to Ngorongoro Conversation Area.

Enormous elephant bulls may roam past, and you will appreciate their size versus others that you have seen. By 9 a.m. you will be having a coffee and snack alongside a big pod of hippos. It will be by midafternoon that the animals become less active and day-tripping visitors arrive, bringing a lot of noise to the caldera.

Mostly they are wildebeest, which are enthusiastic creatures that are full of energy and so numerous that you will hear a drumroll as their hooves cross the plains. Zebra move in tightly-packed herds, tens of thousands of them creating a blur of black and white stripes. Hyena will follow them, picking out the weak from the herds and dining on those who are unable to keep up. Despite being home to so many animals, large areas of the Serengeti can be quiet. The herds are moving to fresh pastures, and some areas appear barren and almost lifeless. So, a safari in the Serengeti is all about being in the right place at the right time. Being in the right place at the right time is easily achieved by a mobile, tented camp. These camps move with the herds, so they are continually surrounded by the audible drumbeat. Stay in a mobile camp, and you will wake up to grazing animals. You will hear lions and elephants through the night, and you will not need to leave the camp to enjoy the show. All the wildebeest and zebra help to support a huge profusion of predators. The big cats do not follow the migration but wait for it to pass through their territory, so on each Serengeti game drive, you are likely to spot some of the cats.

        "title": "Serengeti – Dramatic Big Game Safari on the Grasslands",
        "description": "Flying into the Serengeti from Arusha is a special experience. The light aircraft cruises at a relatively low altitude, creating wonderful vistas from your window seat. First the peaks of Kilimanjaro and Meru, then the dramatic dome of Ngorongoro Crater, and then the rolling expanse of grasslands that fill the entire panorama. As you descend over the Serengeti, you begin to explore the details, like the rocky outcrops favored by lions or the nomadic elephant herds on the move. And you start to notice the herds, a whole patchwork of mammals stretching out across the plains. Touch down, and it's not long before you're just a few meters away from the animals. Your safari camp is located in the Lamai Wedge in Northern Serengeti, an area that teems with life throughout the year. Quirky and chic, this camp offers the quality of a luxury city hotel without impacting on the feeling of the bush. Think dipping in the pool as wildebeest wander past, gourmet dining beneath the stars watching elephant silhouettes, and sumptuous bedrooms open to the sounds of the wild. Over these two days, you explore, driving across the plains and losing yourself in the enormity of the Serengeti. It's not just a single zebra herd; it's thousands of zebra congregating together. You don't find a few wildebeest; you shake your head in bewilderment at the intense quantity of wildebeest. Thompson's gazelle skip past, impala graze beside your tent, the odd waterbuck bounds away, and it's common to open the curtains and see an elephant. For two days, there is no interruption to the dramatic density of life, whether you're admiring 50 hippos grunting in the river or driving past large towers of giraffes. And then there are the predators. Lions bask on the open plains and most game drives encounter at least a couple of prides. Hold your breath as a lioness approaches the vehicle, inspecting it from all sides before lying down in the shade that's been created. Or feel the goosebumps rise as the pride disappears into the high grass on the trail of a zebra herd. Leopard and cheetah sightings are also outstanding in the Northern Serengeti area, and the local trackers intimately understand their hideouts. Hyenas and jackals are almost as commonplace as the ungulates, bringing further moments of drama as you discover why the Serengeti is one of Africa's most famous and revered safari destinations. As with all days on the safari, all meals are included, and the activities are relatively flexible, enabling them to respond to what's happening on the landscape and your own mood."

        "title": "Grumeti Reserve – Exclusive Safari in the Serengeti",
        "description": "A short flight catapults you from the north to the west, where the Grumeti Reserve provides an exclusive angle to a world-famous destination. This private reserve has an unfenced border with the Serengeti National Park and is on the main wildebeest migration route. While the plains swell with herds for one month a year, Grumeti's resident predators remain all year round. So every safari in this reserve brings very personal encounters with the big cats. Spot a leopard in the tree and the driver leaves the main trail, taking you across the grasslands until the spotted hunter is in full focus. Vultures are circling overhead, and you bump over the plains to see what's happening, driving to a bloodied carcass and the ferocious antics of a hyena cackle. Unlike in the Serengeti, this private reserve allows visitors to go off the trails, getting you even closer to the action. Your mobile safari camp is a throwback to the simplicity and authenticity of safari life. It provides a unique connection, allowing you to appreciate all the subtleties of the land. Each haunting yell, every flickering smell, a complete array of wildlife roaming past uninterrupted; this camp is all about feeling as if you're part of the Serengeti. You may be under canvas, but you won't lack for anything. A private chef and camp host lead the program at the camp, while a private guide customizes a personal program of Serengeti activities. Some days you may want to do everything. On other days, you may just want to sit back and watch the charming procession of life roll by. Excursions provide a freshness to the safari experiences. Travel on horseback, riding along with the herds of zebra and gazelle, becoming another mammal out on the plains. Or journey on foot, a Maasai warrior leading you over the expansive landscape, bringing you intimate moments with a whole array of mammals. Game drives continue the big cat experience, and they can be as long or as short as you choose. Spend a whole day following a lion pride, enjoy a brief morning excursion as a leopard is out hunting, then combine the different activities on a day that encounters zebra and wildebeest from three angles."

        "title": "Katavi National Park – Intimate Safari With Katavi's Huge Herds",
        "description": "After a relaxed morning, you fly from the Serengeti to Katavi, briefly touching down in Tabora to refuel en route. Located in the far west of Tanzania, Katavi is blissfully remote and very difficult to reach by road. Tourism is mostly restricted to fly-in visitors and the accommodation maintains a sense of exclusivity. Arrive for a late lunch, and you'll immediately notice the change in atmosphere on an afternoon walk around the camp. Scattered clumps of trees provide a hideout for a new collection of animals, and it's hard not to notice the evidence left by elephants bulldozing a path through the bush. While the Serengeti is wide and open, Katavi can feel intimate and close, with your safari guided by sound as much as sight. Your safari camp offers the luxury base in this remote land. Enjoy drinks around the crackling campfire, listen to monkeys from the comfort of your bed, find exotic birds landing on your verandah, and savor the dazzling intensity of the night's sky. Next, you take a sunset game drive and watch the big herds of buffalo marching across the land. There can be thousands of them, a burly ball of black fur on their daily journey to water. Prides of lions deliberately clash with the herds' big males. They rouse and jostle the buffalo, an intense animal interaction that results in casualties from both sides. On one evening, you may see the hunters coming out victorious, some lionesses scattering the big males so the others can isolate a young calf. On another evening, the tables have turned, and a lioness is trampled by horns and hooves, the resultant bloodied scars likely to have a fatal consequence. A safari in this part of Katavi revolves around the big herds. Elephants are equally plentiful, and the sight of a 50-strong herd marching past the camp is breathtaking. Here you don't always have to drive to the herds; it's common to see great numbers on the plains in front of your camp. Drives lead you into the trees, where every corner can bring a thrilling intimacy. First an elephant, tusks rising above the vehicle. Then a giraffe, feeding just two meters away. Next, a leopard, descending from the higher branches and exploring the narrow trails. And when you emerge from the canopy and enter the plains, these different species interact in a fervent scene."

        "description": "It's an early start to the morning, a game drive leading you into another section of Katavi. Follow the trails through the forest and hone in on the predator encounters, then emerge on plains of scorched grass that are further from the water. A picnic lunch provides the flexibility to eat wherever is most pleasing to the eye, perhaps at a buffalo herd or maybe with a family of two baby elephants. After lunch, you arrive at a beautiful mobile camp in the midst of the Katavi wilderness. Sit back and all your senses provide discovery; baboon hoots filter in from afar, impala skip by barely five meters away, and the smell of squashed fruit indicates that something has been feeding here recently. With a mobile camp, you are absolutely immersed in the wild, enjoying Africa as it always has been. Necessary comforts are provided, and you have a warm shower, a Western toilet, and a bed raised on a platform. But most of all, you have the Katavi wilderness. The camp doesn't interrupt nature and an evening fire ensures nothing gets too close. For these two days, it's easy to sit in the camping chair and admire the landscape as it unfolds; colobus monkeys swinging past, zebra and elephants meeting on the open plains, storks shouting from the trees, a caracal emerging as you sip on a sundowner. Rather than drive around the area, you explore on foot, constantly maintaining the raw connection with nature."

The hours just after dawn are when most safari landscapes are at their most thrilling, with herds on the move and big cats seeking out a breakfast meal. On a two-week safari program, you quickly settle into the program, often returning for a siesta after the morning activity. After this morning's drive, you stop at the airstrip for a flight to Mahale, where you're picked up in a traditional wooden dhow. Spend 90 minutes cruising down Lake Tanganyika, sailing beneath a carpet of forested mountains. Lunch is enjoyed on board, and you might want to dock at a remote beach for a swim. Your camp is hidden beneath the trees, miles from any road or form of civilization. The backdrop is all green, a thick awning that rises across the rugged peaks. The foreground is white and blue, the soft sandy beach connecting with Africa's second-largest lake. This afternoon is free, with options for a dhow cruise, a fishing excursion, or a snooze on the private beach."

Every trekking group is limited to six and the recently habituated chimpanzee troops remain curious and inquisitive. For these two days, you spend the mornings meeting the chimps, then the afternoons resting the legs on a dhow cruise. Trackers lead you up the narrow mountain trails, taking you deep beneath the canopy into a land of mystique and surprise. Other primates are spotted on the way, like monkeys and baboons that also occupy the forest. Sometimes it takes 30 minutes to reach the chimps, yet the hike could also be three hours long. These are wild animals, and their location can't be predicted. You usually hear them first, either their rustling or animated verbal calls. A couple more corners and you see one, perhaps an old male snoozing against a tree trunk. Step a little closer, watching in adoration as the entire troop comes into view. A baby is cradled to a mother's bosom, human-like fingers nimbly pick fruit, brothers share an inquisitive grin, and it's impossible not to be moved by the emotions on display. It feels like you can read what the chimpanzees are thinking just by watching the movement of the lips and the look in the eyes. You're just meters away, watching them swing and forage, play and squabble, eat and do their own thing in the trees."

Rwanda has had a turbulent history and a visit to the Genocide Memorial Center increases admiration for the country and its people. Almost 20% of the population was slaughtered during a three-month period in 1994. Yet, 20 years later, the peacefulness and genuine hospitality of Rwandans is a highlight of visiting the country. In the afternoon, you'll head into the lush land of a thousand hills, driving through the vibrant valleys of Ruhengeri on route to Kinigi. Every turn brings another stunning view, while the local sights of rural Rwanda have an indelible charm. Mud and straw huts dot the hills, gazing down on fresh grazing pastures. Wandering livestock often covers the road, while colorfully dressed women carry baskets of bananas on their heads. It takes two hours to reach Ruhengeri, then another spectacular twenty minutes of driving to reach Kinigi and the base of the Sabyinyo Mountain. The precise shapes of the Virunga Volcanoes provide the backdrop, their high mountain craters dominating a vividly green landscape. Your lodge is one of the most luxurious bases for viewing gorillas, and the lodge's income is used to finance local community development including water, health, and education projects. Situated on the edge of the Parc National des Volcans, gazing out onto rich rainforest, this lodge combines elegance with style. On clear days the views are spectacular. At other times, a mysterious blanket of mist dances over the treetops. Gorilla trekking isn't the only activity on offer here, and you'll also have opportunities to visit the lodge's community and conservation projects, the bustling markets of Ruhengeri, beautiful alpine lakes, and the genocide memorial."

        "title": "Virunga Mountains – Unforgettable Gorilla Trekking in the Parc National des Volcans",
        "description": "Gorilla trekking offers perhaps the most exhilarating and touching wildlife experience on the planet. Less than 1,000 wild gorillas remain, and roughly half of the world's population live on the Rwandan slopes of the Virunga Volcanoes. You'll first take a short drive to the Parc National des Volcans headquarters and meet your excellent local guides and trackers. They'll provide a talk on gorilla etiquette and lead the journey to these critically endangered primates. Enjoy a fresh cup of local coffee and a traditional dance from a local cultural group before setting off. The overgrown forests of the Virungas offer a true wilderness that has remained untouched by human hands. The terrain can be rough and sometimes muddy, while the undulating slopes mean occasionally steep climbs. Trekking can last from one to four hours depending on the gorillas' location, and although this can be physically demanding, the thrill of the adventure and the breathtaking beauty of the forest make it worthwhile. You'll first trek to where the gorillas were seen the night before, then your trackers use their impressive skills to locate them. Any fatigue from the hike is then immediately forgotten as you get your first glimpse. But gorilla trekking isn't about stealing a glimpse through the trees. On every trek you will see a whole gorilla troop and spend an hour admiring them. People are officially allowed to come up to seven meters from the gorillas. This is more than close enough to appreciate their phenomenal size and power. Great silverbacks thump their chests, emitting an impelling sound that is difficult to describe with words. Sharp black eyes return your stare, the gorillas watching you as much as you watch them. Individuals interact, playfully continuing their day and not bothered by your snapping cameras. Then there are the cute babies, suckling their mothers or cheerfully rolling around the forest floor. This is one of the world's greatest natural experiences and chatting about the gorillas' behavior will continue long into the night. Note: gorilla trekking permits are not included"

A second gorilla trek will take you to a different part of the pristine forest and a new group of gorillas. On these treks waterproof clothing is essential, as is a waterproof bag for your camera. Note that plastic bags are illegal in Rwanda and any brought from outside the country will be confiscated if discovered at customs. Even when it rains, the forest has a mysterious serenity, the landscape helping to slow down the heart rate as you approach your second gorilla troop. In many ways the second trek is more enjoyable than the first. On your first encounter with gorillas it's sometimes too much to take in. Even when you descend back to the lodge you're constantly pinching yourself and wondering whether the experience was actually real. On your second trek you'll have another full hour with these unforgettable primates. And this time you can really savor the experience. A silverback sits on the forest floor, just a single tree branch between him and your quivering camera. Some forage through a clearing on their knuckles, while others lounge in the trees just above your head. It's impossible not to be awed by both their beauty, and the real sense of how closely related these creatures are to humans. Poignant, thrilling, and achingly real; few experiences in the world can compare to gorilla trekking. After your second trek you'll be transferred back to Kigali.

You'll be transferred to Nairobi's Wilson Airport for a morning flight that takes you into the heart of the Maasai Mara where you will enjoy three full days of game drives in this unforgettable landscape. In this classic savanna, grass grows at phenomenal rates. This makes it a haven for millions of four hoofed mammals, and such numbers attract an astonishing collection of big cats. Zebra and wildebeest herds dot the plains, their numbers almost hiding the grass below. They're joined by Thompson's gazelle and impala, these graceful antelopes always having their ears and eyes open for the danger that surrounds them. Lion prides lounge in the open, the kings of this environment not shy to show off their power. A lazy yawn reveals humongous teeth while graceful females slowly stalk their prey on the plains. Leopards are equally deadly, and the sight of one out hunting is one of nature's great spectacles. Hyenas saunter through the grass, while wild dogs, cheetahs, and jackals, also find prey in this flourishing landscape. The interaction between predator and prey mark every day in the Maasai Mara, and this intensifies during July to October when the Great Migration brings two million wildebeest, Thompson's gazelle, and zebra to the fresh grass of the Maasai Mara. They're escorted by more predators, and this time of year always offers plenty of raw hunting scenes. There are more treats in store. Herds of elephant ignore the predators, rove throughout the plains and exert their dominance at waterholes. Hippos sink into cooling pools or roll around muddy embankments. Endangered black rhino stop and stare at the safari truck, their impressive horns and armored frames always leaving an impression. The often forgotten last member of the African Big Five is the buffalo, and there will be plenty of these bushy-haired beasts grazing on the grass. As well as the safari truck, it's also possible to see it all from above in a hot air balloon ride. In the Maasai Mara there are no fences or barriers. Animal life continues as it always has, and the spectacles often have a dreamlike feel."

This inactive volcanic crater has a remarkable concentration of wildlife. Thick woodland on the crater slopes is home to rhino, elephant, and leopard. A flat crater floor is covered in impala, buffalo, eland, and numerous other antelopes. Lion prides live in close proximity, and it's extremely rare to visit Ngorongoro Crater without spotting at least one of them. Then a lake shimmers pink beneath the sun, innumerable flamingo flooding your vision as you descend into the crater. Perched on the crater rim, the views from your lodge are legendary. From here the wildlife never stops, particularly when elephants and zebra regularly pass at dusk. Look down into the imperious crater from your luxury suite, while Maasai warrior guards ensure the wildlife never gets too close. In the early morning, there is often a sensational layer of mist in the crater. Descending through it is like entering a mythical world. Lions are returning from a hunt, great numbers of hippo frolic on the mud beside the lake, while black rhino grunt and pace through the grass. Ngorongoro is known as Africa's “Garden of Eden” and once in the crater there is always a 360º view of the volcanic slopes. That means that all the wildlife is visible with just one sweep of the binoculars. The question is which way to look. Maybe at the buffalo herd and their impressive curled horns? Perhaps at the 100 bird species that live along the lake's edge, or at the majestic hartebeest beside the truck? A lion pride lounges in the shade beside the path, but turn around quickly to find that a hyena has stopped barely meters from the safari truck. Not only does Ngorongoro have the Big Five and an indelible supporting cast, but it can all be offered in just one game drive. After arriving at the lodge on day nine, you'll have the whole of day ten to explore the wonders of this UNESCO World Heritage site."

But head out at this hour, and it's eventful in the bush. Antelopes don't graze. They stop and listen, fearful of a predatory approach. Elephants bash into trees and hundreds of giraffe feed silently. Morning is the premier time of day for a game drive, a time when big cats are on the move, and big mammals are feeding with abandon. The grass moves, and camouflage is betrayed. Keep watching and it's another minute before the next rustle. But now the sighting is unmistakable. Just ten meters away there's a cheetah concealing itself amongst the green. Perhaps the impala get scared, and you don't see more than this. But on some mornings, you watch a whole stalking and hunting scene play out. Today is spent on a long game drive into the far reaches of Tarangire National Park. You'll take a deluxe picnic and eat with a view over a waterhole or elephant herd. Like all game viewing, the drive is flexible, and you can return to the camp at a time that suits you. Some prefer to stay out in the bush until sunset. Others prefer to spend the afternoon relaxing at camp, watching the mammals roam past. Like each camp, your tent has wooden floors, an ensuite hot shower (solar powered), and a flushing toilet. The camp provides luxury that doesn't interrupt the natural setting."

        "title": "Lake Manyara to Ngorongoro Highlands - Exquisite Beauty",
        "description": "Driving to Lake Manyara really feels like old Africa. Villages of mud huts are scattered around a rugged road that weaves through the Manyara forest. Elephant hooting can be heard in the distance while some of the park's 500 bird species begin to flutter overhead. Once inside the park gate, there are hundreds of baboons marching around, including babies clinging to mothers' undersides. Then, you see giraffe and buffalo herds as the trees rescind, and the resplendent lake comes into view. Framed by forested cliffs and sprinkled with pink flamingos, the lake offers one of Africa's most picturesque panoramas; Hemingway once described it as “the loveliest place I have seen in Africa.” But get closer, and you're engrossed in the antics of rowdy hippos. Males push and fight for wading space, and the air is punctuated by their distinct wheeze-honks. Another Manyara speciality is the tree-climbing lion. Only in a handful of African parks have the lions evolved to climb trees and survey their kingdom from towering branches. It's a surreal sighting when the maned predator is napping leisurely some ten meters from the ground. Following a full day game drive, you'll exit from the north of the park and ascend into the Ngorongoro Highlands to your charming property that has stunning views over the Great Rift Escarpment and is well positioned for an early-morning start in Ngorongoro Crater tomorrow."

        "description": "Descending into Ngorongoro Crater is one of Africa's most unforgettable experiences. All sides of the extinct caldera are visible as you zigzag down towards the pink-dapped lake. Wild sightings are immediate. Lion prides are on the prowl, lone elephant bulls are marching around, and rare black rhinos graze peacefully in the morning air. There are only a few thousand of these critically endangered rhinos left, and Ngorongoro is a famous place to spot them. In comparison, there's over a million wildebeest and you see herds of them kicking up dust as they gallop across the crater floor. Other than giraffe, the compact crater is home to all the most revered African safari animals. The question isn't what you'll find, but which way to look. Admire the black rhinos for too long and you might miss a pride tearing up a zebra carcass. Stare at the buffalo herd, then turn around and a spotted hyena is just two meters from the vehicle. In just five or six hours, you can fully explore this World Heritage Site and its distinct habitats. Enjoy your picnic lunch overlooking a pool of hippos, spot Maasai warriors herding their cattle down to the floor, and watch the tense interaction between lionesses and wildebeest. After ascending from the crater, you spend the late-afternoon and night at your gorgeous property that's regularly visited by wild game."

        "description": "Unlike some national parks, Ngorongoro Crater is shared by both wild animals and local people. Some 40,000 Maasai live in the conservation area, continuing their ancestral pastoral way of life. Today, you have a rare invitation to spend the afternoon with one of these communities. Over 20 mud and cow dung huts are built in a circle, facing inwards to create their traditional village, or boma . The locals welcome you with songs and dances. The Maasai’s vibrant jewelry and red blankets are a wonderful contrast to the red earth beneath your feet. These legendary people are fiercely resisting the “reeducation” paradigm that's being forced upon them, and they continue to practice a lifestyle unchanged for millennia. You'll spend a few hours at the home of these legendary people, intimately witnessing what life is life for the Maasai. Before this cultural interaction, you'll visit the Shifting Sands, a series of strange black dunes composed of volcanic ash."

        "description": "The grass begins as you drive from Ngorongoro to the Serengeti. There are hyena scurrying across the grass, zebra herds grazing on the grass, gazelle skipping over the grass, and balls of dust emerging where wildebeest maraud across the grass. These grasslands are home to the great wildebeest migration and the largest number of mammals found anywhere on the planet. You're staying in the Grumeti Reserve on the western fringe of the park, so today is spent crossing the Serengeti from the east. It's a journey that's hard to forget. See a dark clump in the distance, and then get close to watch it unravel into a 10,000 strong herd of wildebeest. Rise over a mound and there are perhaps 100,000 mammals within your panorama: eland, topi, impala, Grant's gazelle, buffalo, wildebeest, zebra, and more. And in Africa, having so many of those with four hooves means an abundant number of those with four paws. Your accommodations are perched on a hill above the Serengeti and offers adoring views over the grass plains. There's even a swimming pool with panoramic views. As it's located in a private reserve, rather than the national park, a number of different activities enhance the game viewing. Over the next four days, you'll be able to customize an itinerary of game drives, nighttime drives, village visits, hot air balloon journeys, and walking safaris. Each provides a new angle on this world-famous wilderness. It takes a whole day to cross the Serengeti and reach the camp. But it's not a drive along the asphalt. It's a game drive that brings an unfathomable abundance of wildlife sightings."

        "description": "Rumbling across the grass, you see thousands of wildebeest. The herd is kicking up dust as they migrate north towards the Maasai Mara. A few miles later, there are thousands of zebra. The herd moves slowly and deliberately as it paints the Serengeti black and white. A dozen hyenas are seen around the herds' periphery while a large lion pride watches and waits for the ungulates to approach. Drive a little further, and you see a leopard hiding in the grass, solemnly dipping its neck before it launches an attack. The numbers and the scale are baffling, especially when you're in the heart of it all. However, the Serengeti is also a place of elevated intimacy. In a 1,000-strong zebra herd, you can focus on so many scenes of emotion, from the pairs who rest their necks on each other’s backs to the babies who are constantly spooked. For these three days, the Serengeti is your playground, and the battle between predator and prey is almost unending. On game drives, you can track the jaws of hungry cats. While on walking safaris, you can safely encounter an eclectic array of ungulates. The parks' scale is showcased with a hot air balloon ride while a nighttime drive sharpens the senses to the sounds and smells of the hunts. Customize your program, and experience a natural theater laced in drama and charm. And don't expect to see many other tourists. By staying in a private reserve, these experiences will be exclusive. It's just you and over a million mammals."

A sumptuous lunch is served, complete with the odd elephant wandering past and a glorious view into this renowned Natural Wonder of Africa. All safari activities on this itinerary are completely private and tailored to your pace and style; so there's no need to rush or wait for others. Zigzag down onto the crater floor and the sights arrive with startling frequency; two lion cubs running after their mother, a boisterous buffalo herd protecting their young, zebra and kudu skipping across flourishing grasslands. Stand on the chairs and gaze out into the distance. Then move away from the edge and hold each other close as a lion pride inspects the safari truck. Are they hungry? No, they just want to lie down in the shade of your vehicle. Ngorongoro's diverse ecosystems support a dramatic diversity of animal life. Out in the forest you'll find the elephants, huge bulls that pierce the silence with echoing calls. Down at the lake a pink blankets awaits, tens of thousands of flamingos glistening beneath the sun. On the first inclines of the crater walls you stand and hold your breath. A mother and calf are approaching, grey hulks of power moving with effortless grace. Volcanic remnants provide the backdrop and a scurrying hyena plays second fiddle in the periphery. Time seems to stand still as the pair approach, the clicking of camera shutters on pause as two endangered Black rhino continue their elegant journey across Ngorongoro. That's not a bad start to a romantic escape. But it is just the start. By evening time you’re sitting beside a roaring log fire watching the odd elephant wander past and enjoying the discreet services of your own personal butler. By nighttime you're snuggled into a spacious wooden hut, perched on the crater rim, and absorbing nature's unique soundtrack."

        "description": "Ngorongoro Crater is too good to only see once. As the mist slowly rises you descend again, heading onto the crater floor at prime hunting time. In the insipid morning light there's an air of tension, the ungulates on high alert as the cats inspect the breakfast menu. Stop in a clearing and wait. Be patient. Slowly the lionesses inch forward, half concealed by the grass yet camouflage betrayed by revealing eyes. A few more meters are gained, then a few more, but the sentry wakes from a slumber and raises the alarm. Dust mixes with the last trickles of mist and the zebra accelerate away. This is wild African safari without fences. It's not a zoo or wildlife documentary, so the outcome of this morning hunt will be different for every visitor. A long morning game drive enables you to fully experience the intricacy and intimacy of Ngorongoro, and before you head into the Serengeti, you'll enjoy an early lunch back at the lodge. Endless grass plains replace rolling hills as you arrive in the Serengeti, the planet's most famous safari destination seeming to extend for infinity. Dark clumps are scattered across the green. They're grazing wildebeest herds, joined on the plains by Thompson's gazelle and zebra. By now you'll already know that an abundance of four hooves means an abundance of four paws. The next two nights are spent at Sanctuary Kusini, located in a less visited corner of the park. You're far from tourist crowds and your luxuriant en suite tent is as isolated as you could possibly wish for. It's just you, your partner, and unforgettable panoramas over what the local Maasai call “where the land runs on forever.” Elevating the romance this evening is a candlelit dinner out on these plains, the silhouettes of nature's great mammals seeming to surround the table. There are no other diners around, but there could be a few antelopes and elephants passing by the table of your private Serengeti restaurant."

Perched on a grassy mound overlooking a blue pool, zebras skip past and a few giraffe towers dominate the horizon. If that isn’t enough, the pool is covered in hippos, including rampaging teenage males testing their power and cute babies snuggling beside their mothers. Today's game drive goes at your pace so there are a thousand different directions it can take. One certain feature is the immersion in nature's greatest show, the battle between predator and prey a focal point of every journey in the Serengeti. And while today will unveil scale and size, there's a nonstop delivery of intimate moments that always bring memorable smiles. It could be a baby elephant chasing a warthog.

Loliondo Game Controlled Area shares unfenced borders with the Serengeti and, while the wild game isn't quite as abundant here (hardly a problem in this part of the world), not being a national park opens up new experiences. You'll be exploring on foot, picking up on the trail of leopards, lions, hyenas, and the rest of the cast of the animal kingdom. It's an amorous stroll with a difference. Rather than getting lost, you're searching for things. An expert guide follows the clues and leads your journey, picking a path through thick forests and winding grass plains. An upturned stone, a bulldozed tree, a pile of fresh dung, and now standing before you is a small elephant herd. Stop. Stay silent. Say hello in your own way. Then the elephants move on and your walk stumbles upon a gentle giraffe and a lost buffalo. A contradictory feeling of fantasy and reality is elevated and enhanced as you continually shake your head at the implausibility of the experience. Following the thrills comes indulgent relaxation, a stunning en suite tent at Buffalo Luxury Camp offering unrivaled views into the wilderness and all its nuances."

You can't really visit Tanzania at the wrong time of year for the migration. The herds are moving and congregating throughout the year, chaperoned, as ever, by a ravenous assortment of big cats and scavengers. But dependent on when you come, the wildebeest will be in a different part of the park. Your final day of safari has a particular focus on the great migration. The exact destination is flexible dependent upon the time of year, and you're likely to drive across the park in search of the huge herds. Expect dozens of hunting scenes, herds that merge and cover the grass in a patchwork of activity, hyenas and vultures fighting over carcasses, and rumblings of dust mingling with vivid landscapes. When departure dates are finalized the itinerary for this day will be expanded depending on the predicated location of the wildebeest."

Simba means lion , Nala translates as gift , Rafiki is friend, and Kiara , Simba's daughter, is a word that means bright or clear . Mufasa means king in the Manazoto language, not Swahili. Hakuna Matata really does translate to no worries , but it is now an antiquated phrase. If you want to impress the locals, you should instead say Hakuna Shida , which is a more modern way to suggest trouble-free living.

Their slow and precise movements are usually followed by ungulate shrieks and clouds of dust. On other drives, you may see the aftermath, such as lions that are eating their fill or scavengers that are battling over scraps.

        "description": "The Serengeti can initially appear to be as fictional as the Pride Lands. Grasslands extend in all directions, and they are carpeted by hundreds of thousands of animals. Wildebeest move in large herds, kicking up dust as their hooves create a melodic drumbeat. Elephants and giraffes dominate the horizons and are sometimes silhouetted against a rising or setting sun. Birdlife and wildlife proliferate around watering holes, kindling joyous scenes from the movie. Hyenas snarl and harass the herds while monkeys clamber around the trees, shouting advice to other animals. In Mufasa, Rafiki is a trusted confidant of the lions, but in reality, monkeys provide an early warning system to the grazers, using their high perches to call out the whereabouts of lurking predators. Along with the animals, the other interruption to all seemingly endless grass is kopjes. You will witness one kopje and will exclaim that it is Pride Rock. Lion prides laze around sun-scorched boulders, dozing with one eye open. After an hour at one kopje, your game drive will continue and you see another. Here, there will be another lion pride. A little further along and you will encounter another kopje, another pride, and another incredible similarity between the Serengeti and the Pride Lands. This is one of Africa’s ultimate safari destinations, and the scale is unfathomable. More than 2 million wild animals live here on a landscape of a similar size to New Jersey state. You can spend 30 minutes driving slowly among a giant wildebeest herd, and in a single panorama, there can be more than 50,000 zebras. Over three days, it will be difficult to keep track of all the big cat sightings with lion prides being accompanied by cheetahs, leopards, jackals, and the abundant hyenas. Often, you must pause during your drive because the four-wheel drive trail is completely blocked by buffalos, elephants, or giraffes. Many of these animal sightings continue back at your camp as well. You are not watching the big screen but will be placed center stage on a landscape with more wild mammals than anywhere else in Africa. It is also here that you can follow the real animal stories such as lions that are searching for a meal, wildebeest bulls that are competing in a show of dominance, and warthogs that are scurrying away from trunk-swinging baby elephants. On both of these days, you will take a packed lunch and spend most of the daylight hours on game drives, piecing together a wildlife reality that is as surreal as Disney’s fiction."

        "description": "This morning, you will fly out of the Serengeti from Grumeti airstrip, which is located in the west of the park. You will have time for a final moment with your Pride Rock, rediscovering Mufasa's journey to rule over the land, with possible glimpses of lion cubs playfully annoying their sleeping parents. By leaving to the west, you will also experience how the Pride Lands can become the Bad Lands. Not everywhere is luscious and green in the Serengeti. Large swathes have been grazed to nothing by the herds. Experiencing the contrast is essential, and in some areas, you will find lavish landscapes and ebullient wildlife behavior. In others, you get a sense of a darker, more dangerous side, where the battle for survival has a penetrating urgency. After a short flight back to Kilimanjaro, you will fly across the border to Kenya and indulge in a relaxing night in Nairobi."

Today’s two experiences will give you a glimpse into wildlife conservation and the plight of species whose continued existence is under serious threat. The Giraffe Centre rehabilitates rare and highly endangered Rothschild giraffes, providing you the opportunity to feed and even pet the giants. Then, at Daphne Sheldrick Elephant Orphanage, you can enjoy the iconic feeling of a trunk as it drapes over your shoulder. These experiences are followed by a leisurely afternoon at your accommodation or in the city. It could be an excellent chance to reminisce on your safari adventure so far and get ready for four more days in the wilderness."

        "description": "Amazingly, Disney screenwriters and motion animators were in for some surprises as they began studying the movement of animals in the wild. In a zoo, you can see captive animals in a confined and humanmade habitat. In East Africa, you can discover how these animals truly move, running free across untouched landscapes. The area around Lake Naivasha was ideal for animators as they could really live among the animals since there are no lions or other dangerous predators. On day nine, you will take a beautiful drive through the Great Rift Valley to the shores of Lake Naivasha, where four-legged mammals roam around the lakeshore. Animals like zebras and wildebeests will move away from a noisy vehicle, but they are rarely perturbed by anybody nearing on foot. Over these two days, you can literally walk and cycle with the herds. These animals tend to appear to be far larger when you are not in a vehicle. Antelopes such as hartebeest graze close to you and gazelles skip past. Your walking safari on Crescent Island will be complemented by a walking and cycling safari in the nearby Hell's Gate National Park on day 10. As the park is not home to predators, the animals are much less skittish and bashful. Two animals are seen in abundance around your camp and will help you understand the character, Rafiki . On the screen, he is a mix of baboon and black and white colobus monkey. You will come to know both and will often see these primates as they swing through the trees above your lodge."

At the beginning of the original Lion King film, Victoria Falls is shown in the mystical scene of birds fluttering past a roaring wall of gushing water. There is now a direct flight that connects this natural wonder to Nairobi. You will touch down and will quickly learn the real name for the world’s longest, continuous curtain of falling water. It is known as Mosi-oa-Tunya, or The Smoke That Thunders , and from miles away, you can hear the waterfall growl and see a cloud of mist that rises evocatively from the Zambezi River. After settling into your lodge this afternoon, there will time for a game drive in Zambezi National Park before a night of dining beneath the stars along the riverfront."

        "description": "Just like in the movies, the experiences are not only visual. Out on the plains, you can be guided by sounds. Trumpets alert you to elephants nearby as their orchestral trunks precede a rumbustious move through the forest. Hoots and breaking branches will guide you to a dramatic battle between two baboon troops, and a distant yelp may suggest quarrels between zebras, while an echoed crunch indicates that antelopes may be clashing. You will also smell the safari, especially when you stay for almost two weeks in Africa. On the first day or two, you will be checking off famous animals and scenes, much like re-watching The Lion King for the umpteenth time. However, by day 12, you will be seeking out subtleties behind the storylines. After a morning game drive, you will culminate your vacation with a Victoria Falls visit, where you will journey through the trees and can feel the mist as it rains down upon you. You can also tune your senses to the smells and sounds of a waterfall that befits its original name. Victoria Falls may be known as a site for adventure, but the prevailing atmosphere is very much like the movie’s opening credits. There is real tranquility here, as you stand in awe at the scale of Mother Nature. So, after the adventurous days in the Pride Lands and Carefree Lands, you now have some time to really kick back and absorb wild Africa for one final time, especially during a Zambezi river cruise this afternoon."

        "description": "The Serengeti's scale can be difficult to comprehend. Crossing the park by road can take most of two days. Even by air, it's close to two hours from the town of Arusha in the east to Grumeti Reserve in the far west. On the flight, you gaze down on the spherical cone of Ngorongoro Crater, admire the patchwork of herds on the plains below, and track the great migration by inspecting the color of the grass. Scorched yellow is where they've grazed; thick green clumps are where they will eventually go. Touch down and the short transfer to your next lodge property is also a game drive and a chance to encounter the big mammals for the first time. Just gazing out from your luxurious suite is also a safari as the property stands on a hill that overlooks the Serengeti. Swarovski binoculars and telescopes are dotted around for when you want a closer look. Your second lodge is the most opulent of all the Serengeti accommodation and the flagship property of Grumeti. Think spa treatments while overlooking the herds, relaxing in a private plunge pool as elephants grace the horizon, and chandeliers hanging from the ceiling as lion roars perforate the stillness. Each of the seven suites is extremely private, with personal verandahs and lounge areas; it's easy to go two days without seeing the other guests here. Your itinerary is flexible, with the type and timing of safari activities dictated by your mood and interests. As you've just arrived in the Serengeti, an afternoon game drive is recommended for today. Explore the private concession and find a pair of cheetahs basking in the grass. Watch hippos quarrel in the Grumeti River, find a lion pride wandering over the plains, and stop alongside huge elephant bulls. On the first safari day, the experience is likely to be about encounters with the giants, and Grumeti never disappoints in this regard."

Safari walks are led by Maasai guides, providing an inspiring angle to see antelopes and even larger animals like elephants. Morning and afternoon game drives continue your experience with the big cats while nighttime game drives reveal the Serengeti beneath the moonlight, with the herds drifting into silhouettes along the horizon. Your program is private and completely flexible; local guides will explain the options when you're at the lodge.

        "description": "The Serengeti's fame is justified, and already you'll have experienced why this is the landscape that's been captured on so many wildlife documentaries. Animals stretch out across the ecosystem, some of them on the move (the great wildebeest migration) and others sticking to their home realms. As the plains roll north they meet the Mara River in far northern Serengeti, before continuing into Kenya's Maasai Mara. Herds congregate here throughout the year, feasting on flourishing grass and maintaining an astonishing number of predators. Yet there aren't many other tourists exploring this part of the Serengeti. Why? Inaccessibility keeps this area untouched. The mainland entry to the Serengeti is in the southeast, a two or three-day drive from the far north. As such, this stunning part of the ecosystem is only really visited by people on fly-in safaris. A light aircraft brings you north, and you touch down in the heart of undulating bushland. From May to October, the resident animals are joined by the mass herds of the great wildebeest migration. Crocodiles and hippos rest in the Mara River, and every so often, thousands of wildebeest brave the river crossing. Lions are heard at night, and they're difficult to miss on the plains, the resident kings regularly approaching your safari vehicle. Leopards and cheetahs are also in abundance, and this is a prime place to spot the cats on a hunt. Sometimes you see a flurry of circling vultures and find the remains of a carcass being ripped apart by hyenas. On another occasion, you might see the lionesses stalking an unsuspecting herd of Thomson's gazelle. After checking into camp, you spend the day on a private game drive, exploring an area rich in life."

A swimming pool hangs over the plains, and it's regularly visited by thirsty elephants. Floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors allow you to watch passing wildlife from the four-poster bed. Spacious and stylish, the suites feature vast decks with day beds and views over the Mara River. The camp is part wilderness Serengeti and part contemporary Western luxury, epitomized when you hear a hippo grazing nearby when you're relaxing in your free-standing bath. You will enjoy private game drives, usually skirting along the Mara River and admiring all the wildlife that comes for a drink. Giraffes lope past, hartebeest and kudu herds meet at the water, and there's always a sense of menace in the air. With the rising grasses and undulating bushland, the area is perfect for an ambush, meaning the antelopes graze with ears wide open and big cats are regularly spotted flickering through the grass. Move slowly and patiently and the most revered of safari sights are revealed. The timings are flexible, but most visitors opt for morning and afternoon game drives with siesta time during the hottest part of the day."

        "title": "Serengeti National Park – Luxury Fly-In Mobile Camp",
        "description": "The clue to where to find the great wildebeest migration is in the name. Animals are migrating, constantly on the move as they perform an annual loop of the Serengeti and Maasai Mara. Scientists remain unsure over the exact numbers, but some estimate up to two million wildebeest, zebra, and Thomson's gazelle are grazing these plains, joined by hyenas and vultures that follow the journey. The migration follows a loosely predictable route, but the exact timings are dictated by increasingly unpredictable rains. For example, when the rains come a month early, many visitors end up at a camp that the migration has already passed. To truly enjoy the show, you will also have to be on the move. Luxury mobile camps follow the migration, packing up and moving every week to ensure they're always surrounded by the largest herds. There's only one guest tent, the experience fully exclusive for you and your partner. There are obvious logistical issues to providing luxury in the remote African bush, but the camp is fitted with all the necessary comforts, including hot showers, flushing toilets, four-poster beds, and dining tables beneath the stars. It's not a luxurious lodge. However, the sense of being in the wild is exquisite. Close your eyes and you can hear the wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of mouths grazing the grass, or over a million hooves beating a path across the Serengeti. Fly into the camp and these two days are spent enveloped by nature's greatest show. Often you don't need a game drive, as mass herds of wildebeest and zebra can be spotted from the camp. Crackling fires and park rangers keep the predators at a safe distance, but you are likely to hear the odd lion roar at night (their shouts can reverberate for three or four miles). Private game drives help you track the migration's movements, bringing more redolent scenes of predators chasing prey. Other giants regularly grace your safari, like nomadic elephant bulls and large herds of rumbustious buffalo, who seem unimpressed that the wildebeest are taking their pastures."

Just ten opulent suites make your camp, an expressive property that is stylistically much more like a lodge than a camp. The accommodation is built from stone, with thatch cottages that are generously spaced and come with a private butler. It's all set in a 10,000-hectare private concession, so you feel like you have the whole of the eastern Serengeti to yourself. Rooms evoke impressions of old-world colonial Africa, with thick rugs, big chairs to lounge in, and a fire pit for nights beneath the stars. Rising on the rocky slopes of the Kuka Hills, enjoy spectacular views of the Serengeti, Maasai Mara, plus an acacia woodland to the east. Local bird life is prolific and ten minutes spent in the pool often brings a view of elephants and buffalos. Spend some time relaxing at the camp and then step into the wild in the late afternoon. A Maasai warrior guides your journey, elucidating the tricks of animal tracking and providing intimate moments with a whole flurry of game. Stand beside a zebra herd, admire the horns of hartebeest, watch baboons and colobus monkeys rove past you, and then stop in silence as a buffalo herd graces the trail. With Klein's Camp as the luxurious base, a Maasai-guided walking safari continues the raw impressions of the Serengeti at its most untouched."

If there are any elusive animals you have yet to see then the guide will tailor private game drives that search for them. Or if you have an adorable favorite, the safari focus can be on more close-up encounters. Walking safaris and nighttime drives remain a possibility, and the game drives have an added bonus of being able to travel off the trail. Alternatively, today could be about lounging in the pool, gazing over the Serengeti and Maasai Mara, and making sense of everything you've just experienced."

It can feel like you are wading or swimming in a bath, such as temperature and lack of currents. At high tide, the waters may be a little high for swimming, but during all other times, this will be a very safe place to float and swim, whatever your age. Another highlight of the eastern coast is the picture that will be created at low tide. The ocean will recede, and you will be able to walk across water that is ankle to knee deep. Coral outcrops will stud the water and will be populated by swarms of tropical fish, so at certain times of day, you can experience diverse marine life without needing to put on a snorkel. The other first impression there will be tranquility. This side of the island is undeveloped and little will break the silence.

Zanzibar’s most famous beach resort is Nungwe, where the hotels now extend two to three rows back from the sand. In comparison, everything along the southeastern is directly on the coast. Resorts stretch over vast areas, so every bungalow has space to breathe. Nothing is more than two stories high, and almost everything is constructed in a traditional style, with whitewashed walls, thatched roofing, and large windows to bring in the ocean breeze. Many visitors find the beach a little too hot for sunbathing. The common tactic here is to lie on one of the loungers outside of your bungalow where there is some shade from the trees, should you need it, and a glorious view towards the ocean. After a day of resting up, you will head to one of Zanzibar’s most elegant restaurants. Built onto an isolated coral outcrop, your restaurant will have to be accessed by a short transfer from the beach.

Joining them in the trees are Sykes monkeys, which is a more mischievous species that is likely to be seen along the ground. While the colobuses are elegant and unperturbed, lounging almost mythically in the canopy, Sykes are balls of energy that often cause the resident duikers to gallop off. Jozani Chwaka Bay National Park is on route to Stone Town, and the walking trails will be flat and smooth, and you usually will only need to walk for five minutes to start encountering monkeys. You will arrive in Stone Town for lunch and will spend the afternoon exploring. Stone Town not big as the alleyways are barely wide enough for the donkey carts to pass. You can end up walking endlessly because it will be so easy to get lost, and modern GPS cannot help you either. The locals know the way, so you will join a guide and take in the evocative atmosphere, from spices and traders in Darajani Market to the House of Wonders and the Old Fort.

Mangapwani Coral Cave is similarly gloomy, which is another home to the souls of the stolen. Throughout the 19th century, these caves were used in illicit slave trading, and their hidden entrances allowed traders to quietly load their stock without being seen. An intoxicating array of fresh smells will bring you around from this murky story. Cloves, cardamom, pepper, lemongrass, nutmeg, vanilla will be floating throughout the air as you take your tour of the plantation. Fruit plantations also thrive here, and you will walk through fields of banana trees, mountains of oranges, jackfruit, custard fruit, star fruit, avocado, papaya, and many others. Traders brought these spices and fruits from South America and Asia. Although not native to the island, these imports have thrived in tropical conditions, giving Zanzibar the nickname of the Spice Island.

You can take an excursion of Ngezi Forest where monkeys and small antelope roam, or maybe take a dhow trip to Misali island, returning at sunset time. Surrounding you during these two days is a classic island landscape with palms that reach far higher than buildings and trademark Indian Ocean colors. These will be quiet days, so remove your shoes, appreciate the silence and seclusion, and enjoy the island atmosphere."

You will fly by light aircraft and land in the wilderness on an airstrip that must often be cleared of wildlife. Your camp will move with the great wildebeest migration, so you will be staying in the area that is the thickest with life. After all, the downtime will prepare you for an adventure, so you will set off on a game drive immediately, bumping around the grasslands for initial experiences with the famous, migratory herds. Wildebeest tend to spread out in great, straggly herds while the zebra are packed together, much like a panorama of black and white stripes that are watched by local predators."

        "description": "The Serengeti makes safari easy. Although the national park is larger than the state of New Jersey, animals move with the rains and cluster in different areas that depend on the time of year. This is the famous wildebeest migration, with nearly two million animals that are constantly on the move. Other than hyenas and vultures, predators do not follow the herds. Instead, they wait for the migration to pass through their territory and fatten up on the abundance of prey. So, while the initial panorama is filled with wildebeest and zebra, you will only need to look a little further to spot lion prides, leopards, cheetahs, and other wild cats. Your safari will be private and consist of morning and afternoon game drives. Heading out at sunrise will offer the best chance at witnessing a live hunt, as the cats will go after the migration. You can get close enough to hear jaws crunching into the carcasses or the evocative roar of a lion as they chase scavengers from a kill. With a private safari, you will decide how long to stay out, with options including a picnic spot that overlooks hippos or a hot air balloon ride at dawn. Location is everything with a Serengeti safari, and by staying at a mobile camp amid the herds, there will be less driving and easier encounters with all the wildlife."

Take off from Kilimanjaro and the summit of Africa's highest mountain will take your breath away with its southern slope engulfed with snow. Your pilot will take you past Mount Meru before you take a little detour for a glimpse of the Ngorongoro Crater, where you will return to stay later in the week. With your low cruising altitude, it will feel as if you are descending along the crater's outer slopes to follow the green carpet onto the Serengeti plains. The significant scale will baffle you all as the grasslands extend for hundreds of miles in every direction. As you fly, you will spot brown clumps, and then realize that they are large herds of buffalo and wildebeest on the move. As you come closer to your destination, you will be cruising low enough to spot individuals like the nomadic elephant bulls and the giraffe going about their day. By the time you touch down, you will have already glimpsed just how much wildlife occupies these plains. Your first game drive is always a thrill and the guides will know where to find the different animals. You will find that your children are silenced as they come closer than ever to their first elephant. You will sense your own child-like excitement as you encounter a leopard as the spotted hunter is hidden in the grass beside the trail. Famous movies are evoked as you spot a lion pride on their kopje – a rocky outcrop. The male's mane flutters while two infant cubs fight playfully on their elevated vantage point. Buffalo herds, huge masses of zebra and Thompson's gazelle skipping about bring your first unforgettable safari moments. The northern plains are the least visited of the regions in the Serengeti, notably because they are usually only seen by those on fly-in safaris. The northern plains are also the most diverse, with tree-lined waterways helping to attract more than just the grassland specialists. Even from your camp, you are likely to see half a dozen different species, from impalas and topis to elephant and giraffe. Your journey here is very safe as Masai warriors guard the camp just as they have guarded their own villages for generations. With wildlife visible from your camp, you will probably wish for some quiet hours, and this is where the young ranger program assists. While the game drives enable you to explore as a family in the morning and before dusk, the children are entertained through the middle of the day as you sit back and are charmed by nature's show. The program will be personally tailored for every child. Expert guides lead their experiences using an interactive, hands-on approach to both educate and inspire. If your children are interested in elephants, then the guides will teach them how to spot their tracks and how to analyze their dung. The children can learn how to make fires with sticks, build shelters from their surroundings, and learn simple techniques to ward off dangerous animals. Some of the activities are at the camp, but some are enhanced by heading out into the landscape. Learning how to identify different antelope or seeing how to analyze the behavior patterns of lions are best done out on a safari. Your children will be engaged and involved and will grow in their respect and awe of the natural setting that surrounds them."

        "title": "Western Serengeti – Exhilarating Private Camping",
        "description": "Move next into the western Serengeti, and you will soon be engulfed by the world's largest population of wild mammals. There are around two million in total, mostly made up of wildebeest, zebra, and Thomson's gazelle. These animals form the great wildebeest migration, an annual journey that has been played out since way before written records began. The Serengeti is a huge place, bigger than some U. S. states, and the herds graze on the move to mow down the high grass and rarely return to the same places. So, the only way to guarantee an audience with the migration is a mobile camp. Following the migration, these camps move every week or so, ensuring that guests are within easy reach of the main herds. You will be close enough to hear the drumbeat of hooves marching across the plains, and dependent upon when you visit, your camp may be in the southern, central, or even eastern Serengeti. Your private flight will give you an immediate impression of how many animals are involved. Small planes like these were what early conservationists used to calculate the size of the migration. You are not counting animals as that would be impossible, but you can admire just how widespread the herds are. Sometimes there are 200 square miles filled with wildebeest, and you may see a thick and tight line of marching zebra that stretches back 15 miles. After touching down, you will be transferred to your mobile camp with your time to be focused on game drives among the migration. At first, you will be baffled by scale. Seeing a few zebra is impressive on its own, but being surrounded by tens of thousands is mind-boggling. Your children will likely be mesmerized, and much of your own enjoyment will be watching your kids attempting to take it all in. With so many herbivores, the carnivores are never far away. Hyenas follow the migration and over your two days you may see over a hundred of them. Some snarl, aggressively seeking out the weakest from the herds. Others are patient, approaching lions mischievously in the search for scraps. Jackals also steal part of a kill while circling vultures are the obvious sign that a carcass is nearby. Being amongst the migration is the best place in the world to see the big cats on a hunt. You will need a little patience, but there is nothing like watching a cheetah accelerate or a leopard carefully stalking its prey. Everything is slow and calm, and then it all explodes in an instant, a flurry of dust and noise accompanying the successful hunter. Camping amongst the migration means you will be around the herds during the prime hunting hours. Lion roars are heard from the camp while the loud protest of yelping herds indicates that something has been hunted a few miles away. By tracking the migration so closely, you can also follow scenes over two days. Coming back from an afternoon game drive, you may notice a gazelle stuck in the mud. Return the next morning, and you will likely find the carcass in the grips of the hyenas. Watch as a lion pride tucks into a fresh kill, and then return the next day and watch the smallest scavengers fight over the final scraps. There are perhaps no destinations as thrilling as the Serengeti as these two days immerse you in the drama."

Your destination will be the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, where your lodge is perched on the crater rim. Just as in the Serengeti, you are likely to have elephant and zebra roaming past throughout your day, so a Masai warrior will accompany you whenever you are moving about. Sit down to a sumptuous lunch with a view into the crater, and then spend your afternoon on the floor of the crater to explore nature's fabulous Eden. If your child were to draw a safari destination, it would probably look like the Ngorongoro Crater. With a whole host of different animals roaming around, complete with a forest for the elephants, a lake for the hippos, and a great mix of predators and antelopes meeting on the plains, it’s your imagination come to life. Ngorongoro presents six habitats visible in a single glance and offers an almost complete collection of mammals seen on a single game drive with the only major missing animal the giraffe. Black rhinos will make their first appearance on your safari, these bashful and beautiful creatures grazing by a lake painted pink by the flamingo. Some of Africa's largest elephants retire here, huge bulls with tusks that are as long as any safari vehicle. Skirt the crater's outskirts, where rhino and leopards like to hide and move slowly to take it all in. You will hardly need to drive two minutes to get a close-up of another mammal; such is the concentration of life on this unique caldera floor."

Enter into the manyatta (homestead), and you will get to see how the Masai live with their beds woven from straw, handmade spears are thrown into the distance, goats kept close and warriors out herding cattle. You are not coming to take some photos; rather you will be a guest coming to get some real insight into Masai life. Children can spend time with those of similar age, and it will be remarkable how quickly they will overcome the language barriers. An elder will narrate traditional tales, and you will soon come to feel a kinship with these remarkable people and the traditional landowners of the Serengeti. For hundreds of generations, they have helped to preserve the land and its wildlife, taking nothing more than what they need.

The Selous is the largest of all of Africa's game reserves, and its mixed habitats make for a very diverse safari experience. Your camp will be perched on a scenic bend of the Rufiji River, the perfect location to celebrate Selous's high density of hippos. Riverine forest attracts a range of antelope and makes an ideal place for a big cat's ambush. The thick woodlands are alive with trumpeting elephants and elegant giraffe. Back out on the plains, you will continue your immersion in impala, wildebeest, zebra and lion. The young ranger program will continue and use the diversity of the region to tailor the experience for your children. It is easy to focus on a single animal and gain a detailed insight, including how to recognize their tracks and analyze their behavior. These lessons will feed into your family safari activities, with the children using their tracking knowledge to decide which way to turn. Over these three days, your kids will come to understand the clues and recognize what the landscape is saying. Spot a buffalo herd, and they will confidently know whether it is a placid group of females you can get close to or an aggressive group of bachelor males that must be avoided. Through the program, your kids will not only learn about the environment and the wildlife but will also get to put their knowledge into practice. New activities will keep every moment fresh. You will have become accustomed to game drives, so now will be a good time to get out of your vehicle and explore on foot. Your adventure will be very safe with skilled trackers using their ancestral knowledge to pick a route that will focus on the antelopes and other smaller animals. Boat safaris are a serene method of exploration, especially in the late afternoon when hippos and elephants are playing on the banks as the sun paints the water in golden tones. Your schedule and activities are flexible, so each day and every activity will be tailored to your wishes. You may opt to spend the whole day as a family to head far down river, or you may choose to send everyone off in different directions to pursue personal interests."

Ngorongoro Crater is an exceptional destination for testing out your camera skills in a variety of Tanzania's habitats and conditions. Open grasslands provide an introduction to what you'll see in the Serengeti. Acacia woodland brings compelling challenges regarding light. One lake is tinged pink with flamingos while another is alive with the antics of hippos. Stretches of bush illustrate the need to look carefully and expose animals' camouflage, while high grasses are prime for a lion pride's ambush. More than anything, these contrasting habitats teach an important photography lesson about patience. Nothing is predictable with wildlife, so patience comes with a caveat. You don't just need to wait; you must wait with the camera ready to go, because when a lion pounces on a zebra, there're only a few seconds to capture a scene of pure drama."

Southeastern Serengeti and the Ndutu area is where you find this quintessential scene, especially when you descend by car from Ngorongoro Conservation Area. Your guide knows of a few relatively secret places, where the grasslands roll out, and there's always a mammal in the foreground. These are places for an informative discussion about aperture choice for wildlife photography. But like always, a Tanzanian safari is about surprise, and you'll need to react to what's been discovered, like a cheetah nursing her calves, the spots flickering in and out of the grass. Or Thompson's gazelles that skip elegantly across the plains, their flight captured with a very fast shutter speed. This area also provides your first encounter with the really large herds; when there are over a thousand animals huddled together, it's easy to spend an hour focusing in on the exquisite details or zooming out to appreciate the scale."

Hyenas snarl at the camera, then scurry along towards a flock of circling vultures. Pull the camera up and the grass plains stretch on for miles; look down and there's a lioness prowling around the back of the safari vehicle. Regardless of the time of year, the Central Serengeti is a place of abundance. It's a place where you always need to keep the camera on hand, especially when back at the camp. In this fenceless landscape the animals roam without inhibition, so antelopes regularly graze their way past your spacious verandah. You can hear them through the night, and you may open the door to a flurry of wildlife just before dawn."

        "description": "Over these two days, you go on early-morning and late-afternoon game drives, maximizing the times when the Serengeti is most active. Of course, the lighting during these hours also makes them the best times for photography. Eclectic and unpredictable, this part of the Serengeti delivers a full range of photos. The focus will be on exploring and reacting to what you find, whether that's a leopard hiding in the grass or two male buffalo fighting at a waterhole. It could be a lonely wildebeest with melancholy eyes or a jackal scampering past the camera. The private wildlife photographer guide continues to give tips, and your driver is experienced in guiding photographers, ensuring you have plenty of time to get the right shot before continuing the adventure."

        "description": "Moving into the private Grumeti Reserve provides two days of close-ups. In the main Serengeti National Park, you're unable to drive off the trails, meaning many animals must be photographed from a distance. In Grumeti you bounce across the grass, getting closer to the most revered of sights. For example, when a leopard is draped across acacia branches, you can park beneath the tree. If there's been a kill you can stop just a few meters from the carcass, photographing limbs getting ripped from the carcass. In the afternoon, a Maasai warrior guides lead you through the grass plains on foot, each step bringing you closer to a range of antelope and other ungulates. On walking safaris, you're avoiding the big mammals, those that won't move out of the way when you approach in a vehicle. Instead, traveling on foot enables you to get very close to animals like zebra, wildebeest, gazelle, hartebeest, and buffalo. You're small and silent, so these mammals don't canter away. Take a few photos. Stop. Then step forward a few steps, maintaining the silence. A few more photos and then repeat. By moving slowly, you could be just five meters away."

Dawn starts are essential on a photographer's safari, and you'll usually return to the camp towards the end of the morning. The sun is high now, and you have a two to three hours to enjoy lunch and relax, perhaps going through the camera roll or dropping off into an early-afternoon nap. In Grumeti, you have lodge-style accommodation, with a room that's perched high above the Serengeti. A spa continues the salubrious feel, and the experience is much less rugged than a camp in the heart of the bush."

        "description": "For the final two days, you're fully immersed in the surreal phenomenon of the great wildebeest migration. Mammals are everywhere, the wildebeest scattered across a wide area while the zebra clustered together as they scan the landscape for predators. Thompson's gazelles join the show, and the numbers are staggering. This is an event with a scale that every camera will struggle to capture; half a million animals simply don't fit into a single frame. Instead, the photography is about compiling a storyline, piecing together the different images that showcase the drama and charm of this remarkable show. Some photos are about the herds and fitting thousands of mammals into a single shot. Others zoom in on the emotion cast across the individuals, perhaps a frightened young wildebeest or a loving zebra pair. Predators play an essential role, and there will be close ups with lions, leopards, cheetahs and hyenas. The really iconic photos are of the predators surveying their kingdom, the big cats in focus as the herds blur in the background. Or of the predators in full hunting mode, stalking the prey or devouring a carcass. You can easily take a thousand photos a day here so part of your guide's instruction will be centered around selecting the photos that create a compelling narrative."

Note that this camp only has limited electricity, unlike the other accommodation on this itinerary. However, your safari vehicle is fitted with electricity and it's possible to charge camera batteries and other appliances while on the game drives. The accommodation is simple yet spacious, with large tents that are fitted with hot showers, flushing Western-style toilets, and large comfortable beds.

Wind between the trees and emerge at the Mkata Floodplain, a vast landscape littered with wildebeest and zebra herds. Many call this the Serengeti without the crowds, because while the terrain is classical African and exquisite, there are no other safari vehicles interrupting your photos. Giraffe towers wander beneath the alluring Udzungwa Mountain, the lions climb trees and are easy to spot, then a big herd of buffalo offers the next check on the Big Five list. Your first safari lodge gives a hint of what's to come in Southern Tanzania. Rather than close out the wild with fences, the lodge blends into its surroundings and it's common to see wildlife roaming past your suite. In particular, watch out for the 400 species of birds that flutter around with vibrant delight. Dinner is served Tanzanian style; a fire crackles nearby, a candlelit table for two is situated beneath the stars, and the sounds of the wild permeate your lodge."

Eland is the world's largest antelope and they’re fiercely protective of their young. The lions are hungry and they spot some young kudu. Stay silent and the hunt plays out before your eyes.

Your eco-camp is fantastically positioned in the trees, and Udzumngwa's two premier attractions are everywhere; black and white colobus monkeys swing down from the trees, jumping across the camp and surrounding delightful walking trails for two. Cheeky faces smile hello, a tribe of 20 colobuses leap above your head, and shocks of white hair are wonderfully juxtaposed with jet black features. Look down and there are more monkeys, endangered Sanje mangabeys foraging the forest floor, and returning your gaze with their impressive eyes.

Pass through Iringa and stop in a small village where life has remained unchanged for many generations. It's off-the-beaten-track Tanzania at its finest, a reservoir of smiles epitomizing the benign welcome and openness of traditional life.

This sublimity is enhanced by little romantic touches. Share cocktails as Tanzania's largest elephant population roam beneath your balcony. Grab your partner's hand and walk through a rugged plain of baobab trees. Unwind beneath the stars as a lions roar and hippo grunt from the Great Ruaha River. Or simply stop during your safari and soak up the exclusivity of this vastly unvisited national park. There are perhaps a few more quintessential vacation moments than silently watching nature's show pass by and sharing a smile. Today you'll take a long game drive across Ruaha, the track winding alongside the river and taking in all the classic ungulate herds, like Grant's gazelle, waterbuck, zebra, bushbuck, and impala. There are also some intriguing and unknown sets of hooves to admire. Splendid greater kudu impress with handsome horns, rare sable and roan antelopes are found in large numbers, and where there are ungulates there are always predators. Traverse rutted and raw trails, the ‘roads’ making today's journey a real adventure in the unexplored wilderness. Arrive at camp, enjoy the hot en-suite shower with views onto elephants, and sit down to another dinner for two beneath a sky uninterrupted by light pollution."

Instinctively you grab each other at the sight of lion paws. Keep watching. Here comes another. Now the cubs emerge from the grass clearing. One, two, three, wait, four, five; Ruaha's lion prides are not only abundant, they're unusually large. Keep watching and now there are 24 lions serenely walking past the safari track. No, make that 25 as a cute cub brings up the rear. Some yawn, others stare, and a procession of elegant felines move past at almost unnerving proximity. Follow their paw prints towards the river, ungulate herds skipping into the distance as the cats approach. Then turn around and spot an ousted male making the same journey, face etched with melancholy. Over the next two days, your safari itinerary is completely flexible. With such a huge area to explore, game drives can take multiple directions. Seek out one of Africa's largest collections of elusive wild dogs. Watch cheetah race across the plains of the Lundu area. Completely forget how many jackal and spotted hyena you come across. And continue to be amazed at the long tusks of Ruaha's elephants. The whole experience is rugged, wild, yet enduringly romantic. Few places can leave you so alone with nature. And few African safari destinations are as compelling. So when the sun goes down on day eight, and the lion roars drift into the camp, you're left wondering just how this wilderness has stayed so far off the standard tourist trail."

Selous measures around 50,000 square kilometers, an area that would take months to fully explore. Dissecting the reserve is the Rufiji River and your safari adventure will stick to the photogenic northern side of the river. Tanzania's Ngorongoro Crater receives close to 500,000 annual visitors, but Selous is seen by just over one percent of that number. But don't think that this means less wildlife.

Elephant herds march down and splash around, firing water jets from swinging trunks. A hippo's wheeze-honk directs the boat eastward, a whole pod of wallowing hunks fighting for the harem of females. Buffalos may not be as graceful, but they're equally impressive as they contrast with a burning red sunset and a collection of nervous antelopes.

Perch above the lake and watch the theater unfold. All seems quiet. But you didn't see the lion pride. And neither did the kudu. Water splashes, a yelp is silenced, and a set of crocodile eyes adds further drama. During your three full days in Selous the daily itinerary is very flexible and handcrafted to the two of you. Boat safaris, game drives, and walking safaris form the central part of the experience and you can combine more than one of these activities in a single day.

Amongst lions and leopards, cheetahs and hyenas are also around, further toothed predators that patrol these gaping grasslands. The Serengeti is Tanzania's most famous safari destination and it never disappoints.

For all the individual sightings there's an encompassing beauty and natural hue to the Serengeti. Everywhere you turn there's a photo to be taken, even if there's nothing but a hundred gazelle grazing in the grass. Lake Manyara provides the introduction to safari while Serengeti offers the ultimate reward. Game drives are longer but the quantity of mammals defies the imagination. Sometimes it's difficult to find an angle without a 10,000 strong herd of wildebeest. Like yesterday, after the thrill of the game drive comes the tranquility of camp. Sit back and listen. Silence.

There are only a handful of cottages and the service here is exceptional, with gourmet meals and drinks brought to your balcony or served on the sand. So relax, remove your watch, and allow the hours to float into days and the seclusion to enhance this romantic vacation."

        "description": "Ruaha provides the final piece of your romantic safari jigsaw. The park is all about the utopian scale demanded by the big predators and largest mammals. Ruaha's additional trick is to provide enhanced accessibility, so two days have been dedicated to the park in this itinerary. Full-day game drives delve deep into the heart of this glorious hinterland, each loop bringing forest adventure and journeys into the unknown. Again, it's unlikely you'll see another safari truck and there's a marvelous feeling of being transported into a primeval landscape. Wildlife occasionally has to be shooed from the runway here, an example of how the development of tourism has remained low-key."

The antelopes on the forest edge, hippos along the riverbank, elephants and birds patrolling the trees, then nomadic herds crossing vast plains. Like always, the game drive runs at an easy pace, so there will be lots of opportunities to enjoy a quiet hour overlooking the landscape together.

Board a traditional wooden mokoro , a narrow canoe that silently cruises the lagoons and channels of the delta. It's serene and silent. Yet the gondolier paddles around a corner and 40 or so hippos cover the water. Keep cruising downstream and a herd of elephants are mischievously playing along the riverside. Zebra splash around and there's a divine feeling of being miles from any road or development. In fact, your camp is situated on an island in the Okavango, so you couldn't be any further from the modern world. Another easy afternoon in camp is followed by a walking safari. It's one for grabbing each other's hand and setting off into the wilderness; the same wilderness that teems with elephants, giraffe, and more. Expertly guided and wonderfully authentic, a walking safari is an opportunity to experience the wildlife from ground level. And a three ton elephant is much bigger once you realize that you barely reach the top of its leg. Complete the walking safari by opening the champagne on an elevated platform, the Okavango landscape rolling on beneath your eyes."

Scorched yellow lies behind the migration, yet thick clumps of fresh green become more common as you journey north. From a window seat, you can glimpse the herds, clumps of zebra and wildebeest marching across the grassy carpet below. As the plane descends, these herds come into focus, the wildebeest scattered across large areas and the zebra huddled in tight groups. Land at an airstrip in Northern Serengeti and the short game drive to the lodge showcases the abundance of this realm; in just 20 minutes, you might see thousands of mammals. Lamai Serengeti blurs effortlessly into the natural landscape, each of the wooden suites hidden into the rock and trees. It's one of the Serengeti's most luxuriously appointed lodges, evoking an old-world glamour while retaining a sense of harmony with the environment. Gaze out from the lush sofas, watch herds from the wooden deck, and snooze on the four-poster bed as the wild soundtrack reverberates across the plains. As they're slightly elevated, these suites provide a view that stretches for many miles; it's hard to look out and not see something wild roaming around.

It's easy to spot the animals when the landscape is so open and uninterrupted. Elephants and giraffes grace the horizon, standing well clear of both the grass and the clumps of trees. Buffalos and hippos are seen from miles away, and then your guide brings you close enough to see the tropical birds perched on their backs. Zebra herds appear black from a distance, the unique stripes primarily a method of preventing the lions from picking out individuals. As you get closer you admire the details; a baby yet to develop black stripes, pairs facing opposite directions to share a 360-degree view of danger, adorable expressions made by eyes that return your gaze. You spend the full day on a game drive, crossing great swathes of the Serengeti and reveling in its unadulterated scale. It's perhaps possible to picture a hundred zebra. Maybe even a thousand. But tens of thousands? Even after witnessing this phenomenon, it seems unfathomable. Take a picnic lunch with you and stop regularly along the way, including many pools inhabited by hippos. Wait for the hippos to yawn for an iconic photo, and then continue across the grasslands to find giant elephant bulls on their nomadic journeys. Drive amongst the wildebeest then watch a herd of Thompson's gazelle scatters as they skip towards the burning African sun. Of course, being the Serengeti, it's never just the herbivores. Such a high density of food makes this a revered realm for the big cats. Lions rule with authority, males with epic manes emitting long throaty roars. Compared to the central and southern Serengeti, there are many more trees for leopards to hide in. Drive slowly, and your tracker helps uncover the camouflage, a mother and cub hanging over the high branches. Then there are hyenas, dozens of them scampering around, following the scent of the herds and rushing towards the circled fluttering of vultures. On a full-day game drive, the sights keep coming, more and more animals gracing the landscape as you explore at leisure. Return to the lodge in the late afternoon, where sundowners on the terrace offer serenity after the adventure."

A shout comes from the trees up ahead, birds singing loudly to warn the herd of danger. It's a harem of females, and the alpha male ushers them away, standing proudly with curled horns in response to the threat. Admiring the impalas' frantic movements, you've lost the cheetah in the grass. For ten minutes, you look, but its stealth is too great. Perhaps the hunt is over. But then the drama! An explosion of speed and jaws wrap around a young calf. The cheetah has attacked from a direction that nobody suspected and as the birds continue their noisy protest, the hunter has shimmied off back into the grass. Not only is the Serengeti a place to see the predators, but it's also a place to see them in the most revered state: on the prowl, eagerly tracking down breakfast. On another game drive, it might be lionesses on the prowl, the pride splitting up a zebra pride before making a kill. You get close enough to smell it, especially when the carcass is creating a battle between hyenas and vultures. Thanks to the landscape's openness, the thrilling sights are easy to find, especially when local trackers understand all the clues. One morning you might see a leopard out hunting, the next might bring four different lion prides, each fiercely protective of their home realm. During these two days, the itinerary is flexible and responsive, both to your mood and to the interactions on the landscape. It's recommended to maximize the times when the plains are most active, just after dawn and just before dusk. That could be on morning and afternoon game drives, or by staying out for the full day and exploring a larger part of the Serengeti. Lamai Serengeti is located in a remote and mostly unseen part of the national park. As it's the furthest place from Arusha by road, this area is rarely visited by anyone who is not on a fly-in safari. It helps retain an exclusivity and adds an extra authenticity to a very famous destination."

        "description": "From the Kogatende Airstrip, you fly south to Selous via Arusha, two micro flights that cross the beautiful plains of Tanzania. Touch down at Kiba Airstrip and sense the change in atmosphere, a river meandering nearby and thick tracts of woodland creating a closed and intimate ambiance. This is Africa's largest game reserve, but it feels compact and personal, especially due to the limited number of other visitors; Selous is far from everywhere, so it's mostly reserved to those on fly-in safari programs. You'll arrive in the early afternoon, and the best way to get fully acquainted with the landscape is on an afternoon Rufiji River cruise. While the landscape stretches for over 17,000 square miles, everything must stick close to precious water. So by cruising the river, you can encounter a full range of Selous residents."

        "description": "Selous is always an adventure into the wild, one that can take you on so many different trails. This morning it's on foot, a local guide teaching you the tracks and signs of the bush. Prints lead you to a pair of giraffes, strange burrows help you locate caracals and other nocturnal characters, and then the plains open up, and there are too many zebras to count. An armed ranger accompanies you through this big-game country, yet your focus is not on the giants, but on the small and peculiar of the bush. Most of all, it's about strengthening your connection with the wild, enabling you to listen to its mystical calls and sublime harmony. Like most safari days, the midday sun has you beneath the shade of the camp. Snooze to nature's lullaby, gaze out at the hippos in the river and be lulled by the rhythm of the surrounding woodlands. Then it's back out in the afternoon, another boat trip exploring the life at the banks. Sometimes it's elephants splashing around, trunks poking out above the river. Impalas and buffalos drink where the river opens, preferring open panoramas where lions can't approach undetected. But cheetahs and leopards lurk in the higher grass, tucking themselves away, waiting for an antelope to make the wrong move. A cacophony of barks lead you around a few more bends, and you find a pack of wild dogs drinking feverishly, their resplendent coats a rare and exclusive sight on any safari. Then you return to camp, the setting sun turning the river golden as the stars slowly come out."

The atmosphere epitomizes the allure of the reserve, at times blissfully tranquil yet always a base for adventure and exploration. There's a certain colonial charm to it, yet the lodge creates an easy harmony with the landscape around it. Wooden decking offers a place to wind away the lazy hours in the wild, with the exceptional views ensuring that it never feels that you're wasting any valuable safari hours. This lodge is all about ensuring you can escape into the Selous rhythm, from admiring the monkeys that swing past to moonlit dining as elephant silhouettes wander by. During these two days, the program is fully flexible and can incorporate the full range of Selous activities. Walking safaris and boat cruises can operate in the mornings and afternoons; while game drives could be long full-day expeditions or shorter loops around the surrounding landscape. There's also a unique opportunity for a nighttime game drive, which are particularly enjoyable in Selous due to the spectrum of predators. First, you listen, and then you follow the calls and use a spotlight to illuminate whatever is hunting in the bush. Even when you're not encountering great numbers of animals, being in Selous offers an old-world elegance. It feels like you're in the heart of nowhere, thousands of miles from civilization, alone in a playground of habitats that are only shared with wildlife."

Ngorongoro is an exquisite example, a staggering volcanic caldera that's evolved into a haven for a huge diversity of big mammals. After landing at Kilimanjaro International Airport, you will transfer onto a light aircraft for a short flight into the Ngorongoro Conversation Area. The caldera spills out beneath the wingtips, and the panoramas can be astonishing as you come into land. Your lodge is one of a small handful that is perched on the crater rim, offering compelling views from your private verandah. In part, it's how you would imagine a volcanic caldera: rugged, dramatic, expansive. But then a massive elephant bull wanders past the lodge, and you realize this is a caldera like no other. So rest and relax, you'll be following the elephants onto the caldera floor tomorrow."

        "description": "Descend along the near-precipitous slopes to bounce down towards the mystical floor of Ngorongoro. First impressions seem to come all at once; huge tusks emerge from the trees, elephant bulls roam with an empty air of melancholy. Wildebeest gallop on the grassland, the dust spirals soar over large zebra herds. Hyenas ramble around, always on the move, looking for an opportunity as a lion pride lounges beside a pink lake, the male's mane flows beside the flocks of flamingos. Six different habitats squeeze into the caldera; each provides a haven for its own collection of mammals. Buffalos graze, leopards lurk on the slopes, hippos lounge in the lake, and you quickly tick off dozens of species from your safari list. On the caldera floor, it's hard to know which way to look first. With one sweeping 360-degree panorama it's possible to make out all the caldera walls – this is not a big place. Look one way and wildebeest are rutting, gaze the other for buffalo and elephant, turn around and there's a lion pride, then feel your heart jump as a pair of critically endangered black rhino scamper across the grass. There are less than 1,000 of these shy creatures left in the wild; follow them to admire their grace, and bask in the exclusivity of the sighting. Other than giraffe – their legs are too long for the steep caldera slopes – Ngorongoro is home to all the big mammals of Africa. Spend six hours on the floor and stop for a picnic that overlooks the hippos to immerse yourself in one of Africa's most surreal destinations. There are no fences around here, so back up at the lodge, you're still likely to encounter wildlife throughout the rest of the day."

        "description": "Journey into the Serengeti and descend into a dreamy panorama of grassland. The plains seem to stretch for eternity as a patchwork of green and black tumble beyond the horizon. Get closer, and the black dots take shape as hundreds of thousands of wildebeest graze on the endless plains. They are everywhere, and soon you are surrounded. The volcanic, nutrient-rich grass is like a superfood and the herds are gouging themselves. Stronger males gallop to showcase their strength and willingness to run. But the females aren't interested as fear sweeps across their faces, ears, and eyes on alert as they seek to protect their young. And what an abundance of young! Calves are everywhere, barely big enough to support their own weight and tentatively herded so that they are protected within the interior of a herd. Lionesses move menacingly to work the herd and separate a pre-determined target. Leopards approach furtively to blend slowly into the landscape even though their spots are high above the grass. Hyenas don't quarrel; rather than compete over territory, they are prepared to coexist within the bounty. Vultures circle to alert you to a decaying carcass. But a rumble of hooves has you looking in the opposite direction, where a cheetah has emerged with a month-old wildebeest. Zebra also grazes here, and they are equally loaded with tension as thousands of calves are shepherded by the stronger adults. Much like the wildebeest, the zebra's infant mortality rate doesn't make encouraging reading. Visit the Serengeti from January to March and you're not here to seek out the predators, rather you are here for the predatory scenes. The experience is not about an encounter with a leopard; it’s about watching that leopard lock her jaws around another calf. An atmosphere of anxiety pervades across the plains, and the drama has just begun. For the next three days, you will be surrounded by the thrill of the hunt. Your luxury-tented camp is located in the Ndutu area of Southeastern Serengeti and just a few minutes drive from the edge of the herds. With easy access to the migration, each day's itinerary is flexible with the option for full-day game drives or two half-day drives with a return to camp for lunch."

        "title": "Ndutu (Serengeti) – Going Off Trail Amongst the Great Migration Calving Season",
        "description": "Your guide will park the vehicle at a viewpoint just above the plains. There is an energy and enthusiasm in the morning's cool air as the wildebeest and zebra gallop around and the Thompson's gazelle skips along. Perhaps a million animals are in front of you; their frenzied activity adds great swirls of dust to the patchwork. A cheetah approaches, and you follow, his movement imbued with solemn precision. The tail swishes and the spots are gone as the cat accelerates into a blur of predatory instinct. Wildebeest scatter, and you get closer to see a limp body that hangs between the cheetah's jaws, and all of the sudden the cat has disappeared once again. Another shout, another strangled yelp, and the lionesses have been successful less than half a mile away. Again, drive over and take in another scene in the cinematic high definition. Unlike the rest of the Serengeti National Park, in this section, it is possible for guides to drive off trail in the Ndutu area. There are not really any formal trails, rather just the light, indented marks made by safari vehicles that crossed the grass. The importance of this cannot be understated; rather than watch a hunt or kill from the trail, perhaps 20 or 50 meters away, you can come to within just a few meters. As long as the animals aren't disturbed, your guide can get you in a prime position. Blood scatters across a rusty-toned mane as lion cubs patiently wait for their turn as limbs are brutally torn from the carcass of a wildebeest. Intimate, intense, and inspiring, the great migration calving season allows you to follow natural theater through the eyes of each of its characters. Ears are always on high alert in Ndutu. Gazelles run tentatively as the sentinels quick to report danger. But which way do they run? Wildebeest and zebra have the same challenge, so they congregate in larger and larger numbers; yet, the profusion of predators means that menace always hangs in the air. A young wildebeest gets stuck on a sandy bank, and an hour later, a pack of hyenas are tossing around its carcass. Emotion is everywhere. As some faces speak of fear, while others suggest pride. A leopard mother hunts with her young in tow to teach survival on the plains. Vultures squawk and fight, and then one will fly off dangling a wildebeest's inners. Jackals pick at bones as bachelor male lions build their strength on easy prey, so is difficult to go 15 minutes without a dramatic scene unfolding."

        "description": "Head north from Ndutu to traverse the great grass plains as you drive through mile after endless mile of wildebeests. The great migration isn't static; it is constantly evolving, the cycle dictated by increasingly unpredictable rains and the nuances of leadership. Some herds move off early, perhaps by February. Others stay longer, into April and May. Both are calculated risks. Rather than two million animals moving together, the wildebeest set off in huge clusters. For these two days, stay in a mobile tented camp that follows the wildebeest. If they haven't set off, you'll be located towards the north of the calving herds (you will have previously been to the south). There will still be a focus on the predatory scenes, but you will also have the opportunity to explore the wider Serengeti area. Elephants rumble past, giraffe are easily spotted from a distance, and a tranquil lion pride is draped across a cluster of rocks. Drive through sporadic clusters of trees to follow the shouts of a baboon troop. Emerge onto the grass once more, and the hyenas are on the move as they scurry past, guided by the swooping vultures. Across an area that's bigger than Belgium, there is nothing but grasslands, the odd tree, and the occasional lion rock. Plains stretch, and the mobile camp offers a flexible base to explore the enormity of the wider ecosystem. But, of course, you'll always be in and amongst the wildebeest."

At Olduvai Gorge, fossils and stone tools have been dated to 1.9 million years ago and the time of homo habilis. A walking trail takes you through the gorge before the onsite museum has a fascinating collection of some of the oldest records of early human life. After your stop in Olduvai, visit a traditional Maasai boma, a cluster of mud and straw shacks that house a large extended family. Maasai warriors jump and dance to introduce you to their home as their rhythmic chants guide you into a tribal world that's laced with mystique. From here, it's a short drive back across Ngorongoro to pass more wildebeest and buffalo before you descend towards the lush slopes around Karatu.

Now you start to see the wildlife and encounter the noisy characters that inhabit the trees. A baboon troop jumps on an upturned trunk and an elephant huffs and flaps its ears as a signal to the raucous vervet monkeys. Follow the rugged track and glide beneath birdsong towards the centerpiece of Lake Manyara, the pristine expanse of hippo-dappled water. Wildebeest and zebra graze beside the water with your first encounters with these fabled ungulates. Baboons litter the landscape in the thousands, and the odd hippo escapes the water to join them. Forested slopes provide the backdrop, an elegant sweep of rock and green that enhances the tranquility of the ecosystem. Lake Manyara is not a dramatic safari destination, but after the flight to Tanzania, this compact park makes for an easy and serene introduction to the safari world. You will get a sense of the wilderness and the preservation of nature's realm and as you wind out of the park, there you will see Manyara's revered treat, a pride of lions draped over the branches of an acacia tree. They sleep up high on the exposed branches to survey their kingdom from a unique vantage point. Tree-climbing lions can only be seen in a small handful of African destinations, and it's these you remember as you settle into a luxury lodge."

Elephant bulls roam, a lake is tinged pink by flamingo, a lion pride rests languidly on the trail, and the grassland is dappled with buffalo, wildebeest, and more. Your first memory of Ngorongoro is that first glimpse across the caldera and nature's untouched Eden. Explore as you follow the lionesses as they stalk a small herd of gazelle, and then wind through the woodland and find some of Africa's biggest elephants as their giant tusks tower above the safari vehicle. Drive onwards towards a lake where hippos barge a path of power. Ngorongoro usually brings a predatory scene to the stage, especially if you make it to the crater floor in the first hour after sunrise. Perhaps you will find a lion pride as it tears apart a zebra carcass, or perhaps a herd of wildebeest harried in the morning light. Ngorongoro usually offers one of the safari's rarest sights, a black rhino. A pair marches past the safari vehicle to bashfully trot to the far reaches of the crater floor. Less than 1,000 remain in the wild, and Ngorongoro is the best place to get close to them in Tanzania. You are permitted to spend six hours on the caldera floor to surround yourself with the sublime sights of a world untouched by man.

From January to March, the natural safari choice would be to drive into the Serengeti. But by the month of May, the wildebeest are already on the move. Take a micro flight across the Serengeti as the endless plains extend as you swoop above the migratory trail. From your window seat, it's possible to make out the herds, a blanket of black dots that stretch far above the grasslands. Flying in provides an indelible introduction to scale as nothing manmade interrupts the vista so it's just mile after endless mile of mammal-covered grassland. The dots gain clarity as you descend and the herds become visible as the plane touches down on a remote Serengeti airstrip. From the macro to the micro, a first Serengeti game drive is filled with intimate encounters. Admire the zebra as they sleep with their necks resting adorably on each other’s backs. Stop beside a wildebeest herd and watch the interaction as the frenzied males gallop in a show of power. When the vehicle stops, the herds keep coming as thousands upon thousands of wildebeest march past. Every individual that you can see is also seen by a flurry of ravenous predators, so as you continue the drive, a lion pride will inspect the dinner menu and watch carefully to calculates its move. Hiding in the grass is a cheetah with its cubs, happy to let the wildebeest pass but always alert for opportunity. To follow the great migration is not merely an experience with two million ungulates, it's also an irrevocable theater that includes thousands of big cats and other predators. After the day's drive, arrive at camp just before sundown and the drama of the wild will continue to spill out from your vantage point."

        "title": "Serengeti – Mobile-Tented Camp Safari Following the Great Migration",
        "description": "Where are the wildebeest? On a landscape that's larger than Belgium, it can be surprisingly difficult to locate these two million animals. Migration routes are not set, and they are becoming increasingly unpredictable, likely due to deviations in the climate. While history tells where to expect to see the migration, you could be a week early or a month too late. Staying in a mobile-tented camp is the only guaranteed way to be fully immersed in the great migration. These private camps move with the wildebeest, constructed in new locations for nearly every guest. While the tent walls are canvas, there's a degree of luxury and the experience is nothing like any traditional notions of camping. The focus is on a comfortable base that's among the drama of the great wildebeest migration. The flexibility over location ensures that every game drive starts in the heart of the action. Track the migration with game drives that reveal the enormity of the spectacle. Drive for miles, and the wildebeest don't stop as they extend beyond the horizon in every direction, perhaps half a million scattered across the grassland. Zebra are just a couple of days behind as they follow the migratory trail and appear like a moving black and white postcard, to cover the grass with stripes of absolute inimitability. Some canter, others follow. Some sleep as others have eyes wide open as a lion pride lurks on a nearby rock. Zoom in on the details, like the anxious expression in the eyes of a young calf. Then zoom out for the scale, as you see perhaps 50,000 zebra in a crowded procession. Predatory scenes play out all across the landscape. A leopard furtively glides through the grass, only to emerge to lock jaws around the neck of a tired wildebeest. Lionesses prowl in open view to separating the herd and force a young zebra to run straight into the pride's ambush. Cheetahs accelerate with trademark grace, their trail of dust accompanied by an anguished yelp of their prey. Hyenas are constantly on the move to track the herds and hunt opportunistically, as this is not a place for wildlife to get stuck or lost. Vultures also follow as their monotonous circling lead you towards another fresh kill. Lion cubs tear flesh from limbs and jackals impishly look on to play cat and mouse in the hope of scraps. The wildebeest migration is a continual battle of predator and prey, survival of the fittest in one of nature's most rugged and uninterrupted landscapes. From June to August, the herds migrate across the Serengeti as many of them move west to cross the Grumeti River. Eventually, over half of the wildebeest will run the gauntlet of the Mara River and continue into the Maasai Mara. Spending several days with the migration offers a very good chance to see the iconic river crossings. The herds pile up for days to build up courage before they take the dramatic plunge in the crocodile-infested waters. One goes, and then tens of thousands follow as dust swirls, water splashes, and predators wait with vicious intentions. Some drown, and become food for the waiting crocodiles. Others get stuck, helplessly left in the sand, destined to be torn apart by whichever cat arrives first. For some, there's elation, particularly for the brave male who led the charge. With this safari program, the daily itinerary is flexible. Choose to park beside the river and wait for the wildebeest crossing to unfold. Take full-day game drives and lose yourself in the unrivaled drama, or opt for shorter game drives with plenty of down time at the tented camp. Follow a lion pride, or spend the day through the eyes of the ungulates. Staying in an accommodation that's among the great migration maximizes the choices for every day."

On the other side of the water is an expectant cast of predators. Arrive in the Maasai Mara to spend your final two nights in a luxury camp with elegant views over the plains. Herds wander past your verandah; elephants appear at dusk, and an array of antelopes rumble through the landscape. While it's the same ecosystem, this northern park has a greater variety of life thanks to its diversity of habitats. So for these days, you can focus on the animals that have not yet been prominent on the safari. Take a picnic to a rock and admire the panorama as grass valleys stretch beyond the horizon. Or take a picnic to a waterhole and watch hippos as they splash in the mud. Park beside the river and see if the wildebeest will cross, or find lions mating among the rocks before you follow an elephant herd on the march. Stop and stare at a huge herd of rampaging buffalo, and then admire the serenity of a giraffe tower as their necks move serenely above the trees. Baboons shout, Thompson's gazelle continually skip by, and then a leopard will send goosebumps up your arms.

        "description": "Tanzania's safari landscape cascades across the north of the country as the plains extend beneath the volcanic cones of the Kilimanjaro, Meru, and Ngorongoro. Touch down at Kilimanjaro International, and you can immediately sense the extravagance of nature as these towering mountains guide you westward towards the small town of Karatu. It's a three-hour journey as you cross grass plains filled with Maasai herdsmen and the scent of the wild. Your lodge will provide a tranquil complement to the journey as the verandah gazes out on fertile slopes that are sporadically dotted with wildlife. Reedbuck wander past, vervet monkeys impishly approach, and zebra randomly marches across the slopes. While the safari adventure starts tomorrow, you're immediately introduced to just how untouched Tanzania's landscapes can be."

        "description": "A cacophony of birdsong welcomes you to Manyara as songs sung from the treetops fill the air as you wind through the forest. Baboons cover the track; huge troops jump and scurry beneath the canopy. Turn a corner, and an elephant blocks the way, a bachelor male that stops before it continues a thunderous path through the trees. Another corner and giraffe rise above the forest awning, their elegance a sweet moment on any first-time safari. When the forest rescinds, the ungulates are revealed as zebra, buffalo, impala, wildebeest abound. Cross their trail, and hippos lounge in the lake as their huffing and grunting echo across the steep forested walls of the park. Lake Manyara is an enchanting and compact safari destination, one that can easily be explored in one game drive. While it doesn't have the predatory drama of the Serengeti or Ngorongoro, it provides an perfect introduction into a huge array of wildlife. Rather than the Big Five, Manyara showcases the beauty of being immersed in nature's ancient landscapes. And then there's the sight that takes any breath away, a pride of lions as they lounge on elevated tree branches and slumber in their own tailored tree houses. Tree-climbing lions can only be found in a handful of Africa's parks, giving Manyara an inimitable twist on the iconic safari introduction. Your accommodation is located inside the park to ensure the game viewing continues through the evening."

        "description": "Tarangire lies adjacent to Lake Manyara, yet its forested fringes open onto a much larger and dramatic landscape. This morning you will wind through the birdsong to find expressive savannah dotted with colossal baobab trees. A single panorama can reveal hundreds of these icons, many of them more than 500 years old. They are as integral to the landscape of the elephants, as the pachyderms move in their hundreds and dominate Tarangire's interior. Stop on the trail and a dozen tower over the safari vehicle; watch as the babies swing their trunks and chase baboons beneath their mother's eye, and then admire the tense showdown when two giant herds meet at the river. Giraffe is equally plentiful, and across the landscape, you encounter larger and larger ungulate herds. Wildebeest run as the zebra and impala listen fearfully for danger as a 100-strong buffalo herd covers the trail in a blanket of black fur. In Tarangire, you may also see the lions in the trees, but the open grasslands also provide a space for them bask in the sun. Cheetah and leopard lurk in the trees, impressing their alert eyes as they hunt along the river. After a long morning game drive, you will arrive at the lodge for a late lunch before a local tracker takes you on a walking safari. Definitions of size are alter as you wander along the fringes of the park to gaze in on the great baobabs and elephants. Exhilarating and exclusive, the afternoon walk reveals the true scale of the wild landscapes found in Tanzania."

        "title": "Ngorongoro Crater – Exploring Africa's Mammal Utopia",
        "description": "A misty veil floats evocatively across Africa's ancient utopia, flittering above the Ngorongoro Crater floor at sunrise. It behaves like an illusionist to suggest that there is nothing to see, but then all is revealed all in a single second of magic. As the vehicle dips below the mist, your first impression is spellbinding. In a single view, you can take in the entire caldera floor; a lake tinged pink by flamingo, wildebeest, and buffalo across the grass, the yellow of lion pride roaming. This is one of the world's largest volcanic craters, and it teems with life. Some 30,000 mammals live here, and the diversity is remarkable. The woodland acts like a resting place for some of Africa's biggest elephants, great-tusked bulls that defy the imagination. Buffalo and wildebeest canter on the grasslands, joined by impala and zebra in avoiding the lion's stare. Pride live side by side and feast on the abundance as lionesses stalk the ungulates and slowly creep beneath your uninterrupted gaze. Another group lazily sleeps beside the water, before awakening to find solace in the shade of your safari vehicle. Open the door, and you could step straight onto a flowing mane because that is how close you are. Into the caldera's fringes, and a leopard moves surreptitiously to emerge into the open for just a few brief moments to leave a trail of blood and she carries a wildebeest back to the trees. You are permitted to spend six hours on the caldera floor, and the game drive can be interrupted by coffee and a snack beside the lake. Drink slowly, and marvel at the hippos that barge across the water as many of them surface just a few meters away. Despite all the intimate encounters so far, there's one sight that quickly rises to the summit of your safari memories as two pairs of horns scamper past, to rush along with a reticence that belies their two-ton bulk. Less than 1,000 black rhino remain in the wild, and Ngorongoro Crater is the best place in Tanzania to see them. In just six hours, Ngorongoro offers the full Big Five to take you on a journey through an astonishing Eden that hides beneath the veil. Ascend from the floor, and your lodge is perched on the rim, the premier vantage point for when the mist dissipates in the evening."

        "title": "Serengeti – The Endless Plains of the Southern Serengeti",
        "description": "Grass stretches beyond the horizon in every angle, endless green plains that are dotted black by mass herds. Driving from Ngorongoro, descend into this wilderness and the panoramas blur into a distant mirage. Such space, such openness, and such expression as you bump along the road and the mass of black dots become individuals. Wildebeest are rutting as the males rampage across the grass with amusing displays of testosterone. Get closer and admire the emotion that's etched across their faces. Some two million mammals roam across the Serengeti, but you almost always have a personal moment with just one or two. Zebra is plentiful as they move in herds of over a thousand. From a distance, they're a big black blur. But approach slowly, and the stripes are revealed, along with the tenderness of family groups. Even when you're surrounded by thousands, you always get an intimate moment with an individual. Over these days, you will explore the northern and central areas of the Serengeti to immerse yourself in the dramatic clashes between predator and prey. Lions won't be new to you, but in the Serengeti, they appear in huge numbers. It's often hard to remember how many prides you've seen in a day. They are joined by hyenas, and their mischievous antics bring sound and smell to the teeming plains. Spot vultures as they circle in the sky, and you are almost guaranteed to find these cats nearby. The landscape's openness makes it incredibly easy to spot wildlife. The most iconic are seen from miles away; elephant, giraffe, and buffalo always prominent in the panorama. And whenever you spot the ungulates running, there's a good chance one of the cats isn't far behind. For these two days, you will stay in a luxury permanent tented camp, which indelibly blends into its natural surroundings. Your suite has canvas walls, but it's here that the comparisons with camping stop. Luxury fittings and ornaments are complemented by the large en-suite bathroom, which offers an excellent degree of comfort when you are hundreds of miles from modern civilization. Gaze out from the bed, and the plains open out uninterrupted, to bring the wildlife sights without you having to move. And when night falls, a resonant soundtrack enhances the sensual immersion. Just close your eyes, and the impressions of the Serengeti continue."

        "title": "Serengeti – Evocative Predatory Scenes in an Untouched Realm",
        "description": "The Serengeti stretches across an area that's larger than some whole US states as they spill their drama across northern Tanzania. This expansive realm is the staging point for the great wildebeest migration, an annual spectacle of galloping herds and thrilling predatory scenes. For these two days, stay in a mobile tented camp that tracks the movement to ensure that you are immersed in the most abundant part of the Serengeti. Intimate and exclusive, the mobile camp makes you feel like you are a part of the landscape. Zebra wander past, Thompson's gazelle skip around and wildebeest graze close to the camp to always provide an inspiring photo to greet you in the morning. You are deep in the wilderness, and the hunting scenes will be at their most evocative. A tail quivers in the grass and you follow, to watch the spots as the leopard dips its neck with exquisite precision. Gazelle are fearful, and they have stopped their grazing, but they're unsure where the danger comes from. For over 20 minutes you watch the furtive scene, before a single false step and the herd gallops away, to kick-start a chain reaction of anxious antelope gallops. But later in the game drive, a scene will reach a different conclusion. This time, it's a cheetah hunting as you approach silently and snatch a young wildebeest from a panicked herd. Almost immediately, the hyenas have arrived, and another tense battle ensues. The daily itinerary is flexible during your time in the Serengeti on this private safari. In such a huge landscape, your game drive can travel in so many directions. Head out at sunrise when the plains are most active, or watch the dawn scenes from the tented camp. Stay out all day and take a picnic lunch to journey into the far reaches of the wilderness. Or take shorter game drives and loop back to the camp for lunch. One of Africa's most revered safari landscapes, this region is shown in countless documentaries and has inspired the animated big screen. It will feel as if you are all alone here, submerged in the drama of predator versus prey."

An elephant swings his trunk in farewell, and you savor the final moments of intimacy. But the safari experience isn't quite over. From the Serengeti, you will fly by light aircraft and soar across the plains for a baffling impression of scale. The grasslands seem to extend for eternity, and a patchwork of herds is visible from above. You will land at Kilimanjaro International, a small airport where it's easy to transfer to your international departure."

Maybe it’s Black rhino or waddling hippos? Could it be dreams about watching tusked elephants wander through the forest? Ngorongoro Crater is a bizarre natural phenomenon, the volcanic remnants forming a unique space of multiple juxtaposed ecosystems. Descend onto the crater floor and shake your head in disbelief. All those preconceptions play out like images from a movie. And there's much more. Turn around and there are three separate buffalo herds. Move into the trees and a leopard's eyes stand bright amidst the trees. Hyenas pass by, zebra congregate in huge numbers, and most first time visitors end up with hundreds of photos in less than an hour. With this itinerary there is no gentle introduction to the Big Five safari. There are no slow days in less abundant parks. You're heading straight into the unforgettable destinations that East Africa is famous for. Tonight is spent at a bucolic lodge, your remote suite perched on the crater rim and warmed by a homely fire. A discreet Maasai butler attends to all of your needs. So sit on the veranda, admire the wildlife that wanders past, and indulge in a lodge that blends nature with old-world charm."

        "description": "As the sun peeks above the crater rim you're back down on the Ngorongoro floor, exploring the myriad of ecosystems long before most other safari vehicles arrive. Such a pristine Natural Wonder deserves two game drives. Yesterday you will have toured the popular spots, while today you can journey into lesser known corners that burst with authentic scenes. In the cool morning air there's a great chance to see big cats on a hunt. This time is great for marveling at hippos before they almost submerge themselves in the lakes. Your guide packs breakfast and erects a table beside the forest; fresh Italian coffee is served with the sounds of elephants trumpeting in the distance. Ascend on the western side of the crater and within a couple of hours you're in the Serengeti. Baboons act as signposts, sitting on the road and guiding you into the next six days of adventure. First impressions are never forgotten. It seems to extend for eternity, the grasslands rolling and rolling far beyond the horizon. Entering from the Ngorongoro Crater side means you will gently descend into the Serengeti, the raised platform providing these eternal impressions of beauty. Wildebeest and zebra herds cover the plains at all times of year. From January to March, this section of the park is where the wildebeest give birth, so the grass becomes a patchwork of hooves and predators. It's these wildebeest, some 1.5 million of them form the great wildebeest migration. They're joined by immense numbers of zebra and are chaperoned by a myriad of cats and prowling hunters. On this unique vacation you'll follow the migration route, so regardless of when you visit, you'll have prime seats for nature's greatest show."

Wildebeest neck hairs flicker in the breeze, a gazelle's anxious eyes shine white, and zebra are grazing just outside the tent. It's an early start this morning, the plains at their most picturesque in the colorful light. Take in the close ups and enjoy the intimacy, the Serengeti suddenly confined to the beautiful scenes in your immediate proximity. Now for a new impression; climb aboard a hot air balloon for a private flight over the Serengeti. Slowly you ascend and the intimacy is replaced by stunning perspectives of scale. Only at this height is it possible to grasp the animal numbers. Millions of mammals cover the landscape, clumped together into groups that contrast against the green. Some patches move, leaving behind a trail of dust as they go, others continue their veracious consumption of the grass. Now the balloon descends, the scale slowly receding and the individual detail gradually returning. Champagne is served as soon as you land, a second breakfast to celebrate your stunning two hour flight across the plains. What now? Where next? With bubbles still in your mouth, the howls of hunting scenes come loud and clear. Your guide follows the trail, driving you westwards and following the migration route of the wildebeest. Stop beside a lion pride. They lounge content, a bloody carcass beside them. Eyes remain open and your arrival prompts a defense mechanism. This pride doesn't want remaining meat to be stolen. But gradually they drift off into slumber, the cats forming a poetic union of rugged power and adorable charm. Today will be a long game drive heading west and north through the Serengeti. There's unlikely to be any moment when you can't spot wild mammals from the vehicle."

An elephant bull wanders across the horizon, Thompson's gazelle and zebra litter the panorama, and from a slightly elevated position you make out a cheetah pair surveying what's on the menu. Your personal chef serves your morning meal, the table elegantly prepared on the Serengeti grass. There are no fences and no interruption to the wildlife. Giraffe cross in front of you, ungulate herds continue to march past the camp, and buffalo come to inspect your breakfast. The location of this mobile camp is always changing and is designed to offer safe and uninterrupted immersion in the world's most impressive natural show. You and your partner are the only guests and a discreet team attends to all your needs. In most cases, you will be able to sit outside the tent and watch the great wildebeest migration unfold on the plains below. Game drives bring more intimate action. Leopards, lions, hyenas, jackals, every corner seems to bring glimpses of a new predator. Some are out in the open. Others hide, only revealing themselves to trained eyes. Fortunately, you're guide is skilled at betraying their camouflage. Look across the high grass and you see nothing but gazelle. The guide approaches slowly. Still nothing. Now you're on the edge of the grass and still you can't pinpoint the predator. But a tiny rustle alerts your eyes. The leopard was hiding, barely ten meters away. Not far away, a pair of rhino brings new visual delights. Tailor the game drives to your mood, combining them with languid hours watching the wildlife world from the camp. When evening comes around, the dinner table is idyllically situated on the plains; a lullaby of lion roars accompanying a four-course meal. Clink the wine glasses, marvel at the starry sky that dazzles overhead, and then close the curtains to the elephant silhouettes. Even as you lie on the sumptuous king sized bed the Serengeti continues its magic, the sounds perforating through the canvas. This mobile camp includes solar powered lights, hot bucket showers, a chef and camp guide, as well as thick comfy seats for watching all the action."

You're heading to the Grumeti River for an unforgettable look at the interaction between predator and prey. As the wildebeest migrate they must make daring crossings across a handful of rivers. For days the wildebeest and zebra may congregate, clumping together until one brave soul leads the charge across strong currents and waiting crocodiles. They're hemmed in, easy targets for the prides that have followed them north. Some of these safari days have been about driving around and exploring. This afternoon is about sitting and watching. Your guide will find an ideal spot overlooking the action. Open the picnic and wait for the show to begin. One wildebeest charges, thousands follow, water and dust splashing up as the teeth of predators shine in the sun. It's the kind of scene from a wildlife documentary and the camera shutter can't click quickly enough. Ungulates keep crossing, predators keep attacking, and a group of clever crocodiles wait downstream for those wildebeest without the strength to swim.

It's not as flat here, valleys and hills begin to interrupt the flat panorama. There's arguably an even greater abundance of lions and other cats here, although they're not always as easy to spot. It's also more popular with other tourists here so, to continue the private theme of your itinerary, you spend the night on the remote western fringes of the Maasai Mara.

When the trees rescind it's the floodplains that dominate the horizon, lush grass-covered in silent giraffe and ponderous elephants. Acacia trees dot the land and they hide a surprising resident. Tails twitch, eyes blink, manes glow, and the tree-climbing lions of Lake Manyara sit serenely on the broad branches. They sleep with one eye open, forever opportunistic as they dominate this animal kingdom. The big and the small coexist on the lake. Over 300 bird species flutter around the shallows and sing their inimitable tunes, while the innumerable flamingo stain the water a shocking pink. Wading across the escarpments are cumbersome hippos, great hulks of flesh posturing, and arguing over the best spots in the lake. Size matters. And the biggest male not only gets prime wading rights, but it also relegates the up and coming youngsters to the edge of the pod. After exploring all corners of the park, you'll get an aerial view of the lake from your safari camp's private verandah."

        "description": "Indigenous tribes are slowly disappearing across Africa and very few remain in Tanzania. Hadzabe bushmen live around Lake Eyasi, continuing ancient practices that compel and enthrall. They take their bow and arrows into the forest, nimbly sidestepping through the trees and tracking animals with remarkable skill. Every upturned stone is a clue, and these traditional hunter-gatherers know exactly how to bring home a meal for the village. You'll spend a day with a local bushman guide and experience how life is lived in this remote and untamed corner of Africa. It's a place where fires are still lit by rubbing sticks together. Alongside the cultural interaction, there's a gentle serenity and freedom to the landscape; no wifi, no phones, no noise from passing traffic. This is a day that really will reveal ancient Africa."

        "title": "Ngorongoro Crater – The Unique Wonders of Ngorongoro Crater",
        "description": "The Ngorongoro Crater floor is never quiet. Slowly you descend into this inactive volcano, the steep track taking you down 2000 feet and into a surreal animal world. Elephants and zebra are making the same journey, heading down the slopes but keeping a watchful eye for the abundant lions. Some prides rest by the trail. But as you stop and admire, the lionesses take a keen interest in the safari truck. Don't worry, they're not looking for a meal, they just want to rest in the shade of the truck – but be warned, it's wise to keep your hands inside when a lioness is just two meters away. Big cats roam throughout Ngorongoro, the land able to sustain huge numbers of predators. Zebra, gazelle, wildebeest, warthog; there's plenty to go around. Ngorongoro's secret lies in its rich fertile soil. The grass always grows, the trees always rise, and the savannah continuously provides for an immense concentration of four-hoofed inhabitants. From the crater floor you can easily make out the outline of all the crater walls. This isn't a big place, and a 360º swing of the eyes takes in an uncountable variety of big game as Ngorongoro provides the Big Five in a day, perhaps all in a single hour. Bushy haired buffalo love to stare, their prominent horns juxtaposed with comical stuck-out ears. Some of Africa's biggest elephants roam lonely in the acacia forest here; giant old bulls choosing Ngorongoro as their retirement home. Leopards lurk in the trees, awaiting an opportunity to emerge and pounce. Your vehicle glides through diverse habitats as you explore different corners of the park. Grassland, forest, flamingo-tinged lakes, iconic savannah, and now some boggy swamps filled as always by the bobbing heads of hippos. Out of the trees comes another giant, a majestic armor-plated black rhino that wanders past the safari truck. Its horn protrudes and indicates power, yet benign eyes hint at the elegance and largely peaceful nature of these critically endangered mammals. All safari sights are memorable, but spotting a black rhino is a tale that will linger on for days, the scene constantly relived as people share stories over dinner and a campfire. Let's not forget some of the smaller and less known sights that grace Ngorongoro. Hyenas seem to be everywhere, scampering around as they seek an easy meal. Waterbuck feed silently in the forest, servals reveal beautiful spotted fur coats, and common eland butt heads as they jockey for power within the herd. Rocking back onto hind legs they generate power, before horns smash together and a ferocious echo filters through the trees. It can be a gruesome sight - eland bulls weight close to a ton. After a full day on the crater floor you'll ascend to the highest point of the crater rim to your accommodation that commands magnificent views and unforgettable sunsets. The dazzling lobby and lounges provide a regal welcome, each exquisitely furnished in a unique African style. A swimming pool and open grass lawns overlook the crater, offering the perfect place for a sundowner or a morning cup of fresh local coffee. Your spacious room has its own pristine view of this majestic natural wonder."

        "title": "Serengeti National Park – Exploring the Serengeti",
        "description": "You know those wildlife documentaries about Africa, the ones that seem fictitious and more like a Disney film? The camera panning out to see hundreds of thousands of wildebeest dotting a grass plain; close up shots of a lion pride effortlessly taking down a zebra; elephants wandering across immense open landscapes, no sight of roads or mankind anywhere. Well, that is the Serengeti. At times it feels fictional. You pinch yourself as it becomes apparent that places like this still exist and you quickly learn that the documentaries offer only a glimpse at what happens in the Serengeti. For three days you're going to be right in the middle of it all. Gaze across the endless plains and make out the resident herds, the yellow grass dotted black by wildebeest and zebra. Almost two-million mammals rumble across the Serengeti during the great wildebeest migration, perennially following the same cycle and turning the plains into a great patchwork quilt. Not everything migrates, and some resident herds decide its better to stay put than make a 1,800-mile round journey. That doesn't mean they'll escape the predators. While a fearsome gang of big cats track the migration, a huge collection stays and patrol their own territory. The Serengeti isn't about getting a glance of a lion or leopard. You'll be finding them every day, perhaps out on a hunt, and often within a few meters of your quivering camera. Game viewing is easy on these plains as the big mammals don't have many places to hide. Elephants rumble in the distance, giraffes wait on the horizon, and ungulate herds graze without any protection. From your safari lodge these eternal views will accompany every morning wake up call and every leisurely evening as you recount the day. In the Serengeti the wildlife doesn't stop, and you should expect to see an assorted cast of local residents roaming beside the lodge. Before entering the Serengeti on day six you'll first stop at Olduvai Gorge, a place that holds the secret to human evolution. Over a million years before homo sapiens, Homo habilis and Homo erectus were living in this gorge. Their fossilized remains have an almost eerie feel. Stand over the valley and there are a few thought-provoking moments that linger in the air. Man probably wouldn't have existed if it wasn't for what happened here. While the vast landscape remains remarkably constant, every game drive reveals something different. Stop for lunch and savor the sights of a hippo filled swamp. Explore the kopjes, rocky outcrops that are havens for lion prides escaping the afternoon sun. These are places where you might find lion and cheetah cubs taking their first steps. Buffalos square up and start a fight, great furry masses attacking each other and aiming for control of the female harem. Then there are the cute and delicate sights, like tiny dik dik, the world's smallest antelope half hidden by the grass, or any one of the 500 bird species that soar through the air. There are colorful lovebirds and enigmatic cranes, as well as rowdy flocks of vultures and giant marabou storks. The sights come thick and fast, something catching your eye every few minutes. But for all its abundant wildlife, it's the sheer freedom of the Serengeti that is often most impressive. You’re exploring a land that seems to have no boundaries or endpoints. Just imagine a place where you're surrounded by hundreds of miles of an ancient untamed ecosystem. This isn't a place for fast-paced sightseeing or immediate visual gratification. Relax, absorb the atmosphere, and allow nature to slowly paint an evocative picture. The Serengeti certainly isn't fictional. In fact, if you want to see the natural world in its most raw and untouched state, there is no better place on the planet."

After a quick cup of coffee and a snack, you will set out across Tarangire in search of intimate wildlife encounters. The beauty of Tarangire is that it is seldom visited by the masses of Tanzanian tourists, giving you plenty of opportunities for privacy and exclusivity in the wilderness. The park feels raw and untouched, which will nicely compliment the upcoming experiences in the Serengeti. Over the course of the morning, you may have the opportunity to observe the rare and endangered wild dog or an oryx. Giraffe, wildebeest, eland and impala are near guaranteed sightings over the course of the morning, as they graze in the acacia trees and plains. As the sun climbs, you will drive back to the lodge for brunch and relax in the shade during the afternoon. For some, that may mean curling up with a book from the library on the shaded terrace, while others may prefer to suntan beside the pool. Massages and yoga classes are available through the spa if looking for a bit of indulgence and relaxation. From the lodge, it is common for vervet monkeys scamper through the property while elephants amble past. In the late afternoon, you will have the option to set out on another guided game drive, or to explore the region on foot. Following the signs and scents of the wildlife outside of a vehicle gives unprecedented intimacy with your surroundings, and increases your knowledge of wildlife behavior. Approaching an elephant on foot is a truly unique experience, one that is not offered within the Serengeti. Return to the lodge as darkness sets in, and enjoy a sundowner on the terrace overlooking the plains below. Dinner will again be served in the remarkable dining area, while stars emerge around you.

The lake lies between the Eyasi Escarpment and the Kidero Mountains, with stunning meadows and forests along the shoreline. While wildlife viewing in this area will be good, the real draw to the region is the opportunity to spend time with the Hadzabe people, who have lived here for nearly 10,000 years. The Hadzabe are one of the few known tribes that continue to sustain themselves off hunting and gathering. Here, you will have the chance to learn from them, and perhaps even try out a few of their hunting techniques. Your rustic lodge is located near the lakeshore, and is built entirely out of local materials. Décor is inspired by the Hadzabe and Datoga cultures, making this an especially unique stop in the journey. In the afternoon, you may wish to stretch your legs with a guided walk along the shores of the lake, which are often dotted with flamingos, storks, pelicans and hippos. Dinner will be served at the main area, and you will have the option of having international fare or perhaps sampling some Tanzanian specialties.

As you track signs of human activity in this remote landscape, you will hopefully have the opportunity to interact with these unique individuals. Due to their small numbers and nomadic lifestyle, it is often difficult to predict their precise location. However, your guide will be able to follow signs left by wildlife and Hadzabe, drawing you closer to these 400 survivors. Upon reaching them, and earning permission to interact with them, you will learn about the culture, traditions and history of the tribe. You will also be able to visit the tribe’s current base, in order to observe an active homestead. It is possible to spend time learning how to hunt with a bow and arrow, or visiting the caves where they sleep while hunting. Throughout this walk, it is also likely that you will see smaller game including dik diks and lesser kudu. In the late afternoon, return to the camp for tea and coffee and some time to relax and reflect in your private tent. Enjoy a magical dinner tonight lit by hurricane lamps and the moon.

These distant ancestors of man date back 1.8 and 1 million years old respectively, and are among the oldest remains ever found. You can also see where fossilized footprints were found that date back approximately 3.6 million years. This is among the world’s most important paleoanthropological sites, and reveals a fascinating and hands-on opportunity to observe human evolution. From the gorge, you will carry on to the plains of the Serengeti. This predator-rich region is an impressive 14,900 square kilometers, and you will drive through the heart of the ecosystem as you head towards the western edge and your safari camp. Arriving in the late afternoon, you will be welcomed with a cool drink and face towel before being ushered to your luxury tent. You will likely want to spend the rest of the afternoon familiarizing yourself with the camp, and relaxing with a chilled drink on your private porch. A warm outdoor safari bucket shower might be the perfect way to refresh yourself after today’s drive. This shower-with-a-view quickly becomes a favorite activity among guests. Enjoy a sundowner as the sunset transforms the sky and landscape around you. As the stars emerge, you will head to the main dining area for a candlelit four-course dinner before having a final glass of wine or whiskey around the campfire.

Getting back in the truck after tea and coffee, you will then work with your guide to explore the Serengeti. He may take you through the Gol Kopjes, a popular place with cheetahs. Otherwise, you may head towards the Seronera River, where leopards are often spotted. No matter where you drive, herds of wildebeest, zebra and gazelle will undoubtedly surround you. These ungulates will be in the process of completing their annual migration through the Serengeti towards Kenya’s Masai Mara. Feasting on fresh grasses as they go, this event is heralded as one of the world’s most impressive and dramatic wildlife spectacles. Stop for lunch in the shade as wildebeest revolve around you, before carrying on with the adventure.

As you drift high over the savanna, the true expanse of this ecosystem will become abundantly apparent. The trip emphasizes the total magic of the region, as you look down on the acacia trees and wildebeest that stipple the landscape below.

Stopping to learn of the insects, birds and plants that sustain this park gives added insight into the eco-system, drawing attention away from merely ‘spotting’ the Big Five. Guides at your camp are very knowledgeable and will be able to share their perspectives and experiences as you walk together through herds of wildebeest, zebra and, if lucky, an elephant.

Today you will drive through the region en route to Rhino Lodge, located strategically near the crater rim with stunning views of the montane forest. Home initially to the area’s first conservator, this property has been rehabilitated into a rustic and low impact lodge. En route to your next lodge, you will make a stop in a local Masai village where you will have the chance to observe another fascinating east African culture. Famed for their intricate beadwork and impressive jumping abilities, a visit through a Masai boma (homestead) will give further insight into the tribes that survive in this remarkable landscape. A highlight of the Masai tour is always the moment when young men perform the famed adumu , the Masai jump. Competitively practiced among young men, the ability to soar to remarkable heights informs social positioning within the tribe. It is truly impressive. The evening will be spent unwinding at the lodge, perhaps in anticipation of a wildlife sighting. Unlike properties nearer to the ridge, this lodge has a number of elephant, buffalo and bush pig that regularly congregate around the property.

Take time to explore the flamingo-filled lakes, characteristic of the Great Rift Valley, before returning to the lodge in time for lunch. In the afternoon, you will have the option to join the lodge on one of many hikes that they offer in the region. A walk through the highlands carries you past a series of extinct volcanoes towards the crater rim. As you hike through the forest and grassland, you will be rewarded with great views of the Olduvai Gorge, the Serengeti and the Gol Mountains. It is also possible to follow another route that ends with sweeping views of Lake Eyasi and a number of Masai villages. Ambitious individuals can carry on from the Eyasi viewpoint up Mount Oldeani for an incredible panoramic view of the entire region. This four-hour hike would be the perfect way to conclude this tour of Tanzania. In the evening, you will return to the lodge for a final African dinner and drink under the stars.

        "title": "Tarangire National Park - Spectacular Safari",
        "description": "Life in Tarangire National Park revolves around water. A vast grassy savanna is punctuated by ancient baobab trees, their immensely broad trunks towering over brittle grass. Meandering through the park, the great Tarangire River attracts migrants from hundreds of miles around. At some points, it flows wildly. Large concentrations of waterbuck and zebra tentatively enjoy its life-giving goodness, ever watchful for surrounding predators. Yet in the dry season, animals must dig beneath the parched riverbed, using remarkable intuition to discover water. A procession of mammals heads towards waterholes, including lions, leopards, and elephants, all uninhibitedly heading for an easy drink. Shaded by an immense acacia tree, your luxurious canvas tent overlooks one of these waterholes, meaning that Tarangire's unique wildlife essentially comes to you. Situated in a secluded area of Tarangire, your safari lodge offers privacy, exclusivity, and a unique harmony with nature. Each en-suite tent is unashamedly luxurious, featuring comfortable beds, plush sofas, and indoor and outdoor showers. They're also opulently furnished with traditional materials. Raised on stilts above the savannah, the spacious tents have private viewing decks that gaze down on Tarangire's unique world. Elephant herds roam past the camp, a giraffe's distinct shape is silhouetted against a slow-burning sunset, while a lion pride approaches for a drink. A spectacular infinity swimming pool also overlooks the waterhole, while a personal attendant will attend to every one of your needs."

        "title": "Serengeti National Park - Safari Days",
        "description": "Tanzania's vast wilderness offers one of the world's final animal havens. The national parks have no fences or barriers. The parks merge into one another as animals roam freely across the landscape of dense forests, endless savannas, lakes and swamps. East Africa's inimitable mammals travel across the land and find personal havens in different habitats. Other than a few Maasai tribes, this beautiful wilderness isn't populated by man. Private tented camps are pitched in hand selected wildlife areas, offering an intimate bush experience that doesn't leave any footprints on the environment. On day four you'll be transferred to the Tarangire airstrip for a flight to your camp. Each private camp is exclusively designed to suit your interests and tastes. They are pitched in secluded areas of wilderness where you'll find no other accommodations, tourists or safari trucks. For four days your private camp becomes part of the landscape and who knows which animals will wander past for closer inspection. In Tanzania, the tents are pitched in either the endless grass plains of the Serengeti or in the Ngorongoro Nature Reserve. The exact location depends on the guest and could take into account the location of the Great Wildebeest Migration. Attentive staff cater to all your needs and ensure that nothing gets too close. Extremely spacious tents are carefully furnished with traditional furniture, hand woven rugs, and king sized beds. A fully flushing china toilet and hot running water is available in your en-suite bathroom, while solar power provides electricity for the camp. Dining tables are erected in the bush and sumptuous meals are enjoyed with breathtaking 360º views of this surreal landscape. Each day is individually tailored to your needs, and could include any range of game viewing activities including scenic flights, hot air ballooning, camel and horseback safaris, or daytime and nighttime game drives."

        "title": "Grumeti - Luxury Safari Experience",
        "description": "On a private charter flight, you'll fly over the endless grass plains of the Serengeti, heading to Grumeti Reserve in the north west of Tanzania. Adjacent to the Serengeti, this enormous private concession is integral to the Great Wildebeest Migration and offers a luxurious safari experience. Every year, over two million mammals migrate across this land, heading north for the rich grasses of the Maasai Mara. Great herds dot the plains with tens of thousands of wildebeest marching together and leaving a swirling trail of dust behind them. Zebras and Thompson's gazelle join them, trying to keep their distance from the predators that trail behind. But a lion pride stirs panic in the herd, lionesses approaching from different angles and offering the confused prey nowhere to run. A lame wildebeest is separated from the herd and the furious final attack lasts just a few seconds. At all times of year the Grumeti Reserve thrives with wildlife. The Serengeti has no boundaries, and every species on four legs wanders over into this private concession. But while the Serengeti is also populated by safari trucks and tourists, Grumeti offers a very private and personal safari experience. Enjoy daytime game drives that reveal giant herds and hunting predators, or explore the nocturnal magic of Africa on a nighttime drive. Intermediate and advanced horseback riders can take enchanting rides onto the endless grass plains, galloping alongside zebra and infiltrating a giraffe herd. Elephants and giraffes wander in the distance, their distinct shapes towering above a small herd of kudu that rest in the grass. Nighttime brings a beautiful starry sky, and perhaps a pair of incandescent looking buffalo eyes just meters from the cottage. Leopards lurk nearby, as do lion prides. Don't worry if you don't spot them from your verandah, the experienced trackers will locate them as soon as you head off on a morning game drive."

        "description": "After eight exhilarating days on safari, you'll be transported to the airstrip for your flight to Zanzibar. Surrounded by calm Indian Ocean waters, Mnemba Island is just one mile in circumference. Traditional wooden dhows drift along the horizon, coconut palm trees line irresistibly white sand, while the tropical forest hides just ten quaint palm-frond bandas. Just a handful of lodge guests and a discreet team of staff stay on this island. You'll have a blissful piece of beach paradise all to yourself. Fresh lobster and prawns are served on wooden platters, romantic candlelit dinners follow a serene sunset, and the temperate waters provide safe swimming all year around. Before your transfer to the idyllic Mnemba Island you'll have the option to take a private tour around Zanzibar's Stone Town, a UNESCO World Heritage site that reveals the cultural history of this iconic island. It's still a thriving town, and a charming wander takes you through a labyrinthine collection of narrow streets. Locals congregate around domino games and street-side televisions, men sell mountains of oranges from wooden carts, while barefoot children skip past ancient churches and mosques. Diverse influences harmoniously juxtapose on these atmospheric streets. Persian baths stand beside ornate Islamic courtyards, Hindu temples are hidden behind British colonial remnants, and boisterous cafes look out onto opulently decorated wooden doorways. A fragrant journey takes you from Stone Town to the north eastern tip of Zanzibar, passing through lush spice plantations and rich jungle. From here it's a 20 minute boat ride to your private island. On Mnemba Island it's easy to relax into an unhurried atmosphere where time is often irrelevant. Lounge on your own piece of beach or enjoy languid hours on your banda's secluded verandah. Each banda features traditional materials and offers a tropical version of a beach cottage. A covered walkway leads you into the forest and an en-suite bathroom with a huge shower. Thatched bar areas have unobstructed views of the beach and the island of Zanzibar. Between April and August, green turtles lay their eggs on the beach, and within a couple of months the island is filled with cute turtle hatchlings. It's easy to unwind and do little but enjoy the exquisite beach and tranquility. Wade into the turquoise waters or snorkel along spectacular coral reefs that reveal a vivid assortment of tropical life. Mnemba Island is part of a marine conservation area, and there is an on site PADI dive school that can take new and experienced divers into the pristine marine world. Deep-sea fishing and specialty dives can also be arranged. Attentive staff fulfill all of your needs and an array of delicious meals are served in the most enchanting of surroundings. After eight days on safari, these three days will show you another side to Tanzania's charms."

        "title": "Giant Elephant Herds and Spectacular Safari in Tarangire National Park",
        "description": "Tarangire's beautiful landscape offers an ideal start to your safari adventure. Ancient baobab trees punctuate the grassy savanna, their distinct shapes finding a way into most Tarangire photos. Meandering through the landscape are giant elephant herds, often numbering over 300 strong. Beside waterholes they stop and play, tiny babies taking their first steps and amusing all with their antics. The herd's size and power always leaves an impression, but it's often the intimate interactions that linger longest in the memory. Also meandering through the park is the great Tarangire River, this constant water source attracting thousands of migrating mammals. In wet season the kudu and impala drink with little threat, but when the river shrivels, everyone must dig beneath the parched river bed. That leaves the mammals exposed, making them prime targets for the park's resident lions and leopards. Screeching from the treetops is an assortment of birds, some 500 different species making their voices heard. Yellow collared lovebirds are perhaps the most beautiful, while the prize for nosiest goes to the ground hornbills. Kori bustards are the heaviest, but they're dwarfed by the hippo pods that wade in Tarangire's swamps. On each game drive you'll encounter something different, from the long necked gerenuks that feed from high branches to the bizarre sight of fringe-eared oryx. Then a herd of rumbustious buffalo charge past the safari truck, the bushy haired beasts leaving a trail of dust as they rumble through the brittle grass."

        "description": "Nestled into a woodland clearing, Lake Manyara provides a new habitat to explore. Thousands of flamingos cover the lake, the water brilliantly tinged pink by a blanket of these birds. They share the wading rights with large hippo pods, the lumbering beasts often only keeping their eyes and snout above the surface. Then one pops up to say hello, uninhibitedly plodding along the embankment just meters away. In the vast floodplains an assorted cast go about their day; elephants roam, zebras skip, gazelle stand tentatively, while giraffes showcase their elegance as you slowly drive past. Leave the lake behind and wind through an overgrown forest. Baboon troops ramble across the forest floor, jumping over exposed roots and swinging between low branches. Round another corner and an elephant blocks the trail. The truck stops and an eery silence filters through the trees. On an exposed tree branch something else is swinging. It's a lion's tale. Unique to Lake Manyara and Tarangire, these tree-climbing lions have evolved to hunt in the forest. They hide up high, ready to pounce on anything that's ambling below. Leopards also thrive in this landscape, and catching a glimpse of these majestic cats is the highlight of any safari adventure. Accompanying the mystical safari through Lake Manyara is a raucous soundtrack of wild Africa."

        "description": "Driving towards Ngorongoro Crater you ascend through rich jungle, baboons eyeing your journey from the trees. Keep your windows closed at the park gate because these mischievous primates have a tendency to jump into safari trucks and ransack any edible treats. Perched on the crater rim, your lodge enjoys breathtaking views into the crater. Zebras and elephants randomly wander past, followed into the crater floor by Maasai warriors herding their cattle. You'll arrive in time for a spellbinding afternoon safari on the crater floor, a place that's recently been nicknamed Africa's “Garden of Eden.” Lion prides live in close proximity and they're the kings of this environment. In the relentless afternoon sun they search for shade, lounging beneath trees or finding respite in the shadow created by your safari truck. Some prides are hungry and the lionesses are out hunting, slowly approaching a zebra herd who watchfully graze. Alpha males sit and wait, showing off brilliant black manes and ferocious teeth. Leopards stealthily leave the forest, also eyeing up a hearty dinner. In the meantime, scampering along the grass clearings, hyenas and jackals look for an easier meal. They stop and gaze up at the safari truck, before scurrying away towards a lame wildebeest. As an encompassing blackness descends on the crater, enjoy a leisurely evening surrounded by the natural sounds of Africa. Punctuating the silence is bird song, elephants rustling in the trees, and monkeys and bush babies offering their inimitable calls."

        "description": "In the early morning, a blanket of mysterious mist rises from the crater floor. Elephant bulls are clambering down the slopes, followed by kudu, wildebeest, and your safari truck. Now is an ideal time to spot big cats returning from a hunt or feeding on a freshly killed carcass. Once inside this inactive volcano, the question is which unique ecosystem you want to explore first. Perhaps start with the woodland, where majestic eland and waterbuck can be found. These gracious antelopes combine size and beauty, and they stand silently as your camera snaps away. A hippo's wheeze-honk grabs your attention, the rowdy beast plodding along a lakeshore and munching on a carpet of fresh grass. Another young male returns the call, the two hippos enthusiastically squaring up to each other. The sheer concentration of wildlife makes Ngorongoro feel like a wildlife documentary. Nowhere else in Africa is it possible to see such diversity and abundance in a single game drive. Like all your game drives on this vacation you'll be accompanied by a skilled guide who knows the favorite spots of each of the mammals. A spacious 4x4 vehicle with a pop-up roof means you have an elevated vantage point and unobstructed views of the landscapes. Sometimes the truck is filled with excited chatter and amazed eyes. At other times everyone stops and watches in silence, like when a black rhino calf slowly ambles towards the safari truck before stopping to stare. The calf is joined by its mother, who's kicking up dust in a confident show of strength. With just 5,000 black rhinos left in the wild, a close up experience with these critically endangered animals will live long in the memory."

        "description": "As you leave Ngorongoro behind, the landscape flattens out and the stupendous views begin. In every direction there is grass, and it extends beyond the horizon, occasionally punctuated by the silhouette of a giraffe neck or an elephant herd. To the local Maasai, this is land that extends forever and it's difficult to contradict this description as you get your first taste of what is the world's most famous national park. Thousands of Thompson's gazelle are feeding on the grass, always keeping a watchful ear for the nearby predators. Giant wildebeest herds dot the plains, covering the grass in a swirl of dust and four hooves. Zebra join them, their black and white elegance always bringing a smile no matter how many times you've seen them on this vacation. The Serengeti is home to the Great Wildebeest Migration, and during these times the herds multiply and combine, often traveling in a group of tens of thousands strong. Before arriving in the plains you'll enjoy a short stop at Olduvai Gorge, a remarkable archaeological site that has uncovered fossils that date back to prehistoric man. It's an eery and poignant experience, gazing out onto a land that holds the secrets to man's evolution. Your comfortable lodge will provide a continuous immersion in the Serengeti's animal world. No humans are allowed to live here, and the life and death interactions of wild animals plays out in front of your eyes. But for all the wildlife, it's often the vast beauty of the Serengeti that leaves the most indelible impression."

Lions survey their kingdom from kopjes (rocky outcroppings) where prides rest and decide what should be on the dinner menu. Cheetahs accelerate across the plains, leaving a dusty trail behind as they move at phenomenal speeds. A kill can happen in an instant. Sometimes it comes from nowhere, like when you're watching a wildebeest herd and a leopard pounces from its camouflaged hiding place. At other times tension runs high, fearful gazelle anticipating trouble but unable to locate the cause. You can see hunter and prey, and as the cat approaches a silence accompanies the scene. A ferocious pounce draws gasps from the safari truck, but the zebra got away...this time. Throughout your time in the Serengeti, your guide will take you to the best wildlife viewing spots. Dependent on the time of year, they will try and track the Great Migration and give you front row seats to the phenomenal herds of wildebeest that cover the plains. Throughout the park there are special sights and your guides will tailor each game drive dependent on your interests. Enjoy a picnic beside a hippo filled pool and watch the interactions between different members of the pods. Approach kopjes where the scenes resemble something very similar to the Lion King. Weave along rutted trails where buffalo and hartebeest impress with their savage horns. You'll enjoy morning and late afternoon game drives each day. In the heat of the early afternoon the plains are quiet, animals resting in any available shade. The afternoon provides a chance for leisurely relaxation at the lodge, before the adrenalin levels are raised as you set off once more into the wilderness."

        "description": "An early arrival into Kilimanjaro International Airport is followed by an enchanting flight over the Serengeti plains, a light aircraft cruising the length of the grasslands and descending onto an airstrip in the north. It's the Northern Serengeti that has the greatest concentration of wildlife throughout the entire year, the proximity to the Mara River maintaining food and life throughout the driest of the months. The mammal population swells from May to July as the migration passes through. Many ungulates then make the perilous crossing over the river, although some of the herds prefer to stick to the fresh grazing pastures of the Northern Serengeti. This area is also on the migration route when the wildebeest and zebra return south, usually in scattered clumps of herds, perhaps just half of the number that started the annual journey. From the airstrip, there's a brief game drive en route to the camp, then a hearty early lunch and time to rest under the canvas. Luxurious and chic, your safari camp reflects the quality of accommodation in Northern Serengeti. Expect an uninterrupted connection with nature, the sounds flowing into the opulent tent, and the curtains opening each morning to roaming mammals. Later in the afternoon, you head out on a game drive, an exploratory journey that unravels the diversity of the plains. Thompson's gazelle are scattered across one panorama; then turn around to encounter a cackle of a hyena. Giraffes and elephants are easily spotted from afar, then thrillingly encountered amongst the trees. A warthog scurries along as a baboon troop shouts from the bushes; enjoy a serene sunset as the hippos start emerging from the water."

Wind along the southern banks of the Mara River and admire everything that comes to drink, another cluster of animals coming along every ten or so minutes. Sometimes you can cross open areas and not see anything. But look a little closer and there's a caracal hiding in the grass, a leopard lurking beneath a tree, and a whole flurry of exotic birds. Then you cross a ridge and the panorama is suddenly filled with thousands of mammals, including the iconic herds of wildebeest and zebra."

        "title": "Northern Serengeti – Mobile Camping and Walking Safari",
        "description": "It's always inspiring to see an elephant, the tusks curling, the trunk swinging with playful pride. Giraffes and zebras are equally impressive, huddled together with their adorable mash of colorful tones. The landscape is filled with animals to be savored, such as buffalos, hippos, gazelles, hartebeests. You'll see them all on a game drive. But there's an enhanced thrill to encountering these animals on foot. On a walking safari, you're just another mammal on the plains, one that the other animals are naturally inquisitive about. Many animals hear the noise of a vehicle and move away, yet they aren't perturbed by people traveling almost silently on foot. So you get closer. And the animals appear so much bigger when you're both on ground level. A walking safari provides this new perspective and is the focus of these two days. For safety reasons, it's an activity that isn't suited to places that are completely packed with wildlife; you wouldn't want to be amongst a 10,000-strong zebra herd when the threat of lions could come from any direction. Instead, the walking safari provides a unique insight into the daily rhythm of the Serengeti, away from the biggest herds and largest predator presence. You're guided by Maasai warriors, who pass on their ancient knowledge about how to track animals. From animal dung to broken branches and barely perceptible prints, you'll learn many of the exquisite details that can be missed when the safari program only includes game drives. Enhancing the experience is the mobile camp, which you travel to on a game drive. Moving location with every guest, this private camp completes the connection with nature. You have the basic comforts, with a bed raised on a wooden platform, a hot bucket shower, Western toilet, and comfortable chairs for watching the procession of life on the plains. But this isn't a time for extras like a swimming pool or artistic works on the walls. It's a time for soaking up the authenticity of the land. Listen to lions roar throughout the evening, smell the scents left by passing herds, feel the goosebumps as a buffalo herd wanders past at dawn, and lose yourself in the remote beauty of the Serengeti. Note that the mobile camp is flexible at heart, so the location will change throughout the year to ensure a private and safe experience on the plains."

Unlike the national park, the number of visitors to this private reserve is carefully limited and only those staying in the reserve are permitted to enter. This creates an enchanting stretch of grassland that isn't interrupted by other vehicles, one that permits a safari experience straight from the imagination. You'll fly into Grumeti, then spend the day on a game drive with a difference. Rather than stick to the main trails, the guides will have you bumping across the plains, getting as close as possible to each of the revered safari sights. You'll have already seen vultures in the Serengeti. But now you watch them circle and drive towards the bloodied remains of a zebra carcass below. Hyenas won't be a new sight, but the guide can lead you towards a ferocious battle between the cackle and three young male lions. Raucous calls alert you to a predator in the trees, the birds warning nearby gazelles of a menacing presence. Rather than peer from a distance, you come within ten meters of a leopard attempting to blend into the grass. After two days of mobile camping, your next lodge brings you back into the realm of luxurious extras like spa treatments and a plunge pool overlooking the plains below."

        "description": "There's a herd of zebra crossing the plains, a few dozen clustered together as they slowly graze and move. After five days in the Serengeti, it's definitely not a new sight – you've been seeing zebras continuously. Except you're not just watching them, you're riding alongside them. A horseback safari provides another fresh perspective and confident riders can enjoy a very intimate ride with the herds. Beginner riders will only be moving at a walking pace but this is also an inspiring and evocative ride on the plains. Again, it's an activity suited to the non-migration months. When the long rains fall in April, the grass rises to phenomenal heights, making it a haven for stealthy predators. After the herds have chomped their way through, the low open grass makes it easy to spot predators for miles around. So towards the end of the year, more and more areas become safe for walking and horseback safari. On this flexible itinerary, the ride could just be a short exploratory excursion. Or it could be a full day riding around. Approach the river and admire the hippos, especially when one opens its mouth with a humongous yawn. Stop beside a giraffe and marvel at the size, before admiring the cute baby that still rises higher than the horse. Approach zebra and gazelle, getting close to some but watching others scatter upon your arrival. Guides are always interpreting behavior, knowing where it's safe to turn. For example, a herd of bachelor male buffalo can be one of the most dangerous encounters on the plains, their testosterone-fueled aggression best to avoid even in a vehicle. But a herd of females and calves will be placid if they don't sense any predatory threat. At your lodge, it's also possible to spend today on a game drive or walking safari, dependent on your mood."

        "title": "Namiri Plains – The Serengeti's Private Big Cat Safari Destination",
        "description": "The eastern plains are the most unexplored of all the Serengeti's regions. As they're not on the northbound migration route, they don't see a surge in visitors at any point during the year. In fact, there's a widely held misconception that the Eastern Serengeti has a relative scarcity of wildlife. Which means there aren't many visitors. Furthermore, most visitors are exploring large private conservancies, with often an hour's drive between any two camps. The Namiri Plains is one of these and it's one of Africa's most exhilarating up-and-coming destinations. Opened to visitors in 2014, it's a special haven for big cat encounters and a fascinating place to end a Serengeti safari. For over 20 years, the Namiri Plains have been a specially protected research concession. Access to the land and animals was restricted, so the big cats behave as authentically and unchanged as anywhere in Africa. It's still a research area and some game drives are accompanied by scientists and researchers, adding another layer of insight into the safari. Namiri Plains is the only camp in this vast private conservancy and it only caters for 12 visitors. It's rare you see another vehicle or person on the drives. As you would expect from an exclusive camp, there's an excellent level of comfort and service, plus a seamless immersion into nature. You'll fly into the eastern plains from the Western Serengeti, and then take a 90-minute game drive transfer to the camp. Find a leopard nursing her cub in the highest branches, spending an hour savoring the interaction. Find two male lions fighting for supremacy, one of them bloodied and scarred. Watch a cheetah stalk a gazelle, exceptional camouflage enabling it to pounce from close range. Feel the tension as three hyenas snap away at a wildebeest herd, predicting that an old male will soon collapse from exhaustion. Namiri Plains is all about these exceptional encounters and three days gives you a good opportunity to see all the revered hunters out exploring. Sometimes the proximity is both thrilling and heartbreaking, a carcass being torn apart by a pride or a limp body being carried off between the jaws."

Animals are very difficult to spot around the park gate and park perimeter. For better sightings, you will need to venture deeper into the park towards the area around your lodge. Elephants will soon start to dominate, marching in herds of up to 60, and baobab trees will mark the horizon, which are resting places for primates and leopards. Soon, the rest of the world will disappear,w and it will be just you and the animals. Within two hours of being in Tarangire, your senses will have been tuned to the wilderness."

        "description": "Today, a game drive will take you out of Tarangire, through Lake Manyara, and into a thick and mysterious forest. The going will be slow here with muddy trails and plenty of wildlife blocking the way. You will travel deeper and deeper until the lush green foliage becomes incredibly thick. Lake Manyara has the world’s largest baboon population, and they can cause a racket with troops quarreling by bashing on trees and yelping loudly. Within an hour in the park, you will have seen hundreds of them from raucous large males to tiny babies. It may seem like the forest has no end, but with a few more turns the lake will appear. Now there will be thousands of animals in a single panorama although you will not get as close as you were in the forest. Hippos will fill the lake, buffalo will graze, and baboons will scurry about in large gangs. The forest is sparser on the opposite side of the park, and it is here where you will search for lions. They will lounge upon branches, sleepily watching the savanna below. Sometimes an entire pride will fill a tree with a dozen lions watching patrolling the landscape for prey. There are only a couple of places in Africa where lions do this, adding exclusivity to your encounter in what is the continent’s most picturesque park. At other destinations like the Serengeti, you will need to maximize the early morning and late afternoon, going on game drives when the animals are the most active. That will not be as important in Lake Manyara, so you can explore throughout the day before exiting to the north and continuing into the Ngorongoro Conservation Area. Your lodge will be positioned on the crater rim and will be perfect for making you the first visitor into the crater tomorrow morning."

At this early hour, the predators will be prowling, and lions and leopards will commonly be spotted on the plains, using the mist as a veil to hunt. Gradually the mist will clear, and the lakes will appear. Into a forest you will venture, passing some of Africa’s largest tusked elephants on your way. Then, back out on the plains, you will make out the remains of a hunt with lions lounging around a carcass. Black rhinos will trot past, keeping clear of the commotion, and buffalos will graze in large numbers as zebras skip clear of hyena. Now it will be the middle of the morning, and the whole caldera floor will be in view. With a single glance, you can see upwards of 10,000 animals. Over 30,000 wild mammals live here, and they represent almost all of Africa’s famous species. The only big one that will not be present is the giraffe because the caldera slopes are too steep for them to walk down. You are allowed six hours in Ngorongoro, meaning you will ascend around midday. The rest of the day will be very at your leisure, admiring caldera views from your lodge and watching the odd mammal en route to the lakes."

        "description": "The fourth park in Tanzania’s iconic northern circuit, the Serengeti, is adjacent to Ngorongoro Conservation Area. This circuit is so good because it is an unbroken wildlife route with animals moving freely between the areas. In each park, the landscape changes, and the most dramatic transformation that you will see on your trip will be today. You will descend from the crater rim and look upon seemingly endless grass plains. Scattered across these plains will be wildebeest, zebra and Thomson’s gazelle. At first, they will be dots, but as you descend, they will grow larger. Stripes will appear, and bearded wildebeest will play with each other. With three days in the Serengeti, you can cover a large proportion of the park. You will need this much time because it is such an enormous space and the animals are always on the move. Different areas will be packed with life at different times of the year. Rocky platforms will punctuate the grasslands, which are the hideouts from which lions watch the plains. Predators will not follow the herds, so you will be able to see lions and leopards throughout the park. Unfortunately, some areas within the Serengeti will appear empty. This is just how it is in the vast, African wilderness. You might see an elephant or buffalo, but not the fabled herds. With three days, you will track the animals’ movement, staying in a camp that is amongst the largest animal populations. Like with every stop on this luxury safari, the camp will be handpicked, using location as a premium. There are stunning lodges and camps across the Serengeti, but a great safari is dictated by being in the right place at the right time. Some camps will literally be surrounded by herds. You can even lay in bed and listen to animals grazing. You will also wake up to a vista that includes many thousands of animals. Over these three days, you will track the herds during game drives. Except it is never just the herds, it is the drama that follows them. Hyenas yelp in unison, alerting the pack to the weak and vulnerable. At first, they are ugly little characters, but there will be a charm when you look beyond their laughing stigma. Leopards will rest on tree branches, watching you with piercing blue eyes. Occasionally, they leap onto the grasslands where you will follow them. It is the abundance of encounters that you will most remember. Here, it is not one lion but many prides. Even elusive animals like cheetahs are seen in large numbers. With three days, you should spot the enormous herds, sometimes over 100,000 wildebeest filling a single frame. You will appreciate the contrast between fertile plains and those areas that have already been grazed, and you will come to understand the rhythm of life, particularly the daily battles between predator and prey. On some days, you will go out on full-day game drives, taking a packed lunch with you. On other days, you will have morning and afternoon game drives, with downtime back at your camp."

        "description": "Through the green, you will see a blanket of black fur. A gorilla is on the move, crawling on all fours through the rainforest. It will take an hour of trekking to get here. Now, you must continue the journey, and the guide will slice a path with a machete. Only after 30 minutes will the gorillas stop, and you will have reached your destination. You will approach slowly as a gorilla mother gazes out and greets you before uttering a grunt of approval. You can creep even closer, walking up to the rest of the troop. A dozen gorillas will appear before you, including a playful youngster swinging about the trees. Officially, you can come to within seven meters, but the gorillas do not know this. Some of them start feeding behind you. For 30 minutes, it will be as if you are in a dream with so much going on that it will be hard to know where to focus. The second half of the encounter will be more relaxed, especially once you put the camera away. You will admire different behaviors and sounds, especially how the gorillas interact with each other. There will be time to focus on an individual, particularly the cute gestures and calls that it makes. Slowly you will come to know an entire troop, and then, it will be time to return, trekking back through the rainforest and away from these unique primates. This is too unique of an experience to only do once. So, the next morning you will return, trekking to a different troop and experiencing the behavior of another gorilla family. It will be more relaxed the second time around, especially now that you know how gorilla trekking works. This time it will be a larger troop with two silverbacks and a slightly different social structure. You will stare in awe and wonder at the primates for an hour, feeling the inimitability of who you are with and sensing the remoteness of the rainforest. There are only around 1,000 mountain gorillas left, and none of them have ever been captive. When you return to the lodge, it will be rather special to think that you have encountered two of the few remaining troops."

But it's different to see it all from just a few meters away. Buffalos stare and stamp their hooves, showing off their one-ton frames and bushy hair.

It's an iconic scene, elephant and baobab juxtaposed in one of Africa's finest parks, and it's a scene that will accompany you throughout these two days in Tarangire. Olive baboons and waterbuck also move effortlessly across the woodland, while a cacophony of birdsong sails across the treetops. Yellow-collared lovebirds are probably the loudest, and they're just one of 550 different bird species that congregate here. Some are pretty, some sing duets, like the red-and-yellow barbet, and then some impress with their size, including the nine foot wingspan of the Kori bustard. Tarangire has a raw and rugged landscape, scorched and dusty in dry season, fresh and vivid during the rainy season. And the views will continue all day and night, with your lodge offering spectacular panoramas and quaint accommodation. Elephants regularly pass right by, joined by a congregation of oryx and zebra. So sit back, admire the wonders of untamed Africa, and listen to the unique sounds of nature. But don't get too relaxed, two full days of thrilling safari will reveal all corners of Tarangire. Wildlife spotting is easy, the immense Tarangire River quenching the thirst of all its residents. Impala and hartebeest sip greedily in herds, relying on the vigilant look-out of others. Gazelle and eland are also out drinking, scratching along the shriveled riverbeds and swamps. Don't worry if these antelope species sound unfamiliar now, you'll quickly learn the nuances and how to distinguish each variety. In particular, look out for the rare long-necked gerenuk, standing on their hind legs and craning their necks towards overhanging branches. There are predators here, lots of them, and you'll find them in strange places. Admire the baobab trees and acacia woodland, photographing a landscape that looks as African as all the wildlife documentaries. All seems calm. But wait...was that something moving in the tree? Get closer and it appears to be nothing. You're just 10 meters away now, scanning the branches for movement, and then a lucid pair of eyes makes you jump. The lion has been watching you. They climb trees all over Tarangire, camouflaging themselves and then pouncing on prey. Leopards also prowl along these branches, and witnessing these two stealthy predators is a highlight of being in the park."

Perhaps you’ll spot a troop of baboons; mothers cradling babies and skipping across the red ground, old males reclining against a tree. Or maybe an elephant, appearing from nowhere and standing almost within touching distance. You'll drive slowly through the forest, each corner bringing surprise, and each tree a possible resting place for the tree-climbing lion. Lake Manyara is nestled into the base of the Great Rift Valley escarpment, and its forest is combined with a hippo infested lake and elephant covered floodplain. After leaving Tarangire you'll first stop at Mto Wa Mbu, a traditional Maasai village full of endearing sights; it's hard to leave without being energized by the color and imbued by their fierce continuation of tradition. More colors mark Lake Manyara, bright shocks of blue and red amongst the park's remarkable concentration of bird species. They flutter around the lake, joined by the hippos that wade through the shallows and then lope along the muddy banks. Alpha males jockey for mating rights, while youngsters rest their heads on a mother's humongous back. Lake Manyara is relatively small for a national park, but its combination of ecosystems and diverse collection of wildlife make this an action-packed day."

You can also see the clues; an upturned stone, a line of animal droppings, a slight indent in the grass. But the bushman spots them without breaking stride, eyes always scanning ahead, the path of the prey continually visualized. On day eight you'll head out on a morning hunt, a haunting experience that reveals the phenomenal skills of these ancient people. And yes, they do still use a homemade bow and arrow. Your tented camp offers surreal views over Lake Eyasi, a shallow salt lake that rises and falls with the rains.

It's difficult to know which way to point the camera as the crater floor teems with unique scenes. Buffalo herds chew and chomp their way through the grass beside you. Flamingos cover the lake, shocks of pink wonderfully contrasted with the vivid blue water. But turn around quickly and a pride of lions are on the hunt, slowly walking through the grass as they target a large herd of watchful wildebeest. There's a popular conception that great wildlife photography takes lots of patience. In many places it does. Ngorongoro wildlife is unlike anywhere else on the planet and because of the sheer concentration of wildlife, you need to be prepared at all times! Your accommodations overlook the crater with private verandahs gazing down on a unique biosphere. From here you can see it all; the verdant woodland, open grassland, parched riverbeds, and the far walls of this inactive volcanic caldera. This is one of Africa's best lodges, mixing tradition and style with luxury and charm. Huge elephant bulls and small zebra herds are amongst the cast that like to wander past the lodge in the evening. Gaze down onto nature's great amphitheater and then descend the steep crater walls into the heart of the action. On most game drives you hope to see lions. In Ngorongoro these ferocious predators are part of the scenery, and spotting them out on a hunt is a real possibility. Some prides lounge in the sun, bellies full, eyes half-closed, beautiful black manes out on display. Others are hungry, the females ducking into the grass as they eye up a meal. Don't stare at them for too long though, because over your shoulder could be a cheetah or hyena. Out in the forest is a kind of elephant retirement home, some of the continent's largest males plodding a lone track through the trees, cast out from the herd but enjoying the bounty of Ngorongoro. Keep exploring and there are the hippos that prowl the lake shore, or the dazzling horns of the hartebeest herds. Then one sight brings about silence in the safari truck. A pair of endangered black rhinos approach the clearing, slowly, unhurried, watchful. Their power is evident, their horns are expectantly majestic, yet their grace comes as a surprise. Before the cameras come out there's a moment when everyone just watches and admires, these breathtaking animals witnessed first-hand. Ngorongoro Crater is the best place in Tanzania to spot Black rhinos."

The grass plains seem to stretch for eternity, going beyond the horizon and dotted with giant herds of wildebeest and zebra. This is where the Great Migration takes place, an annual journey of some two million mammals, dictated by the rains and followed by a hungry cast of predators. The migration is happening all year round, the animals always in search of fresh grazing land. For the next two days you'll be in the south east of this immense park, staying at your next lodge, neatly situated just outside the park boundary and away from the tourist crowds. From here the immense plains wow the eyes, vistas extending into the distance from your private verandah, and elephants approaching a nearby waterhole. Before reaching the lodge you'll have a short stop in Olduvai Gorge, the cradle of humankind where man's earliest ancestral remains have been found. It's a poignant and thought provoking experience. In the early months of the year the wildebeest congregate around this corner of the Serengeti, giving birth and raising young on the profuse grass. It's a particularly abundant time for predators. Cheetahs accelerate and pounce, the defenseless wildebeest unable to prevent regular attacks. Lion prides peacefully coexist, while hyenas and jackals scrounge for scraps. At all times of year the sheer concentration of wildlife is difficult to believe. Giraffes amble along the horizon, their necks silhouetted against a burning sunset. Thompson's gazelle seem to pop up everywhere, while circling vultures reveal the location of a recent kill. With morning and afternoon game drives you'll be overwhelmed by the sights of the Serengeti. Even a quick stop for a picnic is accompanied by a pool full of wading hippos."

It takes a journey across the park to truly reveal the scale of the Serengeti. The grassland never stops; it just keeps going and going. The Kirawira Serena is idyllically situated, towering over the famous western corridor, on the route of the marauding wildebeest. They pass through here between April and June, although the exact dates will vary each year. And remember, it takes a long time for two million mammals to pass by, so don’t be worried about turning up a day late. Giant herds dot the plains, covering them in a patchwork quilt of black. From a distance it's a surreal sight, and there's a good chance that you'll be seeing it from the elegance of this exclusive camp. Each tent comes with a personal valet, a four-poster bed, antique Edwardian furniture, and the ongoing sounds of the Serengeti. These are your last two days on safari and the wonders will continue. Nowhere in Tanzania is the same, and every game drive brings new delights. In the Serengeti there's always grass, gazelle, wildebeest, and predators. On some drives the lions lie in the shade of your safari truck. On others it's a leopard that's most memorable, its solemn movements towards prey showcasing intelligence and beauty. Then on the drive back to camp a pair of elephants starts fighting in front of your eyes. And throughout it all the landscape provides a breathtaking beauty, a stunning backdrop that screams of untamed Africa and aches with authenticity. For an alternative vista, an optional morning balloon ride can be taken on day 14. For an idyllic final evening, ask your valet for a hammock and watch everything unfold. As always in the Serengeti, keep the camera ready...you never can predict what time something might wander past the camp."

But Kilimanjaro immediately inspires, causing a gasp as your family lands at Kilimanjaro International Airport and gazes across at the summit. There are few better introductions to Africa's wonders.

        "description": "When the boy king is banished, he's revived from near death by a warthog and a meerkat (here's another inconsistency with reality as meerkats are not residents in this area). Together they sing about Hakuna Matata , a wonderful phrase concerning trouble-free living. This phrase comes directly from the Swahili language and is frequently used by locals to say “no worries.” As the two guides lead you into Ngorongoro Crater, you quickly learn how it wasn't just local landscapes and animals that inspired the movie. The Swahili language fills the script: Simba translates as lion, Pumba is a colloquialism for warthog, Mufasa means king in some Swahili dialects, and Shenzi (the name of the lead hyena) translates as a mix of barbarous and uncouth. Simba and his two new friends live in a carefree world, one that is very much like Ngorongoro Crater. Giant elephant bulls inhabit the forest here, their proud tusks rising above the eyes of a retired patriarch. Flamingos create a pink tinge on the lake while hippos barge across the grass. Zebras and buffalos congregate on grassland that's hemmed in by the crater walls, excitable herds that always provide charming views. Lion prides are spotted, often resting beneath the tree as they sleep off the tree. A handful of black rhinos trot across the crater floor; only 1,000 remain in the wild, so if they make an appearance, you know that the destination is bountiful for almost everyone. This no worries landscape is an idyllic introduction to an African safari as it brings encounters with a wide diversity of animals in a single five-hour game drive. You'll explore in the afternoon, departing at sunset to a quiet lodge that's often visited by elephants during the evening."

A dramatic scar slices through the plains, the stark walls of Olduvai Gorge providing the inspiration behind the wildebeest stampede. There are few animals here (food is scarce in comparison to the plains), but the resemblance to the movie is almost pixel-perfect. Take your photos then discover the real history to the gorge. Olduvai has uncovered the earliest evidence of human ancestors, possessing magnificent antiquities like skulls and tools that reveal the evolutionary chain of homo sapiens. Walking through the gorge has both movie moments and a surreal evocation of the past. After lunch, you continue the drive, descending onto the pride lands and finding a landscape of bounty. It's lush and green, the herds grazing in large numbers as they scatter across the plains. An elephant ambles past, a thousand zebra return your stare, wildebeest graze on strips of longer grass, and there's a continual sense that lions are always nearby. Up ahead you see them, a pride draped across a clump of yellow rocks that rise above the Serengeti plains. This is known as a kopje , although the children are likely to immediately exclaim that they've found Pride Rock. But a little further on there's another kopje. And another. So which is the highest and pointiest that the movie is modeled upon? The next few days will unravel the mystery."

        "title": "Serengeti – Beautiful Family Safari in the Pride Lands",
        "description": "The Serengeti inspires from every angle, Tanzania's flagship safari destination as resplendent from up close as it was on the movie screen. It's difficult to find an angle that doesn't resemble the pride lands, and soon you realize that everything the light touches is now your kingdom, a mammoth landscape that always offers fresh safari scenes. Within a couple of days, the children's tick-list is answered. A leopard hiding in the branches of an acacia tree, hippos yawning at the waterhole, giraffe loping past with manifest elegance, and great crowds of wildebeest ignited into action. Hyenas snarl and startle the wildebeest (much like in the movie) and when one starts running, the whole herds start kicking up dust. During these three days, the game drive itinerary is flexible. Choose morning and late-afternoon drives to maximize the most dramatic wildlife encounters, or spend the whole day on safari, stopping for a picnic beside a lion-filled kopje or hippo-filled lake. You stay in a small luxury camp with sweeping views over the plains that have interconnected suites and a private verandah. Local Masai warriors run tailored children's activities at the camp's Masai Academy, teaching the basics of animal tracking, bush survival, and tribal customs. This can be particularly useful when you want a quiet afternoon. The camp is often surrounded by wildlife, and you don't need to travel far to see it all. Zebras graze on the grass outside the boutique tents, a herd of Thomson's gazelles skips past at breakfast, and the odd elephant picks at a nearby fruit tree while you're eating dinner. An expressive landscape like the Serengeti deserves a few days. At first, you're amazed by the similarities, matching the plains to the pride lands. During the movie, there are baffling shots of animals marching past in unison, or thousands of mammals congregating beneath the protruding rocks. It doesn't look real in the movie. It feels even less real when you get to see it. Rather than thousands, there are tens of thousands of mammals in a single panorama. Three hyenas become 30 hyenas. Every day, you're likely to encounter at least a couple of lion prides as the landscape is divided into unmarked territories. Drive next to a pride and the lionesses wake from slumber before roaming to the vehicle. They inspect you, gazing back into your eyes before deciding to sleep in the shade created by the back wheel. Here's the other Serengeti highlight: you don't just see the quantity and diversity of mammals; your family will also get exceptionally close."

It's as heart-thumping as hearing it on the movie when you were seven years old. On a relaxed morning, you can have a final game drive on the pride lands before flying from a Serengeti airstrip back to Kilimanjaro International Airport. Here, you depart from Tanzania on a flight to Nairobi, Kenya's capital. Touch down and a new guide greets you at the airport for the short transfer to Karen, a lush green suburb on the outskirts of the city. The wildlife doesn't stop, and it's often possible to see giraffe necks and skyscrapers in the same city vista."

        "description": "From a children's perspective, there's often a desire to get even closer. To pet a lion, to stroke a leopard's cute fur, to feel a zebra's mane. But this is wild Africa, and such things are as dangerous as anything on the continent. Today the children (and parents) do get to meet and interact with a few animals, starting with a visit to the Giraffe Centre in Karen. Endangered Rothschild Giraffes are rehabilitated here, and they will eat directly from the hand, stretching a long black tongue to slurp up little pellets. They're calm and quiet, satisfying many children's imaginations. At the Daphne Sheldrick Elephant Orphanage, a similar experience is possible with another giant, including the iconic feeling of a trunk coming over your shoulder and curling up before your eyes. Both these places are visited on a relaxed day in the city."

        "description": "To animate a wild animal, you must understand their movements. Not just their famous gallops, but their facial expressions and sudden behavioral changes. A team of animators based themselves in Kenya's Hell's Gate National Park for three weeks. You'll only have two days, but the proximity to wildlife quickly reveals why this park was chosen. There are no lions or leopards here. Nor elephants. Roaming beneath beautiful canyon walls are the plains animals, like wildebeest, zebra, giraffe, buffalo, gazelle and hartebeest. A surreal number of monkeys and baboons also inhabit the compact park. Without predators, they all graze and live in peace, without fear of anything that passes. So when you walk up, the animals rarely move. Approach slowly and silently, and you could be just two or three meters away. To get closer, you explore on foot and on a bicycle, fresh safari activities that keep the children's imagination animated. Paddle past a zebra herd, walk past a tower of giraffes and get so close that you feel you could reach out and touch (although this isn't recommended as the animals will quickly run away). Such regular proximity was a learning experience for the animators and now becomes a playground of delight for your family. A new character from the movie is also found here – that of Rafiki (incidentally, the name translates as friend in Swahili). On the big screen, he's a mix of baboon and black and white colobus monkey, a friendly fellow with a mischievous attitude and an inclination towards laughter. In Hell's Gate, you'll see both and admire how they selected the best features of the two animals. During these two days, you stay at a lodge on the banks of nearby Lake Naivasha, where serene evenings are enhanced by the sight of hippos emerging from the water. Floodlights give you a premier view as the hippos graze just a few meters from the lodge (an electric fence had to be erected to stop the hippos from getting too close). It's very easy to imagine that this was the lake where Simba saw a vision of his father. Throughout the day, there are flexible safaris in Hell's Gate National Park, with a local guide leading you on walking and cycling safaris. His knowledge and experience help you get indelibly close to most of the animals, including the boisterous buffalos. Hell's Gate is a two-hour drive from Nairobi."

There's a baboon troop sauntering across the track, and here are three elephants bulldozing a path through the trees, and then you turn another corner to spot wild giraffe for the first time. These initial incursions into safari wilderness can sometimes be too much to take in. You're admiring a pod of hippos and then the guide grabs your attention. Turn around and half-hidden in the trees is a rare tree-climbing lion. Lake Manyara provides the perfect start to a Tanzanian safari adventure. An eclectic selection of classic safari sights is available in a compact and easy to explore the national park. Manyara doesn't have the huge herds or abundance of big cat hunting scenes, but that doesn't matter on your first safari. Most people are completely engulfed with the realism of the experience; you're just meters away from many of Africa's famous wild animals. Tonight's accommodation gives a glimpse at what to expect. Settle into a cute treehouse accessible by walkways suspended above the wilderness. Gaze out at a waterhole and watch the parade of visiting nomads; antelope herds, zebra, elephants, unusual four-legged characters impressing with their antics. It's a sight that's available from the bed, as well as from your private balcony. As you settle into the romantic bliss there's an accompanying soundtrack; birdsong that flutters through the branches, an occasional lion roar, elephants trampling and rustling, random calls from passing baboons. And this is just the start of this Tanzanian safari vacation for couples."

Just south of Manyara is Tarangire National Park, your base for the next three days, and the start of your Tanzania safari tour . Everyone is expecting the unadulterated excitement of a Tanzanian safari, but this vacation will also bring the romantic bliss of any iconic getaway. You're staying at a sumptuous lodge with just 12 luxury en suite tents on stilts. Intimate, exclusive, idyllic; this is an escape that provides unlimited private time with your partner. Except you're not completely alone; you're accompanied by huge herds of elephants, rowdy predators, and an almost complete cast of Africa's famous animals. Don't be put off by the word “tent.” This isn't camping as you may know it. Lavish king-sized beds gaze out onto the wilderness, the furnishings offer a classic African style, and the en-suite bathroom is wonderfully surrounded by the wild. You'll probably hear the elephants while having a shower. Then there's the infinity swimming pool and the verandah overlooking a waterhole. But pull yourself away from this romantic indulgence and over these three days, you'll discover all corners of an inimitable national park. The landscape is defined by two natural wonders. Giant baobab trees are everywhere, towering over meandering rivers and home to many more tree-climbing lions. Elephant herds are the second iconic sight. They travel by the hundreds, huge tuskers accompanying the trunk flapping babies and watchful mothers. Like each destination on this itinerary, the safari itinerary is flexible and tailored to your preferences. Each game drive is private and accompanied by an expert guide with an intimate knowledge of the environment. Perhaps you want a full day of exploring with a picnic beside hippo pools as an interlude? Or, maybe a sunrise game drive seeking out leopards on a hunt? Or is it the towering giraffe you have a particular fascination with? Three days in Tarangire not only provides a calming escape, it ensures a relaxed and easy pace that can satisfy the most idiosyncratic of safari dreams. Slowly you explore the trees, using the binoculars to scan the branches. A tail swishes, the leaves rustle, and there's the sight you've spent the morning searching for; a tree-climbing lion jumping down and starting to stalk its prey."

Can you really see something like this, or does it require two years of patient filming? Ngorongoro often feels like a surreal documentary. Descend the steep crater walls and begin exploring the distinct ecosystems; forests hiding elephants, grasslands patrolled by lions, a lake covered by wallowing flamingos. Which way do you look? A rhino causes you both to stop and stare, its inherent grace complimenting an unquestionable power. Eyes follow the horn, but something in the periphery pulls you both away. Now you’re admiring a large herd of buffalo, their bushy frames stampeding towards the safari truck. Why are they panicking? Keep watching and you spot three mischievous lionesses seeking a way to isolate a young calf. You'll leave Tarangire in the morning, saying farewell to the huge elephant herds and arriving at your lodge in time for a filling lunch. The whole crater extends beneath your feet and a zigzagging downhill trail takes you into this majestic realm of nature. Stay in the crater until sunset and then spend the evening around a crackling fire, admiring the stars and listening to the calls of the wild. Just as you’re about to cuddle up in bed, a lone elephant bull rumbles past your room. Maybe it's worth staying up for a few more minutes. Like all accommodation on this itinerary, your room is isolated and private; there are no other visitors interrupting the natural immersion and no need to share your piece of Tanzania with anyone else."

So you may prefer a leisurely morning in bed, a champagne breakfast served on your private verandah, and the camera at the ready to snap passing ungulates. Today's drive takes you into the Southeastern corner of the Serengeti. Wildebeest are everywhere, their wiry frames mingling with herds of zebra and thousands upon thousands of Thompson's gazelle. The grasslands seem to stretch for eternity, a carpet of green dotted with four-legged residents. This is just the view from your private verandah. Yet you're going to spend five days in this world-famous park, so expect these ubiquitous first impressions to become an iconic backdrop that frames the whole experience.

Occasionally a rocky outcrop interrupts the green landscape, a place where lions lounge and giraffe saunter past. It's a slow journey, every meter a reason to stop and get intimate with something new. By now the zebra are so commonplace that they hardly cause you to raise a glance. But the regular lion sightings never get tired. Find them hiding beneath trees, elegantly chasing wildebeest, stopping to inspect the safari truck, and playfully fighting in the high grass. Appreciating the Serengeti's scale requires a journey. The scenes keep repeating themselves and the incredible landscape never seems to end. More wildebeest, more cats, and more grassland that dazzles beneath the African sun; it's only on a journey like today's that the unrivaled beauty of the Serengeti can be realized. While many parks have the Big Five, nowhere delivers such abundant collections of Africa's mammals on such an epic scale. Your destination is a mobile camp, arguably the finest option for private immersion in the Serengeti."

Wake up and pull open the luxury tent curtains. A sprinkling of gazelle and elephants greet intrepid eyes. Is it time to get up? No, not just yet. Not when you can cuddle in bed and watch a tower of giraffe stroll past, or a big herd of buffalo slowly approach the camp. This private mobile camp is carefully erected in the heart of the wilderness, engulfing you in the Serengeti's charms and ensuring that you’re many, many miles from any other tourist or safari truck. Being mobile, the location of the camp is unlikely to have been experienced by anyone else before. And it's always likely to be in touching distance of the great wildebeest migration. It can sound a little scary, can't it? Being alone in the middle of lion country? There’s no need to worry; the local Maasai have coexisted with the big cats for thousands of years and your camp follows their generations’ old learning. Evening fires keep the big cats away, evidence of leopard prints is carefully followed, a scout keeps guard in case of any overly enthusiastic visitors, and any meat smells are carefully discarded. Complimenting this ancient style is a commitment to modern vacation luxury. Dining tables are erected on the grasslands, carefully selected wines are enjoyed from thick comfy chairs, solar panels provide electricity, and the bathroom facilities far surpass anything you could envisage in the bush. Of course, as you've come to expect, this is a camp by name, but luxurious home in reality. This is the Serengeti at its most authentic and intimate, but with an indulgent romantic twist. This is more than just a getaway; it's just you, your partner, a couple of discreet guides, and the whole of the Serengeti. While the camp is often attraction enough you also have three days of customized game drives. A leopard dips its neck and descends into the grass, stalking a small herd of unsuspecting kudu. Two boisterous male hippos fight for mating rights in shallow pools of water and mud. Lion cubs test their strength by play-fighting beneath a mother's watchful gaze, and a rampaging whirlwind of dust accompanies the wildebeest as they charge around the Serengeti, hooves galloping clear of the big cat patrol that follows at a discreet distance. This is every Serengeti game drive; wild, wonderful, and overloaded with unique sights. Breakfasts beside elephants, candlelit dinners surrounded by evocative silhouettes, zebras grazing beside your tent; these three days offer one of Africa's finest private safari experiences."
