Overnight at a tented camp, Tarangire. Dinner included. Tarangire Ndovu/Honeyguide camp or similar. (Lunch and Dinner included) Highly underrated, yet bursting with a dense wildlife population, it won’t take you long to appreciate just why we love Tarangire. During the dry season (June to September) thousands of animals including elephant, buffalo, giraffe, wildebeest, kudu, and the rarely seen oryx migrate from the dry Maasai steppe to the Tarangire River in search of water. Lion, leopard and other predators follow, so be sure to charge your camera battery and empty your memory stick as some unique moments are waiting to be captured. With impressive landscapes dominated by baobab trees, an enormous elephant population and over 550 varieties of bird, Tarangire offers secluded game viewing and loads of game – a winning combination in anyone's book!"

      "description": "An early start today, but one we’re sure you’ve been itching to tick off your African travel bucket list. Enjoy a full morning and picnic lunch in the Ngorongoro Crater, one of the natural wonders of the world. The volcanic caldera of Ngorongoro offers spectacular game viewing in the crater. We can almost guarantee you four of the Big Five will show up, as well as a rich variety of birds, all viewed against the backdrop of the thickly forested crater walls. Varied terrains and dramatic landscapes consisting of forest, grasslands and both freshwater and soda lakes make the Ngorongoro Crater a true marvel of creation. (On some Essence of Tanzania itineraries, your crater visit may take place on Day 3, in the afternoon. The timing of this activity will be confirmed by your guide when commencing this safari) From here drive to the Serengeti eco-system to overnight at Serengeti/Ndutu Wilderness camp. (Full board and drinks included)"

      "description": "Full day exploring the Serengeti. Overnight at a Serengeti Wilderness Camp, or similar. (Ndutu/North or Central) Balloon safari optional extra, enquire at the time of booking. (Full board and drinks included). You are in the heart of the Serengeti, home to more than three million large mammals spread over vast endless plains. It is here that we may encounter the fascinating spectacle of the annual wildebeest migration, where one and quarter million wildebeest trek in columns of up to forty kilometres long in search of grazing, drawing with them plenty predators and numerous other species of game. From January to March the herds can largely be found birthing their young in the southern area around Ndutu, before proceeding north through the centre and Western Corridor during June and July, eventually splitting to the west and north as they continue their way toward the Mara River. August to October sees dramatic river crossings which can only be considered Africa’s “greatest leap of faith”, before the herds return south in November to repeat this amazing instinctive procession all over again"
