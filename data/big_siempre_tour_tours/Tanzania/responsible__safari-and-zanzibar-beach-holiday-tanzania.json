It is a place of winding alleys, bustling bazaars, mosques and grand Arab houses. Stone Town has brought together many different elements of the cultures of Africa, the Arab region, India, and Europe over more than a thousand years. You can spend endless hours just wandering through the fascinating labyrinth of narrow streets and alleyways, absorbing the years of history. You will enjoy a guided tour of this fascinating town, recently and deservedly declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Late afternoon Mahanjumati tour (food tour with Forodhani) In Kiswahili, “mahanjumati” means a feast of different delicacies. Zanzibar’s cuisine reflects the island’s cosmopolitan spirit. Indian, Arab, Persian, African and Western influences create a wide variety of tasty dishes and snacks. Most of these won’t be served in tourist restaurants; they are prepared in Swahili homes and small local eateries. On this leisurely walk through Stone Town’s alleyways, we will take you to the best (and hygienically safe!) places to sample these local delicacies. Make it a breakfast or dinner experience, depending on your timing!"

Drinks and snacks are served on board."
