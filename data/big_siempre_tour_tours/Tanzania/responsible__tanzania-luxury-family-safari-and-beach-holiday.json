      "description": "Following breakfast, you transfer to Lake Manyara airstrip. Fly to Zanzibar and transfer to Stone town for 1 night on a bed and breakfast basis. Explore Stone Town, Zanzibar’s atmospheric historic heart, where narrow alleys reveal centuries of Swahili, Arab, Indian and European influence. Visit the former Sultan’s Palace and the Old Fort, wander through bustling markets, and admire the carved wooden doors and coral-stone buildings that define the town. A guided walking tour brings the history to life, while time at the waterfront or a visit to the Freddie Mercury Museum offers a glimpse into Stone Town’s cultural past and present."
