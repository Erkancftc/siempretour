If you have time, why not check out bustling Casablanca, the largest city in Morocco, at your own pace. Modelled after Marseille in France, this port city has an eclectic architectural style, a fusion of Art Deco French buildings and Mauresque (Moorish) government institutions. A great way to spend the day is to wander around the Old Medina and city walls, then jump in a taxi and visit the Quartier Habous – the new medina full of shaded squares, narrow streets and arcades that lead from one souk to another. This is a great place to enjoy a Moroccan coffee and maybe start working on your bargaining skills."

Later, head to the station and take a local train to Meknes before heading to the whitewashed village of Moulay Idriss – one of Morocco's most important pilgrimage sites. Here, you’ll witness a demonstration of the art of mint tea making – this sweet treat is a Moroccan speciality! Tonight, you'll get to hang out with a local family – an experience only allowed foreigners since 2005. Your guesthouse, an old traditional riad, has a family atmosphere and all the optional meals are homemade, so you can get an authentic taste of Morocco in your free time."

This afternoon is free for you to explore, so why not head to the red-walled Kasbah, the 15th-century fortress and dungeon, or the ethnographic museum.

Alternatively, you might prefer to get out of town and enjoy a hike and picnic in the surrounding hills. The hike is a popular option, as you can leave the shades of blue for a journey across the Rif Mountains and join your guide to Akchour Falls – a natural wonder, abundant with lush mountains, rivers and waterfalls. Cross the remarkable rock formation The God’s Bridge and then hike back along the forest, soaking in the nature that surrounds.

Brace yourself for one heck of a sunset, as you ride through the vast expanse of sand and loop back to your private camp for an overnight stay. In the camp, you'll have a thin mattress, blankets and sheets. Make sure you bring an extra sleeping sheet and a jumper if it's winter (you'd be surprised how cold it can get, even in the desert). Sleep under the stars and have one of those 'I’m so far from home' moments."

Head back for brekkie, collect the rest of your gear, and then travel west to Todra. You’ll come across a bright tablecloth of green that might seem so out of place you'll think you are dreaming. This valley is pretty impressive, with all the palm trees and mud-brick villages.

Quench your thirst with a mouthful of mint tea (the best in the world) at Tawesna teahouse, whose profits are devoted to the projects of the women association in the village. This experience is more than just a cuppa – it’s about discovering a culture, sharing a true moment and contributing to women’s economic inclusion. Continue to the medieval mud-brick town of Ait Benhaddou, which is at its best in the late afternoon sun. If you wonder why Ait Benhaddou looks familiar, it’s probably because you’ve seen it before! Perhaps not live, but certainly on the silver screen – think Gladiator and Game of Thrones – loads of movies and shows were filmed in this kasbah! Explore the many old streets and climb the fortress for a superb view of the Old Town. You can also (for a small fee) enter one of the most interesting old houses and climb up to the turrets for a view over the river. You'll spend the night just outside the walls."

The rest of the day is free, so why not head out on a cycling trip, go quad-biking or indulge in a Luxury Hammam and Spa – the options are endless! You might also like to visit Le Jardin Secret – a traditional medina garden revived for the 21st century. Once owned by a powerful local chief U-Bihi – who was poisoned by Mohammed IV – this historic riad has one of the most beautiful courtyards in Marrakech, combining exotic and traditional Islamic gardens that are fed by original khettara, an underground irrigation system. Maybe visit AMAL Women’s Training Center for lunch – Amal is a non-profit organisation that helps disadvantaged women gain work experience by providing comprehensive training in gastronomy. Every year, 30 to 40 women complete the training, which helps them find appropriate employment and improve their living conditions. In the evening, you’ll undoubtedly be drawn back to Djemaa el-Fna for a night out on the town."

Head to the medina and people watch while you sip a mint tea in Jemaa el-Fna (the main square) or visit the Jardin Majorelle, just a short walk from our hotel. There are no activities planned for today, so you're free to arrive at any time. If you'd like an airport transfer, you'll need to arrive at Marrakech Menara Airport (RAK), which is around a 20-minute drive from our hotel. Our tour leader will meet you in the hotel reception at 6pm for a welcome meeting and then an optional dinner. If you arrive later, they'll catch you up as soon as possible."

Marrakech is a destination like no other, offering a vibrant new sight, sound, or scent at every turn. We'll pass by the rose-coloured Koutoubia (booksellers) Mosque on the way to Bahia Palace, famous for its decorated stucco walls and marble floors. We'll fuel up on fresh pastries from a traditional bakery before continuing to the medina on foot. There, we'll be guided through the labyrinth of spice-scented souks, passing by craftsmen selling rugs, leather goods and crockery, before dropping by a spice shop to sample ripe dates and almonds. Finally, we'll navigate our way out and into the energetic Jemaa el-Fna Square. This afternoon you're free to explore more at your own pace - amongst the array of must-see sites are Ben Youssef Madrasa, the Dar Si Said Palace, and the Menara Gardens, tick them off your list or delve back into the maze-like souks.

Built in honour of the King's 60th birthday, this spectacular mosque is a feat of engineering and can hold an astounding 105,000 worshippers. Sitting right next to the water - to honour the Quran, which states \"the throne of Allah was over the water\" - it's a meeting spot for locals to socialise and, of course, worship. Once we've marvelled at the marble exterior, we'll head inside for a tour. Departing Casablanca, we'll head down the coast to Morocco's capital, Rabat. Established as the country's capital in 1912, by the French, Rabat has a distinct history, which dates as far back as 8BC, when settlers arrived in what is now the Chellah district. This evening, you'll have free time to explore the city or walk down to the waterfront where you can watch the sunset over the estuary."

The highlight of this morning is the Royal Palace where we'll stop to marvel at the intricate golden doors (the palace isn't open to visitors but is still a Morocco must-see for its majestic exterior alone). Once we've explored Fes el Jadid, we'll head out and up to the viewpoint at Borj Nord for a look at the sprawling city from above. After lunch, we'll delve into Fes el-Bali, the oldest quarter of the city, with a guided tour.

The Berber way of life is unique and lost to most of North Africa and music, dance, language, and religion are far removed from the rest of the Arab world.

This morning, we'll take the opportunity to visit the founder's mausoleum before we explore the local ksour (fortified villages). In the afternoon, we'll continue to Merzouga, a small village on the outskirts of the desert. From here, we'll swap bus for camels and journey on into the dunes of Erg Chebbi. Our home for tonight is right here in the desert, at a Berber camp, where we can relax by the campfire and fill up on traditional tagine. Our camp is basic but comfortable - the twin share tents are fully equipped with full size single beds with mattresses, blankets, and pillows and there are charging points for phones and cameras. The camp site is right on the edge of the magnificent sand dunes, after a refreshing glass of mint tea you may wish to take a stroll amongst the dunes to witness the sun setting over the Sahara Desert, the light at this time in the late evening casts shadows over the dunes making them a photographers dream. Dinner is served under the stars after which we retire to a campfire. Note that the camp has shared bathroom facilities, showers are simple and hot water and good water pressure aren't guaranteed."

There are two hiking options, a circular walk which is 10km (around 6 miles) in length and a hike to a viewpoint at Abdelali and back which is 6km (3.7 miles). We usually undertake the 10km (6.2 mile) hike, however the route is exposed to the elements, so depending on the weather, we might opt for the shorter option. The trek begins in the middle of the narrow gorge following the main road before joining a small mule path going up gradually along a ravine. The path climbs about 500m (550 yards) to a small pass with views looking down the gorge and the Jebel Sahro range. The descent is 550m and is again on a rocky, narrow path that can be steep in some sections. The trek is considered as moderate-to-challenging and in high temperatures it can be more demanding. Walking boots with ankle support are essential. The shorter 6km walk follows the main road of the gorge before joining a small mule path, gradually working our way up the ravine to the viewpoint, where we're treated to vistas of the Jebel Sahro range and down into the gorge. If you don't fancy the hike, you might like to explore the gorge valley floor, following the path of the river, or take in the scenery from one of the nearby cafes."

The blossoms are used to make rosewater, which is sold throughout the Islamic world. Driving on through the Dades Valley, we enter the Valley of 1000 Kasbahs, an oasis land teeming with kasbahs and towns that each have their own distinct character. You'll notice the mud and straw structures become more ornate as we travel further along the valley. This afternoon, we'll visit the fortified Berber settlement of Ait Ben Haddou, a UNESCO World Heritage Site widely considered to be one of Morocco's most picturesque spots. You might recognize the ornate crenelated towers from scenes in Jesus of Nazareth and Lawrence of Arabia, which both took advantage of the dramatic setting."

With its golden rampart, this Amazigh town is one of the most beautiful in Morocco's south.

Continuing into the mountains, we branch east through a wide flat mountain valley, finally arriving at Anmiter, where we leave our bus and take a 1hr 30min to 2hr walk on an uphill gradient to the Amazigh village of Tighza, where we spend the next two nights. Tighza is a rural village set in the Atlas mountains. From the terrace of our Riad you can look down into the valley and enjoy the sunset over the surrounding mountains. It is a peaceful retreat and provides the opportunity to meet local villagers and share their way of life. Our luggage is transported to the village for us. For those who do not want to walk, mules are available (170 dirhams, payable locally). We’re greeted with a mint tea on arrival at the village.

The length of our trek depends on the group’s ability, but it is likely to be approximately four hours. The afternoon is free to relax with a book, enjoy the mountain views, take a stroll through the beautiful landscape or challenge the village children to a game of football. Tighza is one of just four villages in this remote valley and has been supported by us for more than 10 years through various responsible tourism projects. We visit the village hammam, built with money raised by our clients. This is an authentic experience and terrific fun. It is very much a traditional hammam and you are likely to get the opportunity to mix with the villagers, which further adds to the experience. A standard treatment is included, but you need to purchase a scrubber and soap for 20 dirhams (US$1.90) plus a customary tip of 20 dirhams.

Famous for its French colonial architecture and its namesake film, Casablanca has a vibrant metropolitan atmosphere. If you arrive to the city early, there are plenty of sights to keep you occupied. Get a feel for local life over at the Marche Central, where you'll find stalls of fresh produce and street food vendors or take a stroll in Place Mohamed V, Casablanca's central plaza. At 7pm, our tour leader will meet you in the hotel reception for a welcome meeting. If you want to, there'll be the chance to go out for dinner afterwards. If you arrive later, our tour leader will catch you up at a later point. If you want to receive an airport transfer, you'll need to arrive at Casablanca Mohammed V International Airport. The journey from there to our hotel is around 45 minutes."

Built in honour of the King's 60th birthday, this spectacular mosque is a feat of engineering and can hold an astounding 105,000 worshippers. Sitting right next to the water - to honour the Quran, which states \"the throne of Allah was over the water\" - it's a meeting spot for locals to socialise and, of course, worship. Once we've marvelled at the marble exterior, we'll head inside for a tour. Departing Casablanca, we'll head down the coast to Morocco's capital, Rabat. Established as the country's capital in 1912, by the French, Rabat has a distinct history, which dates as far back as 8BC, when settlers arrived in what is now the Chellah district. We'll explore the city's historic heart with a walking tour around the Hassan Tower and the Mausoleum of Mohammed V before strolling through the Kasbah des Oudaias, finishing up at the Royal Palace."

Once the heart of the Moroccan Sultanate and home to the tyrannical Sultan Moulay Ismail, 1672-1727, Meknes is littered with remnants of its imperial past, which once boasted 20 grand gateways and 50 palaces. We will delve into Meknes' imperial history with a guided tour of the city's major highlights from the old granaries of the Heri es-Souni to the Mausoleum of Moulay Ismail. Despite Ismail's blood lust and unbenevolent lifestyle, the sultan's tomb remains a place of reverence amongst those who see his rule as Morocco's Golden Age. Our tour will also uncover the Bab el Khamis Gate and Bab Mansour, on route to the Place el Hedim, the city's medina. From Meknes, we'll travel 45 minutes to the ruins of Volubilis, an ancient Berber-Roman city which was once the capital of the Kingdom of Mauretania. Here, a local guide will help us to uncover the mosaics found amongst the settlement. Today's final destination is Morocco's cultural capital, Fes. Steeped in history, Fes has played an important part in Moroccan trade, culture, religion, and politics throughout the centuries. We'll arrive at our hotel in time to discover the distinct differences between the old and new towns and explore Fes' culinary offerings."

We'll also stop by the North Borj viewpoint for a panorama of the city from above. After lunch, we'll swap new for old and head into Fes el Bali - also known as old Fes.

Up here in their mountain stronghold, the fiercely independent Berbers - the Lords of the Atlas - live by their own traditions. The Berber way of life is unique and lost to most of North Africa - here, music, dance, language, and religion are far removed from the rest of the Arab world.

This morning, we'll take the opportunity to visit the founder's mausoleum before we explore the local ksour (fortified villages). In the afternoon, we'll continue to Merzouga, a small village on the outskirts of the desert. From here, we'll swap our bus for 4WD vehicles and journey on into the dunes of Erg Chebbi. Our home for tonight is right here in the desert, at a Berber camp, where we can relax by the campfire and fill up on traditional tagine. Our camp is basic but comfortable - the twin share tents are fully equipped with full size single beds with mattresses, blankets, and pillows and there are charging points for phones and cameras. The camp site is right on the edge of the magnificent sand dunes, after a refreshing glass of mint tea you may wish to take a stroll amongst the dunes to witness the sun setting over the Sahara Desert, the light at this time in the late evening casts shadows over the dunes making them a photographers dream. Dinner is served under the stars after which we retire to a campfire. Note that the camp has shared bathroom facilities, showers are simple and hot water and good water pressure aren't guaranteed."

We'll follow the main road of the gorge before joining a small mule path, gradually working our way up the ravine to the viewpoint, where we're treated to vistas of the Jebel Sahro range and down into the gorge. Today's trek has been graded as moderate and covers six kilometres. It has an ascent of around 500 metres and a descent of around 550 metres, walking on terrain that is narrow, steep, and rocky in some sections. We recommend wearing walking boots with ankle support. If you don't feel like taking on the trek, you're free to explore the gorge valley floor or take in the scenery from one of the nearby cafes. The dramatic ochre-coloured cliffs of the Todra Gorge rise to leave a narrow pass through which our track and the river struggle for right of way. In the mornings, Berber women drive their goats through the narrow gorge to grazing ground higher up. Today there'll be the opportunity to join our tour leader on an optional walk to Abdelali viewpoint, from where there are excellent panoramas across to the Jebel Sahro and down into the gorge. There are two hiking options, a circular walk which is 10km in length and a hike to a viewpoint at Abdelali and back which is 6km. We usually undertake the 10km hike, however the route is exposed to the elements, so depending on the weather, we might opt for the shorter option. The trek begins in the middle of the narrow gorge following the main road before joining a small mule path going up gradually along a ravine. The path climbs about 500m to a small pass with views looking down the gorge and the Jebel Sahro range. The descent is 550m and is again on a rocky, narrow path that can be steep in some sections. The trek is considered as moderate-to-challenging and in high temperatures it can be more demanding. Walking boots with ankle support are essential. If you don't fancy the hike, you might like to explore the gorge valley floor, following the path of the river, or take in the scenery from one of the nearby cafes."

If you have time, you can take a short boat tour to see Coimbra from a different angle. Alternatively. head out to Porto for the day. Stretching along the banks of the River Douro, Porto is one of Portugal's most romantic cities, known for majestic bridges, medieval riverside district with its cobbled streets, merchants’ houses and cafes. Back in Coimbra for the evening, you’ll head to a traditional Fado performance. Fado songs must follow a particular structure, and though this traditional music can really be about anything, it popularly features mournful tunes with lyrics about the sea or the life of the poor. In Coimbra, university students would often serenade their sweethearts with this music!"

In the afternoon, head to one of the most controversial sights here – the Pierres Bleues (painted rocks).

We use a mix of public and private transport options to traverse the three countries of Spain, Portugal and Morocco that we have featured on our carefully crafted itinerary.<br/><br/>Starting in Spain’s capital, Madrid with its fine collections of art galleries and all round metropolitan chic, we then take some time in historic Salamanca before heading across the border into Portugal. Here we spend two nights in the 12th century and ancient university city of Coimbra. We then head south to spend a couple of days roaming around Portugal’s stunning capital of Lisbon, with its eclectic quarters, some chic and cosmo, others with markets and myriad music venues. <br/><br/>After a couple of days on the Algarve coast, we pop back into Spain for 24 hours so that we can take the boat to Morocco, taking a quick visit to the sumptuous city of Seville, where you can start to feel the Moroccan influences already, with its Moorish architecture standing proudly alongside flamenco and tapas bars.  <br/><br/>From here to Tarifa, where we take the one hour ferry crossing over to Tangier, although we spend our first night in the stunning Rif Mountain town of Chefchaouen. Every city in Morocco is different, and all exciting in their own ways, as two days in Fez will show, with its well preserved ancient Islamic heritage and car-free Fez el-Bali medina. And finally, we take a train to Marrakech, a city that needs little introduction but which leaves the most memorable mark for its vibrant, sense awakening and exciting atmosphere. <br/>",

Set against a wide valley and nestled between two peaks in the Rif Mountains, Chefchaouen’s medina has been lovingly cared for with striking blue and whitewashed houses, red-tiled roofs and artistic doorways. The medina is filled with handicrafts, while the main square has shops selling woven goods and sweets. Learn about general life in a small Moroccan community, visit a communal bakery and walk up to a former mosque for a great view over the town. As a popular shopping destination for handicrafts, carpets, blankets or woollen garments, you may also see the artisans at work. After your walking tour, maybe head to a traditional Moroccan hammam to relax."

In Marrakech, you’ll stay on a bed-and-breakfast basis, the better to discover the city’s superb culinary scene. <br/><br/>This trip focuses on a handsomely restored kasbah in the mountains – once the summer retreat of a local chief, it fell into ruins and has now been brought back to life as a luxurious hotel. Luxury here means comfortable rustic simplicity, and the warmth of the surrounding community. A small accommodation levy that all guests must pay has been used to build a village hammam (where guests are welcome to spend time and get to know local people) and a school for 80 children, as well as the region’s first ambulance.<br/><br/>Trails in the area are well-marked and vary in challenge so as long as you have a decent level of fitness you’ll have little difficulty. The famous Toubkal Trek, which leads to the summit of North Africa’s highest peak, Mount Toubkal, begins right on the doorstep. <br/><br/>For those who would like to combine their trekking with a deeper exploration of the culture and traditions of the High Atlas Mountains, you can also add on walks accompanied by a local Berber guide. Whether you want to know the significance of a particular flower or what life is like at these higher elevations, there’s no-one better to ask.",

After breakfast, drive through the Draa Valley to Zagora, where you’ll see the original route of the caravans. Then, travel along the rugged and desolate Jbel Tadrart ranges through seas of sand and past the occasional desert oasis of date palms to the township of Tamegroute. Here, you’ll visit a library filled with ancient scripts of science, literature and stories of the prophet Mohammed. After, join a local guide to uncover the underground Kasbah. Carry on driving to the frontier town of M'Hamid. From here, your group will jump into 4WDs to the massive Erg Chigaga dunes. This is the largest dune in the Moroccan Sahara and one of the less visited – meaning your experience will be further from surrounding towns and villages, away from the tourist trail. Arrive in the late afternoon, where you’ll get ready for the experience of a lifetime – riding on the backs on camels into the Saharan sunset. Tonight, the starry sky won’t disappoint."

On the way, stop at the waterfall of Attiq in Tissint for a refreshing change of scenery. These waterfalls are all saltwater and the translation of ‘Tissint’ in the local language is ‘salt’!

The area is quite rocky in general, so sturdy shoes are needed. Also stop for lunch set against the beautiful view of the valley. In the afternoon, head to one of the most controversial sights here – the Pierres Bleues (painted rocks).

        "description": "Take a full day guided tour of Marrakech. Marrakech was founded in 1062 by one of the chieftains of the Almoravid king Youssuf Ibn Tashfin. The Almoravids were desert warriors, very much attached to their Islamic religion; the original garrison developed very quickly into a city where numerous mosques and madrasas (Koranic schools) were built. Andalousian craftsmen built and decorated several palaces, merging their style with the Saharan and African traditions, which gave the city a distinctive architectural flavour. Nowadays, Marrakech is a vibrant city which exhibits a curious blend of the ancient and the modern, allowing travellers the chance to experience the genuine medieval atmosphere of the old medina, and visit the trendiest bars, art galleries and restaurants in the French Quarter, Guéliz, built at the beginning of the 20th Century, all in one day. Dinner and overnight at hotel in Marrakech."

Our next stop is the royal palace, which we'll view from the outside, after which we'll head to the Kasbah des Oudaias, a fortified area of the city perched on top of a cliff with commanding views of the city behind it and the ocean in front. The Kasbah has a distinctive Andalusian flavour, with whitewashed houses and narrow winding streets surrounded by imposing fortified walls. There's time to enjoy a refreshing glass of mint tea or orange juice before we stroll around the Andalusian gardens, a haven of tranquillity, offering a shady retreat. After a break for lunch, we bid farewell to Rabat and drive to Chefchaouen. It's a drive of around five hours which will take most of the afternoon with a stop or two along the way, and we'll arrive into the famous 'blue town' in the early evening. Our base for the next two nights is a bright and spacious riad in the heart of the medina. Featuring a traditional Moroccan hamman, a large roof terrace with fine views of Chefchaouen and an indoor swimming pool and a spa with a wide choice of massages and treatments available, it's the perfect spot to relax and take a break from the bustling streets outside."

Spanning several hectares, the site has remarkably well preserved mosaic floors, carved columns and avenues, giving a sense of what life would have been like in this once bustling Roman outpost. The area around Volubilis is blessed with rich fertile plains ideal for wine production. The combination of clay and limestone soil with a Mediterranean climate of hot summers and mild winters, enables growers to produce high quality wines including rich, full bodied reds made from imported grape varieties including Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Tempranillo. We'll be greeted at the vineyard by our resident wine guide who will accompany us on a short tour of the vineyard and production facilities, before we get the opportunity to taste three different wines. Today's final destination is Morocco's cultural capital, Fes. Steeped in history, Fes has played an important part in Moroccan trade, culture, religion, and politics throughout the centuries. We'll arrive at our riad located in a quiet corner of Fes' historic medina. Lovingly restored using intricately carved cedar wood, with mosaic floors, it is set out in a traditional manner with rooms arranged around a central courtyard.

Nothing quite prepares you for your first visit - you'll see weavers, coppersmiths and tanners all hard at work, the narrow winding streets and covered bazaars are a riot of noise, colour, smells and life and rolled into one. During our walking tour we'll also get to see the famous tanneries and dye pits where leather products are still produced by timeless traditional methods used for hundred of years.

Up here in their mountain stronghold, the fiercely independent Berbers - the Lords of the Atlas - live by their own traditions. The Berber way of life is unique and lost to most of North Africa - here, music, dance, language, and religion are far removed from the rest of the Arab world. We'll pass by the ruined kasbah of Telouat where we break for lunch at a local restaurant and the fortified village of Anmiter, continuing to our night stop of Tighza. On arrival, after settling in, we will take a gentle circular walk around the village covering a distance of 2.8 km (1.7 miles), with a total ascent and descent of 90 meters (295 feet). We will take a relaxed pace, following the winding tracks high above the valley. Our base for tonight is a family-owned village house on the outskirts of Tighza. Feel free to unwind on the terrace, with panoramic views of the High Atlas, or enjoy Berber cuisine in the small tearoom - dishes are made using fruit and vegetables grown in the family garden."

This afternoon is free to spend as you wish. You can relax by the swimming pool or take a guided tour of Ait Ben Haddou.

We will cross what is remained of the amazing view of Anti Atlas Mountains, if you’re lucky enough (and I am sure you are) we may come across a weekly market in one of the villages along the way. If so, we will surely take a deep look into it via a walk among the locals’s tents where they sell their goods. If so don’t hesitate to wander, it’s always fascinating to discover local life during such a weekly event. The road may not be the best, but it’s scenic and definitely worthy to be hit!"

    "generalInfo": "Moroccan Landscapes: A Relaxed Fly-Drive from the Atlas to the Atlantic<br/><br/>A journey through the hidden routes, kasbahs and coastlines of Morocco, designed for the independent traveller with a taste for discovery and comfort. This refined fly-drive holiday reveals Morocco’s diverse beauty through a carefully planned journey that blends cultural immersion, dramatic landscapes, and handpicked accommodation. From the vibrant pulse of Marrakech to the cinematic peaks of the High Atlas, the palm-lined oases of Skoura, and on to coastal havens like Safi and Essaouira, you’ll travel some of Morocco’s most enchanting, and lesser-known, roads. <br/><br/>Your Morocco holiday begins to take shape with the choice of hire car independence or an English speaking driver enabling you to choose your own adventure as you explore off the beaten track.<br/><br/>Your adventure begins with a stay in a traditional riad in Marrakech, where carved plasterwork, tranquil courtyards and rooftop terraces offer a soothing retreat from the energy of the medina. Wander the spice-scented souks, visit the majestic Bahia Palace, and savour Moroccan cuisine in stylish surrounds before collecting your vehicle and heading into the mountains.<br/><br/>Whichever way you travel the drama of the Tichka Pass. Driving south across the High Atlas, you’ll take a spectacular and winding route through the Tizi n'Tichka Pass, where panoramic views unfold at every turn. The discoveries to be made in the kasbahs of Telouet and Ait Ben Haddou will stay with you for a lifetime and play no small part in understanding the relationship between Morocco’s rural landscapes and its people. Your destination is Skoura, a palm-filled oasis dotted with ancient kasbahs and traditional adobe villages. Stay in a boutique guesthouse, where warm hospitality, local produce, and starlit skies provide a perfect setting for rest and reflection. From here, travellers have the option to extend their journey southward to the vast dunes of the Sahara, with a night in a deluxe desert camp at Erg Chigaga – complete with camel rides, sunset views, and dinner beneath the stars.<br/><br/>Rejoining the main itinerary, you’ll head north by a scenic backroad over the Tizi n’Outfi that cuts through quiet valleys and almond orchards to reach Demnate, a town rarely included on tourist routes but rich in local life and geological interest. Visit the striking natural rock arch at Imi n’Ifri, or take a detour to small Berber villages tucked into the hills. It’s a stretch of travel that feels delightfully off the map. Nearby is also the fabulous waterfalls of Ouzoud, well worth a visit that can include a hike along the river and a meal with a cascade view.<br/><br/>Finally, you’ll drift west and resist the urge of the Atlantic coast no longer with lesser used roads and rural riads complementing your journey. Your route brings you to the historic port city of Safi. Known for its centuries-old pottery tradition, dramatic coastal views, and authentic atmosphere, Safi offers a taste of Moroccan life untouched by mass tourism. Spend a night in a characterful guesthouse and explore the old medina, seaside ramparts, and vibrant ceramic markets.<br/><br/>The final leg of your journey leads to the bohemian charm of Essaouira, where sea breezes, Portuguese fortifications, and art-filled alleyways create a relaxed yet stylish coastal escape. Enjoy freshly grilled fish at the harbour, browse artisan boutiques, or simply unwind in your elegant riad near the medina.<br/><br/>About the accommodation used on this Morocco holiday.<br/>Staying overnight in hand-selected riads and small rural kasbahs gives travellers the chance to reveal the inner workings of Moroccan society where central courtyards, stucco carvings, and decorative tiles offer a naturally cool alternative to power draining air-con. Many of the properties have been carefully converted into guesthouses using locally sourced materials and provide invaluable jobs for local people as well as a much more authentic experience for responsible travellers. <br/><br/>A bit more information about our drivers.<br/>Why not put your feet up and let an experienced English speaking driver chauffeur you across the highlights of central Morocco? This is the perfect means of learning more about the landscapes and the history of the region as well as being able to discuss daily schedules and organise local guides to fit in with an itinerary that’s tailor-made to your wishes.<br/><br/>With comprehensive driving notes, carefully chosen accommodation and the freedom to explore at your own pace, this fly-drive holiday offers a unique perspective on Morocco’s natural and cultural riches. From high mountain passes to ocean waves, kasbahs to coastline, it’s a journey full of unexpected moments, designed with comfort and individuality in mind.",

This bespoke holiday blends cultural immersion, architectural splendour, and evocative desert adventure - crafted with comfort, authenticity and style in mind.<br/><br/>Begin in the captivating city of Marrakech, where you’ll stay in a beautifully restored riad tucked within the atmospheric medina. Behind its discreet walls lies a serene haven of intricate tilework, scented courtyards and personalised service; its location providing a great base to get out and explore on foot. Enjoy a privately guided tour of the city’s most iconic sights, from the architectural majesty of the Bahia Palace and the historic Koutoubia Mosque, to the vibrant souks and tranquil gardens. Your expert guide offers rich insights into Marrakech’s history, craftsmanship and daily life, while allowing ample time for personal exploration and relaxation.<br/><br/>From the city, your journey ventures south into the raw beauty of the Moroccan desert. Over three days, with your own private driver-guide, discover the dramatic contrasts of the landscape - from ancient kasbahs and palm-filled oases to windswept mountain passes and sculpted rock formations. Journey over the Tichka pass and down to the iconic Ait Benhaddou, a UNESCO-listed ksar that has stood for centuries, and continue through the Draa Valley, dotted with traditional Berber villages and fortified settlements.<br/><br/>Your first night is spent in the luxury of a small hotel at the edge of the Sahara near the desert town of Zagora (famous for its sign indicating to travellers that Timbuctou is just 52 days away... by camel). The next day, journey deeper into the Sahara for a once-in-a-lifetime stay at a luxury desert camp nestled amid the majestic Ch’gagga dunes—far from the tourist trail and immersed in silence and stars. Enjoy camel rides at sunset, gourmet dining under the open sky, and the unforgettable stillness of the desert at dawn. This day also features some informal sightseeing of the ancient scrolls at the Koranic Library and traditional pottery making in the village of Tamegroute and an afternoon spent enjoying the hospitality of the Bedouins at Erg Lihoudi.<br/><br/>Exploring the dunes on top of a gently swaying camel, is a real highlight with stunning sunsets and sublime seclusion adding to the customary refreshment of mint tea and an evening meal underneath a black velvet blanket studded with stars. The early morning sunrise is definitely worth setting your travel alarm for with the drive north, back over the Atlas Mountains, taking in Berber villages, such as Zaouiate Sidi Ben Abdenbi and Tazenahkt, as well as plenty of captivating scenery as you return to Marrakech. <br/><br/>Your final full day is completely free for you to haggle, explore and enjoy the sights of Marrakech, perhaps even learning some cookery skills (and secrets) before finally heading for home on day seven.<br/><br/>Alternatively, you can extend your Marrakech to the Sahara adventure by heading west to the coastal resort of Essaouira or south to the Berber village of Ouirgane which lies within the Toubkal National Park amongst the peaks and plateaus of the High Atlas Mountains.<br/><br/>This exclusive holiday offers the perfect balance of cultural discovery and scenic retreat, with carefully selected accommodation, private touring and authentic experiences throughout. Whether sipping mint tea in a Marrakech courtyard, watching the sun rise over the dunes, or tracing the trade routes of old, this journey invites you to experience Morocco at its most enchanting.",

From the Kasbah you can organise walks out into the hills, varying in difficulty and length, and offering the chance to enjoy the remarkable scenery as well as meet some of the Berber villagers from the area.<br/><br/>Late spring – around March to May, and early autumn – around September is the best time of year to travel. The summer can get very hot in Marrakesh, whilst the winter in the High Atlas is cold – although with a bit of snow lying around, the mountains are at their most beautiful in the winter.",

If you arrive early, maybe you’d like to visit the art deco Villa des Arts – this gallery dates back to the 1930s and holds numerous exhibitions of contemporary Moroccan and international art. If you're looking for a different cultural experience, you can discover a unique and fascinating part of Moroccan history at the Museum of Judaism. There’s a lot to see and do in Casablanca, so if you’d like to spend more time here before your trip begins, just speak to your booking agent.??"

Head out on a short orientation walk with your leader, then enjoy some free time exploring the town. Maybe duck into Café Hafa (which has hosted celebrities like Sean Connery, The Beatles and The Rolling Stones) for a cup of mint tea and views overlooking the Gibraltar. In the afternoon, take a private transfer to Chefchaouen. Set against a wide valley between two peaks in the Rif Mountains, much of Chefchaouen was recreated by Andalusian refugees escaping the Reconquista. Follow your leader on an orientation walk and head to a great sunset viewpoint overlooking the town. In the evening, if you're feeling peckish, the local goat’s cheese is a popular treat."

Alternatively, you might prefer to get out of town for a hike and picnic in the surrounding hills. The hiking tour is a popular option, as you can leave the shades of blue and journey across the Rif Mountains to Akchour Falls – a natural wonder, abundant with lush mountains, rivers and waterfalls. In the evening, how about tucking into a tagine at a local restaurant or visiting a hammam – a traditional Moroccan spa. The night is yours to enjoy.?"

Continue to Fes in the afternoon, where you'll spend the next two nights. Fes is the most complete medieval city in the Arab world, and the most ancient of Morocco's imperial cities.

Look out for the Medersa Bou Inania – one of the city's most beautiful buildings, which has recently been restored and is now open to tourists. Visit Medresse el Attarine and the splendid Funduq al-Najjarin – a beautifully restored 18th-century inn. You'll also see the famous tannery, known for the iconic view overlooking its dye pits, and a ceramics factory where you can see potters working. The afternoon is free for you to explore.

It was once an important stop for caravans passing through as they carried salt across the Sahara, returning with gold, ivory and slaves. Does it look familiar? The town has a long list of film and TV credits, including Lawrence of Arabia, Game of Thrones and Gladiator! Enjoy a leader-led walk through the winding streets of the Old Town, making your way to the top of the hill, from where you can enjoy the views across the surrounding plains.

Then, travel along the rugged and desolate Jbel Tadrart ranges through seas of sand and past the occasional desert oasis of date palms to the township of Tamegroute. Here, you’ll visit a library filled with ancient scripts of science, literature and stories of the prophet Mohammed. After, join a local guide to uncover the underground Kasbah. Carry on driving to the frontier town of M'Hamid. From here, your group will jump into 4WDs to the massive Erg Chigaga dunes. This is the largest dune in the Moroccan Sahara and one of the less visited – meaning your experience will be further from surrounding towns and villages, away from the tourist trail. Arrive in the late afternoon, where you’ll get ready for the experience of a lifetime – riding on the backs on camels into the Saharan sunset. Tonight, the starry sky won’t disappoint."

On the way, stop at the waterfall of Attiq in Tissint for a refreshing change of scenery. These waterfalls are all saltwater and the translation of ‘Tissint’ in the local language is ‘salt’! When you arrive in Tata mid afternoon, you’ll have a free evening to relax. If you like, explore downtown with your leader tonight and head out for a great local dinner."

The lifestyle and irrigation system here is quite unique to the region and you’ll get a deeper understanding of what life was like here with a visit to the old collective granary that’s still in use. After exploring, continue to Tafraoute, arriving in the afternoon. This southern Moroccan village sits in the shadows of the Anti Atlas Mountain Range. Although it’s now more of a campervan destination, Tafraoute remains authentic and a great base for exploring the Anti Atlas region.

The hike will take you through palm trees, almond trees and fields of alfalfa crops used by locals to feed their animals. On the way, stop for a rare chance to visit a traditional Amazigh house that's preserved by your host to showcase the traditional lifestyle, which is changing fast in the modern day. You'll be able to learn about how the traditional Amazigh household functions, and learn about your host's story of growing up here over a cup of freshly made mint tea. The area is quite rocky in general, so sturdy shoes are needed. Also stop for lunch set against the beautiful view of the valley. In the afternoon, head to one of the most controversial sights here – the Pierres Bleues (painted rocks). The Belgian artist Jean Verame spray painted these boulders in 1984 and visitors still debate whether these rocks are an artwork or not (so you can decide for yourself!). The evening is yours to spend."

You’ll stop at a local woman’s cooperative along the way, which specialises in Argan oil production. This coop provides women and their families in the rural area with extra income for their community, promoting independence. You’ll learn about how the Argan is extracted from the trees, how it’s produced, then you’ll get to try the freshly made Amlou paste. Carry on to Essaouira (translating to ‘pretty picture’). Within the stone ramparts, you'll find whitewashed houses with bright blue shutters, art galleries and wood workshops – the perfect spot for photos. This evening is free for you to explore or relax."

You’ll have the chance to meet one of the expert fishermen in the port, who will tell the group all about their story and show you some of the tricks they use, what type of fish to catch and what seasons mean to them. After, enjoy free time for the rest of the day. Jimi Hendrix spent a lot of time here during the 60s, so you know this is a great spot to sit, people watch and listen to the sound of the ocean. Maybe grab a freshly cooked plate of the day's catch at the port or browse the plentiful shops and intriguing art galleries. This is also a hotspot for surfing, so consider taking a lesson if that’s your thing. If you’d prefer to relax, don't miss the opportunity to indulge in a hammam (Moroccan day spa) or local-style bath."

At 660m altitude and with very little traffic of cars, the clean and fresh air adds to it's timeless feeling. We invite you on a walk to visit some of its prettiest places including Bab el-Ansar and the famed Ras el-Maa, the source of the pure and fresh water for which the city is also famous.

The “nouvelle Ville” of Fez, or the new city, provides a startling contrast with Fès el Bali. Wide and elegant avenues are lined with numerous cafés and restaurants. The modern aspect of the new city highlights the economic differences of the suburbs and the city centre. Artisan workshops in the medina are as active today as 100 years ago, and strongly contribute to the city’s industrial economy. Trades such as metal and leather working, ceramics, silk, tapestries, and sculpting are still practiced in these workshops, whilst the original ramparts still protect the ancient city and its’ 9000 inhabitants who meander through its passageways and narrow streets.

Inside, elegant calligraphy graces the ceramic tile walls. The marble floors, sculpted cedar, and carved stucco walls—made with a concoction of plaster and egg white—have held up since this masterpiece Medersa was built in 1350. Since it is still in use, non-Muslims must depart during prayer time. Bab Boujloud: Constructed in 1913, this gate is about 1,000 years younger than the buildings behind it. It's proof that age doesn't matter—the relatively youthful structure is the most strikingly beautiful entry point into the old city. Painted flowers and calligraphy embellish its outer blue ceramic tiles and, depending on one's interpretation, the green mosaic interior either represents peace or the official colour of Islam. Stop by at sunset for some excellent photo opportunities.The square, with its splendid and unusual fountain, takes its name from the Souk Nejjarine (Carpenter’s Souk) which is situated behind a wooden door in a narrow street below the square. The Mellah: The Jewish Quarter is where Jewish people traditionally lived under protection from the Sultan. The main street is especially interesting with its balconies and Art Deco zellij mosaic. Most Jews in Fez (around 300) now in fact live in the Ville Nouvelle. Visit of the Ibn Danan Synagogue, a recently restored 17th century synagogue. The souks of Fez are located in the ancient city center, the medina. Merchants selling the same sort of products are generally grouped together in their own “souk”. The tiny alleyways are crowded with the tiny boutiques on both sides. The henna and wood working souks are located in the Nejjarine neighborhood and the scent of cedar is everywhere. The main plaza is planted with trees and provides a shaded haven from the warm sun. Various natural products derived from henna are sold here. Nejjarine is also where the fabric dyers are located. You simply should not miss El Attarine, the spice souk. Without question, this souk is the most colourful in Fez. Stay at: Riad Salam"

This fortress is best known for Orson Wells filming most of Othello, in 1949. Essaouira’s walled medina dates from the late 18th century and was added to Unesco’s World Heritage list in 2001. It is an outstanding and well-preserved example of European military architecture in North Africa. It’s a great place to walk around and explore.

Part Berber, part Arab, part African, Marrakech is the heartbeat of Morocco where palaces and monuments of unrivalled refinement sit calmly alongside the snake charmers and Gnaoua drums pulsing constantly from Djemâa el Fna Square - the most exuberant marketplace in the world.

The new owners decided to live in the Villa Bou Saf Saf, which they renamed Villa Oasis, and undertook the restoration of the garden in order to “make the Jardin Majorelle become the most beautiful garden – by respecting the vision of Jacques Majorelle.” As YSL himself commented: “We quickly became very familiar with this garden, and went there every day. It was open to the public yet almost empty. We were seduced by this oasis where colours used by Matisse were mixed with those of nature... And when we heard that the garden was to be sold and replaced by a hotel, we did everything we could to stop that project from happening.\" Stay at: Riad Nashira"

The minaret served as model for the Giralda in Sevilla and the unfinished Tour Hassan in Rabat, all three being designed by the same architect. Koutoubia means ‘booksellers’, as the trade of books was concentrated in the neighbourhood during the Middle Ages. The minaret of the Koutoubia, 77 meters high, is visible from almost any point of the city – an old ordinance, still in force, forbids any building of Marrakech to surpass the Koutoubia minaret in height. Medersa Ben Youssef, is not only the most important but also the largest in Morocco. Commissioned by Sultan Abdallah al-Ghalib, its construction was completed in 1565. It has 130 rooms which have accommodated up to 900 students. The most interesting moments of the visit are undoubtedly the discovery of the interior courtyard as well as the austere atmosphere of the rooms. After lunch; continue to the Market at the heart of Marrakech, filling the alleys north of the central square, are the souks, mile after constricted mile of tiny, closet-sized emporia. The sheer number of shops is overwhelming—100 of them in 100 yards.

        "description": ": Our first stop is Rabat's historic centre. After taking in the views across the city including the Oued Bou Regreg river estuary, we'll walk over to Rabat's most famous landmark, the intricately carved Hassan Tower. The marble interior of the Mausoleum of Mohammed V lies directly opposite the tower. Our next stop is the royal palace, which we'll view from the outside, after which we'll head to the Kasbah des Oudaias, a fortified area of the city perched on top of a cliff with commanding views of the city behind it and the ocean in front. The Kasbah has a distinctive Andalusian flavour, with whitewashed houses and narrow winding streets surrounded by imposing fortified walls. There's time to enjoy a refreshing glass of mint tea or orange juice before we stroll around the Andalusian gardens, a haven of tranquillity, offering a shady retreat. After a break for lunch, we bid farewell to Rabat and drive to Chefchaouen. It's a drive of around five hours which will take most of the afternoon with a stop or two along the way, and we'll arrive into the famous 'blue town' in the early evening. Our base for the next two nights is a bright and spacious riad in the heart of the medina. Featuring a traditional Moroccan hamman, a large roof terrace with fine views of Chefchaouen and an indoor swimming pool and a spa with a wide choice of massages and treatments available, it's the perfect spot to relax and take a break from the bustling streets outside."

After breakfast, accompanied by our tour leader we'll take a stroll into the medina. With its stacked white and blue houses set against red tiled roofs, the town is a photographer's dream. Our walking tour of the medina takes in the narrow, winding lanes of Chefchaouen, which give you an idea of Andalusia's influence over Morocco. There's time to discover many of the artisan stalls and stop for a glass of mint tea in a shaded café watching the world go by.

Morocco's best-preserved Roman site, Volubilis was once the capital of the province of Mauritania Tingitana and home to 20,000 people. We'll take the chance to explore the UNESCO World Heritage Site with a local guide. Spanning several hectares, the site has remarkably well preserved mosaic floors, carved columns and avenues, giving a sense of what life would have been like in this once bustling Roman outpost. The area around Volubilis is blessed with rich fertile plains ideal for wine production. The combination of clay and limestone soil with a Mediterranean climate of hot summers and mild winters, enables growers to produce high quality wines including rich, full bodied reds made from imported grape varieties including Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Tempranillo. We'll be greeted at the vineyard by our resident wine guide who will accompany us on a short tour of the vineyard and production facilities, before we get the opportunity to taste three different wines. Today's final destination is Morocco's cultural capital, Fes. Steeped in history, Fes has played an important part in Moroccan trade, culture, religion, and politics throughout the centuries. We'll arrive at our riad located in a quiet corner of Fes' historic medina. Lovingly restored using intricately carved cedar wood, with mosaic floors, it is set out in a traditional manner with rooms arranged around a central courtyard. It's the perfect base from which to explore this vibrant city."

This morning, we'll delve into Fes el-Bali, the oldest quarter of the city, with a guided tour of the old medina. The day starts with a short drive to the viewpoint at Borj Nord for a look at the sprawling city from above to get our bearings; we'll then visit the royal palace in the Fes El Jedid district, see the palace from the outside and take a short stroll around the historic Jewish quarter. The highlight of the day is the chance to head into the old medina and souks. Nothing quite prepares you for your first visit - you'll see weavers, coppersmiths and tanners all hard at work, the narrow winding streets and covered bazaars are a riot of noise, colour, smells and life and rolled into one. During our walking tour we'll also get to see the famous tanneries and dye pits where leather products are still produced by timeless traditional methods used for hundred of years. This afternoon is free to enjoy meandering at your own pace. You might like to head into the new town and take a seat at one of the European-influenced cafes that line the pavements in the French Ville Nouvelle district.

Walk through the twisting streets and alleyways, passing donkeys piled high with goods and explore the specialty sections that divide the souk. Filled with historic khans, medresses and dye-pits, stalls loaded with fruits, herbs and soups, and where the squawk of chickens, smell of spice and sound of hammering copper fills the air, it’s not hard to imagine yourself back in the Middle Ages. Spend the day exploring the old city, visiting, Medresse el Attarine, the tanneries and the splendid Fondouk Nejjarine, a beautifully restored 18th century inn.

Driving across the plain you will see vast acreages of vineyards which produce good quality wine, much of which is exported to France. You will have up to three hours in Meknes to explore the town including souks, the fascinating historical sites and to take lunch. Moulay Ismail made Meknes the capital city of Morocco during his reign around 1700; his mausoleum and the Rouah, his stables for over 12,000 horses, together with Place el-Hedim, the central pedestrian square in the Medina, are well worth a visit. The souks of Meknes are refreshingly spacious compared to Fez, which makes the city a relaxing place to explore. Meknes to Moulay Idriss - After lunch our journey takes you 30 km north to the hillside settlement of Moulay Idriss. The town is one of the country’s most important spiritual sites and a place of pilgrimage as it is the site of the tomb of Moulay Idriss, a prominent Moroccan saint in the late 8th century and a great grandson of the prophet Mohammed. The town is often bypassed by non-Muslim tourists, whose closest encounter is often a photograph taken from nearby Volubilis. There is limited access to the green-tiled shrine but the myriad of narrow streets leading to vantage points for views over the valley towards Volubilis are well worth a short stop. Moulay Idriss to Volubilis and Fez. Leaving Moulay Idriss for the short 4 km drive to the World Heritage Site of Volubilis, there are a number of vantage points to take photographs of the town. Volubilis is the site of the largest and best preserved Roman ruins in Morocco, particularly noted for its superb mosaic floors; it has fabulous views of the Rif Mountain foothills, particularly at sunset. A guided tour of the Volubilis site with an official guide (20 dh paid locally) is well worth it if you are interested in some detail of the site’s history. At around 4.30 you depart Volubilis returning to Fez at around 18.30pm."

Chefchaouen or Chaouen, as it is often called by Moroccans, is a popular tourist destination because of its proximity to Tangier and the Spanish enclave of Ceuta. The name refers to the shape of the mountain tops above the town, that look like the two horns (chaoua) of a goat. « Chef Chaouen » derives from the Berber word for horns, Ichawen. There are approximately two hundred hotels catering to the summer influx of European tourists. One distinction possessed by Chefchaouen is its blue-rinsed houses and buildings. Chefchaouen is a popular shopping destination as well, as it offers many native handicrafts that are not available elsewhere in Morocco, such as wool garments and woven blankets. The goat cheese native to the area is also popular with tourists. The growing tourist industry is geared especially towards Spanish tourists, who are especially numerous during great Catholic feasts like Semana Santa and Christmas. Chefchaouen was visited by Joe Orton and Kenneth Halliwell in 1967. They adored it finding it « very ‘Golden Bough-ish’ Orton mentions their trip in the Orton Diaries. There are a number of distinct mosques in the town. Aside from the mosque at Place Uta Hammam in the medina, there is also a mosque dedicated to the patron saint of Northern Morocco’s Jebalah region, Moulay Abdeslam Ben Mchich Alami. His tomb and the village surrounding it is by the way an hour’s drive or so from Chefchaouen on the old road to Larache. There is also a ruined mosque built by the Spanish, with stairs still in the tower."

Perched in the mountains and washed in shades of blue, Chefchaouen feels like a world of its own. Founded in 1471 as a fortified settlement, the town blends spiritual significance with a relaxed, artistic atmosphere. With your local guide, you explore the old medina, where blue-painted streets, red-tiled roofs, and narrow lanes lead to the lively Plaza Uta el-Hammam and its restored kasbah. You wander through nearby souks, admire the Grand Mosque from the outside, and visit the kasbah’s gardens and historic spaces. For sweeping views over the blue city, you step just beyond the old walls and pass through historic gates toward a scenic viewpoint near Hotel Atlas. After your visit, you continue your journey through the Moroccan countryside, arriving in Fes later in the day, ready to explore one of the country’s most storied imperial cities."

There is a special focus on the rare and iconic nocturnal mammals of this part of the world and so there are some very long (but productive and rewarding) nights of spotlighting throughout the trip. <br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>On this rare wildlife tour some of our targeted species are among the rarest and most elusive nocturnal creatures in the world (as well as being some of the most sought after species of mammal watchers worldwide). Species such as African golden wolf, Fennec &amp; Ruppell’s Foxes, African wild cat, Sand Cat, Saharan Striped Polecat &amp; Desert Hedgehog are all possible on this tour and we have a very good success rate with many of these species including the two top priority animals which are fennec foxes and sand cats. <br/><br/>The tour will involve some stunning desert camping and after dark the beautiful and spectacular starry skies are among some of the best in the world. All in all this tour is a great overview of the Western Sahara’s fascinating and unique wildlife, much of which is very difficult to see elsewhere.<br/><br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife safaris of Africa including Morocco and Western Sahara. The Western Sahara is huge country with some of the most remote and isolated wilderness anywhere in the world and is home to some of the most specialised species in the world.<br/><br/>It is hard not to be mesmerised by the expanse of sand and wilderness of the Sahara and it is easy to think that the whole area is devoid of life, however on closer inspection there are many species of birds and reptiles which live on the dunes and gravel pans during the day and then after dark when the temperatures drop the landscape comes alive with jerboas, gerbils and their predators which include various foxes, mustelids and of course the tiny sand cat. <br/> <br/>We are specialists at rare mammal watching tours all over the world and can tailor tours to any specifictions. Whether you are interested in desert mammals of the Western Sahara or trying to see the critically endangered Javan Rhino or look for Giant Pandas in China we have the options for you, as well as many other safari options.<br/><br/>Group Tour Departure: 12th March - 19th March 2024<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Dakhla. We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers and game drives and spotlighting. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Western Sahara. Your naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. Whilst the trip involves a lot of camps, for the camping we will provide all of the camping equipment the only thing you will need to bring is your sleeping bag. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the Western Saharan wilderness, night safaris are available in some locations (subject to the local conditions on that day). You will have to speak to your guide on arrival there and book places on these (this is not included). A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>We plan this tour in February, however it could be done in most times of year. The reason for February is temperature as it is cooler in the winter and so the wildlife is more active for longer than in the hotter times of year. Also there is more night time hours and as most of the wildlife on the trip is nocturnal, that factor helps us also.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist guides as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it. We do our best to include as many wildlife activities as possible in all of our itineraries.<br/>• Depending on budget and interest we have a range of different accommodation packages to offer, from luxury top end lodges, national park safari lodges and mobile-camps which often offer unbelievable wildlife watching deep inside national parks as well as camping. We can also arrange mobile camping safaris of Botswana is very popular and all of your camping gear will be provided.<br/>• Spend all the daylight hours searching for wildlife and visiting various natural wonders and stunning landscapes.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our Western Sahara wildlife safaris a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Southern Africa so that we can try and find and observe some of the rarer and more elusive species. We have great itineraries and expertise in all African countries (such as Namibia, Gabon, Ethiopia, Madagascar, South Africa, Tanzania, Botswana, Kenya, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Uganda, Rwanda and Mozambique) and can arrange trips to find some of the rarer species such as mandrills, aardvarks, gelada baboons aardwolves, brown hyenas and black-footed cats among other species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour visits two general locations within Western Sahara, however they are best kept relatively secret as they are unprotected and so we do not want to highlight the presence of wildlife in these areas and potentially open the area up to poaching.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from a vehicle and whilst there is some walking, most of the walking is over flat terrain. This doesn't require any special fitness level. The biggest consideration is the heat, it is very hot in the wilderness of Western Sahara during the day.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 15 Years Old<br/><br/>Photo Credits:<br/>Payman sazesh, CC BY-SA 3.0<br/>Leonemanuel, CC BY-SA 4.0",

        "description": "Upon your arrival in Madrid, as you wander the charming and charismatic streets, it will be hard to believe that you are in a capital city. Strangers greet each other, small establishments know their guests by name, and the sounds of chatter and clinking glasses far outweigh any traffic. Parts of the Spanish capital feel like a village, as their gregarious makeup is quick to make an impression on visitors. However, these streets also have the vibrant advantages of a city. Aromas of garlic and olive oil emanate from the taverns, great menus of wine are available by the glass, and dishes are created by the country’s top chefs. Your driver will meet you at the airport and escort you to your Central Madrid hotel that blends vintage design with contemporary luxury. After you settle into your hotel, you will discover that the city is a culinary paradise. The classic way to discover it all is on a tapas crawl, a Madrileno ritual that isn’t just about what you eat and drink. As you join the locals on these old narrow streets, you will get an immediate sense of what Madrid is all about, from the architecture to the atmosphere. Led by a local guide, the tapas crawl allows for a relaxed introduction to the city. End your night with a casual stroll to your centrally located hotel, which is accessible on foot, while also providing a peaceful setting for returning to after the evening of tapas and wine."

Begin your day by standing on the baroque Plaza Mayor where you will admire the elegant arcades. Then, wander past colorful cafes to stop for chocolate and churros in an iconic early 20th-century establishment. Afterward, you will discover the legacy of the early Habsburg monarchs as the oldest part of town is marked by palatial townhouses and plazas where you can watch the world go by. Your morning will conclude at the Royal Palace, an enormous structure of marble and mahogany with gilded stucco and crystal chandeliers. While the king’s reception rooms are impressive, the guide will also take you to places that few visitors know about, such as one of the 3000 ornamental rooms that include a royal pharmacy and a library that glistens with pride. After lunch on a plaza, you will spend the late afternoon on a short tour of the Prado, the iconic home of the Spanish masters. Perhaps only Paris’s Louvre can rival the Prado for its collection of European art where the works of Velazquez and Goya are complemented by Rubens, Titian, and the names that forever changed art through the middle centuries. The evening will be at your leisure and your guide can recommend some excellent restaurants close to the hotel."

Enjoy lunch at the hotel’s excellent restaurant then set off to discover Seville’s great monuments. You can begin at the towering cathedral, where Columbus is buried and the Gothic excess is greater than anywhere on the planet. Then, visit the Alcazar Palace, a journey through Moorish design mingling with Mudejar craft and Christian regality. Next wander through Santa Cruz, a Jewish quarter filled with vintage stores and ornamental history. Seville has a vast historical area and this tour of the major three sights will be just an introduction. Tonight, you will have a full evening to explore at leisure."

Explore the aristocratic residence of Casa de Pilatos, a brilliant mix of architectural styles that’s been perfectly preserved. Afterward, discover Roman mosaics and ruins that paint an older history of the city. Then, take a stroll through a marketplace of color and noise, where castanets and fans spill from the stalls. You may want to spend an hour or two in Museo Arqueologico, or visit a sixth floor bar in the world’s largest wooden building. There are many corners to turn with your guide and the classic activity in Seville is to just go with the flow as you turn down the streets at random and embrace the enigmatic feeling of this old Andalusian city. In the evening, you will sit transfixed as you watch the emotion on a singer’s face while a mournful guitar music floats around the room and a dress twirls in musical harmony. Tonight, you will enjoy a flamenco performance at a venue within the Andalusian flamenco triangle, which is where the art form originates and the performances are as authentic as any in the country. Dinner will be included with the performance and later you may want to take a stroll since the streets will be full of energy late into the night."

Nothing ever seems to have changed in these villages and they all have the same feeling: footsteps echo onto the cobbles, the narrow streets retain a euphonic quality, and there’s an artistic centerpiece rising proudly. Today you will travel across Andalusia to Granada, as you follow the route of the pueblos blancos and take time to stop in at least two of the villages. Zahara de la Sierra and Ronda are ideal as they have contrasts that will be difficult to see elsewhere. The journey is relatively short, yet it will take up the full day as you escape into these charming vestiges of the past. It’s not just the villages but also the landscapes that will make Andalusia special for you, as there will be dozens of viewpoints and a sense of solitude that comes as a surprise to many. During your time in Granada, you will stay in a historical building, a formerly a 19th-century mansion in the heart of the old city. It remains full of glistening treasures, featuring an intricacy of design so synonymous with the city.

Decadent porticos line a courtyard of serenity and a forest of pillars stands over a carpet of marble. Some walls are deliberately left plain, which allows intricate murals and calligraphy to shine without competition. Surreal and sublime, this is a building that proves how much artistry existed before the Western world flourished culturally. However, it’s not just one building but a whole complex that incorporates courtyards, gardens, fortified palaces, and the residences of the Nasrid kings. After a full morning at the Alhambra, the afternoon will be at your leisure to discover this historic city.

The old town is vast and packed, a carpet of colorful chaos that can be baffling at first glance. Most alleys are barely wide enough for the donkeys that still plod through, and they jut off at impossible angles that may discombobulate you. Spices float through these alleyways, rose petals float in the trickle of city fountains, and shards of light reflect pink against the walls. This is a city with heart and soul that blends Berber life, Islamic style, contemporary influence and a proud determination to stay unique. As you begin your exploration, your private guide will provide you with insider knowledge that will always be valuable in such a labyrinth of contrasting yet complementary streets. Monuments come from across the centuries, such as the 19th-century Mnebhi Palace and the delicate 12th-century Koubba. Ambient souks are everywhere and each part of the marketplace is dedicated to a different trade or craft such as carpets, enamel, cedar, leather, brass, camel meat, and other crafts that have been perfected over centuries. There is almost too much for the senses so it’s important to stop at the cafes, where sweet mint tea is poured while you watch the city go about its day."

Djemaa El-Fna is the city’s central square, a World Heritage space where oral history is transmitted by Berber storytellers and musical groups. You can sit and listen, as well as watching the acrobats and snake charmers that also make a living on the square. All are performers, whether holding a snake or narrating a tale. First they will grab interest as they encourage people to sit with them. Then they will start to narrate, encouraging others to join. Every part of the tale, or each new song, requires a donation from the crowd, with the audience jostling each other to ensure the entertainment continues. For a true insight into the past there are few better cultural experiences. You can combine it with a meal from one of the dozens of food stalls that line the square after dusk."

The kids will think they have arrived in a desert palace, surrounded by historic walls and filled with exotic culture. Ouarzazate has been featured in films from Lawrence of Arabia to Gladiator. The city maintains a feeling of importance, having once been the main stopping point on the trans-Saharan trade route. The souk bustles with people at all hours of the day, filled with traders that once came all the way from Timbuktu. The city is filled with meandering aromas, from the arid desert earth to the nearby lush valleys, to the aromatics of couscous emanating from homes. Atlas Movie Studios is situated nearby and has helped dress historical fiction on the big screen for decades. The kids feel like they have stepped into a movie themselves, eager to journey out into the surrounding landscape and search for hidden culture, buried treasure, or ancient civilizations.

Mountains fill the distant horizon; the kids are excited to enter the old city walls. Geometric drawings decorate the ramparts and wind down the inner alleys and gateways. Towers and turrets pack single-family homes tightly together, amidst a collection of up to 20 different historic family mansions. A soft, warm breeze sweeps through the deserted streets. A myriad of stairwells creates a mysterious, almost abandoned atmosphere, in the fortress grounds. The children creep quietly through the meandering alleyways like treasure hunters. They find oddly shaped rooms illuminated by large, open windows. The plasterwork is cut into floral patterns to decorate the larger rooms. Cedar wood panels cover the ceilings. The remnants of opulence fill the rooms and the entire Kasbah, restored as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The family makes its way out away from the old walls where your private transfer escorts you through the heights of the Tizi n’Tichka Pass, at around 7,415 feet, and on to the Oasis of Tazzarine."

Mountains roll across the landscape. Henna fields rise out of the fertile earth and make the barren desert almost disappear. The nearby petroglyphs of Aït Ouazik contain history dating back to 5,000 BC. They contain images of elephants, giraffes, and antelope, when the landscape was believed to have attributes of the savanna. Foum Tizza is a rarely visited dune field on the outskirts of the oasis. The picturesque Sahel contrasts soft, sifting sand with blue-black rocks strewn across the expanse. You arrive at your transportation and the kids almost cry out in anticipation. A camel train awaits you to climb aboard before venturing into the depths of the Sahara on a luxury excursion. The camel gets up back legs first before standing at its full height of over seven feet tall. The kids yelp when it’s their turn. You watch them sway from side to side as the camel walks through the desert sand. Bedouins wave as they pass you by. Their cobalt blue robes stand out against the surrounding pale sands. As the daylight fades the drivers pull out drums, singing to the beat with a tune that sounds equal parts expression and prayer."

The aroma of mint tea mingles with scents of breakfast. The cup of tea warms your hand as the sunshine spreads across the expanse. After your meal, the family climbs back up on their camels to venture back into the oasis. The breeze shifts the sand around the camel’s toes. You look back and see the lingering trail the train left in the sand. The camel prints intersect with other prints that you can barely discern. You ask the guide what animal the small footprints belong to. He tells you about the Fennec Fox, a nocturnal mammal that can grow up to 17 inches long. They have large, bat-like ears and angular, black eyes. The kids listen with awe to the variety of animals that can survive the extreme temperatures of the desert. You take in the breathtaking landscape as it starts to shift from widespread sands to the return of rising palms and far-reaching henna fields."

When the meal is done and the kids have grown tired of their camel impersonations, your private transfer escorts you to Aït Ben Haddou, the largest Kasbah in Morocco. Pass through Draa Valley with over 60 miles of date palms. The sweet aroma passes by with a background of the lunar Kissane Mountain Range. The fortified walls are a proud and prominent red, strengthened by interspersed towers. Slit windows adorn the upper parts of the walls for guards to see out, but threatening armies or raiders unable to see in. The city rises up the small mountain. A granary stands at the top of the mountain and offers the best view of the historic city below, and the copious rolling mountains all around. Once again the kids feel as though they have entered a movie, when in fact they are walking through history, with the oldest constructs dating back to the 17th century. The earthen buildings remain firm and inspiring. The clay helps keep the homes cool in the desert sun. Around every corner, the kids turn with anticipation.

The rustic city disappears behind the barren hills as you ascend the High Atlas Mountains. The Tizi n’Tichka Pass has not changed in centuries, continuing to meander through the mountains. The village of Imlil stands on the foothills. The mountains are textured with irrigated terraces. The peak of Mount Toubkal towers over the village at an elevation of 13,671 feet. Visitors often use Imlil as a starting point for treks into the mountains. As you descend the mountain, the outline of Marrakech comes into view. The historic red walls surround the medina. The large gate known as Bab Agnaou once stood as the main entryway into the city. The sandstone walls border an arched doorway. Layers of a shell design encircle the arch. You enter the city and find a world of imagination in Djemaa el Fna Square. People lounge on colorful pillows in rooftop cafes and watch the active plaza below. The kids are as entranced as the serpents when watching the snake charmers play their songs and weave to the instrumentals. Magicians disappear in flashes of light and puffs of smoke. The kids eagerly listen to a storyteller spinning yarns of genies, tales that are both familiar and new all at once.

Arrive in Casablanca where your private guide and transfer are waiting. The city sits at the country’s western edge, against the quiet lull of the Atlantic Ocean. Palm trees border wide boulevards. The trees sway in the delicate sea breeze. The sweet scent of coconut mixes with the salty sea air. Historic neighborhoods edge contemporary Art Deco buildings erected during French colonialism. A cosmopolitan ambiance can be felt through the cityscape, from award-winning restaurants to contemporary art galleries displaying aesthetics that shy away from the more classic Moroccan images. Hassan II Mosque looks out over the cobalt water. The ocean laps at the small wall that pushes against the ocean. The minaret stands 689 feet tall, the largest minaret in the world. The sunlight glints off of the water and inside of the mosque you can see the ocean wading beneath the glass floor of the main hall. The walls contain an opulent shimmer, constructed with decadent hand crafted marble. Over 100,000 worshipers can pray inside the mosque, with 25,000 inside the main hall. Walk through the multi-colored arches and notice the engraved floral designs. The elegance of the mosque reveals Morocco’s contemporary connection to its boisterous and flamboyant heritage."

Honey and melted butter combine to create a sweet and creamy syrup poured over Beghrir , a savory pancake made from semolina. After breakfast, you make your way northbound towards the Strait of Gibraltar and to the famous city of Tangier. The city sits across from Spain and has served as the entryway to the Mediterranean. Tangier has always been a bridge between the European and African continents, attracting people from around the world with enthusiasm and mystique. The city is divided between the medina, an antique area surrounded by historic walls, and the modern city. Inside the medina, you find narrow alleyways that wind around the cityscape, lined with stuccoed walls and cobbled streets. The Grand Socco is the main square fringed with palm trees. A fountain sits at the center and provides a pleasurable, cooling mist to the air. At the edge of the plaza is a keyhole gate known as Bab Fass. The terrace offers a view of the square from up high, where the romantic image of Morocco’s past comes to vibrant life."

The air is perfumed with fresh grass and in the distance you can see the rising foothills of the Rif Mountains. The range has an elevation of 8,054 feet and casts imposing shadows over the valley below. You come to the 15th-century city of Chefchaouen. You find the buildings situated beneath the mountain peaks and awash in vibrant blue. The old streets wind and wander along the mountainside lined with stucco homes shining sky blue with cobalt doors. Some buildings were constructed in the Andalusian style, with red-tiled roofs. 11 towers rise above the old walls and once provided protection to the medieval city. Walk through the shaded lanes and it looks like you are exploring a city underwater with the various shades of blue encircling the streets; it is a unique atmosphere. At the heart of the old city is a plaza paved in cobblestones. Cafes and restaurants provide ambiance and a collection of delicate and rich aromas: fresh pressed dark roast coffee mingles with freshly brewed mint tea. The red walls of the Kasbah encroach on the old square and contrast with the smooth colors of the city."

Meknes has a slow and relaxed pace with a collection of narrow alleys that wind around the old city. The architecture provides reminders of the nobility that once called the city home. The Middle Atlas Mountains rise in the distance swooping downward into the fertile plains that surround the city. Dashes of olives, grapes, and lemons provide aromatics to the city streets. Dar Jamaï Museum is situated in the 19th century palace. The garden maintains its lavish Arab style with vibrant fruit trees and shady cypress trees. The palace windows are painted and framed by detailed tile arrangements and decorated wooden panels. The décor alone is a surviving symbol of nobility’s wealth and dedication to art and culture. Today the palace maintains one of the country’s great museums, filled with talented craftsmen and artists. The main hall is a postcard-like in its central elegant fountain surrounded by graceful arches amidst traditional Islamic geometric tiles."

Venture through the main gate known as Bab Bou Jeloud. The powerful triple arched entrance is decorated with glistening blue tiles. The central arch is flanked by two narrow keystone openings. The city bustles from the moment you enter, filled with a wealth of energy. The marketplace is alive with locals and visitors, spreading down a long stretch of lane. Spices are arranged in conical peaks that display their color as much as their aroma. It looks like rainbows have been separated and sold by their individual striped hues. Silks are draped over stores and flow with effortlessness and grace against the fast moving market. The aroma of leather sweeps through the meandering alleys and emanating from the famous tanneries, almost hidden behind the leather shops. Behind the vendors, you can see people stepping into the tannery pits to dye, clean, and dry leather before it is shaped into various goods."

The lush greenery looks like an oasis against the backdrop of cliffs layered with red and black rock. When you reach the town of Erfoud a 4x4 collects you and takes you into the vast Sahara Dessert for a panorama of unparalleled scenery. The wonders of the desert begin at the edges of the golden sand and spread into the vast unknown. The 4x4 reaches Erg Chebbi, possibly the largest collection of sand dunes in the Sahara with dunes that tower like mountains almost 525 feet into above the level field. The late afternoon provides a breeze over the sweeping sands. The beauty of the landscape is in its seclusion and pristine nature.

You can’t help but marvel at the stunning landscape as you make your way into the Valley of 1,000 Kasbahs, situated between the High Atlas Mountains and the Jbel Sarhro Mountains. In Skoura, you find remnants of what was once a vibrant desert trading post. Graceful palm groves create a vast contrast to the desolate desert sands. The canopy shades almost 15 miles of gardens watered by a water system of locks, levees, and canals with centuries of experience. Birds flutter and twitter around the oasis. The golden towers of a historic fortress rise out of the canopy. Kasbah Amridil was constructed in the 17th century and appears on the 50-dirham note.

The town rests at an elevation of 5,900 feet and was the former seat of power to the El Glaoui family. The red sand Kasbah walls look ruinous from the outside. However, once inside the Glaoui Palace you find a museum filled with opulence dating back to the family’s pinnacle of prominence. Wooden doors are decorated with hand carved geometric shapes. The walls are decorated with elegant zerij mosaics, traditional Islamic artwork. The windows are framed with latticed-style wrought iron work. The panorama fills with green fields of Berber villages. Trees almost block out the rocky outcrops and lead to mountains rolling along the horizon. The interior courtyard is paved with polished marble and lined with thin, graceful columns. The remains of the sensational palace remind you to never judge a book by its cover, or a palace by its exterior."

The alleys of the medina wind away from the main square and take you on a tour of the city that feels like you are searching for buried treasure. Your guide shows you Koutoubia Mosque, a 12th-century edifice that can be seen from almost every angle of the city. An age-old ordinance states that no building can be built higher than a palm tree, but the mosque was exempted. The minaret is one of the three oldest remaining Almohad minarets in the world and stands almost 230 feet tall. A book market once blossomed near the base of the minaret and filled the nearby square. Ceramic tiles create a dazzling band at the top over inspiring decorative motifs. A topper of copper orbs captures the sunlight and shines above the old city.

The roads wind around the foothills with hairpin turns to bring you into the mountain range that rises to an elevation of 13,671. The fortress stands above the wild tree line and blossoming lupines. Sporadic purple and pink flower petals poke out of the lush greenery. The hillside continues to rise over the old fortress into the mountaintops. You can reach the village of Imlil by a muleteer path that winds along the rolling mountainscape. The sweet aroma of budding flowers mixes with the verdant trees. The village rises along the sloping landscape. In the drier months the earthen homes blend into the arid mountains. The mountains are more than just a view but a reward, opening up like a time capsule.

The walls were built by the Portuguese and protected the outpost for centuries. The streets have a relaxed ambiance that creates a carefree atmosphere. Seagulls soar over the walls and narrow alleys turn the town’s center into a maze. Local women wear white veils and palm trees cast shadows and shade over the red walls. Modern gourmet coffee shops stand next to historic old restaurants. You listen to the waves brush against the shore and can stand on the dramatic ramparts for a view of the historic, labyrinthine streets. A sea bastion on the cliffs gives you access to the city walls. 18th and 19th century brass cannons continue to look outward, ever-watchful sentinels. The horizon along the ocean is clear and calm.

Camels turn the soil, helping the farming. The restaurant has open screens that look out onto the plush landscape. You can tour the 100 acres of fields under cultivation and see the storage barrels of wine before enjoying a private tasting. The wines are often featured on wine lists between Marrakech and Essaouira. Sip on a chilled glass of rose beneath the warm sun. The aroma of lime flower and mature fruit linger in the glass.

Your private transfer meets you at baggage claim and escorts you to the comforts of your luxurious hotel located in the city center. The remainder of the day is yours to enjoy an immersive experience in the bustling city. The warm air contains a fragrant hint of the sea, mixed with exotic spices emanating from the local restaurants. The palm fronds rustle in the breeze.

Intricate decoration encompasses the walls and floors through a series of geometric designs in-line with ancient tradition. You can hear the water splash against the rocky promontory on which the mosque stands. The mixture of radiant blue, yellow, and green tiles accentuates the latticework adorning the walls.

Golden pebbles pave the public beaches and the sunlight washes over the pristine pools of private swimming clubs. After breakfast, your private transfer meets you at the hotel, ready to escort you northeast to the historic city of Fes. Before reaching the city, you first stop in Rabat, the capital of Morocco. The city remains serene in comparison to the bustling streets of Casablanca. Palm-lined boulevards frame the colonial architecture. Monuments highlight the city’s wealth of history, from Phoenicians to Roman settlements. Ancient 11th-century fortress walls encircle the Kasbah District. White and blue lanes, reflecting the Andalusian influence of Spain, color the neighborhood. The Kasbah Mosque was erected in the mid 12th century and is the oldest mosque in the city. The antique walls offer a slight aroma of rich earth, accentuating the edge of the district. You can see the towering rusty hues of the unique Hassan Tower, a minaret erected on the site of what was supposed to have been a grand mosque. The more than 145-foot tall tower is all that remains of the original 12th-century design. You continue onward to Fes, stopping in the historic city of Meknes and visiting the Roman ruins of Volubilis before reaching the city known for its connection to the past."

Semolina pancakes known as beghrir overtake tables decorated with zellige tiles. Locals smother the pancakes in honey or spiced strawberry jam. Your guide meets you at Riad Taryana Hotel eager to show you a Fes in which tradition carries a value more important than gold. The grand gates of Bab Chorfa and Bab Boujloud connote the entrance into Fes’s Old City. The gates were erected in the 11th century and offer an iconic image of antique Morocco, harboring the heritage of Fes and Moroccan culture. The oldest neighborhood known as Fes el Bali contains a labyrinth of rambling streets lined with shops and a vibrant marketplace known as a souk. Radiant colored spices fill open sacks positioned in front of stalls. The aroma of cinnamon and cardamom subtly mixes with the aroma of dyes emanating from the tanneries. Your guide introduces you to a local leather slipper artisan, who has produced the customary footwear in the city for years. The cobbler takes pride in his work, producing comfortable slippers that fit around a person’s foot with the comfort and ease of a glove. The cobbler eagerly shows you his workshop before crafting a pair of slippers before your very eyes, leading you through the process from start to finish. You have your first look at the tanneries, in which you find a selection of bright slippers dangling from the rafters above barrels catching dripping dye as the slippers dry with opulent earthy tones and slick sheen. You look out the window to find the actual dying vats below. The image resembles a life-size paint palette bordered by antique homes."

Opulent hand-carved doors adorn the north entrance leading to cedar woodcarvings in the upper levels. After breakfast, your guide leads you on an artisan tour of Fes, moving away from the leatherworks of the tanneries and into artistic crafts of tiles, clay pots, and local cuisine. The tiles decorate regal architecture, from former palace grounds to decadent mosques in what has quickly become familiar Muslim tradition. The first master tile maker offers you an introduction to the history of the tiles and the tradition. Master artists have been unable to keep pace with products produced with the speed of modern technology. The true art of tile creation and the skill needed to produce mosaics appears in the form of focus and dedication it takes to produce a single tile. The workshop fills with the roar of the tools as the tile-maker first cuts the stone to shape the mosaic, placing each tile with focused concentration to create an elaborate mosaic. The patterns are easily recognizable yet unique in color or design providing a traditional connection with the creative touch of each master artist. You continue your artistic tour of Fes with a visit to master potter, making the volcano-shaped pots known as tagines, which are a staple in Moroccan cooking."

Conditions are usually ideal due to the steady current, and you can watch from the beach or find your own private place to relax."

Great mounds of olives will spill from wooden buckets in the main souk, and a mosque will call to the other mosques with a euphoric melody that can become your way of telling the time. Small cafes have outdoor terraces that allow you to sit with the locals and watch the day unfold. Places of solitude dominate the coastline, whether you are interested in the waves or lying on the sand. Another option for spending the day is to visit some of the old, almost abandoned towns in the surrounding area. These relics of the past are another indication of how long life has sustained itself along the Moroccan coast."

You can travel by road to the Sahara, but it is a really long journey with kids. Eventually, you will touch down in an ancient caravan town. Here, you will be surrounded by a trading history that you will still be able to touch and feel. After a short road transfer, you will set off on camels. Sand dunes rise beguilingly and are soft and subtle as their shapes continually change on the wind. A sense of wilderness will be absolute, even after just 30 minutes of being on camel-back. Across the dunes, you will venture on a family expedition into one of the world’s most iconic landscapes. Deep in the dunes is a private camp, where you can experience old-world caravan hospitality and lose yourself in the allure of the Sahara."

You need to spend at least 24 hours here, so you can appreciate how the desert is always changing. Morning hours are typically best for exploring and enjoying family adventures on camels and on foot. As midday approaches, the landscape becomes incredibly hot, and the dunes will appear bleached in color. While a desert camp may look simple, it benefits from centuries of tradition and innovation. From the late afternoon, the desert continues to change: wind visibly whips sand from the ridges, creating an ephemeral landscape that is never the same as the day before."

You will have the opportunity to go shopping in the souks, and a local guide can accompany you. Not only does a guide know where to go based on what you want, but vendors will not approach when you are accompanied by a local.

The Corniche is filled with hip, wealthy locals sipping mint tea in open cafes. Hassan II Mosque was constructed in 1993 but shimmers in the historic Islamic and Moorish styles that embody Morocco’s unique culture. The minaret is the tallest in the world standing approximately 690 feet. Your private transfer and guide meet you at the airport and take you through the eclectic city. You continue onward to Rabat, the capital of Morocco and find a calmer, smaller city, draped in elegance. A cliff-top castle watches over the azure Oceanside. A small cove houses fishermen near the mouth of Bouregreg River. The cool breeze relieves the spreading sunlight. Arte Deco architecture punctuates lavish arcades, decorated with neo-Moorish detail. Storks soar over the cityscape. They nest near the crescent beach. It is easy to settle into the capital city and feel at home in its relaxed, yet luxurious pace."

Your private transfer meets you at the Riad. Rabat fades away, replaced by the 17th century capital of Meknes, home to historic grace and cultural charm. The large gate known as Bab el-Mansour offers an impressive welcome to the city. The 18th-century entrance has a lavish façade of zellij , geometrically arranged tiles that form colorful mosaics. An inscription in Arabic can be seen at the top of the gate. A calm river flows through the center of the city, lined with palm trees and a quaint walkway. The old stable and granary once housed up to 12,000 horses. An underwater channel kept the stone building cool in the heat. Most of the colonnade now has an open roof, but parts of the vaulted ceiling have been restored. The stones remain cold to the touch and light beams through the small but numerous windows. Your footsteps echo against the walls of the powerful edifice. Each arched door takes you farther into the remains of the once treasured architecture."

Bordering houses narrow the medina streets and cause the alleys to wind maze-like around charming courtyards that somehow guide you back to the marketplace. Your guide expertly navigates you around the old city walls. Medersa el-Attarine was founded in the 14th century and continues to sit at the heart of the medina. Colorful tiles are arranged around the central courtyard and border the small but elegant fountain in the center. The floor is checkered black and white. Sensational blue, yellow, red, and white tiles are positioned in a diamond formation and rise midway up the supporting walls. Cedar wood and carved plaster adorn the upper walls and create an earthy, yet elegant décor in conjunction with the spiraling tilework.

The mountain town is known for its university but recently has become the “Switzerland of Morocco.” The aroma of cypress trees swirls around the mountaintops emanating from the nearby forest. The air is crisp and cool at all times of the year. The king of Morocco has a vacation home in the city. Storks build nests around the central park waters and atop various, flat roofed homes. The mountain range has ten peaks that reach above 13,123 feet. The local university teaches in English, French, and Arabic, providing students across Morocco with an American-style university education. Locals who live on the fringe of town harken back to the area’s original Berber routes: herding goats and traveling over the mountain pass to buy and sell goods between the seaside and desert markets. In the forest, you can witness the small but elegant waterfalls fed by snowfall and lush springs. The water spreads across the forest floor and trundles down protruding rocks, connecting back to the small river."

The animal has been prized in desert regions for their ability to withstand temperature variations, and remarkable ability to conserve water. Whenever the camel steps you sway back and forth, understanding the animal’s given nickname, “Ship of the Desert.” You make your way to experience the culture of the Gnawa people, brought from the Sudan to Morocco as slaves. The men wear long flowing white robes with a white cloth wrapped around their heads to protect them from the sun. You sit in a cool room in a small building made from stone. The Gnawa men pull out traditional instruments and such as a three-string lute and heavy iron castanets. The rhythm pulses through the room as the men’s voices harmonize in a collection of chants and urgings. The drum beats strong and loud. Two men begin to encircle one another and tap leap into the air, spinning in circles, and squatting to the ground before doing it all again. The proud heritage is apparent in the unique, blended sounds that came with time and movement. Your trek continues deeper into the desert where the night sky begins to take over, trading sunlight for starlight."

You return to Merzouga for breakfast and are met by your private transfer. The sand dunes of the desert disappear and are replaced by the towering walls of the Todra Gorge, Morocco’s highest and narrowest canyon. The raw power of nature is present. The cliffs are spaced as little 33 feet apart at the narrowest and climb up to a height of 525 feet, as tall as the largest sand dunes at Erg Chebbi. A small stream meanders through the valley and once carved the impressive landscape around it. The gorge walls are rugged and rustic red. The scent of rich earth and fertile riverbanks bounces off the cliffs.

The village is made of desert stone, which contains a golden or rustic hue depending on the angle of the sun. Asif M’Gound River irrigates the rose fields that spread across the valley and provide the sensual aroma lingering around the village. Over 18 miles of roses stretch from Kelaat M’Gouna to the village of Bou Tharar, situated at the edge of fertile fields and rugged foothills. M’Goun Mountain stands 13,356 feet high and casts a shadow over the “Valley of Roses.” Pickers venture into the fields and pick the bright pink rose blooms. They place the blossoms in a cotton bag. In May, the Rose Festival is in full swing, where traders from around the region come with handcrafted goods to trade for roses. The mountains roll along the horizon and separate the elegant scent of roses from the rugged aroma of the expansive desert."

The highest peak of Mt. Toubkal stands 13,670 feet tall. Donkey trails meander across the mountainside. You can venture out into the scenery and feel at one with Morocco, looking out over the landscape and enjoying the fresh, fragrant air. For a picturesque view matched with luxury, you can visit Kasbah du Toubkal, a fusion of Berber hospitality and décor, with European service.

The high-pitched rhythm of snake charmers creates the soundtrack to the stories that echo through the square. People lounge on rooftop cafes and listen to the active life of the plaza while sipping orange blossom and mint tea. You step into the depths of the city’s grandeur at the Saadian Tombs. The tombs date back to the turn of the 17th century and were rediscovered in 1917. Two main mausoleums fill the enclosure housing 66 tombs. The first hall contains thin marble stones. The back of mausoleum contains a delicate mihrab, a decorated niche that signifies the direction of Mecca. The mihrab supports a collection of marble onyx columns. The central chamber is domed and glistens in the light. The décor and architecture recall the grace and splendor of the Alhambra in Granada, Spain.

The medina is an immaculate white, which makes the cobalt blue doors and windowpanes burst with color. Waves mist against the 16th century walls built by the Portuguese, but the city’s roots date back to the Phoenicians. The beach glows with golden sand that disappears behind the city walls. The city has a relaxed pace settled between historic, narrow lanes and the echoing rhythmic music emanating from homes and hidden restaurants. Bab el Mersa, the gate that leads to the Scala Port, is adorned with a triple cresent moon above the wide arch. The sandstone gate contains Arabic calligraphy decorating the pinnacle just below the pediment’s point.

Chefchaouen is small, and you can walk around the medina in less than 30 minutes, so it will be a comforting first stop after your flight. You can sit back on the main square, Place Outa el Hammam, and watch the world go by as a call rings evocatively from mosque minarets."

Suddenly the entire alleyway is blue, from the doors to the stones on the street. The color resembles a cloudless sky. The city’s color stems from a Jewish tradition of dyeing threads. The city meshes Berber, Muslim, and Jewish culture with those of Moorish Spanish exiles. Aromatic herbs emanate from local homes. Charming brass teapots are displayed in narrow hillside streets that fill the old city. Vendors dangle artisan silver bracelets that jingle. Soft shawls radiate with color and hand stitching.

The tannery creates an unmistakable leathery aroma drifting around the bazaar. Follow your guide through the streets and find a historic building around every corner. The Medersa Bou Inania was constructed in the 14th century and maintains a gem-like quality. The fine details filling the theological school create the larger, exquisite design.

They stand in pods and add a touch of color to the rippling surface. In the distance, you can see the beginning of the sand dunes. The dunes fulfill the image of what most people believe the Sahara to be, a display of nature’s raw power with rolling sands seemingly devoid of life. However, when you arrive at the dunes you find beauty in the seclusion. Erg Chebbi is a stretch of sand dunes that encompasses 17 miles.

A small river meanders through the basin and slowly carved the gorge’s current form. During monsoon season the river rises and water tumbles down the cliffs. Vibrant greenery blooms alongside elegantly tiered waterfalls. You arrive in Ouarzazate in the afternoon and find a fortified city made of clay. Towers and turrets support the old walls. The town rises up a bluff, adorned with a granary providing views of the meandering streets and the expansive desert. Mountains slope downward into the flatlands. Aït Benhaddou is the largest Kasbah in Morocco and retains its antique atmosphere, featured in films such as Kingdom of Heaven and Jesus of Nazareth.

Mint tea accompanies the meal. Your private guide meets you at your hotel for your journey through the cultural history of Morocco and its connection to Jewish history. Over 30 synagogues fill Casablanca and kosher markets line the streets of the old Jewish neighborhood that is less than 100 years old. The Jewish cemetery is open to visitors and remains quiet and still. The whitewashed stones are marked in French, Hebrew, and Spanish. Arrive at the Jewish Museum and find a large space that covers almost 7,535 square feet. The museum is unique in its display and architecture, embodying the close relationship of Sephardic Jews and their North African surroundings. The museum remains the only Jewish museum in a country that considers itself an Arab nation. The exhibits highlight the wealth of Jewish history in the region, along with the mutual influence of Jews and Muslims. The antiquity on display ranges from dolls to books, Torah to Torah dressing. The scent of familiar spices wafts through the main gallery. Two separate rooms recreate complete Moroccan synagogues. In the evening the Mellah comes to life with women selling produce. They wear richly colored djellabas , loose fitted robes that date back to the Berbers. The culture you have experienced in a single day is unparalleled in depth of history and image of perseverance."

The medina is the old quarter of the city and it retains a sense of antiquity unlike anywhere else in the world. Bab Boujloud is the main gateway that leads into the old city. Two thinner, smaller arches flank the large central Moorish arch. The gate shines with brilliant bluish-purple mosaic. The medina was once home to the celebrated Jewish scholar, Maimonides. The ambiance is palpable, specific to the old plaster walls and undulating streets. There is something to be said about walking in the footsteps of such a renowned rabbi. The tanneries provide the unique aroma that rushes around the narrow historic streets. The scent of leather and dye flows from the constricted square that houses the uniquely traditional craft. The leather has open shops where people tinker with belts and shoes, creating distinctive handmade garments with goods from the tannery most often behind the shop. From the surrounding streets you can look into the formed pits filled with colored dye. Your guide explains the process and takes you through some of the artisan shops known for their quality leather goods."

Outside of the city you venture through the fertile Saiss Valley, which looks almost like an oasis fitted between the rugged oxidized rock walls of the mountains. Traverse the winding roads of the mountains and arrive in Ifran, an alpine town with a European ski resort atmosphere. Al-Akhawayn University conducts classes in English, French, and Arabic. The cool mountain air flows joyously through town. The crisp aroma of cedar follows the breeze. Storks graze in the local park and build nests on the town rooftops. In the winter snow blankets the streets and trees. In the summer the fertile land stands against the rolling mountaintops in the distance. The nearby forest is lush and dense.

The aroma of slow cooking kebabs wafts around the cobblestone paved plaza. People watch the activity from on high, with panoramic views from rooftop cafes. Henna artists hold people’s palms and swirl ancient artwork over visitors’ hands and forearms. Storytellers gather crowds and weave legends of magic carpets and towering desert sand dunes.

You can hear craftsmen beginning their trade, from cobbling shoes that hang on graceful display, to shaping and smoothing leather. The city life surrounds you with incredible, daily detail. Around the bazaar you see mounds of spices displayed like colorful pyramids, from turmeric to allspice. Their fragrances merge and create a powerful, enticing aroma. El Badi Palace was constructed in the 16th century and now stands in ruin. The palace was once paved with gold, turquoise, and crystal making the edifice justifying its nickname of “the incomparable.” Today the palace contains similar grandeur but less opulence. A 12th-century prayer pulpit is located in the main hall. Gold and silver calligraphy decorated the cedar-wood steps. The spacious grounds contain the large entrance gate and once lavish arching doors.

The men begin to sing and you can hear the tribal elements that have persisted through the evolution of the music, a combination of storytelling, prayer, and expression. After your cultural exploration, you will climb aboard a camel as a part of a famous desert camel train. When you sit in the saddle the camel rises back first, which urges you forward. At full height a camel can stand over seven-feet. The camel sways from side to side as it steps through the sand.

Following a series of seemingly unnavigable turns, you will uncover the real Casablanca, away from fictional cafes with its beautiful architecture and easy-going locals. The Hassan II Mosque is a staggering architectural achievement that rivals any of the world’s religious buildings. It is also a place of worship that invites non-Muslims inside."

This coastal town looks more like Greece than Africa with its glistening walls and incredibly slow pace of life. After a short walking tour of the old city, the evening will be at your leisure, so you can indulge in some incredible Moroccan cuisine, wander the old walls, and wonder how a town like Asilah ended up in Morocco."

After you settle in to your hotel your guide meets you in the lobby to take you on a half-day exploration of the city. Located northwest of the Corniche is the wondrous Hassan II Mosque. The stunning structure was consecrated in 1993 and can hold a up to 105,000 worshippers between the main hall and the outer grounds. The minaret is the tallest in the world, standing at 689 feet. Outside, the Atlantic Ocean splashes quietly against the shore and fishing boats idly wade on the cobalt water. The central hall contains a succession of domes. Glass chandeliers made of Murano glass add prisms of delicate light to the gallery. The mosque is an image of grace and discipline, providing just enough embellishment for elegance."

The gardens offer respite from the bustle of the Medina and the bubbling marketplace. The blue building was once painter Jacque Majorelle’s studio and now houses a Berber Art Museum.

Caves open up the cliffs and the remnants of an ancient slave village sit near the old Telouet Kasbah. The fortress was constructed with red earth and stands against the open bright blue sky for a dramatic contrast. The interior is open to the wind. Much of the fortress has fallen into disarray; however, you can’t help but be enchanted by what remains. The interior has a maze of locked doors and interconnected halls. The Moorish elements that decorate the interior connect the contemporary architecture to the traditional. Fallen roofs and decayed hallways give way to stunning galleries shimmering with geometric textiles adorning the pillars. Large and imposing wooden doors are decorated with smaller Moorish arches that open up, leaving the larger door to defend the entryway like a gate.

The arid stretch of oxidized rock that rises and falls over the plateau brings you to Boumalne Dades at an elevation of 5,125 feet. An oasis sprawls around 30 miles. Dades Gorge cuts the fertile landscape behind the city and creates a rugged and embracing terrain. The foothills are colored with layers of limestone that reach up to the mountaintops.

The breeze blows sand across the dunes and it looks like mist in the early hours. When the sun begins to rise over the sweeping sandy sea, the horizon fills with orange and the desert shimmers with gold. Slight pink hues layer the depths of blood-orange that emanates from the sun.

The sound of trickling water offers a calm respite from the fast pace of the encompassing city. Parc de la Ligue Arabe is a promenade lined with palm trees and designed in 1918. Locals stroll through the park and find the comforts of the countryside in the manicured pathways at the heart of their city. So much of Casablanca weaves you in and out of the contemporary life and historic fantasy."

The palm trees sway in the indulgent breeze. The family rises for breakfast to find a mixture of familiar flavors and traditional Moroccan dishes. Orange blossoms and mint drift from tables around you. Almonds and dates are naturally tempting and delicious. Yogurt and is enhanced with bits of orange flower water to create a bright, zesty, and creamy combination. Rghaif is traditional pastry dough similar to a pancake, sometimes accompanied by sweet date syrup. Part of the wonder of vacation is watching the family enjoy the flavors of a new country and culture. After breakfast your guide meets you at the hotel for a private tour of Casablanca’s glowing landmarks. Just beyond the borders of the Old City you arrive at Hassan II Mosque, the second largest mosque in the world. Its tallest minaret is over 656 feet high. Your children have to strain their necks to see the top of the tower. The structure sits to the right of a rocky ocean alcove, which adds to the dramatic artistry. The ocean brushes against the shoreline in quiet whispers. The children marvel at the immaculate décor. The prayer hall contains three naves, the largest of which is 130 feet tall. Glass chandeliers hang from numerous domes. They reflect the sunlight that pours in from the open windows. The walls are decorated with marble and contain traditional geometric mosaics to add bright color to the galleries. When you walk through the mosque you can see the floral details in the plasterwork as well. The ambiance is stunning. The entire family could wander through halls, inspecting every detail and listening to the nearby water. It isn’t often that the family can appreciate the splendor together."

The colonial architecture is a constant display of elegance and the palm-lined boulevards provide classic charm in the cosmopolitan city. The atmosphere is relaxed and provincial. The city’s history reaches as far back as the Phoenicians. The beaches around the northern edges of the city are coved with golden sands and pristine waters. Breakfast is another wonderful surprise of flavors with plump red grapes and crumbly cheeses. Your guide meets you at the hotel and takes you out into the majestic charm of this approachable treasure. Few empires evoke as much thought and fantasy as the Roman Empire. The Historic city of Chellah dates back to the year 40 AD. The city sits on grassy slopes that overlook the banks of the local river. Fruit trees and wildflowers grow against the backdrop of crumbling buildings. The forceful fortress walls were constructed in the 14th century and offer platforms to view the incredible remains of the old stronghold. The grounds create a mystery that your children are happy to fill in with stories of what possibly took place across the expanse of the city’s streets. Follow the path that leads alongside rising stones. A triple-arched entrance still stands. A minaret watches over the Roman ruins and is adorned with a stork’s nest. The collection of ruins nearing 2,000 years old is unique and inspiring, from the rampart walls to the surrounding, opulent landscape. Continue onward to Meknes en route to Fez, where you will settle into the enchanting city for the night."

The locals set the pace of the city, walking and talking with intent. Blind alleys open up to marvelous squares where exceptional fountains trickle in the quiet space. Music emanates from cafes and plazas and copper beaters create a rhythm all on their own, working to their own special beat. The city is both fun and elegant, traditional and forward-thinking. Follow your guide closely through the Old City. The narrow alleys turn on a dime in an endless, splendid maze. The streets ramble and the people are active. The aromas of fresh spices are matched by their vivacious colors. Ruby red saffron and sun-yellow turmeric create a rainbow in the storefronts. The alleyways themselves are as photogenic as the landscape around the city. The atmosphere is mesmerizing, filled with a distinctive charm. Shopkeepers call out to you to check their wares. The scents of cinnamon and sugar drift around the grounds. The ancient skyline helps guide you along the steps of history. Donkeys and mules pull carts. People stop and chat with grocers and weavers. It is a virtual paradise of local crafts, from slippers to rainbow-glass lamps. On a rising hillside between an open span of buildings you find the Chouara Tannery. The iconic picture of the dyeing pools stands before you in the heart of the leather district. You can see people working on dyeing the products, giving tremendous color to the leather and the pools."

The grasslands are golden and the sky is an expanse of perfect blue perforated by sporadic fluffy clouds. The souq , the market place, is important for the rural lives of the local people. You can hear their bartering and happy exchanges sweep through the streets. Oranges and olives come in from the mountains. Textiles and cotton are offered in the form of rugs and blankets. Ouzoud Falls are 360 feet high and terrace by the towering cliffside. A swath of olive trees shades the pools at the bottom. The summit is home to a series of old mills. The nearby canyon reaches a depth of almost 2,000 feet. The thunder of the falls is cacophonous. The kids marvel at the natural splendor of the world before them. The greenery intersperses with the rocky terrain. Mist fills the upper pool before the water continues to cascade to the lower river. The power and beauty of nature are often one and the same."

Manera Garden is an oasis in the heart of the city. You leave behind the bustling streets and jovial merchants to find the heart of serenity. Peaceful walkways and shady trees encompass a large pool at the center. The gardens were constructed in the 12th century. The pool reflects the sturdy palms and 18th century pavilion on the water’s edge. The nearby tree line stands before the towering peaks of the Atlas Mountains in the background. In the evening you will venture to the remarkable Fantasia dinner and show. The legends of the desert come to life with a portrayal of 1,001 Nights .

The synagogue has colorful stained glass windows that cast light into the interior as the main entrance contains a large wooden double door. A fountain trickles in the inner courtyard near a tall, thin tree and the synagogue is considered the centerpiece of past and present Jewish life in the city. You can see the detail etched into the banister of the women’s balcony; the prayer stand sits at the center, near the central ark. The allure of the synagogue is not just the beautiful décor but the wealth of history that dates back centuries. The temple was renovated in 1997 but has maintained its graceful antiquity."

The relaxed ambiance is noticed in the winding old streets where true Morocco comes to light. Old men sit in antique cafes; children play jovially in the streets, and the aroma of freshly baked flatbread drifts from communal ovens. Many of the buildings are painted white and reflect the sunlight; you can hear the water brush against the rocky shore wall.

The aroma of packed spices, from cayenne to turmeric, is never far away. Men with white, manicured beards play backgammon and drink mint tea. The medina fills with life along its meandering streets. The Old American Legation sits in the southeast corner of the old city. Morocco was amongst the first countries to recognize the United States after its succession from England. The Tangier American Legation Museum is housed in a five-story building and was the first piece of American real estate outside of American soil. The mansion contains impressive displays of paintings depicting city life throughout the building’s history.

Historians regard it as one of, if not the finest, preserved Medina in the country. The aroma of freshly bread blends into the simmering spices as picture-perfect narrow lines lead you around buildings brimming with character into the jovial marketplace. The rainbow color of spices surround you on the way to the mellah , the old Jewish district. Established in 1807, the district maintains a single synagogue for the use of local Jewry, which dates back to the 18th-century, and is supported with help from the Spanish Jews.

The ancient city contains a relaxed pace surrounding the historic streets of the medina. The first mellah did not adjoin the old royal palace, so the second mellah was constructed after the French protectorate was installed. The two districts hold a combined eight synagogues and the latter district is home to around 200 of the city’s Jewish population. The Elkrief synagogue is located in a whitewashed building with an elegant iron wrought door. The interior is cool and subtle as the marble looking ark contains hand-stitched and handcrafted Torahs.

The prayer hall centers on a simple doorway, vague in its separation from the surrounding houses. When you enter the door, follow the short flight of stairs upward into a rectangular space.

Sundays and Wednesdays erupt in sociability around the souq , where people come from all over the mountains ready to buy, barter, and haggle for goods. The Berber village is home to a small synagogue and Jewish cemetery. In the 1930s, over 1,450 Jews had moved into the city coexisting with their Muslim neighbors without dividing into a mellah.

The aroma of rich, hot earth blends into the freshness of the swaying trees. The fortress city was ruled by the Spanish-Jewish Perez family and was the center of a Jewish region until the end of the 18th-century. The city was important for trade routes venturing from the desert, or through the mountain pass.

Breakfast is a collection of intoxicating regional flavors. Date jam and figs offer sweet aromas and accompany creamy yogurt accentuated with orange blossom water. You sip mint tea and enjoy the traditional cuisine of the morning. Your guide meets you at your hotel and takes you on a private tour of the city’s remarkable historic sites. The Central Market dates back to the start of the city and continues to be at the center of city life. Vegetables and fruits line the alleyways with vibrant freshness. Pomegranates almost glow with ruby red. Grocers call out their daily specials. Spices are stored in open sacks for you to see their vivacious hues iridescent in the sunlight. The aromas of turmeric and radish glide past you. A plethora of shoes are hung on strings alongside shop walls. The spirited display of local life sweeps you up and captivates you. The experience is more than just shopping but is also a view into the Morocco of which you have always dreamed. In the afternoon you will transfer to Rabat for the evening. Settle into the political capital of the country and find a slower pace in more serene neighborhoods."

        "description": "Rabat is the capital city of Morocco and is filled with an atmospheric calm. History reaches back to the Phoenicians at the citadel of Chellah. The palm-lined streets are pristine. The cool air drifts from the Atlantic Ocean. After breakfast, you meet your private guide and prepare for the hidden gem that is Rabat. The 12th-century fortress of Oudaias Kasbah encompasses a tranquil tiny neighborhood. The winding alleyways are decorated with white and blue hues, the same hues as the Andalusian buildings of Spain, just across the Strait of Gibraltar. The fortress looks over the placid water. The steps lead to the remarkable gate of the Kasbah Mosque, the oldest mosque in the city. Its main gate is adorned with a traditional Moorish arch, surrounded by geometric designs. The mosque was constructed in the 11th century and rebuilt in the 18th century. The minaret rises over 131 feet above the ground. You can see the tower from all angles of the city, dominating the skyline no matter where in the capital you are. The colorful alleyways lead you through the expansive grounds. The sound of the ocean is never far away. An interior gate takes you to the Palace Museum and Andalusian Gardens. The palace dates back to the 17th century and exhibits Moroccan art and culture. The beauty of the fortress is in its artistry but is also in its intentions. Moulay Ismail was the first sultan to unify Morocco and wanted to display the collective art and culture of the country. In the afternoon you will continue to Fes, stopping en route to visit the enchanting imperial city of Meknes."

The contemporary world continues to edge the fringes of the historic neighborhoods but the stately atmosphere of the historic imperial city is undeniable. The flavors of breakfast have become familiar but are no less satisfying. They brighten the already exciting morning with luscious and zesty flavors. Your guide meets you at the hotel and escorts you on a private tour of the city’s corners that should not be missed. Medersa Bou Inania was constructed in the mid 14th century. It is a school of learning and a spectacular display of Moroccan artistry in architecture. The minaret is outlined with deep green, which stands out against the backdrop of opulent blue sky. The courtyard walls are decorated with traditional open windows that provide a cross-breeze to cool the building in the summer heat. The arches are textured with fringe. Dar al-Magana is a house next door constructed by a Sultan. The house held a clock that consisted of 13 windows and platforms. The clock was powered by water and was built in the 14th century. The design used a series of platforms and weights to keep the clock moving at a regular and constant speed. The city is filled with rich wonderments, from mosques to an old Synagogue with collections of Moroccan-Jewish life. The city’s community is active and vibrant, promoting their history by staying connected to their heritage."

The foothills’ peaks are draped in snow and they range in color from rocky grey to green. Golden grass sweeps to the edges of the foothills. Today you will make your way to Marrakesh, stopping in fabulous traditional cities along the way. Imouzzer du Kandar is a town that dates back to the early 20th century under the French. The town partly resembles an alpine ski resort. The main square is paved with textiles and lined with oak and cedar trees. The aroma of simmering coffee and sweet honey drifts along the plaza. The mountain peaks emerge over the city’s edge. The slower atmosphere is a delightful change of pace from Fes’s endless vivacity. Limestone plateaus add to the landscape and were once home to the locals. A small lake decorates the city center and is filled with colorful paddleboats. The city sits 5,249 feet above sea level. The aroma of the surrounding forests fills the air with fresh pine. The architecture is more in line with French villas than Moroccan culture, which adds an unusual charm to the cityscape. Imouzzer du Kandar is also home to the only English university in the country. The streets offer a different view of Moroccan culture, where the French influence remains strong and the movement with the contemporary world stays constant."

You are ready to venture through the streets and immerse yourself in the charm and history of the cityscape. The Saadin Tombs were constructed in the 16th century and are home to 66 members of the dynastic family. The Moorish architecture is classic in its design and pink sandstone walls. The large arches present power and grace. The geometric shapes are symmetrical, which adds to the thoughtful and artistic balance of the tombs. When you enter the grounds you find colorful tiles decorating the floor and intricate mosaics on the lower half of the walls. Marble pillars provide cool support for the building. Twelve columns and cedar wood enhance the already pristine beauty of the grounds. The nearby souq is filled with enthusiastic activity. Spices form conical peaks and the aromas of the saffron and cayenne add a touch of decadence to the afternoon."

Medersa Ben Youssef was constructed in the 16th century and continues to be the largest college of theology in the country. The rooms are clustered around internal courtyards to help alleviate the heat. The air circulates over the reflective pools to provide a cool and refreshing breeze.

After breakfast your private transfer, arranged by one of Zicasso’s luxury travel agents for Morocco , will escort you to the airport for your flight home. There is something about Morocco that is both palpable yet intangible. It gives you a sense of its history displays its embracing culture. The people are friendly and the cuisine is unique and delicious. The beauty of the architecture and artistry emanates from each city’s core.

Your guide meets you at the hotel lobby and takes you on the first of many Morocco tours , beginning with exploring Casablanca before venturing north to the calm and graceful streets of Rabat. The city has roots as a Barbary pirate port from the 16th to the 18th-centuries. Today the city has a charm emanating from its wide avenues, historic fortress, stunning museum, and remarkable tombs. The colonial architecture creates a gem of a city that allows you to explore at your preferred pace. Authentic boutique shops wind through the Kasbah les Oudaias, the oldest part of the city. The citadel has a commanding view of the encircling landscape, most notably from the 12th-century Bad Oudaia gate, which faces the heart of the city. The Bou Regreg River feeds into the Atlantic. Cobblestone walkways twist and turn around the beige brick structure with fortified battlements. The collection of palm trees provides luxurious shade in the warm sunlight of the Moroccan coast. Whitewashed homes line the narrow streets inside the kasbah. The serene city provides great insight into the true cultural history of Morocco."

The ruins date back to the 3rd-century and offer insight into the Roman occupation of North Africa. A circuit of walls expands more than one-mile along the 100 acres of the cityscape. Foothills border the prairie. Columns and outlines of stone buildings continue to decorate the landscape. The stonework of the Arch of Caracalla stands at the end of Decumanus Maximus, the main street. The architects used the local stone to erect the monument. Walking through the site takes you on an easy trip back to the city’s heyday. Various houses contain mosaics undisturbed by time. The House of the Athlete has a mosaic depicting an athlete riding a donkey backward. He holds a cup in his hand, with his arm extended as if in salute to passersby."

The marketplace brims with activity emanating from the tanneries. The cultural heart of Morocco beats strongest in Fes. Locals linger in cafes hidden by narrow alleyways. The iconic image of the souk (marketplace) comes alive when you see the stunning colors of the variety of spices stacked in front of a shop stall. You set an easy but excitable pace through the city streets, eager to absorb the beauty all around you. The Medersa Bou Inania was erected in the 14th-century. The religious school is an architectural treasure that highlights the splendor of geometric design and the majesty of Islamic artistry. Geometric patterns decorate the walls and court. Keyhole archways and lattice windows provide easy access to constantly flowing air. You can see the crown of the green-tiled minaret hovering over the courtyard."

The town is located about 22 miles southeast of Fes at an altitude of 3,000 feet above sea level. Traders have stopped here en route from the Sahara Desert to the Mediterranean Sea for centuries, creating a mixture of cultures since the 13th-century. The town once hosted one of Morocco’s largest Jewish communities as well. The Mellah, the Jewish neighborhood, continues to line the northwest riverbank. Wooden-galleried homes line the pathways and streets enclose to a narrow peak to fit only two pedestrians at a time. The allure of Sefrou is its medina, with a wide-open lane leading through its center.

You can see the towering rusty red walls of the gorge, reaching upwards of 1,000 feet, lingering behind the verdant palm groves and lush grasses of the oases in the foreground. Barren, craggy mountains roll away from the canyon walls. The gorge narrows to a width of 30 feet. The stunning natural landscape is undeniable.

In the villages along the route, you can see locals stopping in small cafes and shops, drinking tea with one another. The scenic drives takes you through the Valley of Roses. In the morning and afternoon, flower pickers stroll through the miles of pink hedges producing garlands of fragrant roses. The flower buds are at their most fragrant early in the morning or late in the afternoon. The ochre turrets of the remote kasbah behind the plantation create a remarkable contrast in lushness and vibrancy.

The greenery is noticeable and even casts shade over the road and bordering villages. Once in Marrakech, you settle into the comforts of your riad, a historic mansion, located in the heart of the spirited city. You have time to freshen up before your tour of the old city. The old square of Djemaa El Fna was erected in 12th-century and stands as one of the oldest areas of the city, and holds the entire vibrant heart of Marrakech. When you visit the square in the evening, local restaurateurs haul their grills into the center of the square, fanning at their coals, and placing kebabs filled with meat or vegetables over the grate.

Fertile planes encircle the city and stretch to the Middle Atlas Mountains. You notice the apparent divide in architecture between the newer French constructs of the west to the medina in the east. Bab el-Mansour is the most distinguished imperial gateway in the country. The gate was constructed in the 18th century and remains immaculately preserved. The colorful textile border has faded but once shimmered a polished green. The remaining color and power of the Moorish arches and thick pillars are still equally as impressive. The granaries of Moulay Ismail, known as Heri es-Souani, were designed to hold tiny windows and massive walls, along with a system of underground water channels to cool the interior. The stables hold up to 12,000 horses. The vaulted ceilings have been restored to an impressive degree. The stone remains cool against the afternoon’s warmth. You can walk along the restoration and ruins to see the impeccable design and eventual decay of the massive project. Soon you will continue to Fez and find comfort in your accommodation, which was once a nobleman’s mansion."

        "description": "The culture of Fez is prestigious because of its perseverance through time. The distinctive elements that made the medina and the medieval city wealthy have created an incomparable atmosphere centered around history. Your plush Riad -style accommodation is located at the center of the city. Your escort meets you after breakfast and takes you on a private guided tour of the best-preserved medieval city in the Arab world. The aroma of fresh citrus fills the air. You see a pattern forming within the streets of the country’s medinas, filled with narrow winding alleyways. In Fez, you find the alleyways often created by charming architecture and brightly painted doors. An aroma of leather quickly overtakes the medina. You hear the tinkering of metal on metal and chaffing pelts. The tanneries date back to the 12th century and fill the old city with the familiar fragrance that drifts past the vendors. The tanneries are located behind the leather shops. The pits are filled with colorful dyes that stain the leather a particular color. The leather workers shape and taper the fabric into bags, coats, and belts. Continue to follow your guide through the historic streets of the city and find yourself in a rooftop café overlooking the entire Medina. A fresh brewed mint tea arrives at your table. The herbaceous aroma blends with the sweetness of honey. The energetic pulse of the alleyways fade and you find a peaceful, private moment on the rooftops overlooking history."

        "description": "Fez leaves an indelible impression on your time in Morocco, connecting a vibrant past with an encroaching modernity. Linger at breakfast and indulge in the flavors of tangy yogurt and sweet honey. Walnuts provide a textural crunch and the scent of mint tea helps awaken the senses. Your private transfer escorts you out of the city and on your way to the desert town of Merzouga. En route to the desert plateau you wind through the Middle Atlas Mountains. The mountain range’s highest peak is Jbel Bou Naceur at a height of almost 10,960 feet. Enjoy the relaxed pace and alpine atmosphere of the university town of Ifrane. The mountain air is crisp all year long. The fresh aroma from the cedar forest fills the streets. Storks nest on the rooftops. King Mohammad VI vacations in Ifrane in the winter, stirring up the laidback ambiance and traditional Berber culture that persists even today on the town’s fringes. In the afternoon, you arrive in Merzouga and unwind in your opulent Riad, which provides you a pristine and private view of the desert scenery beyond the village."

        "description": "The sun hovers over the horizon on the Sahara Desert and spreads a golden shine across the sand. The wonder of the scenery is ineffable, filled with a rolling landscape and endless sweeping sand. Outside of Merzouga’s borders is Dayet Srji, a salt lake that awakens in the spring. The water reflects the empty blue sky and sits at the base of a rising sand-based hill. Flamingos linger in the water. Their plumage turns pinker the more they eat. Falcons circle the sky and leave a small, dancing shadow on the ground. Your guide points out tracks in the soft sand and says they belong to desert foxes. The desolate landscape makes you wonder if anything could survive, but the vibrant bird life and unseen foxes are proof of a vibrant ecosystem and the delicate wonders of a harsh environment. Step aboard a camel and follow trek into the desert with seasoned professionals. When the sun begins to set you will find the starlight flickering above you. The scent of slow-cooked meat rises from a traditional cooking pit. The powerful spices fill the desert air and your lavish evening beneath the starry sky."

The breeze brushes sand across you feet. The desert looks tiered with pink and purple, orange and red, until the sun takes full form over the horizon. You once again board your familiar camel and make your way to the renowned Erg Chebbi sand dunes. The dunes spread over an area of 17 miles. The majesty of the dunes is apparent when you see how large they can grow, some rising up to 524 feet. The desert continues to display natural splendor, from the lakeside fauna to the landscape. You return to Merzouga to meet your private transfer and make your way through the stunning polished rock walls of Todra Gorge and onto the Dades Valley."

        "description": "Today you make your way across the Road of 1,000 Kasbahs en route to Marrakech. The road takes you to Kalaat M’gouna, a town at the center of an oasis. The rocky hillsides look over the verdant flatland. Kalaat M’gouna is constructed of the same golden earth that fills the mountains, making it stand out amongst the greenery. The floral aroma of roses becomes stronger the closer you get to the town. In the spring, the area is laced with thousands of blossomed small pink roses. Local women stand in the fields and harvest the petals. The women wear colorful djellabas , loose hooded garments with long dangling sleeves. The color of their clothes stands out against the bright pink flowers. The petals are used to perfume creams and lotions. An estimated 2,600 miles of rose hedges fill the region. You reach the walls of Aït Ben Haddou Kasbah, the largest fortress in Morocco, and constructed in the 18th century. The oxidized red stone that make up the town and the walls replaces the swirling pink of the countryside. The mud buildings traipse up the hillside and provide breathtaking views of the surrounding scenery. The corner towers have defended the town from invaders for centuries and now act as a beacon to visitor arriving from far off lands."

Mint and honey linger on the rooftops brewing in the tea. Storytellers provide much sought after tales of Morocco that hearken back to images of flying carpets and clever maidens. The magnificence of Marrakech is in its continued connection to its past. Narrow alleyways wind away from the main square and your private guide escorts you through the city’s notable sites. Vibrant red walls surround the medina and account for Marrakech’s namesake as the “Red City.” Green flitters off of walls, from mosaic artistry to woven textiles. You arrive at the Bahia Palace; an edifice built in the 19th century and considered the grandest citadel of its time. The gardens are set over two acres. Rooms open up into courtyards where trickling fountains provide a cooling mist. The interior palace is embellished from floor to ceiling. The Grand Court is gilded with inlaid woodwork. The Harem overtakes almost 20 acres and contains 150 rooms. Hand woven silk panels and stained glass windows add stunning color to the quarters. The lavish décor of the palace adds to the grandeur of Marrakech and the allure of Morocco."

Tetouan now basks in UNESCO World Heritage status, but it remains off the beaten track. There’s a real authenticity to how little the city has changed. It is also a wonderful city to stroll during the evening, and you can join locals on the squares or dine on food that also has some Spanish character."

While some of the charm that attracted these figures remains, you need an excellent guide to uncover the most impressive places. After a few hours of exploring the city, you will continue down the coast to Asilah. Hanging over the Atlantic Ocean, this is a dreamy place of white walls and blue doors. It looks a little more like Greece than Africa. While Tangier has a few standout sights, Asilah is a better place to stroll around at your leisure."
