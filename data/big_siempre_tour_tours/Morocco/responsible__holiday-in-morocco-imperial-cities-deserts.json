      "title": "Trip starts in Casablanca",
      "description": ": Our tour of Morocco starts in Casablanca, a port city on the country's west coast. Famous for its French colonial architecture and its namesake film, Casablanca has a vibrant metropolitan atmosphere. If you arrive to the city early, there are plenty of sights to keep you occupied. Get a feel for local life over at the Marche Central, where you'll find stalls of fresh produce and street food vendors or take a stroll in Place Mohamed V, Casablanca's central plaza. At 7pm, our tour leader will meet you in the hotel reception for a welcome meeting. If you want to, there'll be the chance to go out for dinner afterwards. If you arrive later, our tour leader will catch you up at a later point. If you want to receive an airport transfer, you'll need to arrive at Casablanca Mohammed V International Airport. The journey from there to our hotel is around 45 minutes."

      "title": "Experience Casablanca and the nations capital, Rabat",
      "description": ": Today starts with a visit to Casablanca's Hassan II Mosque, the 7th largest mosque in the world and the largest on the continent of Africa. Built in honour of the King's 60th birthday, this spectacular mosque is a feat of engineering and can hold an astounding 105,000 worshippers. Sitting right next to the water - to honour the Quran, which states \"the throne of Allah was over the water\" - it's a meeting spot for locals to socialise and, of course, worship. Once we've marvelled at the marble exterior, we'll head inside for a tour. Departing Casablanca, we'll head down the coast to Morocco's capital, Rabat. Established as the country's capital in 1912, by the French, Rabat has a distinct history, which dates as far back as 8BC, when settlers arrived in what is now the Chellah district. We'll explore the city's historic heart with a walking tour around the Hassan Tower and the Mausoleum of Mohammed V before strolling through the Kasbah des Oudaias, finishing up at the Royal Palace."

      "title": "Explore Meknes' ancient history and visit the Roman ruins at Volubilis enroute to Fes",
      "description": ": This morning we continue to Meknes. Once the heart of the Moroccan Sultanate and home to the tyrannical Sultan Moulay Ismail, 1672-1727, Meknes is littered with remnants of its imperial past, which once boasted 20 grand gateways and 50 palaces. We will delve into Meknes' imperial history with a guided tour of the city's major highlights from the old granaries of the Heri es-Souni to the Mausoleum of Moulay Ismail. Despite Ismail's blood lust and unbenevolent lifestyle, the sultan's tomb remains a place of reverence amongst those who see his rule as Morocco's Golden Age. Our tour will also uncover the Bab el Khamis Gate and Bab Mansour, on route to the Place el Hedim, the city's medina. From Meknes, we'll travel 45 minutes to the ruins of Volubilis, an ancient Berber-Roman city which was once the capital of the Kingdom of Mauretania. Here, a local guide will help us to uncover the mosaics found amongst the settlement. Today's final destination is Morocco's cultural capital, Fes. Steeped in history, Fes has played an important part in Moroccan trade, culture, religion, and politics throughout the centuries. We'll arrive at our hotel in time to discover the distinct differences between the old and new towns and explore Fes' culinary offerings."

      "title": "A full day in the imperial city of Fes; explore the medina, Royal Palace and souks",
      "description": ": Today, we have an entire day to explore Fes. After breakfast, we'll take to the artisan capital with a local guide, starting in Fes el Jadid - known as new Fes, despite dating back to the 13th century. We'll drop by the Royal Palace and marvel at the intricately designed exterior - the palace is not open to the public but remains a must-see on any tour of Fes. We'll also stop by the North Borj viewpoint for a panorama of the city from above. After lunch, we'll swap new for old and head into Fes el Bali - also known as old Fes. We'll wander through the bustling souks and artisan alleys, where quaint doorways and narrow paths reveal weavers, brass workers, coppersmiths and tanners, who've been practicing their trade for generations. We'll also take in the opulent 14th-century Attarin Medersa, one of Morocco's most captivating medieval colleges."

      "title": "Drive over the Middle Atlas via Berber villages to the desert settlement of Erfoud",
      "description": ": This morning, we'll set off early and travel south into the dramatic landscapes of the Middle Atlas. First, we'll head towards Immouzer and Ifrane, passing near the small mountain village of Azrou, which translates as 'the rock' in Berber. Up here in their mountain stronghold, the fiercely independent Berbers - the Lords of the Atlas - live by their own traditions. The Berber way of life is unique and lost to most of North Africa - here, music, dance, language, and religion are far removed from the rest of the Arab world. We'll continue into Berber sheep raising country and head towards Timadite and over the Col du Zad, before crossing the Tizi Talghemt Camel Pass and continuing via the Gorge du Ziz to Er Rachidia. Finally, we traverse a broad plateau past Meski Oasis, the so called 'Blue Spring' that borders the arid desert plains. Our last stop for today will be the desert settlement of Erfoud."

      "title": "Drive to Merzouga and camp on the dunes of the Sahara Desert",
      "description": ": Our day starts by following the meandering Ziz River towards Rissani where you'll notice the landscape begin to change as we edge closer to the dramatic dunes of the Sand Sea. The holy city of Rissani is the homeland of the Alaouite dynasty, who reigned in the region for 300 years. This morning, we'll take the opportunity to visit the founder's mausoleum before we explore the local ksour (fortified villages). In the afternoon, we'll continue to Merzouga, a small village on the outskirts of the desert. From here, we'll swap our bus for 4WD vehicles and journey on into the dunes of Erg Chebbi. Our home for tonight is right here in the desert, at a Berber camp, where we can relax by the campfire and fill up on traditional tagine. Our camp is basic but comfortable - the twin share tents are fully equipped with full size single beds with mattresses, blankets, and pillows and there are charging points for phones and cameras. The camp site is right on the edge of the magnificent sand dunes, after a refreshing glass of mint tea you may wish to take a stroll amongst the dunes to witness the sun setting over the Sahara Desert, the light at this time in the late evening casts shadows over the dunes making them a photographers dream. Dinner is served under the stars after which we retire to a campfire. Note that the camp has shared bathroom facilities, showers are simple and hot water and good water pressure aren't guaranteed."

      "description": ": This morning, we'll wake up before dawn to watch the sun rise over the Sahara from the tip of the sand dune. After breakfast, we'll leave the desert by camel over the high sand dunes of Merzouga, a true Moroccan experience. Our route today takes us along the southern slopes of the Atlas to Tinerhir, our base for exploring the towering vistas of the Todra Gorge. We'll have a bit of time to explore the area and wander the lush grounds that line the banks of the Todra River, an oasis of date palms, olive groves and fruit orchards."

      "title": "Witness the beauty of Todra Gorge on a hike",
      "description": ": Today we have an optional walk to Todra Gorge's Abdelali viewpoint. The ochre cliffs of the gorge tower above the narrow pass where the track and river struggle for right of way and Berber women drive their goats up to higher land. We'll follow the main road of the gorge before joining a small mule path, gradually working our way up the ravine to the viewpoint, where we're treated to vistas of the Jebel Sahro range and down into the gorge. Today's trek has been graded as moderate and covers six kilometres. It has an ascent of around 500 metres and a descent of around 550 metres, walking on terrain that is narrow, steep, and rocky in some sections. We recommend wearing walking boots with ankle support. If you don't feel like taking on the trek, you're free to explore the gorge valley floor or take in the scenery from one of the nearby cafes. The dramatic ochre-coloured cliffs of the Todra Gorge rise to leave a narrow pass through which our track and the river struggle for right of way. In the mornings, Berber women drive their goats through the narrow gorge to grazing ground higher up. Today there'll be the opportunity to join our tour leader on an optional walk to Abdelali viewpoint, from where there are excellent panoramas across to the Jebel Sahro and down into the gorge. There are two hiking options, a circular walk which is 10km in length and a hike to a viewpoint at Abdelali and back which is 6km. We usually undertake the 10km hike, however the route is exposed to the elements, so depending on the weather, we might opt for the shorter option. The trek begins in the middle of the narrow gorge following the main road before joining a small mule path going up gradually along a ravine. The path climbs about 500m to a small pass with views looking down the gorge and the Jebel Sahro range. The descent is 550m and is again on a rocky, narrow path that can be steep in some sections. The trek is considered as moderate-to-challenging and in high temperatures it can be more demanding. Walking boots with ankle support are essential. If you don't fancy the hike, you might like to explore the gorge valley floor, following the path of the river, or take in the scenery from one of the nearby cafes."

      "description": ": This morning, we head west to make a short stop in El Kelaa des M'Gouna. Famous for its roses, the town is blanketed by a landscape of scented blooms each spring, which are harvested in the May during the Festival of Roses. The blossoms are used to make rosewater, which is sold throughout the Islamic world. Driving on through the Dades Valley, we enter the Valley of 1000 Kasbahs, an oasis teeming with towns and kasbahs. You'll notice the buildings become more ornate as we travel further along the valley. This afternoon, we'll visit the fortified Berber settlement of Ait Ben Haddou, a UNESCO World Heritage Site widely considered to be one of Morocco's most picturesque spots. You might recognize the commanding crenelated towers from scenes in Jesus of Nazareth and Lawrence of Arabia, which both took advantage of the dramatic setting."

As we wind our way up, you'll notice the sand and stone landscape give way to the hills and deep gorges of the High Atlas Mountains. On our way to our next point, Ouirgane, we'll stop to visit the local market at Tahanoute and the village of Aguersioual, where we'll experience local life, sharing a mint tea with a Berber family. Depending on our arrival time in Ouirgane, we might have time for a short hike around the town."

      "description": ": We have a long drive ahead of us, so we'll be starting early today. Heading west via Marrakech, we'll reach the shores of the Atlantic Ocean and the quaint port town, Essaouira. Set inside 15-century Portuguese fortifications, Essaouira is a charming seaside spot to recoup after a busy few days. We'll aim to arrive mid-afternoon and have the rest of the day free to explore."

      "description": ": This morning our tour leader will help us get our bearings with a brief orientation before we're free to spend the day as we wish, uncovering the colourful coastal town. A day is just enough time to settle into the relaxed but lively way of life here. Head into the old walled medina and the maze of streets lined with craftsmen selling souvenirs from handmade leather belts to jewellery to wooden boxes inlaid with mother of pearl. Outside of the medina, you can take in the Mellah (the old Jewish Quarter) before sinking your feet into the golden sands of the beach and watching as the fishermen return to shore with their day's catch."

      "title": "Drive to Marrakech; tour the highlights of the Red City",
      "description": ": We'll leave the coast behind and head back inland to Marrakech, a few hours' drive away. Once we've arrived in the Red City, we'll take a guided tour to see the highlights, from the rose-coloured Koutoubia 'booksellers' Mosque to the Bahia Palace, famous for its decorated stucco walls and marble floors. We'll fuel up with fresh pastries from a traditional bakery before continuing to the medina. Here, we'll explore the labyrinth of spice-scented souks and the stalls of rugs, leather goods and crockery - to have the true Marrakech experience, you have to get stuck in haggling with the traders! Next, we'll drop by a spice shop and sample dates and almonds before navigating our way out of the souks and into the bustling Jemaa el-Fna Square. Take on the crowds and watch street performers up close, or head up to one of the many roof top bars and see the city from above. To finish off the day, there's an optional trip to a traditional Hammam."

Take in local life wandering past vendors selling everything from doughnuts to fabrics, meander through the maze-like markets, where vendors call out to sell their wares, and enjoy the sounds and scents of the souks. Please remember that many of the mosques will be forbidden to non-Muslims and be careful of photographing people. If you are unsure, always ask first."
