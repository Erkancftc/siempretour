      "description": "Islamabad to Naran via the Jaulian Monastery & Sirkup Old City. Visit Naran Bazaar We leave modern Islamabad this morning and start our drive up into the hills to the north. Our journey takes us along the photogenic, 160km-long Khagan valley, which is embraced by the forested peaks of the lesser Himalayan range. Along the way we visit the Jaulian Monastery and Sirkup Old City. Explore the ruins of Jaulian, a Buddhist monastery, and imagine the serene lives of monks who once resided there. Finally, walk among the relics of Sirkup, a bustling city from the Kushan era, picturing its grand streets and marketplaces Naran is one of Pakistan's most popular summer holiday spots and is famous for its colourful panorama.

      "description": "Cross the Babussar Pass. Hike to Fairy Meadows Prepare for some serious hairpin bends today as the road climbs up to the Babussar Pass (4175m) and then descends again towards Chilas, situated on the banks of the mighty Indus River. En-route we'll stop for a break at Lalusar Lake. We continue up the Karakorum Highway to Raikot Bridge (2300m) and then follow a narrow jeep track to Tato village. The track clings to the side of the mountain with steep drops below and we'll be thankful for our experienced driver! We leave the vehicles at Jhel Village there and take a 2-3 hour/5km trek to Fairy Meadows (3300m). This is a strenuous uphill walk, which includes a gradual climb for most of the route, with one steep final section of around 30 minutes (total elevation gain around 650m). Horses can be hired locally for around 3000Rs per person (approx. GBP 13 / USD 18) if you don't want to walk up. This a legendary place, well named by German climbers, and has an unsurpassed view of Nanga Parbat (8125m). OVERNIGHT"

      "description": "Free time or treks in the mountains around Fairy Meadows Fairy Meadows (3300m) is one of the most picturesque places in the world, and the start of some fantastic mountain trekking routes. There are two options today. The easier choice is a 2-3 hour trek through dense prime forest, and then through birch trees and along shallow streams up to Beyal Camp (3500m). This is a summer settlement for the local shepherds and has stunning views of Nanga Parbat. An easy walk takes you back down to Fairy Meadows to enjoy a camp fire after dinner. The other, tougher option is continue on from Beyal Camp for another 3 to 4 hours to reach Nanga Parbat Base Camp (3967m, 500m ascent). Suitable for fit, and experienced trekkers, this is an 8 to 9 hour round trip, but well worth it if you're up for it, For those preferring a more relaxed pace, Fairy Meadows is a good location for a relaxed stroll, or wildlife spotting; keep your eyes peeled for marmots, Himalayan ibex, and colorful birds. The remote location of Fairy Meadows makes it a perfect spot for star gazing at night. OVERNIGHT"

      "description": "Hike down to Tato, drive to Tarashing We'll leave Fairy Meadows reluctantly this morning and after breakfast hike back down to Tato (approx. 1 1/2 to 2 hours), pick up our vehicles again, and then drive on to Tarashing, through the magnificent, pine forested Astore Valley which feels reminiscent of Austrian scenes (around 3 to 4 hours drive). The roads become smaller and narrower and eventually we reach the remote village of Tarashing, the last village at the head of the jeep road towards the Rupal face of Nanga Parbat. The village is watered by Tarashing Glacier which follows the route to the base camp. The fields around the village offer picturesque scenery and the flower blossom in summer is superb. OVERNIGHT"

      "description": "Hike to Nanga Parbat-Herrligkoffer Base Camp We have another stunning mountain trek today. We'll start by driving from Tarashing (2911m) into the the Rupal Valley, following the Tarashing (or Chhungphar) glacier's lateral moraine before crossing it and continuing to Rupal Village. From there we hike through small settlements and past herds of yaks and cattle to the Herrligkoffer Base Camp (3550m) at the foot of Nanga Parbat. The camp site is named after a German mountaineer, Karl Herrligkoffer, who led the first successful expedition to reach the peak of Nanga Parbat in 1953. The overal trek is around 8km, taking around 4 hours. Back at Tarashing, there will be free time in the village to chat to friendly locals and see how life is lived in these remote areas where the glacial water supply is vital and ever decreasing.

      "description": "To Skardu via Desosai National Park Our route today takes us through the Deosai National Park. These plains are a contrast to the steep valleys we've traversed so far, and lie between the Indus River and the souther extension of the Himalayas. The altitude averages 3800m, and the undulating green, flower-filled meadows are surrounded by snow capped peaks. Fresh water lakes abound, helping to make this seldom disturbed area a haven for wildlife, including Brown Bear and Markhor. After driving across the plains, we continue to Skardu, the capital of the Baltistan region. Known as 'Little Tibet', this area has one of the highest clusters of mountains in the world, and has ancient ties with nearby TIbet. We'll break the journey to Skardu at the beautiful Satpura Lake, another large lake at the foot of the plains, and visit the Manthal Buddha, a large granite rock into which a picture of Buddha has been engraved, probably sometime in the 8th century. This is one of the most important relics of Buddhism in the Skardu region. OVERNIGHT"

      "description": "DAY trip to the Shigar Valley We take a day trip from Skardu to the fertile Shigar Valley today. We'll cross the Indus River, and head up the Shigar River which is surrounded by wide flat sand banks, deposited when the water levels are high. The lush green valley is a great contrast, and is well known for its fruit orchards. Shigar is inhabited mostly by Balti people of Tibetan descent, and has many historical buildings of architectural significance associated with the Noorbakhshi Sufi community. We'll visit the Amborik Mosque, and have lunch at Shigar Fort. After returning to Skardu we can take a late afternoon hike to Khorpocho Fort, built in the 8th century on a hill overlooking Skardu. The main fort was destroyed in 1840, though the impressive boundary walls remain. OVERNIGHT"

      "description": "Skardu to Gilgit via Katchura Lake After breakfast we'll drive back to the main Karakorum Highway and the town of Gilgit. The road hugs the banks of the Indus river all the way, and we can see various stretches of white water rapids. We'll make a stop on the way at the Katchura Lakes, and look out for the local wild apricot trees. Gilgit is an important town, and was part of the Kushan Empire in teh 1st to 3rd centuries. Buddhism persisted after the Kushan demise, though few traces remain - one being the Kargah Buddha, a rock wall carved in the 7th century. Gilgit is surrounded by high peaks, the most impressive being Rakaposhi (7,788m). We'll arrive in time to visit the old British cemetery and the lively and eclectic bazaar. If we're lucky we may be able to see a Polo match; Polo is extemely popular through the region and matches between neighbouring towns happen throughout the summer. OVERNIGHT"

      "description": "Hunza Valley, Borith Lake, Passu Glacier View We drive north again today on the newly reconstructed Karakorum Highway. Passing under the shadow of Rakaposhi, our two hour journey leads us to the former kingdom of Hunza, called “the epitome of mountain grandeur” by Eric Shipton. It is a fairy tale land surrounded by beautiful rugged & snow capped mountains; including Ultar (7,388m), Lady Finger (6000m), Diran (7,266m) and Rakaposhi (7,788m). In the Upper Hunza Valley, we'll take a walk for around two hours from Borith Lake (2600m), up to a stunning viewpoint alongside the huge Passu Glacier. The saline waters are supposed to be good for the skin, and many people take a dip here in the summer months. The site is also an important sanctuary for migrating wildfowl. From the glacier, a path leads back down to the Karakorum Highway. We'll return to our hotel and there feast on some of the best food of the trip with both Indian and Chinese influences creating mouth watering dishes. OVERNIGHT"

      "description": "Passu to Karimabad A short drive and walk after breakfast this morning brings us to the world famous Hussaini Suspension Bridge. Considered the second longest man made hanging bridge in the world, this stretches for several hundred metres across the Hunza River, with widely spaced wooden boards and a few wire ropes being all that is between you and the rushing river below. Take care if you want to cross it! We'll then follow the river downstream and visit Gulmit village, Pamiri Musical School, a local museum and discover the KORGAH weaving center, where traditional craftsmanship meets modern social impact. This center supports women artisans in rural Pakistan, empowering them through the creation of beautiful, hand-woven textiles. Witness skilled weavers at work, learn about their ancient techniques, and perhaps even take home a unique piece that carries with it a story of sustainability and female empowerment. In Karimabad, the main town of the Hunza Valley, we'll visit the Baltit Fort which was the old palace of the Mirs of Hunza. About 700 years old, the Baltit Fort sits on the edge of a cliff with a ravine below and the Ultar glacier in the distance. OVERNIGHT"

      "description": "Altit Fort & Village, Duikar viewpoint We'll take a walk around Karimabad this morning, following the main water channels. We can also visit the bazaar in Karimabad and if we're lucky, watch a polo match in the town. We'll also visit Altit Fort and Altit village. Like Baltit Fort, Tibetan architectural traditions are much in evidence. The fort is around 900 years old and has a splendid defensive position overlooking the Hunza river valley, and it also served as the home of the MIr of Hunza before the set of power moved to nearby Baltit (now Karimabad). We'll also visit the CIQAM Project today - The CIQAM project is a remarkable initiative focused on empowering marginalized communities in the Hunza Valley of Pakistan. The project combines traditional craftsmanship with capacity building and skills training. CIQAM supports local artisans, especially women, in preserving their heritage while creating sustainable economic opportunities. The project encompasses textiles, woodwork, and other traditional crafts, highlighting the rich cultural tapestry of the region. Late in the afternoon we'll drive up to the small village of Duikar (approx. 3000m) to enjoy a panoramic view of the Hunza Valley at sunset. OVERNIGHT"

      "description": "Karakorum Highway to Besham or Naran We have a long drive back down the Karakorum Highway today, enjoying a different perspective to the mountain views we saw on the way up. Heading to Gilgit, we'll see the jnction of the three highest mountain ranges in the world, the Himalay, Karakorum and the Hindu Kush. Along the way, we'll make a stop near Chilas at Shatial to see the Petroglyphs there. An important historical crossroads, many Buddhist missionaries, pilgrims, Sogdian merchants and traders passed through Shatial and left inscriptions and grafitti on the rocks. Over 700 petroglyphs and 1000 inscriptions in more than ten languages can be found at the Shatial bridge across the Indus River. Depending on the weather, road and local security conditions, we have the option of following the original Karakorum Highway and taking the Westerly route through the mighty Indus Valley to Besham where we spend the night. This road follows the Indus for most of the rest of the day and travels through steep gorges, beneath high rock walls with the river rushing below us. Alternatively we will return via Barbusar Pass route, travelling through the Kaghan Valley again to overnight in Naran. OVERNIGHT"

      "description": "Return to Islamabad via Taxila Our final descent out of the mountains today crosses low lying hills on twisting roads to reach the 'Grand Trunk Road', built orginally by the British to link Peshawa in the West to Calcutta in the East. We'll stop on the way at Taxila, once an important seat of Oriental culture. First mentioned as a satrapy of the Archemenian empire in the 6th century BC, Taxila was later invaded by Alexander the Great and passed through the hands of various different rulers before being controlled by Ashoka the Great who focussed the city into an important centre of learning. Taxila remained an important place for philsophy, art and learning through the creative Gandhara period and on until the 5th century C.E. We will finish the day and our trip with a walking tour through the Raja Bazaar in Rawalpindi, which sits adjacent to Islamabad. This old bazaar bustles with life and a stop in the silver and gold bazaars will allow us to watch traditional craftsmen at work, as well as perhaps pick up a final souvenir of our time in Pakistan.
