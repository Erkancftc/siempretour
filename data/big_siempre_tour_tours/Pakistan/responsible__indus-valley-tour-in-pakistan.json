  "generalInfo": "This small group tour is created by experts with superb on-the-ground connections. Accompanied by guides with in-depth knowledge of their subjects, you’ll explore UNESCO World Heritage Sites such as the Mughal-era Shalimar Gardens in Lahore and the salt mines of Khewra, which date back to the time of Alexander the Great. You will tour Mohenjo-daro, one of the greatest archaeological treasures in Pakistan, hear stories of mystics and holy men as you wander Multan, take a boat trip to islands where Indus river dolphins swim, and visit the vast Sukkur Barrage, built during the British colonial era.<br/><br/>There’s more: immense necropolises, early Islamic cemeteries where countless thousands were laid to rest in elaborate settings, and vast desert forts that no-one is quite sure what they were built to defend. You’ll also get the chance to compare and contrast the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi.<br/><br/>Wherever possible, you’ll stay in locally owned accommodation, eat in small restaurants where guides can help translate the menu and recommend the best dishes, and pause regularly in neighbourhood tea houses. <br/><br/>This two-week Pakistan tour is a snapshot of the country’s past and present, designed by our experienced cultural tour specialists. It is also a fantastic way to spread the benefits of responsible tourism to remote communities that see few foreign visitors, and are all the more welcoming for it.<br/>",
