      "description": "Bienvenidos! Welcome to Lima, Peru’s capital and one of South America’s most charming cities. As there's little time spent here but so much on offer, you and your family may like to arrive a few days early to see all the sights, including the chic suburb of Miraflores, Central Park and Lovers' Park. Maybe check out some of the many museums or take a short trip out of town to visit Pachacamac, an impressive archaeological site. On the first day of your trip there’s a welcome meeting at the hotel at 5 pm, after which you can get to know the other families and your leader over an optional dinner at a nearby restaurant."

      "description": "Take a flight to Puerto Maldonado via Cusco this morning, where the mighty Amazon Jungle awaits. Hop in a motorised canoe and head upriver to your jungle lodge in the Madre de Dios area – don't forget to look out for wildlife along the way! After checking into your accommodation, join your leader for a short walk through the jungle to your traditional Amazonian archery lesson. There, you'll discover how the local indigenous community craft and use their bow and arrow. You and your family can have a go at hitting the targets before heading back to the lodge for a hearty dinner. After dark we'll return to the river by boat in search of caimans and other nocturnal creatures."

      "description": "Start the day with a big breakfast before embarking on a hike through the jungle to Tres Chimbadas Lake. Look out for colourful macaws, hoatzins, monkeys and black alligators. If you’re lucky, you might even catch a glimpse of an endangered river wolf (otter)! Head back to the lodge for a rest, play and some lunch. This afternoon you'll visit a traditional medicine garden where the shaman of the community will introduce you to some plants used for healing. You and your family will have the opportunity to go to the laboratory and observe how the medicines are prepared. After dinner tonight your leader will take you on a walking tour in search of insects, amphibians, tarantulas, bats, birds and (the shy) armadillo. Listen out for the sounds of the jungle and notice the stars peeking through the trees."

Tonight's plans are up to you. You might like to take a walk around the delightful old city, visiting the Inca walls of the Plaza de Armas or some of the many fine churches around town, or grab dinner and relax with your new friends. Whatever you choose, be sure to take it slow as you adjust to the city's high altitude (3450 m)."

      "description": "Take an orientation walk through the city with your leader this morning. Along the way you'll meet up with a local musician who will show you and your family around San Blas, the artisans’ neighbourhood. Learn about the significance of music and art in Peruvian culture and history, visit their home and have a go at playing traditional drums, strings and wind instruments. You'll also be shown how to make and play your own zampona, a traditional panpipe, which you can take home with you. The rest of the day is yours to explore. Perhaps head to the local market and pick up some pastries for a picnic lunch. Or, if you're keen to brush up on your knowledge of Peruvian history before visiting Machu Picchu, why not check out some of Cusco’s excellent museums? You'll have a full Boleto Turistico (tourist ticket) which means you can access the best attractions in town. If you're still feeling adventurous you might like to climb to the top of the Inca Pachacuti Statue and enjoy the city views."

      "description": "This morning, drive through the Sacred Valley. Known as Wilcamayo to the Incas, the valley has been a source of livelihood for the locals for hundreds of years. You’ll see maize crops covering the terraced walls and the sacred river beneath. Stop in at the Andean community of Ocotuan, located near the beautiful Piuray lagoon. There, you’ll learn about traditional textile techniques and how local women are using them to support their families. Your kids will also be able to feed llamas, alpacas and guinea pigs. Sit down for a lunch with the community, then continue to the Maras Salt Ponds, where Inca built terraces to harvest the salt from the springs. Next is a stop at Moray, where Inca built huge circular terraces to plant different crops at the optimum altitude. Finally, continue to the town of Ollantaytambo. To finish off the day’s adventures, you might like to check out the town’s fascinating archaeological site?– ancient remnants of an Inca city with views over the present-day settlement."

      "title": "Ollantaytambo.",
      "description": "Start early this morning and board a train towards Aguas Calientes, a modern town in the cloud forest at the foot of Machu Picchu. The train ride will offer some unbelievable views of the Andean scenery. Then, take a short bus ride up the winding road to Machu Picchu. The ‘Lost City of the Incas’ was built around 1440 AD as a country retreat for Inca nobility, but there’s evidence that the land had been a sacred Inca site for much longer. It’s true purpose may always be a mystery since no records of the complex exist. Explore with your family around the site with a local guide learning more about these 200 or so houses and temples. Catch the bus back into Aguas Calientes and enjoy some spare time to have lunch and a look around. Then later, board the train back to Ollantaytambo and perhaps join your group for an optional dinner."

Or, you could simply take the time to sit back and relax. Later, you might like to join your group for an optional farewell dinner."
