  "generalInfo": "This trip takes you to the mystical south of Peru - a fascinating country with a great variety of landscapes and ecosystems, and a rich heritage of pre-colombian culture hidden in the mountains or deserted plains. <br/><br/>The south of Peru is an area in Latin America with a different energy &amp; vibration. The Andes &amp; Indian people show and teach us something that is very worthwhile to experience. The people, the spiritual heritage of their ancestors, and the places you visit, will make this a special journey.<br/><br/>You will visit the high sanddunes of Ica with amazing views over the area and stay in a desert oasis, at nearby NP Paracas you will see the large colonies of birds and sealions in Islas Ballestas. You visit the mysterious geometrical figures and lines of Nazca and explore one of the deepest canyons of the world, the Colca canyon, for several days. This trip takes you to Lake Titicaca and the inspiring city of Cusco, from where we offer several possibilities for trekking or daywalks. You can choose among others between the Inca trail, Lares and Salkantay trekkings or other trails, and/or opt for a rainforest extension in the National Park of Manu or Tambopata Reserve near Puerto Maldonado. At the end of the trip you can have either free days in Cusco extra, to immerse yourself in citylife, go for shopping, or see more of the Sacred Valley, eg have a mountain bike excursion to Chincheros, Maras &amp; Moray, visit the Inca temples of Pisaq &amp; Qenko, visit a social children project in or around Cusco, or fly back directly from Puerto Maldonado after a rainforest extension to Lima.<br/><br/>Besides individual tailor made tours we offer also our Tourguide services to small organised groups, the itinery may include all elements your group is looking for, daywalks, cultural excursions, visits to archaeological sites, the Inca trail, other trails, rainforest extensions etc. You will be accompanied by an expert on Andean nature &amp; culture. We invite you to have a direct Skype conference with your Tourguide and ask all the questions you have ! Your Tourmanager is internationally certified, every year trained in first aid, has guided 140 grouptrips, is educated as a westerner in an Indian lineage, one of the most knowledgeable guides in Latin America and last but not least very good company.<br/><br/>Example itinerary - Roundtrip South Peru. Note that with the Inca trail included the trip becomes 20 days instead of 18 days and you still have 2 free days in Cusco at end for optional excursions or free time. All transfers &amp; bus tickets will be arranged in advance for you by our agent in Lima and reservations for the Inca trail have to be confirmed 4-5 months ahead in high season. The accommodation is 3-4 star Peruvian hotels, all selected for a spectacular view or a specific setting &amp; ambience. If you wish to stay for a few days in more luxurious hotels, eg in Cusco, we can adapt that to your wishes. The itinerary below can be modified to your personal wishes including departure date, duration, accommodation used &amp; how long you spend in each destination. <br/><br/>The Inca Trail, permits &amp; alternatives: the classical 4 day Inca Trail to Machu Picchu is one of the most famous treks in the world. The appeal of this particular trek is the stunning combination of Inca ruins, magnificent mountains, exotic vegetation and extraordinary ecological variety. The trail goes over high passes with unforgettable views, through cloud forest, and finally into subtropical vegetation. After the trail you can choose to return to Ollantaytambo on day 4 and stay overnight there, to continue to Cusco, or stay one night longer in Aguas Calientes and return on the 5th day - giving more time to explore Machu Picchu, the hot baths of Aquas Calientes, climb the mountain Putu Kusi and visit the waterfalls &amp; botanical garden Mandor in the surrounding area. On contacting us we can check directly the Inca Trail permit availability for you. Note that the rain season may start in December, lasts until end of March and that the Inca trail is closed in the month February. In case the classical Inca trail is fully booked there are several alternative trails possible, as the 4 day Lares trail or the Salkantay Inca trail which leads you in 5 days to Aquas Calientes beneath Machu Picchu without the requirement of a permit. Besides there is a short Inca trail program of 2 days called the Camino Real which requires a permit same as the classical Inca trail. <br/><br/>More trekkings and trails we offer are the Ausangate trekking in 4 to 5 days, the Ausangate Sibinacocha trekking in 7 to 8 days, the classical Choquequirao trekking, the Juchujqosqo trek from 2-3 days from Tambomachay to Calca, Alpamayo, Cordillera Blanca &amp; Cordillera Huayhuash treks and a few more new trails. The most challenging Inca trekking we can offer is from Cachora to Choquequirao and from there continue via Yanama to the Inca site Vitcos (Yurak Rumi, described as White Rock by Hiram Bingham) in the Vilcabamba valley from where you continue through the mountains and rainforest to Santa Theresa and Machu Picchu.<br/><br/>Extra daywalks in the Colca canyon: in case you wish to make extra daywaks on your own in the Colca canyon we supply the GPS data of three possible daywalks of different level as part of a tailor made booking. In case you wish to walk with a private guide you can make a short trekking of eg 3-4 days from Cruz del Condor to the bottom of the canyon, stay in a lovely green oasis with swimming pool on the third day and return to Cabanaconde the last day. There is also a trekking possible from Colca canyon to Cusco, just for those that have time enough and like to be fully off the beaten path with an extra challenge.<br/><br/>Rainforest extensions: Rainforest extensions can be arranged to Manu National Park (5-9 days) or to Tambopata National Reserve (3-5 days of which one day can be at camp), both including visits to macaw clay licks. <br/><br/>Approximately half the area of Switzerland, the Manu Biosphere is a complete ecosystem with protected watershed embracing Andean montane cloud forest, tropical lowland forest and the Alto Madre de Dios and Manu river drainage systems. Wildlife abundance aside, the journey into the park itself is amazingly spectacular and not to be missed. The two day trip from Cusco takes you over the Andes to an elevation of 4000m, past pre-inca ruins, down through the cloud forest and finally into lush, lowland rainforest. <br/><br/>The Tambopata National Reserve in situated in the province of Madre-de-Dios and is more easily accesible then Manu NP. Within walking distance of the lodge lies a tranquil oxbow lake formerly part of the river Tambopata. The undisturbed and thriving ecosystem here means that the lake can support a family of giant river otters along with other endangered species such as black caimans. Bird life is also prolific; with a record breaking 620 species being recorded in the area surrounding the lodge, you will not cease to be amazed by the variety and colors. <br/><br/>Family holidays: This tour can be tailormade to suit the needs of a family, taking in to account the ages of any children. For example, we could reduce the travelling, and stay longer in individual destinations such as Cusco &amp; Lake Titicaca. Children will love the experience to be in the Peruvian rainforest, which can be added to the travel, leaving from Cusco. For families with kids (or any travelparty) we can turn around this sample itinery and start with Cusco to have a better adaptation to altitude, from there to Titicaca lake and continue with a private guided program into Colca canyon, stay in Cabanaconde, Granja del Colca and pass the highest pass Mirador de los Volcanes at a stage that everyone is well adapted. This has been proven to work out well for families, ask for more information.<br/><br/>The Inca jungle Trail from Cusco to Machu Picchu is a new route which involves biking from Abra Malaga to Santa Marta, walking on 2 newly discovered Inca trails and the highest zipline of South America. The multiple terrain trip, includes recently discovered real Inca paths, archaeological ruins, an 60 km bike downhill on mountain bikes, through the mountains from Abra Malaga to the green valleys below and the jungle base of Santa Maria. On the third day you reach the top of Llactapata with amazing views, flanked by the high peak of the Salkantay. The fourth day, after three nights the trip ends with going up to Machu Picchu and enjoy the sunrise. You return to Cusco by train and bus.<br/><br/>Galapagos extension &amp; Ecuador: For those who have the time and budget, your Peru roundtrip can be given a final touch with a spectacular Galapagos cruise of several days at the end. You have cruises of 4, 5, 7 and 8 days up to full itineries visiting all islands in 15 days. There is a wide range in boats with different comfort classes and style. We help you selecting the right boat on the right time within your budget with all connecting flights from Lima to Guayaguil or Quito to make this one in a lifetime experience come true. For a family booking we can give discounts on Galapagos excursions. A few extra days in Quito and surroundings can be added of course as well.<br/><br/>We have more than 200 independent reviews on Responsible Travel on our destinations in Latin America from Cuba, Bolivia, Brazil, Peru, Mexico, Colombia to Chile and Argentina.
