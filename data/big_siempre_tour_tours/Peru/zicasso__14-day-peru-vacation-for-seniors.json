      "description": "As your plane glides to a halt at the Jorge Chávez International Airport, you will be met by private transport and escorted to your luxury hotel in the heart of Lima. Frenzied traffic will ebb and flow as eager taxi drivers sound their horns and effortlessly maneuver around stalled cars. Locals will stroll down beautiful landscapes of green public parks along Peru's sparkling Pacific coastlines, and other pedestrians may follow the tantalizing aromas of freshly grilled anticuchos skewers , which are marinated in vinegar and garlic spices. You will bump along the cobbled streets of post-colonial downtown until the glimmering white skyscrapers of Lima's opulent Miraflores neighborhood begin to emerge. Soon, you will arrive at your luxury accommodation and be welcomed by the friendly hotel staff. Once you have had time to settle in, you will step out of your hotel for some self-guided, city exploration. You can meander down the alluring coastlines and dig your toes into the soft, sandy beaches at the water's edge. Then, you can choose from a number of fine dining options with sun-kissed patios that overlook the water. Finally, you can cheers to an unforgettable two weeks in Peru with the country's own pisco sour , which is a smooth, frothy liqueur. At sunset, you can amble through Parque del Amor where light, coastal breezes may waft through the air as acoustic duets strum romantic melodies in the distance.

Hundreds of years ago, as the Inca Empire took siege of most of central and southern Peru, the Uros people were ousted and forced to relocate in the Puno region. Rather than build their homes at the Lake's edge, the locals built floating islands that were made from extensive layers of woven reeds at the center of the Lake. You can step foot on the floating islands for a tour of these carefully engineered dwellings, and you can sit in on a reed-weaving demonstration and buy local handicrafts and souvenirs from the Uros people. In the evening, your guide will accompany you to a beautiful outdoor dinner that features the Lake's famous trout as the sun falls in the sky, and a red-orange hued horizon takes center stage."

Travelers who opt not to participate in the hike will have additional time at the base of the ruins to explore and gain deeper insight into cultural and historical nuances.
