      "title": "Join trip in Lima",
      "description": ": Our trip starts today in Lima, Peru's capital, which was founded in 1535 AD by the Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro. The modern cosmopolitan city is littered with reminders of its colonial and pre-Hispanic past, particularly in the historical centre. Located on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, you can easily escape the busy traffic of the city for a little calm on nearby coastal walking paths. For those arriving in time, our tour leader plans to meet you in the hotel reception at 7.30pm for a welcome meeting and for those that wish, there'll be the chance to go out for dinner. There are no other activities planned today, so you're free to arrive in Lima at any time. If you'd like an airport transfer today, you'll need to arrive into Lima's Jorge Chavez International Airport (LIM) which is approximately a one-hour drive from our hotel. Should you miss the welcome meeting, your tour leader will inform you of any essential information as soon as you catch up. If your flight arrives earlier in the day, you might like to take an independent stroll along the coastal path to Miraflores and through the bohemian district of Barranco. Alternatively, you could visit the Larco Museum for an introduction to Peru's ancient history. The city is also gaining a reputation as a culinary centre, so why not try some ceviche (fish marinated in citrus juices) or sip on a pisco sour?"

      "title": "Public bus to Nazca",
      "description": ": Departing Lima early this morning, we'll board a modern public coach south, following the Pacific coastline before turning towards the fertile mountain valleys that lie around the town of Nazca. The journey is around seven hours and takes us through some of the driest desert regions on earth. We'll pass through the winegrowing landscapes of the Ica Valley, a region that produces some excellent vintage, as well as Peru's distinctive local tipple, pisco, a particularly potent mix made from the white grape. Our final destination for today is the oasis town of Nazca, lying in the shadow of Cerro Blanco, which, at over 2,000 metres, is the highest dune on earth. We'll arrive in the early afternoon and the rest of the day is free to relax or explore Nazca."

      "title": "In Nazca; optional view of Nazca Lines from viewing platform or Chauchilla pre-Inca cemetery, overnight bus to Arequipa",
      "description": ": We'll spend today getting to know Nazca. Some specialists have speculated that the Nazca Lines represent the world's largest astrological calendar. Huge birds, spiders, whales, other creatures and geometrical figures are represented in outline. There are several options for you today. You have the opportunity to climb nearby viewing platforms to look out over the lines etched into the desert. Or you could visit the nearby Antonini Archaeological Museum, the Chauchilla pre-Inca cemetery or the Nazca aqueduct. Alternatively, you could do a full-day tour of the area with a local guide, including all of the above, along with the historical Acueductus de Cantalloc, the Inca ruin of Los Paradones and a local pottery workshop. Please note that for safety reasons, neither we nor our tour leader can assist with booking any flights over the Nazca Lines. After dinner today, we'll board the coach for our overnight journey, continuing south through the night towards the city of Arequipa and the volcanic landscapes of the Andean Mountains. Our coach is modern, with good-sized reclining seats and TVs on board, as well as a well-maintained toilet."

      "title": "Arrive in Arequipa, free afternoon for sightseeing",
      "description": ": We'll arrive in Arequipa this morning at around 9am. This beautiful city is located at the foot of the volcanic slopes of El Misti, a perfect conical peak that rises to 5,822 metres above this grand colonial city. The city itself was founded by the Spanish in 1540, on the site of an old Inca settlement, and today is famed for its colonial architecture, including what is arguably one of the finest city squares anywhere in the Americas. We'll transfer to our hotel before having the day free to explore at our own pace. You could take in the elegance of the Plaza de Armas and its immense twin-towered cathedral, or you might like to visit the striking 17th-century churches of La Compania and San Agustin and the colonial grandeur of Casa de Moras. You can also pay a visit to the extraordinary Santa Catalina Convent, a miniature walled town in the heart of the city, which once housed 450 nuns and serving ladies in total seclusion for nearly four centuries. Riddled with a network of cobbled streets and lavishly restored with period furnishings and beautifully ornate touches, the convent is, without doubt, one of the highlights of any visit to the city. Other recommended sights are the old university and the archaeological museum, which has a collection of ceramics and mummies dating back to Inca and pre-Inca civilisations. Otherwise, you may choose to take a seat at one of the cafes overlooking the main square and watch the comings and goings."

      "title": "Travel to Chivay, optional hot springs",
      "description": ": After breakfast today we'll travel to Chivay by private bus. The journey takes around six hours and brings us into the world of the Altiplano, passing behind the volcanoes that ring Arequipa and on to Chivay. There are herds of llamas and alpacas en route, and if we're lucky, we might even spot the elusive vicuna. We'll cross the Patapampa Pass with a brief stop at the trip's highest point (4,910 metres/16,108 feet) before beginning our descent to the town of Chivay. On arrival, we'll have a late lunch and the afternoon is free - you might like to indulge with a dip in the hot springs."

      "title": "Visit the Colca Canyon, continue to Puno",
      "description": ": We'll have an early start this morning as we head to the Colca Canyon. A spectacular river gorge, the Colca Canyon measures twice the depth of the more famous Grand Canyon and at one time it was believed to be the deepest gorge on earth (until it was eclipsed by the deeper Cotahuasi Canyon). Today it allows us to discover a world of Andean villages and Inca terraces that make up one of the most outstanding natural settings in the Americas. We'll spend some time here at the Cruz del Condor viewpoint, searching for a sighting of the majestic birds flying over the canyon. This afternoon, we'll drive east, via the Patapampa Pass again at 4,910 metres/16,108 feet, heading towards the beautiful landscapes that surround the unique waters of Lake Titicaca, the highest navigable lake in the world. Our destination is the town of Puno, a centre of Incan folklore nestling in a bay at the northwestern tip of the lake and the perfect base from which to explore the cultural and historical significance of the lake itself."

      "title": "Boat trip on Lake Titicaca, visit Uros Islands and overnight on Taquile Island",
      "description": ": From Puno, we'll take a boat trip on Lake Titicaca to explore the floating reed islands, home to the Uros people who live on the lake itself. Their islands are made from totura, a reed-like papyrus that grows in the shallows and is used in most aspects of their life, including the construction of their boats and homes. We'll then continue to the lesser-visited island of Taquile which has preserved much of its Inca and pre-Inca heritage. Here, the islanders still speak the language of the Inca - Runa Simi or Quechua. We'll have approximately a twenty minute walk to our guesthouse from the dock, and this evening there will be the option to take a longer walk on the island for those who wish."

      "title": "Morning on Taquile Island, afternoon return to Puno",
      "description": ": This morning is free on Taquile Island. You might like to take a walk up to the Inca ruins, or visit the market and buy some of the locally-made embroidery. Later this afternoon, we'll return to Puno with a three hour boat journey, where the afternoon is free to take a stroll through the markets in search of llama and alpaca wool items."

      "title": "Public bus to Cusco",
      "description": ": Today we'll follow the legendary route taken by the first Inca ruler, Manco Capac, on his way to find Cusco. Rising early, we'll head to the public bus terminal where our coach awaits us. During the ten-hour bus trip, we'll make several stops including at the small market town of La Raya, and the Inca ruin of the Temple of Wiracocha in Raqchi. The landscape is desolate and magnificent, and we might even pass flocks of llamas and alpacas grazing among the windswept meadows. Traversing the northern extremes of the Altiplano, we'll cross the La Raya pass (4,321 metres) and the continental divide, before beginning the descent towards Cusco along the Rio Vilcanota. We'll arrive into the city in the late afternoon and check into our hotel. There's also the possibility today to take the classic rail journey from Puno to Cusco (optional). One of the great railway journeys of the world, this full-day trip traverses spectacular landscapes over the high altiplano. It includes a meal aboard the train, with the chance to try local delicacies, make use of the outside viewing platform and enjoy some traditional entertainment before arriving into Cusco. Please note that rail strikes are common in Peru so there's a chance that the train may not always be running. In the event that you've chosen to take the train and it's not operating, we'll make the journey from Puno to Cusco by bus, with the rest of the group. Refunds for trains cancelled due to strike action are at the discretion of the train line."

      "title": "Orientation tour of Cusco, rest of the day free",
      "description": ": This charming half-day walking tour of Cusco offers history, culture and art. The Main Square is a must, where we will see the colonial architecture that remains intact to this day, standing on the foundation stones of old Inca walls. Entering Cusco's main Plaza de Armas, the focal point of the city, we're welcomed by the baristas of Three Monkeys Coffee who serve us the finest Peruvian beans. Once revived, we'll continue walking, gazing upon the Qoricancha complex, once the Inca's most sacred site dedicated to the Sun God. The route will take us uphill through beautiful narrow streets to San Blas, the city's bohemian neighborhood, known for being home to local artists' craft workshops. It's the perfect place to shop and take something special of this magical city with us! Our final destination is Mercado de Wanchaq, a local hot spot jammed with rows of colourful stalls and filled with the aromas of seasonal fruit. Slurping freshly pressed juice, we'll watch the sellers hawking their wares before returning to the hotel."

      "title": "Train to Aguas Calientes, visit Machu Picchu",
      "description": ": This morning we'll transfer to the railway station to catch the train to Aguas Calientes, our gateway to one of the greatest of all archaeological sites. The train slowly meanders down the valley, following the tumultuous waters of the Urubamba River through a series of rock-cut tunnels before emerging at the small town of Aguas Calientes, serenely nestled amidst a lush landscape of cloud forests. From here, we'll take a public bus up to the mountain complex of Machu Picchu, the fabled lost city of the Incas and probably the most spectacular feat of engineering in ancient America. We'll have approximately a three-hour guided visit of this magnificent city with our tour leader and a licenced and experienced guide. Temples, stairways, palaces and gabled stone dwellings are scattered everywhere, testifying to the energy and ingenuity of the builders. After our visit, we'll head to our simple hotel in Aguas Calientes. This evening, we'll have the opportunity to relax in the local thermal pools."

      "title": "More time to discover Machu Picchu (optional), train back to Cusco",
      "description": ": This morning is free for you to either relax in Aguas Calientes, or to explore Machu Picchu more. There are several optional ways that you might like to choose from - each one requires an additional permit that should be pre-paid at the time of booking. The first option is to revisit the site, giving you another chance to explore (unguided) at your own pace. There are one-way circuits in place in the site, and typically this will be following the same route as taken the previous day. Alternatively, there are a number of alternative circuits to follow, exploring either the upper terraces or the lower royal circuits. For keen walkers and those with a head for heights, it's also possible to climb either Machu Picchu Mountain or Huayna Picchu. For more information on the different circuits, please see the bottom of this page. These options must be pre-paid at the time of booking, and if you change your passport between your time of booking and prior to travel please bring your original passport with you. A final option is to simply relax in Aguas Calientes - it's a fantastic little town with a great market, excellent cafes and a laidback vibe. Later, we'll take the afternoon train to Ollantaytambo, from where we'll get the bus to Cusco."

      "title": "Free day in Cusco; optional trips into the Sacred Valley",
      "description": ": Today we'll have a full free day to explore Cusco, with optional excursions into the Sacred Valley. For water lovers there is the opportunity to go kayaking or stand-up paddleboarding on the Piuray Lagoon in the heart of the area's spectacular scenery. No previous experience of is necessary - full instruction and safety equipment are provided. Alternatively, you can take a trip to Maras and Moray, two of the Sacred Valley's most impressive sights; first, visit the huge concentric Inca terraces of Moray, a sort of botanical laboratory that the Incas used to test their crops. Then, visit the weirdly beautiful Maras salt mines, laid out across the mountainside like a chess board, before making a final 45-minute descent to the small salt-producing town of Pichingoto. If you'd prefer a less demanding activity, there's the chance to visit a craft beer brewery, including a tasting of the various beers. Craft beer is relatively new in Peru but is growing quickly. The range of local ingredients used in the brewing process is fascinating. Alternatively, simply remain in Cusco - visit the fortress-citadel of Saqsayhuaman, the Temple of the Sun (Qoricancha) or the incredible cathedral, or head to the markets for an atmospheric wander."

If your flight is departing later in the day, luggage storage facilities are available at our hotel. If you'd like an airport transfer today, you'll need to depart from Alejandro Velasco Astete International Airport (CUZ), which is around a 15-minute drive from our hotel.
