    "generalInfo": "Spend two weeks exploring Peru, from the high cities of Cuzco and the utterly unforgettable Machu Picchu, to the hot coastal plains. This small group adventure will take you through stunning Andean landscapes, extraordinary Inca ruins, colourful markets and beautiful colonial towns, revealing the culture, colour and character of Peru. <br/><br/>The trip begins in Lima, where a walking tour reveals its old, colonial streets and central market, brimming with local produce. Then travel to see the giant desert inscriptions of the Nazca Lines, one of Peru’s great unsolved mysteries, which you can scrutinise up close on a viewing platform or view from the sky on an optional flight. Next, visit the beautiful white city of Arequipa before heading to Lake Titicaca, where a boat tour brings the chance to meet the local Uru people as you visit its many floating islands, including Taquile Island, where men knit and women spin. Cuzco is a great city to explore on foot, dotted with many Incan ruins and Baroque churches, while no trip through Peru would be complete without a visit to the Sacred Valley and Machu Picchu. Enjoy a guided tour around the ruins as well as plenty of free time to discover it on your own.<br/><br/>Transport is by plane, private minibus and train with 14 nights in hotels. Due to the high altitude of many of places we visit, the air is thinner and some people can suffer altitude sickness. If possible, arrive a few days early to allow yourself time to acclimatise. <br/>",

Nazca dates back to the 2nd century BC, and thanks to dry desert conditions, mummies, textiles, ceramics and other relics have been remarkably well-preserved, providing archaeologists with insights into the pre-Inca civilisation. Head to the viewing tower or take an optional flight for even better views! At sunset, drive south through the desert to meet a local in their traditional mud house where you’ll share a pachamanca dinner (in the Quechua language, ‘pacha’ means earth and ‘manka’ means pot) – a classic dish of potatoes, meat and herbs baked with hot stones. Before digging in, you’ll experience a brief ceremony thanking Pachamama with chicha, or corn beer."

Then, visit the AMA Restaurant in Urubamba – a cafe that provides employment opportunities for single mothers. Enjoy a snack and learn how this inclusive enterprise supports economic growth and gender equality, then continue onto the Huilloq community – tourists are an uncommon sight here! Be welcomed with an offering to Pachamama (Mother Earth), learn about ancestral textile techniques and tuck into a guinea-pig lunch (vegetarian option available upon request).

If you’d like to give your legs a workout too, your leader can recommend some great walks around Aguas Calientes. The city is in the cloud forest at the foot of Machu Picchu, so it’s the perfect place to kick back and take in your surroundings. One Day Inca Trail You can choose to trek the One Day Inca Trail today (11 km or 7 miles) with a local guide. Keep in mind that you must pre-book this option at least 30 days before departure. The day begins bright and early with a 6:30 am train ride to the starting point. The trail is a mix of up and downhill, passing a few archaeological sites, including Chachabamba and Winay Wayna (2680 m altitude) –also known as 'Forever Young'. Considered the most impressive site on the whole Inca Trail, it’s made up of a terraced agricultural centre, religious sector and urban sector. From here, it's about a 1.5-hour?trek to Intipunku (the Sun Gate), where you'll enjoy unforgettable views (weather permitting) over the Lost City of the Incas. Depending on how long the trek takes, you'll have time to snap some pics and look around before taking a short bus ride down to Aguas Calientes to rejoin the group and go to your hotel."

The city was built around 1440 AD as a country retreat for the Inca nobility, but there’s evidence that the land had been a sacred Inca site for much longer. Another school of thought is that this was an astronomical observatory. Take a guided tour around the ruins of temples, palaces and living quarters and decide for yourself.

From this elevated viewpoint, the focus is on landscapes and birdlife. We’ll wait for a mixed flock of canopy birds to appear, primarily tanagers, including Paradise Tanager, Green-and-Gold Tanager, Flame-Crested Tanager, Turquoise Tanager, Opal-Rumped Tanager, and more. The tower also provides excellent opportunities to photograph species like the Cream-Colored Woodpecker, Gilded Barbet, Plum-Throated Cotinga, and Striolated Puffbird. Watch for macaws and toucans flying along the horizon, such as the Chestnut-Eared, Lettered, Emerald, Curl-Crested, and Brown-Mandibled Aracaries. You might even spot solitary raptors riding the thermals, with chances to capture hawk-eagles or even the elusive harpy eagle! Chuncho Clay Lick:Located two hours from Refugio Amazonas, deep within the Tambopata National Reserve, the Chuncho Clay Lick offers an extraordinary opportunity to observe and photograph macaws. After a five-minute walk, we reach the riverbank where dozens of large macaws gather to feed on the nutrient-rich clay. Renowned as one of the world’s top clay licks for macaws, the sight of these magnificent birds taking flight is breath-taking. The timing of our visit depends on the weather and macaw activity, as the birds tend to avoid the clay lick during rain. After this unforgettable experience, we continue with a private boat transfer to the Tambopata Research Centre (TRC). A four-and-a-half-hour boat ride from Refugio Amazonas takes us into the pristine heart of the reserve. Approximately an hour and a half into the trip, we cross the confluence with the Malinowski River, leaving behind the last traces of human habitation. In the reserve’s untouched 700,000-hectare core, wildlife sightings become more frequent, including capybaras, caimans, geese, macaws, and other large species. On arrival, we settle in and prepare for the next adventure. Lunch Photography from Overlooks: A 3-5 km hike leads to overlooks offering stunning panoramic views of the Tambopata River as it meanders through the lowlands. The trail, which runs through a regenerating bamboo forest, is a great spot for observing wildlife like Howler Monkeys and Dusky Titi Monkeys. These overlooks provide incredible opportunities to capture the beauty of the river winding its way down from the Andean highlands. On clear days, you might even be able to photograph the distant snow-capped peaks of the Andes. From these vantage points, there are excellent chances of close encounters with wildlife such as guans, chachalacas, toucans, or macaws roosting in the trees. Afterward, we return to the lodge for dinner. Tambopata Research Center – Overnight and dinner (B,L,D)"

Take time to marvel at the ceiling of carved panels covered with gold leaf. Raqchi (the temple of the god Wiracocha): This Inca temple is monumental in size: 100m in length, 26m in width and 14m in height. Divided into two naves, each of which still retain the base of eleven giant columns. The base of the walls consist of Imperial Inca stonework with a top section of adobe. La Raya: The highest pass on the route between Cusco and Puno, La Raya is 4335m above sea level. Beautiful landscapes await you, as well as animals that are symbolic of the Andes: llamas, alpacas and vicunas. Pukara: This is the most important and oldest ceremonial site this side of Tiahuanaco. Characterized by a series of staired platforms, the ruins also reveal some lit sculptures and tombstones.

Our first stop is the picturesque Andean village of Pisac. The village is famous for its local market and superb artisan stalls throughout the week. Time can be spent shopping or, for the more energetic, visiting the extensive Inca ruins at the top of the hill. Old Pisac ruins have much to explore with a circular hike along a well-defined Inca trail through royal buildings, look-outs, terraces, tunnels and irrigation channels before returning on another good trail to the bus. We may also visit a traditional bakery to try freshly baked bread and learn about the guinea pigs of Peru. Afterwards we take a short journey along the river to visit the Inca fortress town of Ollantaytambo: this was the site of the last big battle between the Incas and Spanish before the remaining Inca rebels fled into the jungles of Vilcabamba. In this lovely, well-preserved village and ruins you can still feel the true magic of the Incas. The hill-top, Inca sun temple displays some of the finest stonework in the area. The site was unfinished and some magnificent stones still lie un-erected, providing important clues to the building methods. Pachamanca lunch experience at El Albergue organic farm: A Pachamanca is a traditional way of preparing food in the Andes. In the absence of a stove an oven is built out of stones, the stones are heated with a wood fire and once brought to a very high temperature. The meat and vegetables are then carefully covered with the rocks.Herbs are then added and the whole mound is covered by wet sheets and finally a mound of earth. While the meal is cooking, you will be shown around this organic farm, working to sustainable methods to provide food for the Cafe Mayu restaurant. After 45 minutes the meal is ready and we have the pleasure of digging our delicious potatoes, yams, corn, fava beans, lamb, pork, alpaca, and chicken straight from the earth."

There are no other activities planned today, so you're free to arrive in Lima at any time. If you'd like an airport transfer today, you'll need to arrive into Lima's Jorge Chavez International Airport (LIM) which is approximately a one-hour drive from our hotel. Should you miss the welcome meeting, your tour leader will inform you of any essential information as soon as you catch up. If your flight arrives earlier in the day, you might like to take an independent stroll along the coastal path to Miraflores and through the bohemian district of Barranco. Alternatively, you could visit the Larco Museum for an introduction to Peru's ancient history. The city is also gaining a reputation as a culinary centre, so why not try some ceviche (fish marinated in citrus juices) or sip on a Pisco sour?"

        "description": "KIDS (AM): The Children's Rainforest Trail: Ania & The World's Voice. A short trail designed for children with the help of ANIA, an environmental education NGO. Kids aged 4-10 hike with a guide through a challenging (but short) trail where they follow maps, solve riddles and find clues that will lead them to Ania’s 'gifts'. Looking for the lost Brazil nut, finding the city of ants and a host of games and stories provide a great way of learning about life in the rainforest and the need for conservation. The concept, the story and the trail are trademarked by ANIA, a non profit with the mission of creating 100,000 hectares of'“Tierras de los Niños' (Children’s Lands) - private protected areas in the management of children. ADULTS (AM): Parrot Clay Lick - A fifteen minute boat ride and sixty minute walk from the lodge s is a clay lick used both by parrots and parakeets. From a blind you will see parrots and parakeets descend on most clear days to ingest the clay on a bank. Species such as Dusky headed and Cobalt winged Parakeet descend at this clay lick. With luck we will also see some or all of the following species in the early morning rush: Mealy and Yellow-crowned Amazons, Blue-headed Pionus, Severe macaw and Orange-cheeled (Barraband's) Parrot. We visit the lick at dawn, when parrots are most active or in midmorning or early afternoon, when they are active. Mammal Clay Lick - Twenty minutes walking from the lodge is a peccary clay lick. These wild rain forest pigs show up in herds of five to twenty individuals to eat clay in the late morning. Chances of spotting them are around 15%, but well worth the short hike. Other wildlife also shows up including deer, guan and parakeets. Then it's lunch at the lodge, followed by more activities. JOINT ACTIVITY (PM): Farm Visit - Five minutes downriver from the lodge lies a farm owned and managed by charismatic Don Manuel from the neighbouring community of Condenado. He grows a variety of popular and unknown Amazon crops - just about every plant and tree you see serves a purpose. It's a great way to see exotic fruits and plants up close and for the children to understand where and how they grow. After dinner there is the option of a caiman search (best suitable for slightly older children). We will be out at the river’s edge at night, scanning the shores with headlamps and flashlights to catch the red gleams of reflection from caiman eyes. Overnight in the lodge."

ADULTS (AM): Oxbow Lake Visit - We will paddle around the lake on a canoe or a catamaran, looking for lakeside wildlife such as hoatzin, caiman and hornerd screamers, hoping to see the otters which are infrequently seen here. You will also be rewarded with overhead sightings of macaws, and then we all meet back up for lunch. Ethnobotanical Tour - Along this trail we will find a variety of plants and trees that are used by the local population with at least the same variety of purposes. We will learn about the medicinal (and other) uses of Ajo-Sacha, Yuca de Venado, Uña de Gato, Charcot-Sacha, Para-Para, among several others. JOINT ACTIVITY (PM): After lunch, it's the canopy tower for all. A thirty minute walk from the lodge leads to the 25 metre scaffolding canopy tower. A bannistered staircase running through the middle provides safe access to the platforms above. The tower has been built upon high ground, therefore increasing your horizon of the continuous primary forest extending out towards the Tambopata National Reserve. From here views of mixed species canopy flocks as well as toucans, macaws and raptors are likely. After dinner, there is a night walk on offer. You will have the option of hiking out at night, when most of the mammals are active but difficult to see. Easier to find are frogs with shapes and sounds as bizarre as their natural histories.

In between you will explore Inca ruins, visit bustling markets, and walk through gorgeous Peruvian landscapes as you follow the footsteps of the Inca from Cuzco to Machu Picchu. <br/><br/>Peru’s southern jungles promises swathes of barely disturbed lowland rainforest with a smattering of oxbow lakes whose banks sometimes bristle with birdlife, caimans, and capybara. Also within its locale is a particularly pristine, protected area of forest called the Reserva Nacional Tambopata-Candamo (commonly known as the Tambopata Reserve). Here, you can visit colpas (claylicks) — inconspicuous-looking mud slicks containing rich minerals and salts that attract macaws and other small parrots.<br/><br/>You will then depart the Amazon for Cuzco. As the capital of the vast Inca empire and their ‘navel of the world’, Cuzco was a remarkable city, reputedly built in the shape of a puma, full of magnificent stone palaces and temples decorated with gold. Modern-day Cuzco is a proud, beautiful and lively city with a vibrant art scene, excellent museums and fine restaurants.<br/><br/>Next, make your way through the Sacred Valley. This winding and fertile valley between Pisac and Ollantaytambo was at the spiritual and commercial heart of the Inca empire. There are numerous ways to explore this region whether by taking it in on foot or visiting the people who have called this area home for centuries.<br/><br/>At last you will reach the crown jewel of the Inca Empire, Machu Picchu. Aside from a few llamas grazing the grassy terraces, and a viscacha (a rabbit-like rodent) or two snuggling in the empty window holes, the ruins are unadorned and devoid of any living presence (other than humans of course, all the relics found there are displayed in a museum in Cuzco). Arrive there in the early morning, and you’ll see how the morning cloud gradually disperses into wisps, revealing the buildings and terracing layer by layer.<br/><br/>After time spent exploring this ancient wonder you will traverse the sparse yet beautiful altiplano to reach Lake Titicaca. Sail to the floating Uros Islands which feel springy underfoot as they are made from the tortora reed that grows on the lake. Further out, on Taquile Island and Amantani Island, take a walk past terraces of lima beans, maize and potatoes tended by shyly smiling locals, and learn about the origins of their unusual traditional dress and farming methods from the islanders themselves. For a more unusual but intimate experience we can also arrange homestays with the local families here.",

In the Chaparrí Mountains you’ll overnight at an eco lodge in a private conservation area where Andean condors, guanacos and spectacled bears can be seen. <br/><br/>In Chiclayo, the twin-pyramid complex holds the tomb of the Lord of Sipan and gave up what many consider to be the finest collection of pre-Columbian art ever unearthed. In Leymebamba you’ll see over 200 mummies, while the clifftop mausoleums of Revash are haunting.<br/><br/>Other highlights include the majestic pre-Incan fortress of Kuelap, the famously scenic drive down from the mountains to Cajamarca, and of course the trek out to the Gocta Falls. Reckoned to be the third-highest falls in the world, they’re a breathtaking sight, and the noise has been compared to that of a plane taking off.<br/><br/>This tour begins and ends in Lima, ‘the City of Kings’, with two internal flights included to ensure you make the most of your time. Travel in June, and you’ll spend a day at the lively Raymillacta festival in Chachapoyas, when thousands of people descend from mountain villages in all their finery for a wild cultural celebration.<br/>",

We will hit the ground running today with a visit to the Sun and the Moon pyramids, towering testaments to one of the most remarkable pre-Inca cultures in the Americas. The Huaca del Sol was once the largest man-made structure in the western hemisphere, reaching a height of over 45 metres. Its neighbour, the smaller Huaca de la Luna was considered to be a ‘religious pyramid’ and the recent discovery of over 6,000 square metres of murals and reliefs provide an incredible legacy to a culture that died out over 1200 years ago. This afternoon, we visit the impressive Chimu ruins of Chan Chan. The remains of Chan Chan are far and away the most extensive of Trujillo’s archaeological ruins. This once great imperial city covers an area of some 28 square kilometres and, at its hiatus, was the largest adobe city on the planet. Today the nine-metre-high perimeter walls encircle the crumbling remains of palaces and temples, workshops and gardens that once lay at the heart of an empire that stretched along the coast for over 1,000 kilometres."

From the town of Luya we drive on to the village of Cruz Pata, where we walk down to the Sarcophagi of Karajia (2,850m). These striking figures, sculptured like humans have become the icon of the area. For 750 years they have looked towards the rising sun and undoubtedly are the resting place for some elite members of Chachapoya or 'Warriors of the Clouds'. The Chachapoyan Empire can be dated back to around 500AD, spreading across the Eastern Andes and developing major urban centres like Kuelap and Gran Pajaten, before finally being incorporated into the Incan Empire during the late 15th century. To date, there have been hundreds of sites discovered throughout the region and it is believed there are still ‘lost’ cities to be discovered. One leading author describes the area as ‘...overwhelming Machu Picchu in grandeur and mystery’. Next we venture on to the village of Huancas – a village locally famous for its rustic ceramics made by the women. Close to the village is the impressive 1000m deep Sonche Canyon. Our final destination for today is Chachapoyas, an important trading city that once lay at the crossroads between the coast and the jungle."

Begun during the 7th century, it is thought to have been under continuous construction spanning several hundred years until it's abandonment shortly after the Spanish conquest. Sprawled across the mountain summit and measuring over a kilometre in length, the site is considered one of the finest examples of Chachapoyan architecture left in the country, its formidable walls rising up to some 17 metres to protect the some 400 stone, cylindrical buildings within. By the time the Incas arrived in the 1470s, Kuelap had become little more than an isolated mountain fortress, but in its day it had been one of the most formidable pre-Columbian cities in the Americas.

Set on the edge of a lush valley, in the heart of Peru’s dairy country, the town once lay at the centre of the Cajamarca culture (500-1000 AD), before being turned into an important Inca religious settlement. Its charming colonial centre belies the fact that this town is steeped in the blood of the Incas, being the spot where that once great empire came to a final, bloody end at the Battle of Cajamarca. It was here, in November 1532, that Francisco Pizarro launched a surprise attack on the entourage of the Inca Emperor, Atahualpa, capturing him and slaughtering thousands of his followers in the process, an event that the Incas failed to recover from. In 1986 the town was declared a ‘Historical and Cultural Heritage of the Americas’ by the Organisation of American States.

You will also be introduced to the Inca creation mythology: why the stars are in the sky, why people are on earth, and how they came to have their form and location, how the day and the night came about, and why the sun is diurnal and the moon and stars nocturnal. In the planetarium, you will also notice that the night sky here is south of the equator, and is very different from the one you would see in the northern hemisphere. After the exhibition is over, weather permitting, outside the Planetarium, you’ll be able to see ‘the oldest show in the world’, observing stars and constellations through telescopes and other astronomical observation instruments."

This afternoon after a relaxing swim in the pool, set off into the vast desert surrounding your lodge. These dunes are world famous for their buggy and sand-boarding activities. Climb on board and find the biggest slopes and best spots for whizzing down for what seems like miles. Enjoy the smooth ride, and come back knackered, windswept and incredibly fulfilled by this spectacular landscape."

The drive passes through or close to several of the villages and temple fortresses which pepper the valley. The Pisac complex, set high above and visible from the eponymous colonial village you will visit, is built on terraces carved into the steep hillsides. The engineering and preservation are unrivalled. From the flat valley floor this intricate hillside rises up like a green staircase to the heavens. Continue along this picturesque, patchwork valley to the temple of Ollantaytambo. The snow-frosted Andean cordillera forms a stunning backdrop. Ollantaytambo, sitting strategically at the gateway to the Amazon basin, was never captured by the Spanish conquistadors, but the inhabitants decided that the settlement was too vulnerable and would eventually fail, and so they abandoned it. The fortress, the colonial grid plan and the Inca foundations are still intact and there are wonderful views down over the sloping hillsides and into the fertile valley. Spend the night in the tranquil valley."

The majestic ruined city, reclaimed from tropical cloud forest, is reached by minibus up a sinuous road, or on foot up a near vertical rocky path. The American explorer Hiram Bingham discovered it in 1911, by which time it was completely buried beneath jungle vegetation.

You may climb the Wayna Picchu (subject to space availability), which means “Young Mountain” as opposed to Machu Picchu. This ascent takes about an hour and its main attraction is the “Temple of the Moon”, a complex of underground constructions likely to have been used by the elite. Finally, you will be able to know the Inca Bridge, an incredible stone building that served as entrance or exit of the citadel. In the afternoon, you will head to the train station of Aguas Calientes and take the train back to Cusco from there. Once you arrive at the Cusco train station, you will be transferred to your hotel."

This is when the Sun (Inti, in Quechua) was worshipped during the Inca Empire and at the time of the Incas its walls were fully covered with gold sheets and its courtyards were planted with golden corn and life-size llamas. You will then go to the Cathedral, the most important building on the Main Square and one of the most splendid Spanish colonial churches in America, which is shaped as a Latin Cross and houses about 400 colonial paintings from the Cusco art school, and impressive goldsmith, silversmith and precious stones works. Its construction lasted almost a century, it started in 1560 and ended in 1654. The Ecclesiastical Chapter ordered to extract and transport hundreds of stones from the Sacsayhuamán fortress for this purpose. You will then visit the said fortress, en emblematic work of the Incas, which protected the Holy City. Conceived and built by Inca Pachacútec in the 15th century, The Sacsayhuamán complex was built with megalithic blocks, which transportation and construction continue to be a mystery. The Inti Raymi Festival, which worships the Sun, is reenacted on June 24 of each year, during the winter solstice. You will then go to Qenqo, located four kilometers away from Cusco City, an archaeological complex mainly used for religious purposes, and it is believed that agricultural rituals took place there. You will finally visit the vestiges of Puka Pukara, located seven kilometers away from Cusco. Puka Pukara, which means \"red fortress\", was an architectural complex presumably used for military purposes; it has many rooms, squares, bathrooms, aqueducts, walls and towers, and it is believed that the Incas entourage used it while he rested at Tambomachay. At the end of the tour, we will take you back to your hotel.

This wonderland of foodstuffs is where your everyday Limeno does their weekly shopping; from tropical fruits such as chirimoya and lucuma to piles of purple corn and an abundance of seafood, we'll be introduced first-hand to the fresh ingredients that go into creating Lima's excellent and diverse cuisine. Of course, during our visit, we'll have the chance to taste some of the produce, too. Following our trip to the market, we'll visit a local restaurant, where a chef will show us how two of Peru's most iconic dishes are prepared; pisco sours and ceviche. This is a demonstration rather than a hands-on cooking class, and we'll find out how zesty lime juice, sweet onions and chilli heat combine to cook raw fish and give it a delicious flavour (limes only appeared in Peru after the Spanish conquest, but there is evidence to suggest that ceviche was created in other ways by prehispanic societies). There are ceviche spots on every corner of the city, from rustic spots with overflowing bowls to high-end restaurants serving delicately presented portions. We'll have lunch in the restaurant, including, of course, ceviche. In the afternoon, we'll head to artistic Barranco for a walking tour. This neighbourhood has a reputation for creativity, with some of the best street art in the city. As well as beautiful architecture and a seafront walk, we'll visit the workshop of Victor Delfin (a renowned Peruvian artist), which will give you a sense of Barranco's bohemian beginnings (note that the artist isn't always in residence).

After checking into the hotel, we'll take an afternoon walking tour. Surrounded by volcanoes and mountains, the 'White City' is famed for its grand colonial architecture with signature vaulted rooves and white-stone arches, and the twin-tower cathedral that dominates the main plaza. We begin our tour with a birds-eye view at the Yanahuara viewpoint, where we take in the conical peak of El Misti volcano and the white spires of the city in front. At Yanahuara we make a stop at Picanteria Tio Dario for an included lunch. Historically these picanterias began in the hillsides surrounding the city, where the wives or mothers of farmers would indicate the availability of food to rural workers with a wooden table outside, covered with a rustic checked tablecloth. This Arepiqueno fare is deeply traditional, and we'll have a three-course lunch that may include local specialties such as rocoto relleno (stuffed peppers), adobe arequipeno (a soupy, spicy pork stew), or solterito de queso (a fresh salad made from local cheese, corn, beans and vegetables). We'll also try the local chicha morada - a purple corn drink very typical in Peru. After lunch, we visit the Santa Catalina Convent, which is a miniature walled town that once housed 450 nuns, living in total seclusion. A city within the city, founded in 1580, there are a maze of streets and squares within the walls that are ripe for exploring, along with the cloisters, rooms and ornate fountains."

Entering the main Plaza de Armas of Cusco, the focal point of the city, we're welcomed by the baristas of Three Monkeys Coffee who serve us the finest Peruvian beans. Then, once revived, we'll continue walking, gazing upon the Qoricancha complex, once the Inca's most sacred site dedicated to the Sun God.

With over 370 varieties in his potato bank, Manuel experiments with the colouring and nutritional value of native potatoes to create new, colourful and nutritionally improved roots. After a fascinating visit, we'll get to sample some of his work, along with a traditional 'uchucuta' (hot pepper) sauce. Manuel is also experimenting with Andean tuber wines (made of ocas and mashwas) - we'll have a tasting of these before heading on our way. After a lunch stop, we'll continue to the complex of Inca ruins at Moray - huge semi-circular agricultural terraces that were used as a botanical laboratory by the Incas, an ancient experiment that shows how in tune the civilisation was with agriculture and Mother Earth.

Today it allows us to discover a world of Andean villages and Inca terraces that make up one of the most outstanding natural settings in the Americas. We'll spend some time here at the Cruz del Condor viewpoint, searching for a sighting of the majestic birds flying over the canyon. This afternoon, we'll drive east, via the Patapampa Pass again at 4,910 metres/16,108 feet, heading towards the beautiful landscapes that surround the unique waters of Lake Titicaca, the highest navigable lake in the world. Our destination is the town of Puno, a centre of Incan folklore nestling in a bay at the northwestern tip of the lake and the perfect base from which to explore the cultural and historical significance of the lake itself."

This aqueduct directs us to arty San Blas, where coffee shops converge with traditional artisan's workshops, we'll explore the cobbled calles, venturing inside the studios to marvel at the local craftsmanship. Entering the main Plaza de Armas of Cusco, the focal point of the city, we're welcomed by the baristas of Three Monkeys Coffee who serve us the finest Peruvian beans. Then, once revived, we'll continue walking, gazing upon the Qoricancha complex, once the Inca's most sacred site dedicated to the Sun God. Our final destination is Mercado de Wanchaq, a local hot spot jammed with rows of colourful stalls and filled with the aromas of seasonal fruit. Slurping freshly pressed juice, we'll watch the sellers hawking their wares before returning to the hotel. The walking tour is approximately 4 kilometres/2.5 miles and is expected to take around four to five hours. We'll have the rest of the afternoon free in Cusco to explore at our leisure."

        "description": ": Potatoes are on the menu today. With over 4,000 different varieties, Peru really is the home of the potato - in fact, we didn't have them in Europe until the 16th century, when the Spanish conquistadores brought them back. We'll see these indigenous vegetables brought into the modern day, with a visit to the home and farm of Manuel Choqque, an agricultural engineer-turned-potato farmer. With over 370 varieties in his potato bank, Manuel experiments with the colouring and nutritional value of native potatoes to create new, colourful and nutritionally improved roots. After a fascinating visit, we'll get to sample some of his work, along with a traditional 'uchucuta' (hot pepper) sauce. Manuel is also experimenting with Andean tuber wines (made of ocas and mashwas) - we'll have a tasting of these before heading on our way. After a lunch stop, we'll continue to the complex of Inca ruins at Moray - huge semi-circular agricultural terraces that were used as a botanical laboratory by the Incas, an ancient experiment that shows how in tune the civilisation was with agriculture and Mother Earth. We'll also take in a panoramic view of Maras; enormous terraced salt pans that are a shock of white in the green valley. We arrive at our hotel in the Sacred Valley in the late afternoon."

This evening, we'll visit the community of Misminay, home to many of the porters who work along the Inca Trail. We'll share an Andean meal with them, prepared from local supplies, before spending the evening underneath the starry night sky, and hearing about the ancient Inca theories of the cosmos.

        "description": ": This morning is free for you to either relax in Aguas Calientes, or to explore Machu Picchu more. There are several optional ways that you might like to choose from - each one requires an additional permit that should be pre-paid at the time of booking. The first option is to revisit the site, giving you another chance to explore (unguided) at your own pace. There are several different one-way circuits in place in the site, each with a different name (Panoramic Circuit, Classic Circuit, Royalty Circuit). If you choose to revisit, we aim to book the Classic Circuit, but the final circuit permit purchased will depend on availability at the time of your booking. Alternatively, there are two optional hikes available within the site, each one unguided. These climb to the summits of either Machu Picchu Mountain or Huayna Picchu Mountain to look down on the citadel. Machu Picchu Mountain is a 700-metre hike from the top of the citadel. There are cobbled stairs on the way up with a few exposed sections in some parts, but predominantly very enclosed and with a fairly steady, but not too strenuous, gradient. The round-trip takes around two-and-a-half to three hours. Huayna Picchu Mountain is only 350 metres, half the size of Machu Picchu Mountain, but much steeper. There are several sheer drops, and it is not suitable for anyone with a fear of heights. For those who fancy doing the two-hour climb, you'll be rewarded with unbeatable views of Machu Picchu and the feeling that you're standing on a precipice at the top of the world. These three options must be pre-paid at the time of booking, and if you change your passport between your time of booking and prior to travel please bring your original passport with you. A final option is to simply relax in Aguas Calientes - it's a fantastic little town with a great market, excellent cafes and a laidback vibe. Later, we'll take the afternoon train to Ollantaytambo, from where we'll get the bus to Cusco, arriving late in the evening."

Our lodge here offers a range of different excursions (all included within the cost of your trip), and your itinerary for the following three nights can be arranged according to your interests. The lodge team will sit down with you on your first day at the lodge to discuss what you'd like to do and the following itinerary is a suggestion based on just some of the excursions that are available at the lodge, all guided by their experienced team of guides. For example, this afternoon you may wish to take a gentle twilight river trip to witness the jungle transform into a nocturnal world, where the daytime animals and birds give way to species specially adapted to the darkness of the night. Or, you may opt to swing in the hammock outside your cabana and enjoy the sounds of the rainforest. Although this lodge is a premium property, due to its remote location the electricity is provided by a generator and is only available for certain hours of the day. Please note, our Amazon journey is designed as an extension to the Upgraded - Discover Peru trip, and as such you Tour Leader will not be joining you.

The activities and tours at the Reserva Amazonica are planned for the morning and afternoon when it's cooler. Each day there'll be a few hours of downtime after lunch to relax or read in the heart of the rainforest. In the afternoon those for a head for heights might choose to climb the exhilerating Inkaterra Canopy Walkway, which is a 1,129-foot system of two observation towers, eight platforms and seven hanging bridges 30 metres/100 feet above the ground. The walkway is designed to perform scientific research on the ecosystems inhabiting the rainforest canopy and gives us an unobstructed view of the jungle setting. During the afternoon, take a 30-minute walk following a raised wooden platform over a flooded swamp. In this ecosystem you might observe various species of birds, amphibians, and abundant flora.

Combine that with a contemporary outlook, world class food scene and a wealth of wildlife and we’ve skimmed the surface of what Peru has to offer. We’ve extracted all these elements and added others to create the ultimate Peru experience. Iconic Machu Pichu sitting proud on top of a jungle clad mountain is always top of the tick list for Peru.  Colca Canyon rises to 4000m, in part, dropping to a deep valley of just 1000m with prehistoric sized Condors gliding overhead. Explore the ancient streets of Cuzco peppered with spectacularly ornate churches and lively plazas. For those who want to get deep into the narrow tributaries of the upper Amazon basin we have a few optional extra days where the sites and sounds of the jungle are brought to life by expert guides.",

We will visit other churches such as the Company of Jesus and we will walk through the streets reflecting the colonial history into the present day, such as San Francisco and Santo Domingo streets.

We will enter the cloisters, walk through its narrow corridors of intense colors, and admire its internal plazas, considered colonial architectural treasures, as well as rooms that house beautiful canvases from the Cusco School with indigenous and Spanish motifs. Arequipa is known as the White City because of the ashlar or sillar, the characteristic white volcanic stone used in the construction of most of the city's colonial architectural treasures. In this Sillar route we will learn more about this peculiar material from its beginnings: the quarries. We will have the opportunity to observe how the ashlar is extracted by hand and participate in the block carving process using chisels.

The Main Square is a must, where we will see the colonial architecture that remains intact to this day, but its history is much older since it used as foundations the walls of Inca enclosures. Also located in the square is the Cathedral, the most important temple in the city. It was built by the Spanish on top of the palace of the Inca Huiracoha. Its interior houses a wonderful collection of colonial art composed of goldsmith pieces and representative canvases of the Cusco School. Within walking distance is the Koricancha, which during the Tahuantinsuyo was a center of worship to the Sun and on which later the convent of Santo Domingo was built as part of the evangelization process. Its baroque facade built on the solid Inca walls perfectly summarizes the syncretism of cultures in Cusco. The route will take us uphill through beautiful narrow streets to San Blas, the city's bohemian neighborhood par excellence, known for being home to local artists' craft workshops.

The bark looks like fine paper on the tree trunk. Continuing north we eventually reach Caraz from where we will enter one of the world’s most amazing roads - Cañon del Pato, meaning Canyon of the Ducks. Rio Santa separates the two mountain ranges Cordillera Blanca and Cordillera Negra by only ten metres at some points.

    "generalInfo": "This trip takes you to the mystical south of Peru - a fascinating country with a great variety of landscapes and ecosystems, and a rich heritage of pre-colombian culture hidden in the mountains or deserted plains. <br/><br/>The south of Peru is an area in Latin America with a different energy &amp; vibration. The Andes &amp; Indian people show and teach us something that is very worthwhile to experience. The people, the spiritual heritage of their ancestors, and the places you visit, will make this a special journey.<br/><br/>You will visit the high sanddunes of Ica with amazing views over the area and stay in a desert oasis, at nearby NP Paracas you will see the large colonies of birds and sealions in Islas Ballestas. You visit the mysterious geometrical figures and lines of Nazca and explore one of the deepest canyons of the world, the Colca canyon, for several days. This trip takes you to Lake Titicaca and the inspiring city of Cusco, from where we offer several possibilities for trekking or daywalks. You can choose among others between the Inca trail, Lares and Salkantay trekkings or other trails, and/or opt for a rainforest extension in the National Park of Manu or Tambopata Reserve near Puerto Maldonado. At the end of the trip you can have either free days in Cusco extra, to immerse yourself in citylife, go for shopping, or see more of the Sacred Valley, eg have a mountain bike excursion to Chincheros, Maras &amp; Moray, visit the Inca temples of Pisaq &amp; Qenko, visit a social children project in or around Cusco, or fly back directly from Puerto Maldonado after a rainforest extension to Lima.<br/><br/>Besides individual tailor made tours we offer also our Tourguide services to small organised groups, the itinery may include all elements your group is looking for, daywalks, cultural excursions, visits to archaeological sites, the Inca trail, other trails, rainforest extensions etc. You will be accompanied by an expert on Andean nature &amp; culture. We invite you to have a direct Skype conference with your Tourguide and ask all the questions you have ! Your Tourmanager is internationally certified, every year trained in first aid, has guided 140 grouptrips, is educated as a westerner in an Indian lineage, one of the most knowledgeable guides in Latin America and last but not least very good company.<br/><br/>Example itinerary - Roundtrip South Peru. Note that with the Inca trail included the trip becomes 20 days instead of 18 days and you still have 2 free days in Cusco at end for optional excursions or free time. All transfers &amp; bus tickets will be arranged in advance for you by our agent in Lima and reservations for the Inca trail have to be confirmed 4-5 months ahead in high season. The accommodation is 3-4 star Peruvian hotels, all selected for a spectacular view or a specific setting &amp; ambience. If you wish to stay for a few days in more luxurious hotels, eg in Cusco, we can adapt that to your wishes. The itinerary below can be modified to your personal wishes including departure date, duration, accommodation used &amp; how long you spend in each destination. <br/><br/>The Inca Trail, permits &amp; alternatives: the classical 4 day Inca Trail to Machu Picchu is one of the most famous treks in the world. The appeal of this particular trek is the stunning combination of Inca ruins, magnificent mountains, exotic vegetation and extraordinary ecological variety. The trail goes over high passes with unforgettable views, through cloud forest, and finally into subtropical vegetation. After the trail you can choose to return to Ollantaytambo on day 4 and stay overnight there, to continue to Cusco, or stay one night longer in Aguas Calientes and return on the 5th day - giving more time to explore Machu Picchu, the hot baths of Aquas Calientes, climb the mountain Putu Kusi and visit the waterfalls &amp; botanical garden Mandor in the surrounding area. On contacting us we can check directly the Inca Trail permit availability for you. Note that the rain season may start in December, lasts until end of March and that the Inca trail is closed in the month February. In case the classical Inca trail is fully booked there are several alternative trails possible, as the 4 day Lares trail or the Salkantay Inca trail which leads you in 5 days to Aquas Calientes beneath Machu Picchu without the requirement of a permit. Besides there is a short Inca trail program of 2 days called the Camino Real which requires a permit same as the classical Inca trail. <br/><br/>More trekkings and trails we offer are the Ausangate trekking in 4 to 5 days, the Ausangate Sibinacocha trekking in 7 to 8 days, the classical Choquequirao trekking, the Juchujqosqo trek from 2-3 days from Tambomachay to Calca, Alpamayo, Cordillera Blanca &amp; Cordillera Huayhuash treks and a few more new trails. The most challenging Inca trekking we can offer is from Cachora to Choquequirao and from there continue via Yanama to the Inca site Vitcos (Yurak Rumi, described as White Rock by Hiram Bingham) in the Vilcabamba valley from where you continue through the mountains and rainforest to Santa Theresa and Machu Picchu.<br/><br/>Extra daywalks in the Colca canyon: in case you wish to make extra daywaks on your own in the Colca canyon we supply the GPS data of three possible daywalks of different level as part of a tailor made booking. In case you wish to walk with a private guide you can make a short trekking of eg 3-4 days from Cruz del Condor to the bottom of the canyon, stay in a lovely green oasis with swimming pool on the third day and return to Cabanaconde the last day. There is also a trekking possible from Colca canyon to Cusco, just for those that have time enough and like to be fully off the beaten path with an extra challenge.<br/><br/>Rainforest extensions: Rainforest extensions can be arranged to Manu National Park (5-9 days) or to Tambopata National Reserve (3-5 days of which one day can be at camp), both including visits to macaw clay licks. <br/><br/>Approximately half the area of Switzerland, the Manu Biosphere is a complete ecosystem with protected watershed embracing Andean montane cloud forest, tropical lowland forest and the Alto Madre de Dios and Manu river drainage systems. Wildlife abundance aside, the journey into the park itself is amazingly spectacular and not to be missed. The two day trip from Cusco takes you over the Andes to an elevation of 4000m, past pre-inca ruins, down through the cloud forest and finally into lush, lowland rainforest. <br/><br/>The Tambopata National Reserve in situated in the province of Madre-de-Dios and is more easily accesible then Manu NP. Within walking distance of the lodge lies a tranquil oxbow lake formerly part of the river Tambopata. The undisturbed and thriving ecosystem here means that the lake can support a family of giant river otters along with other endangered species such as black caimans. Bird life is also prolific; with a record breaking 620 species being recorded in the area surrounding the lodge, you will not cease to be amazed by the variety and colors. <br/><br/>Family holidays: This tour can be tailormade to suit the needs of a family, taking in to account the ages of any children. For example, we could reduce the travelling, and stay longer in individual destinations such as Cusco &amp; Lake Titicaca. Children will love the experience to be in the Peruvian rainforest, which can be added to the travel, leaving from Cusco. For families with kids (or any travelparty) we can turn around this sample itinery and start with Cusco to have a better adaptation to altitude, from there to Titicaca lake and continue with a private guided program into Colca canyon, stay in Cabanaconde, Granja del Colca and pass the highest pass Mirador de los Volcanes at a stage that everyone is well adapted. This has been proven to work out well for families, ask for more information.<br/><br/>The Inca jungle Trail from Cusco to Machu Picchu is a new route which involves biking from Abra Malaga to Santa Marta, walking on 2 newly discovered Inca trails and the highest zipline of South America. The multiple terrain trip, includes recently discovered real Inca paths, archaeological ruins, an 60 km bike downhill on mountain bikes, through the mountains from Abra Malaga to the green valleys below and the jungle base of Santa Maria. On the third day you reach the top of Llactapata with amazing views, flanked by the high peak of the Salkantay. The fourth day, after three nights the trip ends with going up to Machu Picchu and enjoy the sunrise. You return to Cusco by train and bus.<br/><br/>Galapagos extension &amp; Ecuador: For those who have the time and budget, your Peru roundtrip can be given a final touch with a spectacular Galapagos cruise of several days at the end. You have cruises of 4, 5, 7 and 8 days up to full itineries visiting all islands in 15 days. There is a wide range in boats with different comfort classes and style.

    "generalInfo": "Boasting the greatest diversity of mammal life in the world and being one of the birding hotspots in the 4th most diverse country for bird life; Manu National Park in Peru’s Upper Amazon Rainforest is a wildlife enthusiasts dream.<br/><br/>Home to literally thousands of animals the rainforests and riverways of Manu are home to huge numbers of wildlife, clay licks offer chances to see dozens of parrots and macaws together, the rivers are home to caiman and giant otters and the forests themselves are teeming with birds and primates everywhere you look.<br/><br/>But the rainforest is not the only thing that the Peru has to offer, we will also travel into the Andes and visit the historically and culturally important site of Machu Picchu before going off in search of a very different set of wildlife in the arid north of Peru. <br/><br/>Our final stop will be in a small private reserve that takes in injured and orphaned Andean bears with a view to rehabilitating them into the wild. Along with the wild population of bears here we hope to see certain species that are not found in other areas of Peru.<br/><br/>The north-west of Peru is an undervalued yet wonderful part of this large and diverse country. Exploring this region and looking for it's wildlife is a great way to see various species which are not commonly seen elsewhere. Animals like spectacled bears (the original inspiration for Paddington Bear), Sechuran foxes, Andean condors and white-winged guans are all seen with ease in the amazing Chaparri Eco-Reserve.  <br/><br/>This unique trip transports you from the central highlands and the former seat of power for the Incan people down into the steamy and diverse Amazon rainforest before heading north and to the dry forests of the far north-west of Peru. All in all this wildlife exploration is one of the best and most comprehensive available for this country.<br/><br/>Throughout the itinerary you'll be accompanied by expert full time guides, often including: professional zoologists (where available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us), English speaking local naturalists and a local driver for all transfers. Being in the company of a naturalist is the best way to learn more about ecology and animal behaviour and will help you identify different species and interpret behaviours. <br/>Each location and habitat visited on this tour is unique and home to a set of wildlife different from the next. <br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner where mentioned). There will be filtered or boiled water available for each guest each day. We have our own private AC vehicles with an excellent driver for all vehicular transfers. You will have a local cultural and naturalist guides. The guides have spent years in Peru and know the places and wildlife and cultural monuments and sites intimately. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>We choose September - November as a good time for this itinerary, this is due to the weather being drier during this time of year than the northern hemisphere summer.  <br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced local naturalist or guides as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• Our local Machu Picchu expert guide is provided for your guided visits to the site and is an expert in the region and Incan history in general.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it.<br/>• This specific wildlife tour is one of the few in the world that explores remote and wilderness areas of Ecuador in the company of expert guides.<br/>• We provide camera traps for you to set up and you are free to use any and all of the photographs and videos that this camera trap gets during your stay.  <br/>• All the above reasons give this, our unique Peru Wildlife &amp; Cultural Holiday a great success rate of seeing rare wildlife. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Peru which explore other areas and focus on other species such as the Amazon rainforest and more specific birding holidays as well as many other species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/> <br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour visits three distinct locations, firstly the Incan capital of Cusco and the historical and world famous site of Machu Picchu in the Central Andes and then we travel into the remote and wild upper reaches of the Amazon on the eastern slopes of the Andes before heading north-west to the dry coastal forests and in particular the Chaparri eco-reserve.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>Some of this trip is at relatively high altitude and whilst there is not much walking (in terms of trekking) on this itinerary, we do walk around Machu Picchu and have walks in the lower altitude in the Amazon and Chaparri Reserve. There can be uneven ground and so we advice to be used to walking for 1-2 hours in heat and some experience of being at altitude is good but far from necessary.<br/>There is one optional hike up to a view point overlooking Machu Picchu, this is a steep climb and can be physically demanding, however it is optional.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking. We can also include specialist equipment on request such as camera traps, infrared cameras, thermal imaging equipment and spotlights. .<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 15 Years Old",

The drive usually takes around 8-10 hours and we will have some breaks where we can experience some of the Andean villages and small farmsteads as we pass by. The architecture is a mix of Quechua and colonial which makes for a very scenic drive before we reach a pass that overlooks the Amazon Basin. Along the way you may see puna teals, Andean ducks and puna ibis in the high altitude habitats and then as we descend a little to get to the Cock of the Rock Lodge you will begin to hear the calls of birds such as quetzals, trogons and wood rails, and see a variety of orchids that grow in the perpetually damp cloud forest. Our lodge for the night is also home to the tamest and most accessible Andean cock-of-the-rock lekking site in the world. Also found around the lodge (alongside the plethora of bird species) are woolly monkeys, brown capuchin monkeys and very occassionally Andean bears. Some of the more common and impressive bird species we will try and see here are emerald toucanet, torrent duck, golden-headed quetzal, grey-breasted mountain-toucan, Amazonia umbrellabird, blue-banded toucanet, fruit-eating tanagers, red-crested cotinga, banded-tail fruit-eater, tyrant flycatchers and the blue-crowned mot-mot. If we are in time (depending on the traffic, road conditions and how often we stop) we will visit the lek this evening to see the lodge’s namesake bird before retiring for the evening.

The journey will be different from yesterdays as we will only be able to make some of it by vehicle, before we board boats and continuing the journey through the Amazon Rainforest. The lodge is located in the tropical lowland rainforest of Manu Biosphere Reserve. The lodge has a very impressive bird list that is around 630 species strong at present, there are also many mammals recorded from the lodge grounds including 8 species of primates and some rarer sightings such as Brazilian tapir, jaguar, puma and peccaries.

Travelling along the river to the centre we will try and spot aquatic wildlife such as caiman, giant otters and hoatzins as well as other wildlife. Once we arrive at the centre you will have some time to settle in and familiarise yourself with the private lodge located in its own 16,190 ha. rain forest reserve adjacent to the one million-acre protected area named the “Amarakaeri Reserved Zone”.

The Vistadome train passes through picturesque Andean scenery, passing traditional villages, Inca ruins and rushing rivers. You will descend 1,300m through the Sacred Valley of the Incas and follow the Urubamba River to Aguas Calientes (which is now called Machu Picchu Pueblo). After dropping off your luggage at the station we’ll take the 20-minute bus ride up to Machu Picchu, perched 600 meters above the river. After lunch your archeological guide will take you on a walking tour of the site. It is important to have your camera equipment in a small bag ready to take on the bus to the site so that we can leave the train and catch the bus straight away. The famous lost city of the Inca is one of the most magical and mysterious places on Earth. Situated on the spine of a jungle cloaked granite peak towering some 600 meters above an entrenched meander of the roaring river below, the site is frequently shrouded in misty clouds pierced by the powerful equatorial sun. Constructed from precisely sculptured granite blocks carefully joined with the projecting exposed stone of the surrounding mountain, the site may well be the finest architectural achievement of the new world. In the late afternoon we will head back to the town and have the rest of the day to relax in the stunning Andean surroundings. Tomorrow we will make the climb up Huayna Picchu which offers stunning views over the ruins. (breakfast is the only meal included today)."

This is a pretty hard climb and for people not wanting to do this you can spend the day around Machu Picchu and take in the sites at your own pace. The Incas built a trail up the side of the Huayna Picchu and built temples and terraces on its top. The peak of Huayna Picchu is about 2,720m above sea level, or about 360m higher than Machu Picchu. The top of the mountain was the residence for the high priest and the local virgins. Every morning before sunrise, the high priest with a small group would walk to Machu Picchu to signal the coming of the new day. The Temple of the Moon, one of the three major temples in the Machu Picchu area, is nestled on the side of the mountain and is situated at an elevation lower than Machu Picchu. Adjacent to the Temple of the Moon is the Great Cavern, another sacred temple with fine masonry. The other major local temples in Machu Picchu are the Temple of the Condor, Temple of Three Windows, Principal Temple, “Unfinished Temple”, and the Temple of the Sun, also called the Torreon. Only 400 people are allowed to climb the peak per day and we will be in the latter group as the clouds will hopefully have lifted allowing for excellent views over the ruins. The climb is steep and can be slippery when wet so we are best to take our time in getting up to the top. After exploring the site more we will get back to the hotel (via the bus) and then board the train back to Cusco. The rest of the evening will be free to rest.

We will settle into the lodge today and possibly have a short afternoon trip out (depending on the time we make it to the lodge). Over the next 3 full days we will fully explore the reserve.

    "generalInfo": "Peru is a well known holiday destination, whether it is to explore the wonderful and world famous ruins of Machu Picchu or to experience the upper Amazon rainforest there are many reasons to visit Peru. But few trips combine the very best wildlife watching in the Amazon Rainforest and visits to South America's most iconic historical site. This is one such trip and we are sure that anyone wishing to visit Peru for the first time and get an appreciation for what Peru is all about.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>Boasting the greatest diversity of mammal life in the world and being one of top bird watching locations in the world (ranking number 4 for the number of bird species); Manu National Park in Peru’s Upper Amazon Rainforest is a wildlife enthusiasts dream. <br/><br/>It is often very difficult to see a lot of wildlife in the dense thick tropical rainforests, but what makes Manu National Park so special is there are wide open rivers where wildlife can be see on the banks, ox-bow lakes which accumulate wildlife, canopy walk ways and towers which allow great views across the forest as well as salt and clay licks which provide wildlife with much needed minerals and attract them from miles around. <br/><br/>These factors make the wildlife watching in Manu National Park better than most other locations in the upper Amazon Rainforest. It is the salt and clay licks in particular which are adored by many species of parrots and macaws. <br/><br/>The pristine lakes and rivers that seldom have visitors are home to many caiman and families of giant otters and of course the forests around Manu are home to some of the Amazon’s most iconic and accessible wildlife. Whilst spotted jaguars may still be very difficult the smaller mammals (particularly primates) and of course the birds should entertain us as we delve deeper and deeper into the Amazon. <br/><br/>Whilst in Manu we will visit 4 different lodges / camps. The first being in the cloud forests on the border of the Amazon and home to a variety of wildlife that is not usually found in the rainforest further down. But the rainforest is not the only thing that the Peru has to offer, we will also travel into the Andes and visit the historically and culturally important site of Machu Picchu, one of the true wonders of the world.<br/><br/>Machu Picchu is regarded as one of the 7 Wonders of the World and is one of the most iconic and wonderful locations in the world to visit, so many people come and see the ruins and we will spend 2 full days exploring the site and getting expect guidance into its history and the cultural importance of the site to ancient and modern Peruvians.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner where mentioned). There will be filtered or boiled water available for each guest each day. We have our own private AC vehicles with an excellent driver for all vehicular transfers. You will have a local cultural and naturalist guides. The guides have spent years in Peru and know the places and wildlife and cultural monuments and sites intimately. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>We choose September - November as a good time for this itinerary, this is due to the weather being drier during this time of year than the northern hemisphere summer.  <br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced zoologist (where possible - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us), local naturalist or guides as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• Our local Machu Picchu expert guide is provided for your guided visits to the site and is an expert in the region and Incan history in general.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it.<br/>• This specific wildlife tour is one of the few in the world that explores remote and wilderness areas of Ecuador in the company of expert guides.<br/>• We provide camera traps for you to set up and you are free to use any and all of the photographs and videos that this camera trap gets during your stay.  <br/>• All the above reasons give this, our unique Peru Wildlife &amp; Cultural Holiday a great success rate of seeing rare wildlife. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Peru which explore other areas and focus on other species such as the Amazon rainforest and more specific birding holidays as well as many other species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/> <br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour visits three distinct locations, firstly the Incan capital of Cusco and the historical and world famous site of Machu Picchu in the Central Andes and then we travel into the remote and wild upper reaches of the Amazon on the eastern slopes of the Andes.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>Some of this trip is at relatively high altitude and whilst there is not much walking (in terms of trekking) on this itinerary, we do walk around Machu Picchu and have walks in the lower altitude in the Amazon. There can be uneven ground and so we advice to be used to walking for 1-2 hours in heat and some experience of being at altitude is good but far from necessary.<br/>There is one optional hike up to a view point overlooking Machu Picchu, this is a steep climb and can be physically demanding, however it is optional.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking. We can also include specialist equipment on request such as camera traps, infrared cameras, thermal imaging equipment and spotlights. .<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 15 Years Old",

The drive usually takes around 8-10 hours and we will have some breaks where we can experience some of the Andean villages and small farmsteads as we pass by. The architecture is a mix of Quechua and colonial which makes for a very scenic drive before we reach a pass that overlooks the Amazon Basin. Along the way you may see puna teals, Andean ducks and puna ibis in the high altitude habitats and then as we descend a little to get to the Cock of the Rock Lodge you will begin to hear the calls of birds such as quetzals, trogons and wood rails, and see a variety of orchids that grow in the perpetually damp cloud forest. Our lodge for the night is also home to the tamest and most accessible Andean cock-of-the-rock lekking site in the world. Also found around the lodge (alongside the plethora of bird species) are woolly monkeys, brown capuchin monkeys and very occassionally Andean bears. Some of the more common and impressive bird species we will try and see here are emerald toucanet, torrent duck, golden-headed quetzal, grey-breasted mountain-toucan, Amazonia umbrellabird, blue-banded toucanet, fruit-eating tanagers, red-crested cotinga, banded-tail fruit-eater, tyrant flycatchers and the blue-crowned mot-mot. If we are in time (depending on the traffic, road conditions and how often we stop) we will visit the lek this evening to see the lodge’s namesake bird before retiring for the evening.

This park has the largest diversity of mammal life in the world and some of the largest numbers of plants, insects, reptiles, amphibians and bird species in the world as well. The journey will be different from yesterdays as we will only be able to make some of it by vehicle, before we board boats and continuing the journey through the Amazon Rainforest. The lodge is located in the tropical lowland rainforest of Manu Biosphere Reserve. The lodge has a very impressive bird list that is around 630 species strong at present, there are also many mammals recorded from the lodge grounds including 8 species of primates and some rarer sightings such as Brazilian tapir, jaguar, puma and peccaries. We will make the most of the afternoon and evening here before dinner and our first night in the Amazon Rainforest. (all meals included today)."

Around the Cocha Salvador it is possible to see giant otters and around the camp itself it can pay to keep an eye out for brown-mantled tamarins, black-capped squirrel monkeys, gray woolly monkeys and Peruvian spider monkeys. Being so deep into the forest lots of the wildlife is visible around the camp and with a full day tomorrow we hope to see many species that are difficult or impossible to see elsewhere.

The centre is located on the Madre de Dios River and the wildlife is abundant here, as well as trails and canopy towers the centre is also close to a salt lick that is very productive for macaws and tapirs and also two large oxbow lakes that are good places for wildlife watching. Travelling along the river to the centre we will try and spot aquatic wildlife such as caiman, giant otters and hoatzins as well as other wildlife. Once we arrive at the centre you will have some time to settle in and familiarise yourself with the private lodge located in its own 16,190 ha. rain forest reserve adjacent to the one million-acre protected area named the “Amarakaeri Reserved Zone”.

The Incas built a trail up the side of the Huayna Picchu and built temples and terraces on its top. The peak of Huayna Picchu is about 2,720m above sea level, or about 360m higher than Machu Picchu. The top of the mountain was the residence for the high priest and the local virgins. Every morning before sunrise, the high priest with a small group would walk to Machu Picchu to signal the coming of the new day. The Temple of the Moon, one of the three major temples in the Machu Picchu area, is nestled on the side of the mountain and is situated at an elevation lower than Machu Picchu. Adjacent to the Temple of the Moon is the Great Cavern, another sacred temple with fine masonry. The other major local temples in Machu Picchu are the Temple of the Condor, Temple of Three Windows, Principal Temple, “Unfinished Temple”, and the Temple of the Sun, also called the Torreon. Only 400 people are allowed to climb the peak per day and we will be in the latter group as the clouds will hopefully have lifted allowing for excellent views over the ruins. The climb is steep and can be slippery when wet so we are best to take our time in getting up to the top.

The scenes from your window on the half-hour drive to the hotel through Lima encapsulate the invigorating bustle of a modern-day Latin American capital. Lima, the City of Kings, was once the capital of Spanish America, and the vestiges of its glorious past can still be seen in the faded grandeur of the colonial churches and traditional wooden balconies in the city centre. The explosive growth of the last 50 years, so typical of capital cities in the developing world, has transformed Lima into a dynamic and chaotic low-rise city of over 10 million people. In crowded streets, throngs of traffic race out towards Miraflores, a modern middle-class suburb on the coast, where your hotel is located."

The vicuña is a smaller, more delicate relative of the llama, whose fine wool is literally worth more than its weight in gold. You may also come across vizcachas, alpacas, llamas and flamingos all feeding from the scrub. The climb continues around the cavernous crater of an extinct volcano and over a high pass before emerging onto the rim of the valley. From here you can look out over the vast network of ancient, intricately terraced fields and tiny villages. After descending into the canyon submerge yourself in the warm, healing waters of the hot springs."

If you choose, there is the option to follow a couple of the ancient footpaths which link traditional villages such as Coporaque and Ichupampa.

The occasional stop alongside small highland lakes may give you the chance to spot flamingos feeding in the mineral-rich waters. The vast, indigo Lake Titicaca – almost an inland sea – sits on the Peruvian-Bolivian border, and the fish-laden waters and surrounding fertile soil are the lifeblood of subsistence farming communities clustered in scores of adobe villages along the water’s edge.

During severe storms, the islands may break up into smaller islets. Once devoted to fishing, the inhabitants now earn their living mainly through selling handicrafts to tourists and, while this is a unique experience, it has the air of a living museum. In the afternoon, there’s an opportunity to take an optional excursion to the Chullpas at Sillustani, towering stone tombs said to be the burial site of the ancient Hatun Colla chiefs.

First you cross the highland altiplano, a vast, windswept plain of bog and moor, where bowler-hatted indigenous women tend herds of llamas and alpacas, punctuated by the occasional market town. As the snow-dusted mountains close in, the train climbs to the high pass at La Raya (4,200m), and from here the scenery changes dramatically as you race down through the increasingly fertile pocket-sized fields of corn and potatoes to Cusco. The name Cusco derives from the Quechua word for navel, indicating its location at the centre of the Inca Empire, which reached its zenith at the same time as England was fighting the Wars of the Roses. Today its many impressive original Inca walls display extraordinary craftsmanship, while the bustling squares are dotted with ornate baroque colonial churches. It’s a vivacious city, where shoeshine boys and postcard sellers jostle for your attention in cobbled streets lined with handicraft shops and cafés.

In 1536 a desperate and defining three-day battle was fought between the Spaniards and the Incas around this fortress. The first conquistadors to see it were awestruck, and centuries later it is still an extraordinary and imposing sight. There is also free time to explore Cusco; to wander through its cobbled streets bracketed by impressive Inca walls, to explore its colourful, bustling markets and splendid churches, and to stop at some of the many excellent cafés.

Once the bread-basket of the Inca Empire, it was heavily populated in imperial times and scores of archaeological sites remain, where well-preserved ruins bear witness to the highly developed society that the Incas created. The drive passes through or close to several of the villages and temple fortresses that pepper the valley. The Pisac complex, set high above and visible from the eponymous colonial village you will visit, is built on terraces carved into the steep hillsides. The engineering and preservation are unrivalled. From the flat valley floor this intricate hillside rises up like a green staircase to the heavens. Continue along this picturesque, patchwork valley to the temple of Ollantaytambo. The snow-frosted Andean cordillera forms a stunning backdrop. Ollantaytambo, sitting strategically at the gateway to the Amazon basin, was never captured by the Spanish conquistadors, but the inhabitants decided that the settlement was too vulnerable and would eventually fail, and so they abandoned it. The fortress, the colonial grid plan and the Inca foundations are still intact and there are wonderful views down over the sloping hillsides and into the fertile valley. You spend the night in the tranquil valley."

As the river Urubamba enters its narrow gorge between thickly-forested granite hills, there is room only for a single track, which hugs the right bank and passes through hamlets that are no more than a collection of shacks beside the railway. Close to the foot of the mountain on a saddle of which the citadel was built is the bustling village of Machu Picchu (formerly known as Aguas Calientes), dedicated to serving the many visitors with artisan markets, bars and restaurants. The majestic ruined city, reclaimed from tropical cloud forest, is reached by minibus up a sinuous road, or on foot up a near vertical rocky path. The American explorer Hiram Bingham discovered it in 1911, by which time it was completely buried beneath jungle vegetation. It is perhaps the ruins’ location, on a ridge spur amid forested peaks and above a roaring river canyon, that most ignites the imagination. You will have a guided tour of the ruins. Fancy hiking some of the Inca Trail without interrupting your tour? We can organise for you to walk the mini Inca Trail on this day, but still, have a guided tour of the ruins and stay with the group in the evening. Please ask us for more details."

Moray is a system of ancient agricultural irrigation paths which now form circular depressions in the earth, with wonderful views into the Sacred Valley and in the shadow of the snowy peak of Mount Veronica. From here it is a short walk to the salt pans at Maras, circular pans of glistening white carved into the mountainside. Feeling you’d like to be active?

    "generalInfo": "This tailor made holiday in Peru covers a vast array of the country’s spectacular cultural sites, including the Inca citadel of Machu Picchu, which you travel to by train at the end of the holiday. Starting in the capital city of Lima, with its impressive museums and sites, particularly the Centro Historico with its pre-Hispanic and colonial architecture.<br/><br/> From Lima you fly to another wonderful city, Arequipa in the south of Peru. The “white city” is famous for its whitewashed buildings, historic centre with a variety of architecture from through the ages, and exquisite location enveloped by volcanic peaks. On this tailor-made holiday you will have private drivers and guides, who will then take you into the rural wonders of the Colca Valley, where village life is still very traditional on the pre-Inca terraced slopes. Another treat in this region is Colca Canyon which, at 3,400 meters deep is one of the world’s deepest. Here you will not only see herds of llama and vicuna but also the canyon’s resident condors soaring up above on the thermals.<br/><br/>The next stop on this itinerary, which can be tweaked to suit your interests and timeframe of course, is Puno, gateway to the great Lake Titicaca. At an elevation of 3,800m, the town is a fascinating place where many people still wear traditional dress. Surrounded by mountains, the bright blue lake is a wonderful sight, as are its famous Uros Islands made of totora reeds which enable them to float. Learn about traditional dress and farming methods directly from islanders of Taquile Island.<br/><br/> The last few days are spent exploring the Sacred Valley and famous ruins of Machu Picchu. Starting in Cuzco, the former capital of the vast Inca Empire, take time to also explore the cobblestone streets and colonial architecture. In the Sacred Valley you can visit the ruins of Pisac and Ollantaytambo with your driver and guide before taking the train to Machu Picchu the next day. We highly recommend two visits to Machu Picchu so that you have enough time to fully take in the incredible ruins and tackle hiking Huayna Picchu or Mount Machu Picchu.<br/><br/> Please note: We find that the best time to travel to Peru is between the months of April and October, as there is plenty of sunshine and you avoid the highland rainfall that hits during outside these months.",

These ancient networks have been carved out from hundreds of years of exploration, curiosity and passion for the land. Today's excursion will combine culture, history and nature at a slower Andean pace on foot. From the small village of Maras, our specialist will guide you to the salt terraces that are approximately an hour's hike away. From the Raqchi viewpoint, gain spectacular views of the vistas of the valley. As you approach, gleams of dazzling light reflected off the Maras salt terraces might give the illusion of a sheet of snow or frost - the stunning sunlight has that effect here. This is a historically prominent place, the salt was extracted from these mines during Inca times and the same method has been used ever since. From here, you will continue to the community of Misminay where you'll receive a warm welcome with music and typical dances. Learn about the Andean families' lifestyle, by sharing some of their daily activities with them and enjoy a delicious and traditional lunch prepared with local products before beginning the hike towards a viewpoint of the otherworldly terraces of Moray. Enjoy spectacular landscapes with the mountains as a backdrop. After an amble of 45 minutes, you will be rewarded with an amazing view of Moray at your feet. Moray's circular terraces hidden among the hills are similar to that of a Greek amphitheater. Surrounded by an impressive backdrop of snow covered mountains, Moray served as an open-air agricultural lab for adapting crops to different environmental conditions."

The rocks are smooth and polished on your hands as you glide them over the edges of the walkway. The terraces of the Ollantaytambo ruins climb the mountainside above you, giving texture and depth to the already impressive landscape. A single walkway divides the tiers and brings you to the top of the ruins where you can see the town and the valley below. The breeze is cool on your cheeks and the air is pure and crisp in your lungs. Continue to Pisac where the ruins are divided into four separate areas.

The air is perfumed with sweet earth, a mixture of vegetables and fruits as you venture through the famous Pisac market. Villagers journey from towns near and far to arrive at the market. The colors are explosive, ranging from vibrant textiles to a variety of produce: eight different types of corn and six different types of potato. The fabrics are weaved into stunning designs with smiling suns, prominent llamas, and rolling mountains. Spices shimmer rich reds, bright yellows, and dark greens, adding mint and heat to the air.

The modernity of Lima has a vibrant energy, coursing through the boulevards underneath the remnants of Spanish colonization. Wooden balconies decorate buildings. Baroque architecture flourishes in the embellishments of cathedrals and decorative fountains in the heart of a plaza. When you arrive at the airport, your private transfer is waiting to take your family to your comfortable accommodation located in the trendy seaside neighborhood of Miraflores. The aroma of Peruvian roasted chicken drifts out of hidden local restaurants. Fresh ceviche has bright citrus flavors, situated in the counter restaurants of the Central Market. When you reach Miraflores, you find a neighborhood situated on the cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Contemporary buildings shimmer in the sunlight and reflect the image of the water in their windows. Historical colonial homes intersperse the modern feel of the neighborhood, with greenery adding a more embracing atmosphere. In the heart of Miraflores, you can find a pyramid-shaped temple belonging to a coastal civilization with roots dating back to 200 AD. The kids marvel at the view of the water and the pyramid, finding the new culture of Peru exciting, and this is only the beginning."

        "description": "In the morning, your private transfer escorts you to the airport for your flight to Cusco. The atmosphere is thinner, standing at an elevation of 11,200 feet above sea level. The Andes is the world’s longest mountain range, spanning 4,300 miles, and climbing to a height of 13,000 feet. The mountain range ventures through seven separate South American countries. Your transfer meets you at the Alejandro Velasco Astete International Airport and takes you into the countryside known as the Sacred Valley, home to the heart of Andean and Inca culture. The elevation subsides to between approximately 8,000 to 9,000 feet above sea level. The landscape is lush, with sweeping greenery rushing along the hills and ending near the top of the rugged mountain peaks. The aroma of fresh grass fills the crisp, cool air. Your guide leads you to the Center for Traditional Textiles, where local Andean women demonstrate the importance of the intricate art, from the traditions the work maintains to the culture it alludes to. The center was established in 1996, with the goal of preserving and reviving the Peruvian Inca textile trade. The traditions date back more than two millennia, passed on from generation to generation by watching and practicing. The kids immediately notice how soft the garments are. You can’t help but notice the variety in colors and design, finding red and black stripes, and even blankets decorated with tiny llamas. You continue through the Sacred Valley, and settle into the comforts of your hotel, in the encompassing greenery of the mountains."

The kids are enthusiastic about river rafting, and soon your transfer meets you at the hotel, ready to take you to the banks of the Urubamba River. The excursion is part adventure, part cultural and historical tours of the valley. You reach the raft and find the current calm along the riverbanks. The Urubamba River flows for more than 449 miles before combining with the Tambo River. When you set out on the water, your guide tells everyone to paddle. The kids are practically glowing with smiles, eager for adventure. The water spritzes into the air and lands on your cheeks with refreshing vigor. Upper Urubamba has a system of irrigation, with the ruins dating back to the ancient times. When the water begins to speed up, you can hear the rapids before you see them. The kids cry out in delight. The raft urges forward. Your guide tells you all to paddle once again. The rapids lift the raft left and right, shifting your position against small boulders and the arching riverbanks. The rocky banks lead into towering foothills. When the rapids calm, the kids cheer. You can’t help but notice the pure beauty emanating from the valley."

After breakfast, your private transfer whisks you away from the hotel and into the foothills to visit the exceptional towns along the mountainside. The allure of Moray is its stunning design, captivating Peruvians and visitors form worlds away for centuries. The intrigue lies in the numerous and impressive symmetrical circular terraces decorating the landscape. The scene resembles a large amphitheater carved into the greenery. The formation is actually a complex network of flat terraces forming two separate bowls. Stone stairs climb up and down the terrace walls. The kids marvel at the sheer size of the terraces. The perfect symmetry of the circles is something akin to wonder. The true unique quality of the terraces is not as much in the structure as in the varying degrees of temperatures from the top terrace to the bottom, creating microclimates of up to 59 degrees Fahrenheit. Your guide explains that the Inca brought different soils from around the empire to help create the differential to yield different crops from the Andean region. You notice the kids’ interest in the active history surrounding them."

The family is eager to take the train to Machu Picchu, sitting under the glass dome of the celebrated train ride to Aguas Calientes. The Urubamba River winds around the valley floor. The mountainous landscape gives way to a lush cloud forest. Orchids blossom on the higher branches with vivacious purple and red petals. You venture from the train station in Aguas Calientes to the gates of Machu Picchu, walking along the path to the historic stone stairwell, opening up to the terraces of the legendary city among the clouds. The site stands almost 1,000 above the Urubamba River, cast in the dramatic setting on a plateau with Huaynu Picchu rising in the background. Clouds drift below you. The rich stones of the city standout from the manicured grasses and encircling jungle covered mountains. Your guide leads you through the Sacred Plaza, atop the stairs overlooking the ceremonial baths and opposite the old quarry. The square has a curved wall, demarcating a viewing platform looking out to the snowcapped peak of Cordillera Vilcabamba. There is a sense of accomplishment when you reach the city, from seeing the Sun Gate at the edge of the Inca Trail in the distance to encircling the Intihuatana, the “Hitching Post of the Sun, ” which predicted solstices and lengthening days. The kids are enthralled with the sense of history that feels so ancient to everyone, dating back to the 15th-century."

In the afternoon, you settle into Cusco and follow your guide through the cobblestone streets of a city overflowing with colonial buildings and rich with Andean culture. The central market houses rows of produce; the aroma of freshly made chicken soup lingers in the air. The city has roots dating back to the 12th-century and is the oldest continually inhabited city in the Americas. In the narrow streets, you find remaining Inca Walls, creating the ambiance of an outdoor museum, such as along the streets of Loret and Hatunrumiyoc, leading to the Plaza de Armas. Your guide points out the 12-sided stone in the wall on Hatunrumiyoc. The church of Santo Domingo was built over the ruins of the Coricancha, the Incan Temple of the Sun. The old walls were lined with gold sheets and decorated with a golden disc reflecting the sunlight and illuminating the temple. Today the church is reminiscent of the Spanish colonization, with solid stonework, atop a large platform raising the church above the surrounding descending streets. The kids point to the curved wall made of stone, standing 20 feet tall, beneath the west end of the church. It remains a great example of Incan masonry. The trapezoidal doorways, perfected by the Inca, allowed the building to move during an earthquake, especially due to the fact that the Inca did not use mortar to reinforce their stonework."

The site has been occupied since the 10th-century but the Inca erected the fortress in the 13th-century. The stones used can weigh more than 120 tons, with the largest stones weighing up to 440 tons. The Inca used weight and intricate carvings to place the stones together like puzzle pieces. Your guide shows you how thin the space is between each stone by trying to stick a blade of grass into the cracks. The fortified complex has defensive walls extending almost 1,000 feet, zigzagging across the plateau like puma teeth. The kids love the fact they can walk along the site, stepping over the various tiers and examining the stones. Your guide points out another trapezoidal doorframe leading to the upper tier with a view to the city below. Even more so, your guide points out a smooth stone slide that leads down the hillside into the open square. The kids quickly volunteer to be the first to ride down the granite. After your exploration of the fortress, the remainder of the day is at your leisure to enjoy the wonders of Cusco at your preferred speed, from the charm of the Plaza de Armas to the trendy cafes and lovely rooftop view of Plaza San Blas."

The cream colored walls of the buildings stand out against the lush grass and rolling hills surrounding the city. After breakfast, your private transfer meets you in the hotel lobby and escorts the family to Cusco International Airport for your flight home. You have ventured along mountains and down rivers, into ancient cities and mysterious wonders for a great family adventure."

        "description": "Leave the sprawling wonders and sweet ocean perfume of Lima behind for the Inca capital of Cusco. Standing at 10,750 feet above sea level, Cusco is the oldest continuously inhabited city in South America. The cobblestone streets meander along the fertile, rolling hills of the Andes. Decadent Spanish architecture rises up from the roads, much of which has been built over Inca foundation. The mountain air is cool and inviting as you follow your guide along the stone paths of the road. The aroma of rotisserie chicken glides out of the restaurant doors. The capital of the Inca Empire was, and still is, considered by many Quechua people to be the spiritual center of the world. Santo Domingo Church showcases a mixture of the once opulent Inca Temple of the Sun and the large expansive Spanish cathedral. The painting depicting the Sun Temple of Koricancha glistens in gold, giving the Spanish the impression they had truly found El Dorado , the walls lined with solid-gold sheets. The remains of Koricancha are situated in the grandiose stonework of the current church that expands into a dome, and down the sloping streetscape of the city. The pathways of Cusco can take you into the bustling Plaza de Armas, where the fountain trickles along the facades of history, or winding through narrow roads and into the hills where the fortress of Sacsayhuaman overlooks the surrounding valley."

Pisac is a traditional Andean village along the gentle sweep of the vale. The agricultural terraces sweep around the south and east of the mountain in elegant curves mostly unbroken by a stairway. The scent of grass and the crisp air rises from the valley floor. The market shines like a rainbow with traditional Andean textiles being sold and bartered by the surge of villagers that come from all around. Pink and blue beads roll along black skirts. Yellow fringe dangles like a curtain from a red pleated hat. The boisterous sounds of the market and jovial local vendors rush along the walkways. Ollantaytambo village sits beneath the mountainside where tremendous ruins loom. The Inca once showered the Spanish with arrows, spears, and boulders from above the steep terraces of the mountain, giving them a large victory over the intruders. The silhouette of the mountain brings a wave of shade to the ruins as you climb the single staircase that divides the sweeping tiers. The stones are cool to the touch as you arrive at the temple partially carved into the peak of the mountain. The history of the ruins and the remains of the village below are inherently connected with the spirit of the Inca Nation."

Follow the open paths of the city and search through the ruins with the high altitude giving you clear and bright skies. In the lower region of city is the Prison Group, a labyrinth of ornately structured cells, niches, and passageways, winding both under and above ground. Stand at the centerpiece of the labyrinth in the Temple of the Condor named for a carving that has the head of a condor with its wings outstretched, showing its expansive wingspan.

The remains of the stone structure sit beside the abundant trees and the steep cliff. Three pillars stand against the slope and as you circle the walls and look back towards the city you can see the pillars framing Machu Picchu like a perfect postcard. The peak of Huayna Picchu looms over the plateau in the background while the design of the Inca gem is on display, from the climbing terraces to the ambling stones, making the entire mountain look like one large pyramid.

The villages that decorate the arid landscape are filled with Quechua speakers wearing colorful and warm clothing along the craggy flatlands of the upper mountains. The men wear chullos , a woven beanie with dangling string along the sides. The women drape themselves in stunningly colored blankets, wrapped around their shoulders as they weave, walk, or perform their daily chores. Along the way you will visit the incredible site of Roqchi, a temple dedicated to the god Viracocha and sits over 10,000 feet above sea level. The remaining walls of the temple look as though the interior of the structure had been hollowed out, leaving only the outer parapets. The air is cool and thin from the altitude; the two-story remains are impressive against the lowland of the ruins. The sky is filled with the joyful sound of the pan flute, as the mountains stand tall in the close distance.

The cooling perfume of the fresh water lake continues to fill the air. Copacabana sits along the shores of the lake on the Bolivian side. The city sits between mountains as the water calmly rolls along the sliver of beach. The Basilica of Our Lady of Copacabana is pristinely white and built at the foot of a small, steep hill. The church shines like a beacon in the mid-morning sun. The hill was sacred to the Inca and known as the Temple of the Sun, making the area of blessed importance to both the indigenous people and Catholics of the city. The city bustles with life, from the restaurants where the sweet smell of chocolate and the slight bitterness of coca leaves mix together along with the flaky aroma of fried dough; people pour along the downtown streets with alive with color, open space, and beautiful brick buildings. Travel to the Island of the Sun situated within the waters of Lake Titicaca and experience the continued culture of the Aymara who have inhabited the island for centuries. Uphill from the dock, within the village of Yumani, is the beautiful hanging garden. The gentle rush of rolling water rises from waterfall and guides you. Travel along the Inca Stairway, the stone path that meanders up the hillside. Terraces stretch gracefully over the steep slopes. Come to the natural springs at Fuente del Inca. Once thought to be the fountain of youth by the Spanish, the Inca believed that the three streams represented their motto: “Don’t steal, don’t lie, and don’t be lazy.” The spring continues to be an important water source for the islanders. You can see them carrying pots or pouches for collecting their daily water. As Island of the Sun becomes covered in evening cool you will have the opportunity to stay in a guesthouse located on the island, absorbing the culture and becoming one step closer to being a part of the Inca Nation."

Myths and mysteries of the lost civilization are whispered in the breeze about the little known people that built the ceremonial center over 2,000 years ago. Around 1,200 BC the nation faded into oblivion adding to the world’s current list of “lost civilizations.” Large statues stand against the backdrop of an open sky, their eyes stern, their hands held close to their chests. Smooth stone walls run along stairs and footpaths where glittering gold was once looted by the Spanish, and the pottery was most likely destroyed by zealots.

The pre-Columbian collection is rumored to contain more than 50,000 pots that span warehouses and history, including Nazca and Inca relics.

The sun rotates from deep red to bright orange. The sky is smothered in blue.

The town is situated next to a breathtaking archeological complex that stretches along and beneath the mountainside. The system of overlapping terraces form the remnants of an amphitheater but was, in fact, agricultural in design. Each tier even contains its own microclimate, shifting from cool to hot the farther you descend along the hillside. The morning dew has long dissipated. The scent of warm grass fills the sky. Continue on to the saltpans of Maras where, from the distant hills, you can see what looks like large saucers terracing the mountainside. The warm afternoon is perfumed with saltwater, replacing the aroma of the lush grass. As you venture closer to the saltpans you can see the variety in their sizes, and each one is larger than you had expected. The pans are fed from a natural saltwater spring that meanders through the mountainside. Each pan fills with water and eventually evaporates leaving the salt ready for harvest. Experiencing the engineering ingenuity is among the continuous joys of travel and among the continuous wonders of the Andes."

        "description": "The opulent Spanish buildings of Cusco have stood over the city for centuries and continue to do so today as you depart from the diversity of the city and arrive at the train tracks of Ollantaytambo. You can hear the train chug along the tracks and you will feel like you have been transported back to a day of plush trains and adventurous exploration. Board the comfortable car and see the glass dome that offers a 360-degree panorama of the surrounding valley. The lush grass and towering peaks give way to sprawling dense jungle. You can see the fluid rush of waterfalls careen over the mossy forest floor. Purple and pink orchids blossom along the tree branches and shine beneath the dangling canopy. Arrive in the town of Aguas Calientes and reach the entrance gates where all Machu Picchu tours begin. The craggy stairs wrap around the hillside and take you up along the citadel. The walls guide you away from the climbing stairwell onto a lush stretch of grass and eventually opening to the plateau of the Lost City. Terraces ascend the mountainside and sweep across the verdant hill. The stone facades of the city shine with the sunlight, like a gift you have always wanted. Huayna Picchu stands tall in the distance looking down on the city like a proud older brother. Wander through the remaining wonders of Machu Picchu and absorb the rich culture and sensational architecture that continue to sit within the company of mountains. The ceremonial baths line an extent of the walkway where you can climb the stairs and come to a flat area of jumbled rocks and the open space of the four-sided Sacred Plaza. Step along the curved wall and look out over the white peak of Cordillera Vilcabamba that pierces the sky in the distance while the rushing waters of Urubamba River can be seen below."

        "description": "Welcome the morning light as the night sky fades into the bright blue of the dawn. The sun slowly rises above the stone high atop the mountain. The thunder of the Urubamba River pushes against the foothills. Begin your day with a sweet, fresh cup of Peruvian coffee. Wrap your fingers around the warm cup, the steam and aroma rising from the heat. The sun makes the stones glisten like regalia which are now within your reach. There is time for one last exploration of the city and one more chance to feel connected to the wonder that it is. Step within the borders of the Lost City and watch the trails expand before you, each one offering to take you somewhere new, exciting, different, and equally exceptional. The peak of Huayna Picchu continues to watch over the Lost City and beckons to you, its beauty and grandeur magnetic. Through the Inca Tunnel, along the stretch of stone path you can find the steep staircase that will guide you into the clouds. Use the rope rail to help pull yourself up the steep stairs. Your breath is short from excitement. Adrenaline rushes through you. You find your stride and push up the mountainside. The final steps bring you to a ladder where you stand on a granite peak, look out over the mountains that stand eye to eye, and you realize that you made it. Turn to face the Lost City below and find that the wonders never cease. Machu Picchu stands small beneath you, its grandeur still immanent, and surrounded by mountains, overlooking the valley, and standing within the clouds. You will eventually make your way back down to Aguas Calientes, board the train, and return to Cusco. But for now, take another breath, watch the clouds drift by, and know that you have followed in the footsteps of wonders."

Outside of Moray are deep, circular-shaped terraces that look like crop circles dug into the earth floor, almost 90 feet deep with concentric ringed terraces. You can feel the weather change within the circles, each containing their own microclimate. Maras is almost a feat of imagination, where saltpans roll up the mountainside, fed from a natural spring in the valley.

The hut is one of the few restored buildings, and a fabulous site to take in Machu Picchu as a whole. Be sure to look down on the city and into the open roof of the Principal Temple.

        "description": "The morning lingers over the city and brings the sun peaking over the Sacsayhuaman Fortress. The boulders shine in the early light as it spreads along the mountaintops until it wraps around the whole of Cusco like a comfortable blanket. Today you will be taken on a guided tour of the city to experience the mixture of the Spanish colonial footprint and the remaining Inca influence. The city and its surroundings are decorated with stunning relics of Spanish life built over the Inca foundation and remnants of an unaltered past, from the buildings that line the streets to the ruins that dot the mountainside. The Sacsayhuaman Fortress is a relic of the decadent past. It was built by the Incas, taken by the Spanish, but was untouched, and has been guarding the city for centuries. The grand monoliths line the mountainside and overlook the city, and they were pressed together with nothing more than a stone cut and the boulder's own weight. A blade of grass can barely make its way between the cracks of two stones even after hundreds of years pressed together. Enter the gates of the fortress and into a stunning structure strewn together with unfathomable stones, creating rising terraces, mammoth archways, and outstanding views. You can hear laughter rising through the air along the border of the open plain within the fortress gates. A tall stone glides along the monoliths, pressing down into the soft plain below. Parents, children, and anyone with a sense of adventure enjoy sitting on the cool boulders and feeling the rush of the wind through their hair, as they sweep along the slick slide, pressing their feet into the smooth grass with the city fading behind the boulders."

Spanish explorer Francisco Pizarro dubbed Lima the “City of Kings,” due to city’s founding during the important Catholic holiday of the Epiphany of the Three King’s. Lima continues to wear the crown of its former name by combining the marvelous vistas overlooking the Pacific and the desert hills spreading to the east. The cultural and national capital of Peru offers a cosmopolitan ambiance with a variety of traditions found around the country, from the Andes to the northwest sea, and deep in the arid plains that hide the Nazca Lines. Your flight lands at Jorge Chavez International Airport, and your private transfer greets the family upon arrival and escorts you to a gorgeous hotel overlooking the stunning cliffs of Miraflores. The seaside neighborhood provides a fashionable and contemporary perspective to the historical city outside of the Spanish colonial architecture of the classic city center. The sea breeze carries the aroma of the water and a cooling mist beneath the warm sunlight. The electric railways have traversed the interior city since the mid-19th century and continue to add charm and valuable transport around Lima leading to the funicular along suburban Chorrillos. Hang gliders ride the wind, circling the thermal pockets around the cliffs like a bird. After dinner, you make your way to El Circuito Magico del Agua to view the illuminated fountains that transform the park on the edge of downtown into a ballet of dancing water and light. More than a dozen fountains spout water into the air while music echoes across the city center.

The unique complex invites visitors into the former society that developed around the central coast nearly two millennia ago. The pyramids were erected around 500 AD and remain one of Lima’s most important preserved monuments. A large wall separated the different sections of an administration and urban zone from the ceremonial sector. Sunlight spreads over the adobe bricks and fills the air with the fragrance of hot soil. The pyramid spans nearly 330 feet wide and is more than 70 feet tall, and the kids listen with inspired looks as the guide explains how the priests conducted religious ceremonies to honor their gods and ancestors here. Fossils of alpacas, mollusks, corn, pumpkins, and ducks have been discovered during the excavation process.

After the meal, your private guide escorts the family to the airport for your brief flight to Cusco, the capital of the Incan Empire, located at 11,200 feet above sea level. You can feel the altitudinal difference of the thinner air. Intriguing ruins, cobblestone streets, and Andean culture permeate the unique neighborhoods of the historic city. Your driver meets the family at the airport and quickly escorts you to Center of Traditional Textiles, which helps preserve the historical customs of Andean communities. Your guide offers a private tour and demonstration of the practices continued inside the center, where master weavers practice their trade and the scent of wool filters through the gallery. First, the family learns how the Andean communities would dye the wool into the specific, vibrant colors you see shining from the fabrics, colors the local women would find in nature. Red is important to the Andean people because of its significance in history, and because it offers the brightest natural hue. Your guide makes the red dye from a cochineal , a scaly insect found in the prickly pear. After drying the insect, the color-master grinds it into a powder with a mortar and pestle, adding water to help the dying process, and with an end product of red, pink, and purple hues. After learning the natural ways the Andean people have crafted dye throughout their history, you watch as the weaver looms the colorful yarns into a garment, moving with a hypnotic, consistent motion."

After the meal, your guide leads you to the shores of the Urubamba River for an adventurous ride down the exhilarating whitewater. The upper segment of the river rushes along the valley floor near extensive irrigation networks and remarkable Incan ruins. You put on your life-vest and helmet, then you step into the raft and paddle down the river, feeling drops of the cold water dripping on your skin. You can hear the rushing whitewater nearing, rumbling over the boulders and riverbanks. The family paddles with your guide, trundling over the class II and III rapids. The raft bucks and bumps against the protruding rocks before settling down at the end of the whitewater. The river travels a total of 450 miles, but you only travel for about 10 miles before enjoying lunch in a quiet picnic area. The high-altitude sun helps dry your clothes quickly before you set out to the town of Ollantaytambo, located at the western edge of the Sacred Valley. The Andean homes were erected over the foundations of an Inca city, and the town retains the same grid. Historic archways frame the entrance of each neighborhood, with trapezoidal arches, consistent with Incan architecture, leading into the main courtyard.

At first, the kids don’t understand the draw of terraces but quickly find wonderment in the historical and magnificent engineering. The deep bowl resembles a Greek amphitheater, with the terraces cutting into the natural grade of the surrounding slopes. Archaeologists believe the terraces were used as an agricultural laboratory for the Incas to learn more about their crops and how they grew. The largest terrace reaches a depression nearly 100 feet deep, with temperatures changing more than 25 degrees Fahrenheit between the top and bottom terrace. Your guide explains that the Inca often experimented with microclimates and the hybridization of vegetables, which is why Peru has more than 2,000 types of potatoes."

The kids want to stop at the Visitors Center before reaching the top of the plateau to receive their unique Machu Picchu passport stamp. Your guide leads the family to the forgotten city to find an enormous complex atop the hillside textured with terraces. You walk up to the Inti Punku, the Sun Gate, which marks the end of the Inka Trail, and where you can enjoy a view of the ruins and the peak of Huayna Picchu in the background. Your return to the heart of the historic city and climb the stairs above the ceremonial baths to reach the Sacred Plaza. The jumbled rocks connote an area once used as a quarry, and a viewing platform with a curved wall gives you a view of the Vilcabamba mastiff and the winding whitewater of the Urubamba River. Llamas perch on the grass and graze along the terraces as the family marvels at the majestic ambiance of one of the world’s new Seven Wonders."

The scent of popcorn fills the air near the Central Market where vendors offer soup and roasted chicken with sides of rice or potatoes. Your guide leads you on an exclusive tour of the city, pointing out its historical connections to the Inca set beneath the Spanish colonial architecture. You venture to the Church of Santo Domingo, which was once the Sun Temple of Coricancha. Gold draped the walls, and a large disk in the interior symbolized the sun and cast light over the halls. The riches were melted down and sent to Spain, but the ethereal ambiance remains. Frescoes depicting the original temple decorate the walls and the foundations of Coricancha, and a 20-foot tall curved wall is a feature of the exterior. Inside, rooms of smooth gray stone and sharp angles contrast the rounded arches of Spanish design."

At first glance, it will seem like an odd place for a culinary capital, especially with all the honking on the streets. Fresh seafood comes in from the Pacific each morning, and some of it is used for the city’s most famous lunchtime dish, ceviche, which is raw fish cured in lemon juice. Regular flights will land in the capital from across the country, bringing flavors from different Amazonian regions as well as high up in the Andes. Tomorrow you will start sampling raw ingredients in Lima’s markets. This tour’s introduction will come at a restaurant that celebrates diversity in its widest form. Twelve courses will be served on the tasting menu and these tend to change each day, reflecting what has come in from the market that morning. You will not recognize many of the flavors, but you will be only tasting and enjoying. Over the next few days you will separate individual components, but for now there will be nothing to do but indulge on the final fusion that Peru creates."

Today will be dedicated to this style of cooking, particularly how it differs from what you have been tasting so far. For example, classic Peruvian ceviche spends long hours marinating in lime juice, while Nikkei is a rawer form that adds the lime just a few minutes before serving. Finally, you will jump into a kitchen with a Nikkei chef and explore the basics for lunchtime, learning about precise timing as you prepare tiradito and an Amazonian fish dish known as de la selva lo Nikkei, which is made from a river fish called Paiche and mixed with anticucho, cocona, miso causa and mirin vinaigrette. You will also roll up a Nikkei maki roll, using Peruvian ingredients to craft something that will appear to be from a sushi restaurant, but will taste completely different. After some free time in Lima, you will round off the tour with the best restaurant in Latin America, which was number seven on the 2018 World’s Best 50 Restaurants list and is the most evocative interpretation of the Nikkei style, from pioneering chef and Nikkei legend, Mitsuharu Micha Tsumura."

The fishmongers cut and clean fish for an extra two soles. After exploring the historic district of Plaza de Armas and wandering through the catacombs of Saint Francis Basilica, you continue to the House of Gastronomy, Peru’s only museum dedicated to cultural cuisine. The gallery opened in 2011 and provides over 500 years of history, including the ancient wisdom of cooking certain types of produce, and the fusion of flavors brought by the influence of international dishes.

After breakfast, your guide leads you out of Lima to the town of Chincha, located along the southern coast. Juice merchants grind sugar cane alongside the streets, and vendors offer African figurines, representing the Afro-Peruvian culture dating back to the arrival of the Spanish. The restaurants promote criolla flavors, which represent the coast. The town remains a testament to the slave trade in Peru, a little-known but strong part of country’s development after Spanish settlement. The scent of grilled meat drifts through the streets where restaurants serve tacu-tacu , seasoned beans and rice, with cuts of beef heart cooked over a coal fire. You continue to the town of Pisco, sharing the name of the national beverage, Pisco Sour. The town sits on the edges of a popular beach resort and the Paracas Reserve. The region hosted the Paracas culture between 700 BC and 400 AD, the most prominent Peruvian civilization existing before the Inca Empire. The town also harbored the 19th-century revolutionary spirit reacting against Spanish rule. Your guide leads you on a tour of a winery known for growing the grapes used to produce pisco, a type of brandy spirit. The leaves are waxy, and the grapes are plump beneath the warm desert sun.

After the meal, you step onto a boat with your guide ready to traverse the Pacific waters to view the spectacular wildlife around Paracas National Reserve. Water mists from the hull of the boat casting droplets onto your cheeks, and the sunlight glints against the turquoise sea leading to the cobalt hues of the deep water. The park encompasses nearly 1,300 square miles, over 450 of which consists of land, while the remainder is made up of protected waters. The slate gray wings of Inca terns are nearly camouflaged by the rocks on which they are perched, but the stunning yellow patch beneath their eyes and orange beak betrays their location. Sea lions bask in the sunlight and laze on the rocks as you glide peacefully along the water. The water splashes against the beaches that are set beneath the sheer cliffs. The boat leads you to a colony of Humboldt penguins which prefer the cold water in the currents flowing across the Pacific. The penguins are shy as your boat approaches so your skipper keeps a nice distance so you can watch the penguins interact with one another without fear. They dive into the water in search of fish, using their wings to fly through the current. You return to shore in Paracas where you will learn the best techniques to craft the perfect ceviche, allowing the citrus to cook the fish while keeping the flavors bright and fresh."

The image of the Andes spreads before you, revealing the high-altitude plain, the lushness of the Sacred Valley, and the colorful clothing of customary Andean communities. The town of Maras is celebrated for their saltpans that are terraced along the sides of the canyon. The geometric pools have allowed locals to harvest the coveted cooking ingredient since the time of the Inca. A small stream trickles into the interlocking pools near the town of Maras where the pools cascade down the hillside resembling a series of uneven steps. When the water evaporates, it leaves the salt crystals for harvesters to scrape away from the ground using simple instruments. Local families continue to control the saltpans, and they transport the harvest spice across the Sacred Valley. You continue to a home brewery run by a family along the valley slopes. The family is known for producing the celebrated drink known as chichi morada which is made from fermented corn. The sweet and tart brew offers an alcoholic bite once bottled.

Agricultural terraces climb the slopes beneath the dramatic stone ruins atop the plateau, narrow cobblestone lanes wind between homes inhabited since the 13th century, and stairs run along the edges of the unbroken terraces leading to the fortress. Inca warriors once watched from the plateau for Spanish invaders crossing the Sacred Valley, and this vantage point provides a perfect panorama. A trail guides you to the unfinished wall of the Six Monoliths where the giant boulders weigh 50 tons each. The Princess Bath decorates the ceremonial area and religious center. This intricate décor was carved from a single piece of granite, taking water from the Patakanch River flowing through the mountains. From here, you have a view of the old store houses across the valley and the Face of Wiracocha, a portrayal of the deity the Inca carved into the natural contours of the landscape to commemorate the creator. You continue to the village of Cachiccata where you discover a large hole smoking with hot stones. Local chefs have already begun the pachamanca , a traditional underground barbecue turning the earth into an oven.

The typical cuisine of the region consists of shellfish, seaweed, birds, and livestock in a continuation of ancient traditions. The scent of Shambar soup, which blends Spanish, Criollo, and Andean gastronomical customs, drifts out of the restaurants as you find your way to the Cassinelli Museum which offers a private archeological collection located in the basement of a gas station. The unique display showcases more than 2,000 ceramic pieces, including a stunning whistling pot shaped like a bird. When air blows through the pot, the sound becomes a clear, crisp musical note and, when asked, the curator offers examples of the whistle, allowing visitors to listen to the same sounds heard by the pre-Columbian peoples of Chan Chan. The calls correspond to those of male and female birds, allowing you to hear the simple pleasures captured through sound centuries ago. The preserved structures, unique culture, and stunning connection to the local archeology welcomes you back to Peru in a different and pleasantly unexpected light, leading you to the Sun and Moon Temples in the late afternoon.

After breakfast, your guide greets you in the hotel lobby and escorts you to the gates of Chan Chan, the largest pre-Columbian complex in the Americas and the largest adobe city in the world. The outer reaches of the former grand city have eroded over the years of heavy rain and floods. You make your way closer to the center, where the restored Tschudi complex reveals broad plazas and a royal burial chamber. Sunlight washes over the adobe bricks and unique latticed designs and the scent of hot soil fills the air. At its peak, the city had 60,000 inhabitants and retained vast amounts of wealth even after the Inca conquered the Chimú Empire. Ten walled citadels once protected the various districts of the city, each containing a royal burial mound stuffed with ceramics, weavings, and jewelry. Your guide leads you to the Ceremonial Courtyard, where 13-foot tall interior walls shine with geometric designs. Images of sea otters float along the ground-level, which are the last of the original embellishments, and you find remnants of the walls reaching nearly 330 feet tall. The adobe friezes outside of the courtyard depict stunning images of rippling waves and fish swimming beneath lines of seabirds, the character and fluidity bringing a marvelous flare to the historic artwork."

At breakfast, you sip a delicious coffee made from beans sourced across Peru, discovering the unique flavors and aromas of properly prepared coffee. After the meal, your private transfer greets you in the lobby and escorts you into the northern highlands to reach the town of Cajamarca. Rugged mountains envelop the skyline, surrounding the sleepy valley and colonial architecture. Adobe red-tiled roofs glint in the sunlight, representing the village roots of the growing population. Fertile farmland shimmers with verdant grass and lively crops nestled between the mountainous slopes and cobbled lanes. Locals wear wide-brimmed hats and colorful scarves. Gorgeous churches border Plaza de Armas and the former grandeur of the city is reflected in the narrow streets leading outward from the city center where baroque mansions once belonging to wealthy landowners now hold graceful accommodations and refined restaurants. The local community prides itself on delicious homemade yogurts and cheeses. The pace of the day moves slowly, allowing you to settle in at your preferred stride. Your guide leads you to the steps on Santa Apolonia Hill. Atop the summit stands the “Inca Seat,” where the head of the Inca would address his subjects from on high, visible to the community when looking up from the streets. Today, the hillside provides a splendid view of the colonial city and mountains."

The volcanic rock shimmers with peculiar golden hues, and the cupola of the neighboring baroque church provides contrast to the lavishly decorated walls along El Complejo de Belen. After breakfast, you venture with your private guide to the ancient grounds of Cumbe Mayo. The archaeological splendor represents one of the oldest structures in the Americas, dating back more than 3,000 years. The elevation of 11,000 feet things the air and tufts of grass and sporadic boulders roll along the high-altitude plain. Your guide points to the beginning of the Pre-Incan aqueduct, which travels a length of five miles. The historic feat of hydraulic engineering collected water from the Atlantic watershed and redirected it to the Pacific. Archeologists believe the structure was created around 1,500 BC. The crisp air of the mountains bites at your cheeks, and the thinner atmosphere allows the sunlight to shine stronger over the rocks and grasslands. Petroglyphs surround numerous caverns, representing untranslatable images belonging to the civilization which carved the aqueduct around the remote mountainous region. You point out the zigzag formation of the canals and learn about the theory that the angles helped slow the water flow, allowing the water to irrigate. You continue into the Stone Forest, also known as “Los Frailones,” which means Stone Monks. The volcanic pillars reach as much as 60 feet tall and were carved out of the volcanic rock through millennia of erosion."

Orchids grow in the garden outside of the thatched roof house and alpacas graze on the grass keeping the lawn manicured around the cobbled walkways. The tranquil nature of the museum accompanies the natural warmth of the city, set at an altitude of nearly 6,000 feet above sea level, far below the 11,000 feet you experienced while at Cumbe Mayo. Your guide introduces you to the gallery erected in the 1990s to house the nearly 220 mummies discovered 25 miles outside of town at the Laguna of the Condors. The mummies offer insight into the burial customs of the Chachapoyas people who did not embalm their dead and instead chose specific areas where the microclimates aided in preservation. Leather and unspun cotton preserved the facial features, while the body was wrapped in layers of cloth. Outside of the museum, you meet with a woodcarver inspired by the archeological finds around Leymebamba. The studio is filled with the scent of wood shavings as the artist welcomes you into the studio and shows you works related to the ancient features displayed in the museum, from ceramic works to the mummies themselves. Local weavers greet you with open arms, eager to show you the customary techniques of shearing, dying, and weaving alpaca wool. They begin by showing you the ways the various dyes are made including the way the color masters derive hues from the cochineal bug. After drying in the sun, the dyers use a mortar and pestle to grind the ingredient, adding water or oil to shape the dye into shades of red, pink, and various hues of purple."

You follow your guide to the forgotten fortress of Kuelap, which rises out of the mixture of tropical scenery and cloud forest. The road switches back along the mountain leading to a mile-long trail. The elevation reaches nearly 10,000 feet above sea level, and your first view of the ancient site is dramatic and breathtaking, featuring 65-foot tall walls made entirely out of stone. The Chachapoyas lived in the northern Andes nearly eight centuries before the Incas, and history refers to the civilization as the Cloud Warriors. Red bromeliads blossom against the moss twisting along the trees. The mountainous ridges dip into the canyon to the west, the verdant rainforest spreads across the east, and llamas graze on the grass and chew in the tranquil ambiance. Emerald summits burst through the occasional passing clouds. This fortress was erected between the 6th and 16th centuries, and you take in the way the limestone rocks shine with hints of gold. Many of the stones are 10 times the volume of the stones used to create the Pyramids at Giza. Giant mortars in the complex helped crush herbs, and your guide helps you navigate the maze of deep pits, circular homes, and a wall at the heart of the complex reaching almost 2,000 feet long."

The colonial structures remain, surrounding the central market and leading to the ancient ruins of the Chachapoyas. At breakfast, you enjoy a refreshing cup of coffee before traveling to a local plantation to learn more about the cultivation of the internationally renowned beverage. Coffee is one of Peru’s most popular exports, totaling 4.2 million bags in 2016. When in bloom, the coffee plants produce stunning white petals emanating a jasmine fragrance. Your guide leads you along the pathways winding between the coffee crop on the organic cooperative where red berries dangle from the plant ready to be harvested. The berries look nothing like the coffee beans you expected and instead have a bright, vibrant coating as they dry in the sun until ready for roasting. Your guide offers you a selection of light, medium, and bold roasts to try and you find the different aromas emerging from the beans. You dig your fingers into the beans to feel the dry, grainy texture and how it differs from the waxy, plump berry. In the tasting room, your guide heats water to a perfect 195 degrees, the temperature best for brewing coffee, and pours the water over the ground beans in a circular motion.

The Spanish founded the city in the 18th century along the Cumbaza River. Cloud forest plunges into the Amazon basin creating a unique collection of microclimates and ecosystems, and you pass by banana, cocoa, corn, and coffee plantations. En route to the town, you stop in the village of Lamas, which is known for its distinctive mix of cultures, and is where people of both indigenous and Spanish descent inhabit the upper plateau. The indigenous community resides on the lower slopes beneath the facade of the faux-European castle. The streets on the plateau lead to open terraces around 3,000 feet above sea level. The village was founded in the mid-17th century as one of the first jungle settlements in Peru. You continue to the Ahuashiyacu Waterfalls and watch as the stunning natural cascade tumbles more than 130 feet into the waiting pool. The walls narrow into a small crevice where smooth stone frames the whitewater. The sound of splashing water echoes against the stone, the mist rustles the encircling leaves, and the spray spreads from around the base of the waterfall providing a refreshing spritz in the tropical heat."

The defensive walls zigzag for nearly 1,000 feet creating a unique formation modeled after the teeth of a puma. Only 20 percent of the original fortress remains.

They can grow to nearly 30 inches long and have pronounced black plumage outlining their white underbellies and streaking their foreheads. The spines on their tongues help to hold their wiggling prey during a hunt, and they have a distinctive call that sounds similar to a long, bursting kazoo. You watch as one dives into the placid water, revealing how it flaps its wings as if flying through the current."

For an educational experience, you can tour Tambo Colorado, also known as Puka Tampu. Red paint once draped over the Inca lowland outpost, which is the best-preserved Inca archeological site on the southern coast. Archaeologists believe that the complex was a control point for passing traffic consisting mostly of conquered peoples around the borders of the empire. You find spots on which the red, yellow, and white colors have remained, adding bright bursts to the prevalent regional material instead of neatly cut stone. You wander amongst the storehouses, living quarters, and military installations for a better understanding of the distinctive complex, offering a hidden reward to archeology fans and those interested in the Inca."

The trickle of the fountain drifts through the air. A crowd of people strolls through the plaza. The Government Palace stands along the square with grace and power, its structure dating back to a different era, shown by the beautiful frilled façade. Soldiers stand along the courtyard in silence, staring out into the square with focus. Carnations bring a vibrant white and red hue to the plaza, blossoming against the green grass in resemblance of the Peruvian flag. The Church of San Francisco is a jewel from the 16th century. The bright yellow façade seems even livelier in contrast to its white trim. The bells peel and add a touch of music to the streets. The stunning entrance resembles an opulent mouth, sitting between the spired bell towers. Enter into the magnificent church where the scent of myrrh and frankincense fill the open space. Red and white tiles climb the pillars and over the archways. The courtyard is garnished with blossomed trees and a pleasant tiered fountain. Follow your guide beneath the foundation of the church where the true draw lies. In the catacombs of San Francisco the air is a bit damp and your footsteps echo off of the walls. Travel through the darkness where the flickering bulbs make you feel like someone is holding a torch and you’re exploring the depths of a secret, ancient burial ground. Once out of the catacombs the air is sweet, with the sea breeze blowing through the streets as you venture to Miraflores for an evening along the shore."

Watch as the cobblestone streets wind along the city, over the hills, and through the narrow spaces where buildings almost kiss. The Spanish colonial mark is still present within the city, the architectural beauty stunning along the altitudinal hillside and built on the foundation of the Inca capital. The Church of Santo Domingo rises above street level, its terraced stairs gracefully reaching the opulent door. The brick cathedral was built on top of the old Sun Temple of Koricancha, and looks like a regular church from the entrance. The street slopes down around the outside of Santo Domingo; you step inside and can see the magnitude of the cathedral. The courtyard is tiled with arches running around the border. The dome stands high and affluent beside the entrance, and looking up at the structure from the gardens makes the greatness of the church all the more prevalent, as the tiered gardens lower beside the sloping street outside. A trip to Cusco would be incomplete without a visit to Santo Domingo and a chance to witness the grandeur of the Inca influence on the Spanish architecture within the Andean city."

The Principal Temple stands over the majority of the city, its name deriving from its solidity and near perfect construction.

It should be witnessed as the collective city that it is, as opposed to separate structures on the mountain plateau. Wander through the stone ruins with the scent of morning dew evaporating from the hills and gaze at the height of the peak of Huayna Picchu, the mountain that lingers over the Lost City like a watchful eye. With only 200 people allowed to climb Huayna Picchu per day, join the road less traveled with a journey to the top. Sign your name in the history books, literally, as you will be required to sign into the guestbook at the booth at the base of the mountain. The damp, rocky foothills and lush trees stretching over the pass replace the cologne of fresh grass. The stairs can be steep at times and the rope that helps guide the walkway can be coarse; however, the mountains are stunning, the air is crisp and the clouds linger below you as you climb. Arrive at the peak of Huayna Picchu where you can look the surrounding mountains in the eye and view the panorama of the valley beneath the Lost City. The only way you will be able to describe the vista of Machu Picchu will be “breathtaking.” The climb down the mountainside will come with a cool breeze. The wonders of the citadel opened up to you from below, sparkling with secrets.

Considered one of the most geographically diverse regions in the world from towering mountain peaks to low-lying valleys and from grassy plains and sparkling coastlines to the hidden wonders of the Amazonian Jungle, Peru is an ideal location for a scenic hike among luscious green foliage. You will venture to Lomas de Lucumo, where you can trek through the dense cloud forest along well-established trails. You should also keep watch for bursting flowers, mossy green cliff sides, and hilly terrain. At the peak of the rainy season, a mystic fog may descend on the region and beckon you to indulge in a closer look. At each bend in the road, new beauties are unveiled. In the evening, you will return to Lima for your final evening in the city. Water's edge will set the scene for an idyllic last night in the city while you bite into citrusy ceviche and sip on sweet chica morada juice."

The landscape is majestic, with the earthen stones standing against the vibrant green floor as the hills wind and wrap into one another. Venture into the ruins to see the Incan remains up close.

The rough rocks and stone steps of the trail urge you forward. Once at the top you can see the open valley that you have crossed so far and the mountain you have undoubtedly climbed. The vines open and give a view of the stunning Phuyupatamarca ruins, standing against the hillside with the valley sitting far below. From the proper angle it looks like the ruins are cut in half, coming to a steep angle along the tiered mountain. The view of the mountain peaks stand tall in the distant sky while the valley becomes almost invisible. The stones of the city’s remains are covered in moss and time. Witness the grandeur of the craft by walking along paths that are semi-detached from the mountain, where rocks fill up ravines in perfect order saving the trail from the undulating Andean hills.

Step forward and you look out over the breathtaking view of the Lost City of Machu Picchu, where the sun shines along the dew, the stone remains stand high over the valley, and panorama is something out of a painting; you almost pinch yourself to make sure it’s real. Within the city traverse the grounds and experience the history within Intihuatana , the “hitching post of the sun.” It is the rock pillar known as the sundial that stands atop the Intihuatana hill.

Built in an indigenous architectural style, your lodge is perched on a river beneath a lush canopy of Shihuahuaco trees. You will be connected to nature here while still enjoying most Western comforts. Most importantly, you will enjoy all the space and privacy that the Amazon effortlessly creates. You will check into the lodge and take your first wilderness foray this afternoon. A guide will lead you along a trail of 160-foot trees, past strangler figs, and up to canopy viewpoints. They will also show you the rambunctious monkeys and take your bird watching if you desire. You will return to the lodge for sunset before taking a different trail after dark. At night, colorful daytime birds will be replaced by owls, and capybaras will be replaced with nightjars. With a roving spotlight, you may spot a caiman’s glowing red eyes and other strange nocturnal creatures. The tours here are private so you can choose how far to walk, with options to extend or reduce the excursion depending on how you are feeling."

        "description": "The advantage of a lodge stay over a cruise is that you can tailor a program to your interests. There is more flexibility over time and more varied options. Reserva Amazonica is also much closer and easier to reach when combining the Amazon with Machu Picchu. It is also good to maximize the early morning and late afternoon when it is cooler and therefore easier to explore. The wildlife will also be more active in the mornings and evenings. Midday in the jungle is best spent at the lodge, sipping on drinks in air-conditioned comfort. In comparison, the advantage of an Amazonian cruise is that it can cover more ground, so you see new places while resting on board. Note that this is a handcrafted itinerary, so a lodge stay can be switched for a three-night cruise should you desire. You will have options for today. You will take a boat to Lake Sandoval, where cappuccino monkeys gather in large troops, and giant river otters peek their heads above the water. You will explore the lake in a wooden canoe, searching for monkeys and strange prehistoric creatures such as hoatzins and anacondas. At the Canopy Interpretation Center, you will wander across suspension bridges high above the forest floor, where you will seek orchids, woodpeckers, trogons, three species of monkeys and if luck is on your side, Amazonian sloths. You will cross another bridge to the Aguajales swamps, which is a lush mire of mud and water that is loved by rare amphibians and snakes."

They will appear elegant and graceful, yet when they shout, it will be like a call of war. In comparison, the cappuccino monkeys are small, cute, and playful creatures that are always on the move. Toucans and scarlet macaws are another pair of Amazon animals that are best understood once you are here. There will be side-neck turtles, palm creepers, piranhas, caimans, herons, sub grebes, and dozens of other species, all in addition to the hundreds of plant species that you will view. During one activity you will learn about the medicinal properties of plants, while on another you will walk and canoe to intimate wildlife encounters. Sometimes, there is no wildlife, and you will remember that this is the biggest jungle of all and that exploring the Amazon is nothing like being in a zoo. You will be in the wild, discovering what the animals are really like. Then, you will turn a corner, and a monkey may be looking straight back into your eyes. Three nights is the perfect length of time here as you can try different activities while also getting a strong feel for the landscape. Two nights can feel rushed while spending any longer would eat into your time for other Peruvian experiences."

You will take a rumbling train journey through the forest and then a stuttering road transfer up the mountain. It will be easy to see how the place went undiscovered for so long. Machu Picchu really is in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by wild mountains that are almost too steep to walk upon. You will check into your hotel and then finish your journey, walking up thick steps as the citadel unfolds before you. Finally, you will catch your breath and look out towards the Sugarloaf Mountains. Before you even reach for the camera, there will be a moment when time seems to stand still. Machu Picchu is full of mystery, and there is so much to see that you may not be able to make sense of it all on your initial visit, especially when the llamas are running about, and the vistas keep holding you captive. So take your time, take in the tales, walk through the abandoned citadel, and sulk in the once-in-a-lifetime experience."

By staying up here you can wait until just about dark and can be back at Machu Picchu for sunrise the following day. One option this morning will be to climb Huayna Picchu, a sacred mountain of Inca shrines behind the citadel. If this is not for you, then you may simply take another look around, making up your own ideas about what life must have been like here centuries ago. After a second hotel breakfast, you will be transferred down the mountain and will take a train to Ollantaytambo before taking a road transfer back through Urubamba Valley to Cusco. Machu Picchu is the lost city while Cusco is the capital city and home to an incredible collection of tiered fortresses and temples. To the Incas, it was the spiritual center of the universe, but to the Spanish, it became an important colonial capital. The mix is mostly harmonious, with gold-gilded churches next to early Inca ruins and shrines that seem to be holding secrets. Almost the entire city is carved from stone, from Qorikancha (the most important temple) to Sacsayhuaman, a great citadel and fortress. You will spend the afternoon exploring a handful of highlights, picking up from where you left on day six and then ending at Plaza de Armes, which is an energetic main square where locals hang out each evening."

Necks poke from shells, tiny green shards drop from a mouth, and intriguing eyes watch as you approach. Go slowly, stay silent, and the tortoise just stares straight back at you, before dipping its head once more for a flurry of grass. After flying from Quito to the Galapagos, your first wildlife site is this remarkable refuge for tortoises. They're all wild, some of them over a century old and weighing in at an impressive 550 pounds. Not only are the tourists symbolic of the evolution on the islands, but they're also indicative of how close you'll be getting to wildlife. Five feet is the national park rule, and the wildlife leaves an impression that ensures this is always obeyed. There's another dramatic site on route to the tortoises. Stop at Los Gemelos, two sinkholes redolently suggestive of the volcanic beauty to come. Step onto one of the finest luxury boats in the Galapagos. Carrying 48 passengers, the boat’s greatest asset is its size. Cabins are extremely spacious, as are the dedicated dining area and downstairs lounge. An upper deck is equipped with sun-loungers and a small bar, where drinks and appetizers are served when you return from excursions. A library and jacuzzi offer further space to relax.

Walking over a lava flow, you get a deep sense of the islands' volcanic history, with thousands of spirals and twists rolling across the landscape. There's no wildlife in such a desolate place, but the walk is an inspiring reminder of how these islands are formed. Then, enjoy dinner on board before you shift and cruise north. If it's a clear evening, you can enjoy some impressive star gazing from the upper deck."

        "description": "Genovesa is one of nature's great islands, home to a staggering collection of seabirds and mating displays. Today, you visit two sites, Darwin Bay, and Prince Phillip's Steps, both havens for the most iconic of Galapagos birds. Thousands of magnificent frigates look for a mate, pumping up their red chests to attract flying females. Each aims to be bigger and brighter than the next. Whenever there's interest, the birds must then demonstrate their ability to prepare a nest. Nearby, you see lots of red. The unforgettable feet of red-footed boobies stand over single eggs, protecting the next colorful descendent of this bizarre looking species. There are approximately 200,000 of these iconic birds, many of them huddled together on large breeding grounds. Fur seals and storm petrels hang around the edge of the cliffs while marine iguanas betray their camouflage as they wander across the beach. This is only the second island in the archipelago where you can see red-footed boobies, and they're joined by Nazca boobies. Perhaps over a million birds are found here, and you're not glimpsing them from a distance. Nesting sites are practically on the hiking trail, and the colorful mating displays don't require a zoomed camera lens. It's an intimate and unending display of nature's intricacies, whether you're watching frigates posture or admiring a tiny fluffy chick stand flightless on a nest. Snorkeling and kayaking are also possible in Darwin's Bay, and there's also some snorkeling with sea lion opportunities in the morning. After the day on Genovesa, have farewell cocktails and the last dinner of your cruise."

It's like they've come to wave farewell and offer a blubbery grunt to send you back to the mainland. From Baltra Island and its airport, you fly back to Quito where you're transferred to a nearby spa hotel. Two pools and a massage room offer a tranquil last evening in South America before your flight tomorrow."

        "description": "The city of Cusco creates a marvelous ambiance at an elevation of over 11,000 feet above sea level. Spanish Colonial churches stand atop strong foundations set by the Inca and the boulder walls of Sacsayhuaman remain strong on the hill overlooking the city. The black and gray colors of the ruin’s stones shimmer in the passing sunlight surrounding by the rolling peaks of the Andes Mountains. The Inca crafted the boulders like puzzle pieces, fitting each stone together without the need for mortar, and the snug positioning keeps objects as thin as a blade of grass from entering between the stones. Your flight lands at Alejandro Velasco Astete International Airport, where your private transfer greets you upon arrival. Cusco offers a captivating atmosphere shaped by the cobblestone streets, tiled rooftops, and urban sprawl winding along the bordering slopes. The Central Market is filled with the aromas of fresh popcorn and simmering chicken soup. Produce, such as purple corn and a variety of potatoes line the aisles against large bags of quinoa and beans. The church of La Compania de Jesus was erected in the 16th century and rebuilt after an earthquake in the mid-1600’s. The church boasts a grand facade competing with the beauty of the crowning cathedral in the Plaza de Armas. The baroque design of the exterior gives way to the magnificent gold altarpiece of the interior, which hosts a series of shimmering polychrome statues. The structure was erected on the foundations of the Huayna Capac Palace, home to the last ruler of the Inca Empire. Consider reading some of our travelers' Peru vacation reviews for more information on this exhilarating tour."

The fresh, crisp air contains an herbaceous aroma as the marked trail winds down the slopes into the valley, leading you down to just over 6,000 feet above sea level. You brush your fingers along the tall blades of soft, wet grass, leading you over nine miles. The high-altitude grasses around the trail give way to the blossoming flowers budding along the edges of the stream.

The atmosphere begins to thin once more due to the high elevation, making the steep climb an exciting challenge and the rigorous adventure leads you to the incredible ruins at Choquequirao, of which only 30 percent have been excavated. Orchids blossom alongside the trail, their purple, white, and yellow petals bouncing in the gentle breeze. Gigantic terraces continue to texture the hills beneath the ruins where the Inca tended to crops. The hidden city is often referred to as the “Sister to Machu Picchu,” due to its overlooked nature and secluded location. Wild vegetation surrounds the unearthed ruins and irrigation channels, filling the air with a musky aroma. The main structures have thick stone walls spanning the terraces. Five structures in total reflect the temple, plaza, and warehouses utilized by the community and the priests. The distinctive sections across the hidden city demonstrate the divisions between social and religious life, leading to the 16 ceremonial platforms in Sector II."

You relish the news of having to hike only a little over seven miles to your next campsite, stopping first in the village of Yanama. Until recently, no roads existed in the Yanama Valley, and horses or mules had to bring all materials and goods over the mountainous landscape and into this pastoral scene.

Along the islands you can see sea lions frolicking along the shore. The water rushes up the beach, some sea lions sunbathe, their fins spread open to the heat, while others flop into the water with a large splash. Within the confines of little caves you can spot Humboldt penguins, their white and black feathers swirling like a hypnotic circle along the craggy rocks. Return to the shores and visit the Huacachina Oasis where the sand stretches over dunes giving you a piece of the Sahara desert near the Peruvian coast.

The herds frolic and leap as you pass beside them, watching you with wide-eyed curiosity.

As the clouds drift past you can see the rolling mountain peaks covered in snow and piercing the sky. Andean condors glide through the air on thermal patches, circling the trees, their wide wingspan impressive in afternoon sky. Exit the nature sanctuary and continue on to visit Sayhuite, an archeological site that was once a center for the water worshipers whose incredible draw is a circular boulder around eight-feet high and over 30 meters in circumference that features more than 200 animal figures and geometric shapes carved into its surface.

The Sun Temple shines along the hillside with red brick, like the light of the sun. The jovial sounds of the Pisac market fill the town. The colors of plush and vibrant textiles explode like a rainbow across the vendors. Soft blankets and comfortable shirts are some of the items over which you can hear the locals bargain. Even with an influx of visitors over the past years, the market retains its traditional charm and antediluvian customs. Continue to the village of Ollantaytambo where the stone steps that lead through the Incan town stand above ancient working aqueducts. The terraces of the Ollantaytambo ruins line the mountainside climbing to the peak. You can almost see the remnants of the Inca temple beneath the swooping granite. Parts of the ruins are built directly into the mountain, beneath the rock face, while the fortress overlooks the valley as a line of defense against an attack of lowland tribes. The lush grass perfumes the air as the terraces remain but the agricultural use of the tiers have been absent for decades. Whether you wander through the streets of the old town or the stairs of the ruins, the adventure has taken you off-road and into the hills.

The hills are taken over by plush jungle, leaves dangling over the glass, orchids sprouting over branches. You arrive in Aguas Calientes and take a brief journey to the citadel of the Lost City. Climb the stone steps from the entrance and onto the open terrace of Machu Picchu. You can feel the blood rushing through you, the excitement pulsing in your veins as you discover its majesty. Follow your guide over the terraces, along the stone stairs and into the Sacred Plaza. Within the plaza you can see the snowcapped peak of Cordillera Vilcabamba and the Urubamba River below. The stone remnants are cold to the touch as your guide tells you about the “Hitching Post of the Sun,” a rock pillar carved to look like a sundial that allowed Inca astronomers to predict solstices using the angles of the column. Llamas graze along the open spaces and empty terraces.

Tour the wonders of Cusco beginning with the Spanish architecture of Plaza de Armas. The cathedral was built with stones taken from the Sacsayhuaman fortress that hovers over the city like a protective older brother. The huge main doors of the cathedral are open to worshippers where the interior is perfumed with myrrh and showcases the glittering silver and gold-sided chapels where elaborate platforms and altars provide for a different atmosphere than the sparseness of the exterior stonework. You can also see the oldest surviving painting in Cuzco that represents the city during the earthquake of 1650. The people are shown parading around the Plaza de Armas with a crucifix, praying for the earthquake to stop; and it worked.

Rumbling onwards the train will travel down the hill, and panoramic windows will show you an almost claustrophobically narrow valley. There is no road to Machu Picchu, just the single-track railway or hiking trails, and the scenery is stunning. You will disembark at Aguas Calientes, which will be the only town for many miles. It will still be morning, and most people will want to rush straight up to Machu Picchu. It is best to wait for the crowd to die down. Mornings are far more popular than afternoons, so can check into your hotel, have some lunch, and then set off up the mountain. A road transfer will takes you skywards, and it is quite a journey, twisting and turning towards an impossibly remote location. While the road is steep, remember that Machu Picchu is at less than 8,000 feet and your body will appreciate the increased oxygen after being in the Urubamba Valley. There are two famous climbs on both side of Machu Picchu: Huayna Picchu and Machu Picchu Mountain. These are not recommended for senior travelers; However, note that permits for these climbs require visitors to trek at a specific time in the morning. This is one reason the old citadel will be very busy around 7 to 11 a.m. The other reason is that people will want to see Machu Picchu emerging from its hazy morning mist, which is a surreal sight that nobody can ever have to themselves. Only a small fraction of daily visitors will use their Machu Picchu permit in the afternoon, and when the citadel is quieter, you can fully appreciate its magic. Plus, there will be no rushing or pushing along the steep steps. With the hard part over, you can now go down through the citadel, former ceremonial sites, precise stone walls, intact temples, vernacular houses, llamas grazing on terraced fields, and the jigsaw pieces of a Lost City. By 4 p.m. there will be hardly anyone left in the citadel, so you will be able to bask in the privacy. This is more an intact city than a city in ruins, yet the stories can only be theories, for nobody truly knows why or how Machu Picchu came to be, which only adds to the mystique of this new world wonder."

The evenings will be experiential as well, particularly incorporating all of the life and energy of the Plaza de Armas, where Quechua dance troupes will rehearse, and first-floor terraces will provide a great spot for sundowners. Over these two days you will discover how the ancient Incan capital has changed into a mature city of old and new culture. Llamas will graze at the vast Sacsayhuaman fortress. You will find mystique at the Temple of the Sun (Qoricancha) as well as energy at the daily market. Spanish and Inca styles will blur seamlessly together, mingling with Quechua lifestyles, wide-eyed tourists, and hints of contemporary Latin America."

The trendy seaside neighborhood of Miraflores stands above crashing waves and the lingering perfume of lemon from fresh ceviche. The lighthouse twirls in black and white stripes along the edges of the shore, giving light to the dark ocean and to the surrounding boardwalk it stands beside. Parque de la Muralla hovers around the edges of Lima where the heart of the city was once encircled by a large wall. Most of the fortification was torn down as the city expanded; however, a set of excavated pieces of the wall remain within the park, where a bronze statue of Francisco Pizarro stands in silence while Peruvian teens gaze into each others’ eyes."

The Inca remnants of the city sit beneath the Spanish architecture and rise above the streets overlooking the entire valley. The Plaza de Armas was the heart of the Inca capital and today continues to be just as important. Two flags fly above the square in the gentle mountain breeze, the red and white of the Peruvian flag, and the rainbow flag of Tahuantinsuyo, representing the four quarters of the Inca Empire. Stroll along the rounded stones of the Loreto alleyway, where Inca walls line the cobblestones and continue to give access to the square. The monoliths of Sacsayhuaman overlook the rolling hills of the valley and stand above the streets of Cusco, an impressive reminder of Inca engineering ingenuity. The large boulders are cold on your fingertips as you brush over the stones to see how they are pressed together. They were mined, cut, and forced together using nothing more than the intricate change and their body weight to stay in position for centuries. Once inside the fortress, you can venture through trapezoidal archways, where stones cling together without mortar. Climb to the top of the walls, tiered for a grander view of the cityscape, and experience the Andes from 10,750 feet above sea level, with Cusco beginning to glow in the silhouette of the late afternoon sun."

The old guard sits along the citadel overlooking the valley where a series of ceremonial baths continue to line the hillside. Across the gorge you can see a variety of Inca tombs honeycombing the cliff. Within the bustling joys of the town you can see the colors of the Andes sweep across the market, from the clothing of the locals to the textiles of the vendors; even the produce shines sensational greens, yellows, and reds along the flavorful sight of the bazaar. In Ollantaytambo the village remains almost unchanged from the Inca city that it used to be. The homes have trapezoid archways that keep the stones together without mortar and sealing cracks which keeps the home cool in the summer and warm in the winter. Along the terraced hill you can see the lingering stones of the once grand temple. The Wall of Six Monoliths is a rich pink color that stands tall against the backdrop of the mountain peaks. You hear the gentle trickle of water from the Bath of the Princess, a fountain cut from a single boulder with ornate designs and an aqueduct system that still works centuries later. The sky turns cooler in the later afternoon and you return to Cusco for the evening."

You begin to ascend a stone staircase, your heart racing, the air cool, the stones cold, until the stairs come to an end, the wall opens and you look out over the towering city of Machu Picchu standing 1,000 feet above the valley below. Wander through this Wonder of the World with the stone buildings practically glittering in the sunlight. Terraces climb the mountainside. In the distance you can see llamas grazing on the abundant vegetation. Stand at the highest point of the city at the House of the Priest, and look over the stones and temples, along with the labyrinthine complex and its collection of cells, niches, and passageways in the lower corner. Stand in the Temple of the Three Windows where the trapezoidal windows line the wall and the stone slab captures the exact angle of the sun at sunrise.

The luxury river cruiser offers open cabanas along the deck and vistas throughout the dining room to ensure the best view of the water, the riverbanks, and the sensational skyline. The scent of luscious Peruvian fair with a European flare drifts along the deck: succulent chicken, zesty spice rub, and choclo, large kernel corn.

You peak above the marsh and see a colony of Hoatzin calling to one another with the guttural noise. They look to be the size of a chicken, with colorful plumage and a Mohawk, giving them a punk rock edge. A cool breeze brushes along the water taking away a moment of the dense air as you make your way back to the ship. Shallow bottomed boats motor or paddle by the cruise ship, their drivers waving to you with large smiles and grand gesticulation. The trees stand at the edge of the riverbanks without an end to the forest in sight. The Ucayali River winds and twists, carving through the dense expanse of trees. Watch as fisherman line and net the incredibly diverse fish of the river. The men show off their skill and understanding of their profession and of the water, catching the beautifully odd “armored” catfish, whose skin resembles a turtle shell due to their bony plates that also cover their mouths.

Come to an opening in the forest where the native people have learned to subsistence farm, cultivating wild plants and trees to earn income from the wealth of fruit trees and medicinal plants hidden in the jungle. The sweet scent of camu-camu, a tasty, creamy, native fruit filled with antioxidants, rolls along the forest floor. The sun drifts into the late afternoon and you skiff along the Pacaya River, to see Ranger Station Number 1 where sensational and plentiful life is hidden within the canopy of the rainforest. Capuchin monkeys rush through the branches. The cologne of rich, dense vegetation surrounds you. The heavy guttural call of howler monkeys sounds like a prehistoric dinosaur ambling in the trees. As the sun sets their howls turn to snarls, deep warnings that designate their territory; the sounds of the rainforest collect into a symphony of movement and calls across the treetops."

Their jovial nature and playful attitude has given them a peaceful cohabitation with the natives. In the trees macaws stand out with bright blue and red feathers, flapping their wings within the canopy in the distance.

Tour through the city, on your own or with a guide, and experience the fabulous and vibrant life of Lima. The cathedral stands tall along the Plaza de Armas ; spires rise high into the air with Spanish opulence on either side of the entrance. The bells chime on the hour and fill the square with music. Wander into Lima’s old train station, now a cultural center known to the locals as Casa de la Literatura Peruana , which means House of Peruvian Literature. The façade of the building glows yellow in the warm Lima sun. The white painted pillars stand out against the yellow and build upward towards the ticking clock. The interior shines with colorful stained glass, the variety of colors shimmering along the floor. Where once the scent of polished tile would linger along the station, now the rooms are perfumed with books that show the deep range of Peruvian literary works. Wander around and through the stunning architecture of Torre Tagle Palace. The palace is considered to be one of the most stunning pieces of architecture in South America due to the unique elegance and grace of early 18th-century styling. The coat of arms of José B. Tagle is still hung above the door as the pink façade stands out against the hues of the city. Two sensationally carved wooden balconies adorn the façade and flank the stone-carved entrance. Venture inside to see the courtyard, styled like a Spanish villa, where wooden balconies wrap around the building and showcase the designed tile floors below. There is also plenty of time to visit Miraflores, one of Lima’s modern and majestic residential neighborhoods. The green of the grass and trees radiates against the blue of the sea. You can hear the gentle rush of the waves as they lap against the sand. The breeze brings in the sweet and salty aroma of the water. Visit the statue of lovers along the Calle de las Pizzas , where their comfortable embrace sits in stone forever along the shore."

Arequipa is located high along the Andes, ridged on the outskirts of Colca Canyon, and is the second most populous city in the country. Acclimate to the altitude of Arequipa with hot cup of coca tea. Wrap your fingers around the warm mug and let the leaves seep into the water. The slight bitterness is a welcomed flavor and gives a sense of calm in the height of the city. Arequipa is known for its stunning Plaza de Armas , where the architecture is pearled white and stands taller than the palm trees that decorate the square. The multi-tiered fountain rains and splashes in the afternoon sky. The cathedral stretches the length of the square with its spire almost dwarfing the trees. Made from sillar, a white volcanic stone, the pearl color is iridescent in the daylight and is illuminated by the light of the moon. El Misti, meaning the Gentleman, is the tallest of three volcanoes and whose silhouettes are visible behind the cathedral. Wander along the cobblestone streets of the city and find the Ice Maiden in the Andean Sanctuary Museum of Catholic University. Juanita, as she is known, is a well-preserved mummy discovered on the top of Mount Ampato almost 20 years ago. The museum is bright and active with people, from children to adults, curious about Juanita and the history of the region dating back around 500 years.

Alpaca sweaters and blankets are sold in tiny wooden sheds along the route. The wool is soft to the touch, soft enough to feel smooth from every angle.

Stop at Cruz del Condor , where a large cross sits off the roadway and marks the area for you to stop. The mountains are craggy and surround you. The valley is deep below you. Look into the air and watch the gentle gliding of condors, the largest flying birds in the Western Hemisphere. Their wingspan is impressive as they circle high above the mountaintops. As they swoop down into the valley you realize how large they actually are, how from a distance they seemed the size of an owl but they speed down to the earth and grow until their wingspan is as tall as you or the person standing next to you.

        "description": "The journey continues into the Urubamba Valley where you will arrive in Aguas Calientes, known for its spas and hot springs. The Urubamba River rushes along the sides of the city and through the incredible foothills of the mountains. It is a quick journey to the entrance of the fabled city of Machu Picchu. Follow your guide on a sensational walking tour through the ruins. It is almost like a storybook or an image from Indiana Jones. Huayna Picchu’s peak lingers in the sky ahead. The surrounding mountains undulate along the horizon. The rush of the Urubamba River has disappeared. The scent of fresh grass and damp stone rises from the earth. Your guide explains the majestic history of the Incas and the city in the clouds. Walk up the Inca Trail to the Sun Gate where the city of Machu Picchu can be seen through the remains of the temple. The plateau often gives those that choose to trek the Inca Trail the first glimpse of Machu Picchu at sunrise. From the temple’s remains to the variety of quarters and tiers, Machu Picchu is a city unlike any other, built along the mountaintop."

        "description": "Return to Machu Picchu with the sunlight barely peaking over the mountaintops. You will have the ruins virtually to yourself to enjoy a full-guided tour of the city. The clouds hover over the ruins. Your guide takes you around the stone walkways and through the history of the temple and possibly over the Inca Bridge, which is part of a mountain trail that heads west from Machu Picchu consisting of a stone path, part of which is cut into a cliff face. There is always time to climb Huayna Picchu, the towering peak that casts a shadow on the city. With only 200 visitors allowed on the Huayna Picchu trail per day, the experience is always unique and completely personal. Part of the trail is structured with stone stairs smoothed by wind and rainfall. The balancing rope strewn along the mountainside is course in your hands as you climb the sometimes-steep path. There is nothing better than reaching the tip of Huayna Picchu and looking down on the City in the Clouds from above, feeling as if you have surpassed the clouds all together, as if you stand in the highest depths of the sky. The city and people below are dwarfed, the air is crisp and pure, and the Urubamba River snakes though the valley in the distance. The clouds drift, the sun shines, and you make your way back to Aguas Calientes, as ready as you can be for your return to Cusco."

        "description": "Today you will make your way to the airport after a brief stop in Lima before your return journey home. Spend the morning before your departure winding along the cobblestones of Cusco one last time, memorizing the tiny alleys and vibrant galleries. Once in Lima you can enjoy a unique dining experience beside a 1,500 year-old pyramid. The decadent treats on the menu range from quinoa and corn dressed in green beneath succulent beef medallions, to fried yucca and lomo soltado , a Peruvian stir-fry. The salty crunch of the yucca and the grainy richness of the quinoa is enough of a reason to visit Huaca Pucllana; however, mixed with the scent of history from the architectural site, the experience is as unforgettable as Machu Picchu itself. After dinner you will make your way to your flight and wave goodbye to the delicacies, comforts, luxuries, and majesties of Peru, and say hello to home, never forgetting the depths in which you explored the history and culture of this country, as well as yourself."

The Plaza de Armas sits as the central jewel of the city where the colonial past can be seen in the brass of the trickling fountain. The palace rises over the square with the pride of the country’s flag billowing in the breeze. The gentle water sounds through the plaza and mixes with the bustle of the city. Carnations blossom in front of the palace displaying the red and white flair of the Peruvian flag almost mirroring the ebb and flow of the banner above. Opposite the palace is the bare pearled facade of the cathedral; the entrance is sensationally carved, standing in contrast to the canary yellow colonial buildings that frame the square. There is a slight air of citrus to the city emanating from the wealth of ceviche for which Lima is known. The air has a cool mist that drifts in from the sea. The lights begin to shimmer around the plaza, bringing the gentle evening over the city."

The Andes is the longest mountain range in the world, and in Cusco, you can watch the hilltops rise and fall along the skyline and beyond. The streets of the city wrap around the undulating earth with cobblestone beauty. Standing at 10,750 feet above sea level, the Spanish architecture is iridescent in the open sunlight. From the height of Plaza San Blas you can see the colorful rooftops draping over the city adding a touch of Andean spirit within the colonial past. Narrow alleyways and compact homes wind up and down the streets where you can feel the elegance and charm of every stone and building. The pan flute echoes along the walls, emanating from restaurants and plazas. Sitting in a cafe you can listen to the music and the laughter, sip on rich Peruvian coffee, or the welcomed bitter flavor of coca tea; you can watch artists paint the church lavishly into the imaginings of how their city looks to them. As the stunning mountains wrap around the city, the homes climb up the foothills out of sight and the mixture of Andean culture and Spanish architecture fills the city. The walls of Sacsayhuaman, Inca fortress, stand over Cusco like a protector, the imposing stones cut and pressed together without mortar, and helping defend the city’s uniqueness for centuries."

Today you will descend into the Sacred Valley where you will follow in the footsteps of the Inca. The greenery of the valley stretches along the foothills and reaches to the base of the snowy peaks of the Andes. The Urubamba River springs mist into the air, filling the breeze that rushes through your hair with freshness. The sky is one of the brightest shades of blue you have ever seen, you wonder if it has anything to do with the altitude. You can listen to your guide tell you stories about the trail, histories about the Inca and the Valley, as the immaculate peak of Mount Veronica can be seen in the distance. Trek beside lush farmland, terraced along the steep hills of the valley before reaching the beautiful ruins of Llactapata. Stone ruins are set atop a small citadel, structured and designed for a specific look. While meandering through the ruins of Llactapata you will discover the majesty of Inca and their aptitude for architecture, design, and sustainability. The trail has only begun and you can touch the history; the stones are cold against your fingers. The grass is soft and dewy beneath your feet. The splendor of the Andes is all-encompassing, giving you a chance to connect to history, to nature, and to those around you."

        "description": "At dawn, the valley comes to life in the silence. The colors of the sky wash over the mountains, the deep blue shifting to a wondrous pink that eventually brings the morning light. The delightful aroma of coffee fills the valley and mixes with the early dew. You can wrap your fingers around your mug and indulge in the warmth of your drink, the cool morning air, and the soon to come adventure. The sun stretches across the sky; after a hardy and sensational breakfast, you will return to the undulating trail of the Inca. The farther you go the smaller the ruins of Llactapata become until you wrap around the mountainside and the ruins disappear. From the terraces of the earlier journey to the now dense jungle where moss blankets the earthen floor, the spirit of the trail is filled with wonder and awe. Large leaves dangle from the towering trees; their spreading foliage draws the sunlight through the canopy in streaks. There is an almost overwhelming perfume of freshness, from the trees to the moss to the flowers, all blooming and filled with vivaciousness. You can spot orchids blossoming along the branches above you, their effervescence staggering within the green brush. The tangling sounds of waterfalls rush along over the rocky terrain, down the hillside, misting over rocks, adding a blissful whitewater below. The trees start to dissipate like the ruins before them. Suddenly you are above the canopy, the rugged mountainside continues to climb. The crisp evening air settles over the hilltops where, like the Inca, you can watch the stars and read the movement of the sky. The aromatics of pumpkin soup and hot chocolate help soothe the cold outside, settling you in for another night along the trail."

Standing at the highest point of the trail on Warmiwanusqa Pass, almost 14,000 feet above sea level, you can look down at the other mountaintops in the distance. The altitude gives cragginess to the altiplano , the high plain, where that earthy aroma drifts into the air. You lose your view of the valley, the grass, and the trees behind the stretch of clouds that float along the mountainside. Occasionally the tops of trees peek through the blanket of fog, giving a sense of direction and an unparalleled heart-stopping moment. Once over the pass, you will descend into the stretch of jungle that welcomes you with dangling leaves and the sweet scent of lively flora. Pacamayo River trundles through the valley, rushing along the basin and carving deeper into the hills. On an outcropped plateau you can see the ruins of Sayacmarca hanging over the valley. The gentle curves of the ruins climb along the citadel in an impressive manner. Once you settle in for the evening you can relax with a warm cup of coca tea, coffee, or hot chocolate, harkening back to the days when you would camp in the forests or fields with friends, telling ghost stories or toasting s’mores. You can no longer see the imposing pass that you crossed but the success of the day continues to feel brilliant."

The flagstone path was built by the Inca and preserved beneath the canopy, giving you a sense of the grandeur to come. The stones have been rounded by the elements and time, where the stones have been shaped and smoothed by the passage of time, people, and usage. Within the sensation of the cloud forest, you will see the depths of the valley disappear behind the trees, hidden within the cool haze that rises from the basin. The leaves sparkle in the misty air as the stones become slick. The flagstones change to stairs, quickly steepening, nestled between the cliff and the hills. The stone steps wind around the slope of the mountainside before evening out along the citadel you hadn’t noticed was there. Three stone pillars stand before you, framing the fog in the background. This is the Sun Gate from where, once the fog burns away, you experience the breathtaking view of Machu Picchu that you have witnessed countless times in postcards and National Geographic. Except this isn’t a photograph, you have made it to the Lost City. The gate itself is believed to have controlled the access of people to the sanctuary. Beyond the pillars of the gate, you can see the exceptional ruins that tower over the valley, where whitewater of the Urubamba River is silent from this height."

The city is 7,972 feet above sea level and the vegetation that once hid this monument is now is free and clear. The city looks like it was built within the clouds, sensationally rising into the sky. The Temple of the Sun is the single round building in the complex of stones. The tower tapers in its curvature, displaying the type of remarkable design and mason work that the Inca were not only capable of producing, but for which they were known. You can see the particular location and size from of the central window; the window catches the sun during the winter solstice, making the light shine along the complex’s center. Below the temple is a rock that is almost hidden by the grandeur of the structure above. Its smooth and cool angles have amassed theories while its use and purpose is still unknown. For an extra sense of the city’s magnificence you can be one of the 200 people allowed daily to climb the likes of Huayna Picchu, the towering pinnacle that casts a shadow of Machu Picchu. Rising high over the Lost City, you can use the coarse and sturdy rope to help guide you along the stairs, rising to 8,924 feet above sea level, looking down over the wondrous ruins beneath you, and knowing what a true journey is."

The city is known for its whitewashed walls set between the summits of three volcanoes. The immaculate look of the city is set within its whitewashed walls made from sillar, a volcanic stone. The pearl of the mountains comes, not only from the color of the city but also from its decadent Spanish baroque churches and spectacular mansions. The cathedral located in Plaza Mayor resembles the opulent façade that you might find in Madrid or Buenos Aires; it glows a pristine white and boasts steeples that not only border the square but also decorate it. Spanish arched walkways add extra elegance to the plaza; it is not hard to get caught up in the beauty of the city where you can listen to the gentle spray of the fountain as it adorns the square’s center, active and jovial in the afternoon sun."

Today you will journey to one of the deepest canyons in the world. At a depth of 11,155 feet, Colca Canyon is mystical and majestic, with colorful canyon walls, lush valley, and an incredible expanse. The summit of Mount Misti protrudes into the sky and is the location of the magnificent find of Juanita, the most well preserved mummy found. Terraces have been ornamenting the hillsides for centuries, remnants of an Inca past combined with the Andean ingenuity of the present. There is a textured elegance to the canyon, where the natural splendor meets the human touch. Settle into the village of Chivay where the Andean culture continues to thrive. The large archway welcomes you into the city. Beyond the marketplace are the La Calera Hot Springs, where the warmth of the water is soothing and inviting. One of the best reasons to visit the host springs is the view, where the canyon is at its shallowest but the foothills continue to impress. Now and again the serene quiet of the springs is interspersed with the jovial cries of zipliners sweeping across the canyon."

When the morning is in full swing and the mist of dawn fades away, you will venture into the cool canyon air to the Cross of the Condor. The stone cross is large and intimidating; however, it marks the spot where you will no longer be looking down into the terraced loveliness of the valley and will instead be looking up. In the Western Hemisphere, there are no larger flying birds than the condor. They can be described as elegant, graceful, and even majestic, a holy animal to the Inca, but standing beneath the condor as they glide through the air, you may not need to try and capture their majesty in a manner other than by watching. Their wingspan reaches an average of nine-feet wide as you watch them dive to the prairie below. Soon you will journey back to Arequipa where you will board your plane for home, but for now, you can enjoy the calm of the condors and the serenity of the sky.

Along the way, you will stop at Pucara, a sensational pre-Columbian compound consisting of stone pyramids, including the temple of Raqchi. The ruins of the temple remind you of a hollow building where one stretch of wall remains while the rest of the building was taken apart. The pre-Incan civilization of the Pachacutec built the temple for the god Wiracocha and was an important destination for pilgrims at the time. The surrounding ruins were once warehouses that served as lodging for priests, servants, and farmers. The rich scent of earth is carried along the breeze. The ruins stand tall against the soft air. The sun lingers in the afternoon sky as you continue to Cusco. Clouds drift past and over the altiplano as you continue your journey closer to the shining waters of Lake Titicaca lapping at the shores of the city of Puno. Herds of llama decorate the plain, their eyes open wide, and their mouths in constant motion. A short ride has you at the incredible Sillustani Ruins, stacked along the shores of Lake Umayo like a cylindrical game of Jenga. The pre-Incan burial ground contains the best-preserved funerary towers, known as chullpas, constructed for noble persons and priests. The quiet breeze brushes through the grass. The scent of the Andes is pure cool air and rich earth. The remains of Sillustani are as inspiring today as they were to the Incas centuries ago.

The joyous cries of the market and street vendors drift through the open avenues. The streets are perfumed with fried dough stuffed with cheese and ground meat. Follow the joyous sounds of the streets down the main pedestrian avenue known as Jiron Lima.

Continue to explore the waters with a visit to Taquile Island. The Taquileños are considered masters of textiles with clothing that warms the body and the heart. The llama wool is smooth and soft on your skin; from sweaters and blankets, to beanies and socks, the garments are lush and colorful meant to keep you warm in the high altitude any day of the year. Follow the stone walkway up and through the main village of Taquile. The scent of simmering choclo, a corn husk with large kernels, drifts from the homes built from stone and glowing in the afternoon sun. Reach the top of the island where the lake expands beyond the shores of Puno and into Bolivia. The water shimmers and laps at the island below. You almost feel on top of the world with the wonders of Puno and the majesty of Peru at your fingertips."

        "description": "Today you will leave the sapphire waters of Lake Titicaca behind as you make your way to the capital city to explore once more. The stunning architecture of the Torre Tagle Palace glistens in the sunlight. The pink walls stand out along the street. One of the most stunning pieces of architecture in South America, the grace of 18th-century style brings a touch of opulence to the inescapable colonial history. The coat of arms of José B. adorns the façade as you enter the palace flanked by exceptional wooden balconies from where the occupants once watched the world pass them by. The courtyard is styled like a Spanish villa wrapped with wooden balconies and decorated with a geometric tiled floor. As you return to Lima, Hotel B will once again welcome you with open arms, happy to host your stay. Continue to Miraflores where the ocean rolls gently against the sand. The bohemian neighborhood also contains the sensational Huaca Pucllana pyramid. Pucllana is an amazing pyramid constructed with adobe and clay from seven alternated platforms. The pyramid almost resembles a collection of steps that look like an MC Escher painting. The site is filled with tidbits of history, from the pyramid itself to the remnants of pottery and the decorated mannequins meant to add life to the ruins. The scent of rich, dry earth and stone lingers in the air. Evening settles into Miraflores and the glow of the pyramid brightens the night like starlight."

The metropolis is filled with a variety of cultures etched into each neighborhood, the array of scents, foods, and life decorating the facades of a Spanish colonial past. Begin your exploration of Peru with a journey into the depths of the Church of San Francisco. The exterior is a bright canary yellow and sings against the blue sky. The adjacent spires are tall and the bells toll at noon. Once inside the church you can see the opulent trim and large arches that decorate the building. Geometric designs made of red and white tiles climb up the walls and into the domed ceilings. Witness what makes the Church of San Francisco different from the surrounding cathedrals by taking the tour of the catacombs. The warm air of the afternoon sun becomes dark and damp beneath the stone structure of the church. Dim lights recreate an aura of flickering torches as you descend the steep staircase into the depths of the labyrinth. A deep and wide well is buried greater beneath the subterranean hideout, filled with bones, wrapped in circles. The brick and mortar have been able to withstand earthquakes for centuries, keeping the church and the catacombs safe.

        "description": "Venture into the depths of the Andes, leaving behind the expansive city of Lima and its diverse neighborhoods. Cusco is 10,750 feet above sea level and is nestled within the hills of the longest mountain range in the Americas. The city climbs up the hillsides and gives a bird’s eye view of the surrounding valleys. Cobblestone streets line the city, leading locals and visitors alike through the variety of Spanish buildings, Incan remnants, and Andean life. The scent of damp stone and tangy Pisco drifts through the Plaza de Armas. The square bustles with the sound of children running, spraying water guns at one another while circling the fountain. Journey to the fortress of Sacsayhuaman which has watched over the city since Cusco was the capital of the Inca Empire. The large monolith stones of the fortress reach over the mountainside, an imposing and impressive feat, not only due to the size of the boulders but because of their engineering. The Incas didn’t use mortar and instead cut and shaped each stone to fit together on their own. Enter the fortress and follow the frayed cobblestone streets deeper into the open remains of the structure. A flourishing prairie leads towards the trees while various sized boulders create terraces and ramps that guide you to the edges of a cliff overlooking the city. The breeze is cool and inviting on your cheeks and dances with the grass. Cusco sits beneath the fortress and climbs up the distant hills with colorful homes and thin streets leading into the bend in the valley. You can see the buildings of the Plaza de Armas rising above the rest of the city, the open square part of the only space you can make out along the dense design of Cusco."

Overlooking the village of Pisac is the remains of four separate Incan ruins, divided by space but connected by history. The ruins spread through the remote point of the vale, one sitting along the citadel as a lookout to the surrounding valley. The stones have been worn by time but the view and the design of the varied ruins continue to awe. The Inca road snakes its way through the canyon entering the Urubamba Valley at Pisac. The citadel sits at the entrance to the gorge where terraces and steps have been carved from solid rock. The popular and famous Pisac Market retains its local charm with its unique handcrafted garments, locally farmed produce, and the vibrancy of the people who call the Andes home. Skirts are decorated with brilliantly colored beads which shine against their black background. Hats are adorned with dangling yellow and red fringe giving movement to the clothing providing shade to their owners’ eyes. The market is perfumed with freshly roasted potatoes and choclo, a type of corn with large kernels. The sounds of the market continue to drift through the aisles as you depart from Pisac and make your way to Ollantaytambo. The village of Ollantaytambo contains some of the oldest, most consistently inhabited homes in South America. The streets of the village are narrow, paved with inconsistent cobblestones and lined with stone walls. The ruins stand over the city and push into the craggy mountaintops. The terraces are structured with stones and stretch the length of the mountain. A single staircase climbs into the mountain where the original temple stood. Some structures are situated on the rock face and look as though they are carved right into the mountainside. The air is cool and the breeze winds through your hair at the top of the ruins. Look down onto the village below, where the damp stones flash in the fading sun and know that soon you will step into the wonders of the Inca Trail."

The rocky contours of mountains begin to twist with boulders and rocks. Your legs feel shaky; the air is cold and crisp when it hits your lungs. The valley grows steeper with every step, but you arrive at the top of the pass to hot tea and coffee waiting for you. The smell of pure air mixes with the perfume of the rich beans and brings a smile to your face. The sweet cookies help refresh you as you look down on the world from the summit you have just climbed. Continue your exploration of the Inca Trail as you descend the other side. You will pass two stunning emerald lakes that almost blend into the grass beside them. Eventually, you will arrive at the ruins of Sayacmarca. Within the trees you can see the electric colors of orchids hiding beneath the canopy. The hum of birds and the gentle flight of butterflies wrap around you. Sayacmarca has one entrance, a single stairway leading up to the small city. You can see the remains of the canal that was used to bring water to that part of the ruins. Terraces climb along the mountainside to give food to the outpost. As the sun fades behind the mountains you will settle into the comforts of camp where the quiet rippling of a small lake keeps you company."

Vines cascade down trees and run the length of the walkways. The stairs climb, the stones are smooth, some covered with moss as you arrive at the wondrous ruins of Phuyupatamarca. The expansive city is filled with remnants of a decadent past, including the trickling sound of sacred baths where water would flow from the aqueducts into the stone pools. Continue your hike past Wiñay Wayna, where the ruins sit upon a tiered plateau overlooking the flourish of trees below. The area is now home to a campsite where you can enjoy lunch before your final ascent into the Lost City. Your first step along the Intipunku brings the polished step of the sacred and ancient gateway. You have made it out of the Cloud Forest and begin to climb the staircase, one steady breath after another until you see three pillars in front of you. Beyond the stones, framed by the pillars, you can see the open city of Machu Picchu. The stones glisten in the open light.

With only 200 visitors allowed to ascend the mountain per day, you can either reach the peak and look down on Machu Picchu until it resembles a cartoon replica, or make your way to the less visited and equally majestic Temple of the Moon. Having witnessed Machu Picchu from the Sun Gate, a visit to the Temple of the Moon would be the Inca choice, creating a well-rounded and circular journey. The stone remains sit within a cave. The mountainside swoops down and hovers over the temple looking like a moon crater. The air is filled with cool limestone and lingering jungle-life. Sit with history along the altar in the center of the temple and notice how the cold rock feels on your skin. Eventually you will depart for the train that will take you back to Cusco, but for the moment you can stay beneath the mountain, within the company of the moon, and smile."

Cusco is filled with Andean culture and sentiment, spread across the reflective facades of the Spanish colonial buildings and built on top of Incan remains. Children rush along the streets with soccer balls and squirt guns, their laughter bouncing off of the walls of a colonial past. The rich scent of Peruvian coffee lingers longer than the children. Tour through the city to experience the deluxe wonders of the city, from the Plaza de Armas to the surrounding ruins. Sacsayhuaman is the Incan fortress that looks over the city like a petulant ghost. The large monoliths were cut and pushed together, giving the walls a forceful and breathtaking look, having stood for centuries without any mortar. The rich trees that surround the city give a pleasant minty aroma to the afternoon. Enter the fortress and walk deeper into the Incan remains, along the long stretch of large boulders that guide you almost to the distant tree line. The fortress looks like it could have been a second city overlooking the Incan capital of Cusco, and meant to be the head of the puma, created by the shape of fortress and the city combined. The fortress is air musky with fresh earth and rich stone. The boulders rise over 30 feet in places, dwarfing you and leaving you to wonder how the Incas had managed such a tremendous structure. Venture through the fortress, along and on top of the boulders to see the city below. The cool breeze brushes your cheeks. Mountains surround Cusco and homes rise up the sloping foothills.

On the mountaintop that lingers over the city the monoliths of Sacsayhuaman Fortress stare down onto Cusco like a protector. The stones were cut and pressed together, using their weight as mortar with such force that you’d be hard pressed to fit a blade of grass between the crevices of two boulders. Throughout the streets of Cusco you can see the diversity of the city, within its Incan past, its Spanish buildings, and the sounds of the pan flute sweeping over the cobblestones."

The scent of rich soups and juicy chicken drift through the market mixing with the jovial and boisterous customers before you depart for the town of Ollantaytambo. The town of Ollantaytambo is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in South America, with aqueducts that run through the village built by the Inca. The scent of lush grass and cold stone fills the village. The stone streets run along stone walls, and doorways are tiered, sealing the cracks, and keeping the home warm in the cold and cool in the heat. The ruins of ancient Ollantaytambo rise up the hillside with terraces stretching across and up the mountain. A single staircase divides the tiers until you reach the top where the remains of the grand temple continue to watch over the village. Part of the ruins is built into the mountain itself, shaded by the overhanging rock.

Once more along the citadel of the city you can wander through the stone remains at your own pace and even venture out of the city all together, strolling along the stone footpath that will take you to the Temple of the Moon. Halfway down the Inca Road where the Inca Bridge is carved into the mountainside, you will find the temple covering the entire slopes of Huayna Picchu and consisting of architectural caves. The sloped terrain hovers over the temple like an inversed moon crater, holding the stone structure in place, or vice versa. Some of the stonework is decorated by niches and altars carved into the rock. As you exit the cave the scent of cool, shaded stone shifts to the crisp perfume of the high altitude plains.

The trees settle beneath you like a never-ending carpet rolling along the riverbanks. Arrive in Puerto Maldonado where the gold mining and Brazil nut farming infrastructure of the city mixes with the rubber baron past. Flat canoes line the shore of the river and float through the water with ease. Follow your guide, step aboard a boat, and glide up river with the lush forest clamoring to the water’s edge. Keep your eyes open for the vibrant colors of macaws and the accentuated beak of toucans. The spectacular eco-lodge of Posada Amazonas sits inland from the river beneath the lush jungle canopy. The parrots call in the afternoon warmth and you can almost make out a dangling tail of a Capuchin monkey. Climb the scaffolding tower that rises over 100 feet into the trees and looks safely out into the jungle. The diversity of the Amazon is within its delicate, vibrant, and particular ecosystem. From the top of the tower you have a spectacular view of the river and the surrounding forest. Within the canopy you can see the glowing green feathers of parrots; their gruff, guttural call sits in the still air of the late afternoon. The floral scent of the trees rises into the sky and you have discovered the diversity of Peru, from the Andes to the Amazon, and within the rainforest itself."

Today you will venture onto an easy canoe ride around Lake Tres Chimbadas for a tremendous wildlife safari. Giant river otters dip into the water, their fur slick with wet, until they return to shore and stretch out their lengthy bodies in the sun to dry. Turtles march along the banks, their spotted shells helping them blend into the moss and branches of the forest floor. You can hear the deep grunts and wheezes of the hoatzin, a bird that resembles a chicken with a punk-rock haircut. As the forest reaches the mid-afternoon the animal activity lessens and you venture onward to the Tambopata Research Center. Within the canopy of Tambopata the diversity of the rainforest can be seen immediately. Macaws and kingfishers are plentiful, swooping through the air with graceful color and musicality. A capybara, an adorable mammal that resembles a giant hamster, can be seen foraging along the forest floor. Enter the center grounds and enjoy a greeting from the flock of semi-wild, rescued macaws before venturing along the Bamboo Trail famous for the fabulous abundance of rare birds that live exclusively in southern Peru. The deep hoot of a howler monkey rumbles through the trees. You can see the iridescent turquoise feathers of jacamars, their long beaks like a hummingbird’s, but their color almost too bright to witness. The light turns to shadows within the forest and you return to the research center for the evening."

Step into the clearing where, beneath the vines that dangle above a small cliff, the pink clay rises. The morning sun spreads over the tree line and you can see groups of parrots and macaws sitting along the canopy, their vibrant feathers like tie-dye against the trees. The steep bank begins to pulse. Squawks and squabbles over mineral rich clay keeps feathers pumping, beaks biting, and claws gripping at the perch. The bright reds, greens, blues, and yellows of the fluttering birds sit along the cliff side until one senses danger, possibly an eagle. In almost one fluid motion the world explodes into color and sound, squawking and fluttering as the parrots and macaws simultaneously take to the air."

The reflective water sits perfectly still until interrupted by ripples from the fish below. You can hear the aggressive drill of woodpeckers among the trees. Parakeets sing in the canopy. The wilds of the trees sway in the welcomed breeze and you can hear the rush of the river in the still of the later afternoon. Night begins to stretch above the canopy, the birds quiet down, the monkeys stop playing in the branches, and you settle in the lodge with the lingering perfume of camu-camu , a cherry-like fruit, filling the air."

After customs, you will meet your private transport which will accompany you to your hotel in the prestigious neighborhood of Miraflores. You can unwind atop your private balcony or seaside with a refreshing and frothy pisco sour . Paragliders may soar across the horizon while children skip in grassy, public parks and fly kites in the sky. Couples will stroll along the botanical gardens of Parque del Amor before relaxing on beautiful mosaic-tiled benches, and seagulls will coo in the distance while taxis honk their horns along busy city avenues. In the afternoon, you will join your guide at a nearby restaurant where you will sample perhaps the most emblematic of all Peruvian dishes: ceviche . You will sit in on a cooking demonstration that is led by an expert chef before sampling varieties from Lima's world-renowned restaurants. As you bite into the crunchy layers of pepper, onion, and seafood, tangy lemon-lime juices will overwhelm your taste buds. Later, you will enjoy a peaceful evening walk on the elegant trails above the crashing Pacific Ocean waves. The fresh smell of sea salt in the air is sure to soothe your senses and lull you to sleep as you return to the hotel to prepare for tomorrow’s urban exploration."

        "description": "While historians have been fascinated by the ancient civilizations of Peru, some historical relics remain somewhat mysterious to this day. The Nazca Lines are a primary example of this phenomenon, which scientists, mathematicians, and anthropologists have studied and theorized about it for decades. Ancient Paracas and Nazca civilizations are responsible for the impressions that were set in place between the years 500 BC and 500 CE. Naturally, beyond the question of why these designs were created, the real fascination is how they came to be. These massive geoglyphs, or humanmade depressions in the earth's terrain, span nearly half a mile in diameter and depict animals and plants that are indigenous to the region. In total, these figures stretch more than 800 miles. You will meet your guide in the morning to board a small plane for the perfect bird's eye view of these magical and ancient artifacts. As you pass over the exquisitely formed lines, your guide will explain several theories about why and how the Paracas and Nazca people executed their designs. You will view dozens of sites between Nazca and Palpa as you hover over other key formations in San Miguel de la Pascana. In the evening, you will drive through Ica's downtown as you pass through a beautiful plaza that is illuminated with street lamps. You will make your way to an idyllic hacienda on the city's outskirts that is painted with flashy yellow and pink hues. Here, you will meet an internationally recognized sommelier who will take you on a tour of an organic vineyard and later invite you to participate in an exclusive wine-tasting experience of the region's best variety."

Upon your arrival, you will embark on a full day’s cruise around the basin and its perimeter. As you glide along the tepid waters, you can look out on the rugged mountain peaks at the outer edge. You can also search just below the water's surface for glints of the lake trout's shimmering scales. Around mid-day, you will arrive at one of the dozens of floating islands, which are known as the Uros islands. These curious artificial islands were first created by the Uros people hundreds of years ago as they sought refuge from the encroaching Inca Empire in Cusco. Rather than settling along the lake's perimeter, the Uros people resolved to resettle at Lake Titicaca. In doing so, they constructed buoyant surfaces that were made from layers of woven lake water reeds. To this day, the Uros people inhabit roughly sixty of these floating islands on Lake Titicaca. To maintain the foundation of each island, they must weave fresh reed layers as the previous layer decays into the water below. As you dock, you will have a chance to meet descendants of the original Uros nomads. You will observe a reed weaving demonstration and will also have the chance to buy local souvenirs and handicrafts. As distant skies warm with the yellow-orange hues of sunset, you will join your group on the water's edge for a delectable dinner of fresh trout with breathtaking views of the lake below."

White stucco homes line narrow alleyways as indigenous Quechua women are adorned in beautiful, authentic textiles and sell jewelry and handicrafts. Hotel staff will welcome you with a hot cup of mate de coca tea as you acclimate to a steep 11,000 feet above sea level. Soon after, you will find your guide beside the splashing fountain at the center of the Plaza de Armas . You can step inside the meticulously adorned Cusco Cathedral to observe the postcolonial techniques of Spanish design. Your guide will offer you a delicious snack of choclo , which is a thick-kernel corn, and as you bite into the sweet-salty flavors, you will meander down the bustling Avenida del Sol . The stoic edifice along the frenzied central artery is known as Qorikancha , which is the ancient Inca Sun Temple. You will stand in awe of the ornate gold leafing and manicured courtyards. A testament to the Incas' engineering ingenuity, the temple withstood three separate devastating earthquakes. Later in the afternoon, you will climb into the hillside neighborhoods that lie beyond the city's downtown to experience the effervescent excitement of local market culture. Vendors joke with one another as they call from across several produce stalls and clever fruit sellers cut open the creamy white chirimoya and vibrant maracuya to entice customers. Other city dwellers relax at lunchtime with freshly squeezed juice as they read the paper or catch up on town gossip."

You will start at Saqsaywaman, which is a former fortress and outlook point that was meant to ward off invaders from attacking Cusco's many gems, primarily Qorikancha. You will walk along impressive stone walls that the ancient Inca people built without the use of any mortar. Historians revel in the fact that these walls remain virtually impenetrable. That is, not even a sheet of paper can pass between two stones. Next, you will carry on to Tambomachay, which is the site of the Inca spas. Listen carefully to the soft trickling of stream water as it glistens in the radiant Andean sun. In addition to their military might, the Incas were also known for their innovative waterway systems. Aqueducts and other water canals pooled into large water basins that were intended for the Inca elite. In the evening, you will return to Cusco for an entertaining night of fine dining and traditional music accompaniment. You can bite into local flavors of the pickled chicken and vegetable medley known as escabeche as soothing rhythms of guitar and flute quartets create beautiful harmonies in the background."

However, once the Spanish invaded, Ollantaytambo also hid hundreds of Inca people who were fleeing the city of Cusco for safety. You will follow your guide as you weave between the ancient citadel's most notable ruins. You will climb Temple Hill towards the city's ceremonial center, where you will admire the intricate stonework at the Wall of Six Monoliths and continue up the steep terraces on your way to the former storehouses.

You will witness the mesmerizing beauty of the site's most prominent features and snap majestic photos of the looming peaks in the distance. Start at the House of the Guards and then move to the Old City Gates, which is where you can catch a glimpse of the Inca Trail's most glorious final stretch.

As the sun begins to fall, you will enjoy some afternoon hiking and an opportunity to partake in some solo exploration. You can hike along scenic, wooded paths along the forest floor. Then, travel by boat to see the breathtaking beauty of the macaw birds in their natural habitat. Huddled at the edge of a rocky cliffside that is known as the Macaw Clay Lick, these vibrant birds' feathers will burst against their monotone backdrop. In the late evening, you will ride the steady stream waters back to the conversation center where you will spend a final romantic evening in the Amazon in your private luxury accommodations."

Once considered the \"navel of the world,\" modern-day Cusco is a hotbed of activity and a mid-way point for tourists that are headed to the famed ruins of Machu Picchu. Centuries ago, Cusco fell siege to the encroaching powers of Spanish rule. Nevertheless, many of the most prized Andean relics have withstood the test of time. Upon arriving at your hotel accommodations in the pristine, white stucco neighborhood of San Blas, you will be greeted with a steaming cup of herbal mate de coca tea. Cusqueños proudly drink the tea daily, believing that it boosts energy and offsets symptoms of altitude sickness. Once you have had time to settle in, you will join your guide at the epicenter of the city, the Plaza de Armas, for a short tour. A central fountain will sprinkle you as you look out at the towering Cusco Cathedral or the Iglesia de la Compañía de Jesús. You will make your way to the busy Avenida del Sol as cars weave in and out of busy traffic. Bus attendants may call out the windows with the speed of a skilled auctioneer as they urge passengers to get on and off quickly. You will then step foot at Qorikancha, which is among the most revered of all temples for its gold leaf interior and infallible engineering. You will circle the green garden pastures out front and then travel to several nearby markets to shop for jewelry, Alpaca textiles, and handicrafts in the evening."

You can watch as the sun begins to rise from the rolling green hills in the distance, and then meet your private transport in front of your hotel for sightseeing in the countryside. You will first arrive at Saqsaywaman, which was deemed a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1983. The Incas took control of the area from the 13th century on and began to fortify the city one stone wall at a time. Your guide will lead you to these massive stone walls that were so cleverly built at the time that not even a single sheet of paper can pass through. Remarkably, builders achieved this without the use of any mortar. You can walk through the central plaza and huge terraced walls that are evidence of the Inca's military prowess against outside invaders. In the afternoon, continue to Tambomachay, which is the site of the coveted Inca baths and a spa retreat. You will bask in the fresh air of these secluded ruins as you listen to the faint trickle of water along the ancient aqueduct and canal water system. Next, your guide will lead you past Tambomachay's stone terracing, which some historians believe also indicates former military capabilities. In the evening, you will return to Cusco for a lively dinner that will be accompanied by whistling flutes and soulful acoustic guitars of traditional Peruvian music. You can choose from a multitude of authentic bars and restaurants in the Plaza de Armas or in adjacent neighborhoods. You can also sample delicious, regional staples like the ají de gallina stew or escabeche de pollo, which is a chicken dish that is topped with pickled peppers and onions."

Your private transport services will meet you at the front door of your hotel early this morning. Soon, you will arrive in the lovely village of Chinchero. A white stucco facade envelopes ancient ruins at the epicenter, which was once the site of Inca nobility's countryside retreat. Expert guides will show you around the village before escorting you to a local culture class. Here, you will learn the Andean practice of dyeing and weaving. You will observe a class on natural dyeing techniques and then try out the art form together as a couple. Mid-morning, you will saddle up for a spectacular ride along the Sacred Valley's winding foothills and through its grassy pastures on horseback. Gallop past the ancient agricultural terraces and then clop down dirt paths as you overlook the sleepy village towns below. You will rejuvenate with a hearty lunch of pachamanca , which is a slow-cooked dish with meat, corn, cheese, and potatoes. As the sun reaches its peak, you will visit the sites of Moray and Maras. At Moray, you will look out on perhaps the best example of agricultural terracing in all the Inca Empire. Dozens of concentric circles cut deep into the hillside and form around a central basin. Although the Incas lightly extracted soil from the area and preserved the terraces for farming purposes, it is also possible that the site literally paved the way for complex irrigation systems. In the evening, you will arrive at the salt mines of Maras. These carefully constructed salt basins have been harvested since ancient Inca times. Here, you can admire the sparkling white salt basins as they glisten in the sun."

This steeply terraced citadel houses a number of prized ruins that have remained largely intact for hundreds of years. Your guide will lead you to the major point of interest, including Temple Hill, the quarries, and the storehouse that was built high into the mountain to prevent decay. You will also learn about the site's water source and intricate irrigation system. Next, you will gear up for another thrill-ride adventure. You will journey to the outskirts of the Urubamba province for a rush of excitement on the longest zipline route in the country. Plunge from the Andean cliffside to thrilling depths in the valley as you whiz above the scenic lowlands. In the evening, you will enjoy a romantic dinner in a one-of-a-kind sky lodge, which is a glass-encased dome that is suspended from cliff's edge. As you step inside for a panoramic view, crystal-clear views of the valley below will suddenly emerge. You will welcome a private chef into your dining area to cook a delicious, regional dish that will be paired with a lovely glass of local wine. Enjoy this private meal, overlooking the green pastures and steep terraces as the day's light begins to fade. Of course, there will be no better place to fall asleep than while stargazing."

You will journey from your hotel in Ollantaytambo to the 82-kilometer marker of the Inca Trail with your private guide and sign in at the local checkpoint. On day one, you will cover 7.5 miles of moderate terrain as you wind beside the Urubamba River and through the rolling green hillside. You will pass through the small village of Miskay and soon encounter the hideout at Huillca Raccay, which was most likely a former storehouse or dormitory for farmers. As you come to the Cusicacha River, you will cross the bridge by the name that literally translates to \"the happy bridge.\" You will wind down in the evening at the campgrounds of Wallabamba. A lush green backdrop will present phenomenal views of the Andean mountains that will be seemingly a stone's throw away. Beautiful foliage and bursting flower petals adorn the grassy plains on which you will set up tents for the night.

This trek will have you reaching great heights as you summit to 4,200 meters above sea level. Your first stop at Llulluchapampa, which is an altitude of 3,850m, will offer a glimpse of the outstretched lowlands below. Pampa , in Peru's native Quechua language, refers to the large terraced grassy plains on which Llulluchapampa sits. You will come to a resting point at Warmiwañusqa Pass, which was named for the distant mountain peaks that the Incas claimed. In pursuit of the Pakaymayu River, you will pass by dozens of other artificial rock impressions that historians believe the Incas once used as resting points, military lookout points, or fortresses. As you descend to the Pakaymayu Valley, you will traverse through grassy plains and wild reeds that sway in the afternoon breeze. At Sayaqmarka and Phuyupatamarca, you will witness some of the best-preserved sites in all the Inca Empire, feel along the steeply terraced rocky walls, and admire the unique, geometrical shapes of the ancient cities themselves.

Afterward, you will zigzag up switchback roads as you encroach on the famed UNESCO world heritage ruins that will be just beyond the horizon. As you ascend the mountainside, you cannot help but ruminate on the thousands of footprints that marked the same very trails during the Inca times hundreds of years ago.

        "description": "Of course, the grandeur of Peruvian gastronomy extends far beyond the coastal lowland plains on the western shores. You will travel inland to the post-Columbian city of Arequipa to the south. Pristine white facades of downtown buildings flank the central plaza while vibrant red-orange walls pop out from unassuming alcoves. You will take a short flight and touchdown in Arequipa mid-morning. Then, you will follow your guide on a customized tour of key architectural and historical points of interests. It will be impossible to miss the allure of the Santa Catalina Monastery because of its blood orange exterior that warmly welcomes public visitors. In fact, much of the interior passageways and tunnels are also donned in the same vibrant, rich hues that will make you feel as if you are stepping foot in a fanciful storybook. Inside, you will marvel at the ornate religious artifacts and discover the riveting blend of indigenous culture and Spanish influence after the great conquests of the 16th and 17th century. At lunchtime, you can bite into the flavors of this hearty, mountain cuisine that will be sure to warm you up and fill your belly. You can sample the famed rocoto relleno , which is a deliciously sweet, red pepper that is stuffed with meat and eggs and topped with a layer of oozing, melted cheese. You can also enjoy a heavenly spoonful of Arequipa's adobo stew. In the afternoon, you can get lost in the effervescent San Camilo Market where locals call out daily deals with the velocity of a seasoned auctioneer. Electrifying yellows and greens of produce pop against the clay tile floors, and friendly-faced vendors cut open the milky white chirimoya fruit to entice hungry customers. As the day wears on, you can quench your thirst at one of many colorful fruit stands that are inside the market where you can watch vendors squeeze fresh, frothy mango, papaya, and guayaba juices before your eyes. Once you have received your fill of adventure for the day, your private guide will transfer you back to your luxurious accommodation."

In the morning, you will board a cruise boat and spend several hours touring the highest navigable lake in the world: Lake Titicaca. The unique lake is straddled between the national border of Peru and neighboring Bolivia. You can even catch a glimpse of the spirited marine life that flocks in the tranquil waters below. You will step foot atop the curious, floating islands that were built by the Uros people hundreds of years ago. As the Inca Empire gained power and land, the Uros were forced to flee from the valleys of south-central Peru. Consequently, they sought refuge in the Puno region, but instead of staking claim along the water's edge, they created buoyant island colonies that they fashioned from thick layers of reeds that are native to the lake. You will partake in a reed weaving demonstration and peruse jewelry and textiles that have been handmade by the Uros people. In the late afternoon, you will sit down lakeside for a scenic meal that overlooks the sparkling waters of Lake Titicaca. A renowned local chef will serve you the region's prized delicacy: fresh lake trout that are seasoned with expert execution and topped with refreshing slices of lemon."

Soon, you will arrive at your hotel in the white stucco neighborhood of San Blas where you can settle in with perhaps the most symbolic of all cusqueño delicacies: mate de coca tea. This light green tea, which is made from Peru's endemic coca leaf, is used for spiritual practice and is said to offset hunger and the effects of altitude sickness. Early in the afternoon, you will meet your expert guide at the Plaza de Armas. The ornate, central fountain trickles in the background, and hurried residents make their way to mass at the adorned Cusco Cathedral. As you peel off towards Avenida del Sol , the wafting, buttery smells of choclo , which is a thick-kernel corn, will fascinate your senses. It is the perfect salty-sweet snack as you meander down Cusco's central artery to reach Qorikancha . Here, you will admire the original gold leafing and beautiful floral landscaping of this Sun Temple, which not only withstood Spanish invasion but three devastating earthquakes as well. After a relaxing break at your hotel accommodations, you will convene once again at the Plaza de Armas for a tapas tour of Cusco's Novo-Andean cuisine, which blends traditional ingredients with modern-day flavors from around the world. You will begin at one of the many luxurious restaurants along the plaza's perimeter to sample antojos de queso en salsa de maracuya, which is a cheese and spinach dish that is marinated in a sweet passion fruit sauce.

For hundreds of years, nobility luxuriated in the natural spring waters that were redirected to the site via aqueducts and other water channels. Later, you will continue on the same winding dirt road to the ruins of Saqsaywaman. Among the Inca Empire's grandeur is a palpable sense of military might. The remnants of the Saqsaywaman fortress is a testament to the fortitude of Inca structure and design and its ability to evade outside threats until the fateful Spanish Conquest. In the evening, you will travel to a nearby village for a warm welcoming and smoky outdoor barbecue around a crackling fire as you look out on the starry sky and serene city below. Here, your cooks will serve you the most authentic of Andean dishes: cuy , or grilled guinea pig, which is considered a delicacy in the region.

As you begin to weave along the central byway of the Sacred Valley, steep Andean mountain peaks will fall into the rearview mirror, and grassy green pastures will rise to the forefront. The intense Andean sun may shine brightly on the luscious foliage, and the water of the Urubamba River may sparkle with every churn. You can bump along the entrance to your first stop in the Valley at Chinchero. This village, glowing white with post-colonial stucco design, was once the coveted resort town for Cusqueño nobility. Today, the village warmly welcomes visitors from around the world. First, you will sit in on a natural yarn dyeing class to learn about indigenous dyeing techniques that are still used to this day. Then you can get comfortable on an outdoor patio for a delectable home-cooked lunch that is locally known as pachamanca . This dish, which literally means \"Earth Oven\" in Peru's native Quechua language, entices diners with its delicious beef, pork, and lamb mixture that is served with fava beans and potatoes. As its name suggests, this meal is cooked over hot coals in a hole that has been dug into the ground and then covered with corn husks. In the evening, you will visit the fascinating sites of Moray and Maras, both of which were integral parts of Incan innovation. At first, in Moray, Inca agriculturalists developed a practice that is known as agricultural terracing, whereby steep, step-like layers are built into a hillside to allow for optimal farming and irrigation. These concentric circles serve as stunning examples of Inca ingenuity. Secondly, at Maras, you will get to see the sparkling salt basins that were built hundreds of years ago as the Inca harvested an abundant salt supply. Even to this day, salt is harvested from the same large, cascading basins."

As you trek to the storehouses, you will learn more about the Incas' line of defense as they thwarted attempted attacks by the Spanish in the 16th and 17th centuries. In the afternoon, you will travel to a quaint, local village where you will sip on the delicious mate de coca tea as you discover the cultural nuances of the herbal remedy to this day. As you take three of the leaves, your expert instructor will teach you how the Andean people place the leaves between two fingers, fan them out towards the sky, and then blow on each leaf to give thanks to Pachamama , or \"Mother Earth.\" Then, you will take a bite of the leaf as the locals do to for a boost of daily caffeine.

Regardless, both serve as prime examples of Inca design and their acute stonework abilities. Later in the day, you will have the option to summit Huayna Picchu, which is an impressive mountain peak that sits at Machu Picchu's rear. The steep climb, though strenuous, rewards its hikers with breathtaking views of the outstretched valley below. For those travelers opting not to make the climb, you will have additional time to tour the ruins and explore the final portion of the Inca Trail. In the afternoon, you will return to the base city for a soothing dip in the medicinal hot springs that gave the city its name. You will climb the secluded path that leads to the steamy water's edge.

Whether on a boat or at the edges of the observation deck, you can watch the water come to life with turtles slipping along the surface or giant river otters sunbathing on the shore. They are fast in the water but large on land reaching over five-and-a-half feet long. Their tails help propel them through the fresh lake and to blend in with fallen branches. Atop the 100 foot observation deck you can view the lake and the wildlife almost from within the canopy of the trees themselves. The kaleidoscope of toucans is iridescent against the leaves. Macaws radiate a deep blue against the tree bark. The peaceful moments above the Amazon give you a deeper connection to the majesty of the wild and the sensations of the incredible."

        "description": "Leave the stretching waters of the Amazon behind you as you fly above the canopy and make your way over the Andes and venture into the oldest continuously inhabited city in South America, Cusco. The air is crisp and cold along the cobblestone streets of the city. The stones are a vast difference from the wooden walkways and earthen paths of the Amazon. The cologne of burnt sugar follows you through the streets, along with the tanginess of Pisco, the traditional Peruvian spirit. Enjoy the remainder of the day on a tour through the city and its surroundings to experience the collection and connection of Spanish and Incan remains. The Plaza de Armas is considered the main square of Cusco and looks like the capitol of a city in Spain. It is easy to see that much of colonial Cusco was built on the foundations of the Incan stonework and layout. Santo Domingo Church is considered to be the mother of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cusco filled with history and an incredible amount of colonial artwork having transitioned into more of a museum in recent years. The church was once the ancient Temple of the Sun, home to gold lined walls and Spanish dreams of El Dorado. Although the foundation of the original structure remains, the Spanish church rose in its stead. The church is constructed with mortar and stone giving the structure a medieval look and a textured feel. The spire is adorned with a dome and various smaller spires that wrap around the bell tower. The magnitude of the church is impressive; from its entrance it would seem that the church was two stories; however, as you journey through the building you find that the church follows the downward slope of the street, leading into lush gardens that lay beneath the looming stone. The flowers that spread along the courtyard give a gentle bouquet to the coarse and aged grit. The beauty of Cusco is filled in its layers of history, along with its hidden and not so hidden gems, from the Spanish facades to the Incan ruins."

        "title": "Ollantaytambo – The Sacred Valley of the Inca",
        "description": "Venture into the depths of the Sacred Valley where the Andean culture remains strong and the varied remains of the Incan culture are built along the walls of the valley. The ruins of Pisac sit along a plateau giving a tremendous view of the surrounding valley and the encircling mountains. The stones shine a rich red and pink in the morning sun, in contrast to the deep green of the valley. Terraces climb the sloping mountains like stairs. The citadel sits at the top of the terraces, the structures still intact; the aged brick open to the elements and fragile against your skin. Continue to the royal estate of an Inca Emperor at Ollantaytambo. The site was once the capital of the Incan empire during the resistance of the Spanish. The scent of roasted choclo, large kernel corn, drifts from the town and lingers against the stones of the ruins. Steep terraces climb up a central hill of the site, surrounded by sheer rock making the area look more like a fortress than a religious center. Each tier stretches the width of the mountainside and clambers up the valley from the river below, marked with one set of stairs. The gentle trickle of water rises from “The Bath of the Princess,” a single stone with tiered designs carved into a fountain that sits at the base of the ruins. The valley is lush with incredible vegetation and history spreading through the hills."

        "description": "Today you will wind through the foothills of the Sacred Valley and along the rushing Urubamba River. The green valley and mountaintops never seem to fade. Arrive at the base of the Machu Picchu and ascend into the saddle of the mountain 1,000 feet above the rush of the river. Climb the stone steps that take you higher to the plateau where the rocky walls open and give way to the expanse of the Lost City. The integrity of the stone structures continues to decorate the mountaintop, as Huayna Picchu casts a shadow over the ruins from its mammoth peak. In the opposite direction you can see the three pillars of the Sun Gate sitting above the clouds and looking down on the city. The grass is soft and lush. The ruins give a faint musk of wet stone. Terraces continue to tier the mountainside. The hitching post of the sun stands at a tall and open point; it’s large, round stone standing above the city, within the confines of the remaining walls, continuing to tell the time."

        "description": "The sun rises over the stones of Machu Picchu and brings a bright glow to the plateau. The clouds dance around the terraces before disappearing. For an incredible view of the Lost City, take the long walk to the Sun Temple. The stone path leads the way along the mountainside. Llamas graze on the rich grass, their mouths moving sideways with each bite. Once at the Sun Temple you can see carvings circle around the tower to pinpoint the position of the sun during the summer solstice. Rock slabs and stones surround the structure, but the most recognized detail about the Sun Temple is the view. The entire city of Machu Picchu is open to you like a postcard, from the details of the ruins to the peak of Huayna Picchu. The clouds have long dispersed and your view of the Lost City of the Incas is nothing less than breathtaking. Eventually you will make your way back to Cusco, but for the moment you can sit along the smooth stone slabs of the temple and enjoy the view."

        "title": "Lake Titicaca – City-side to Lakeside",
        "description": "Today you will depart from the pearled city of Cusco and venture farther along the stretch of Andean beauty. The altiplano , which stands for the high altitude plains, is a copious mixture of craggy rock and swaying grass. Stop in Andahuaylillas, known for its incredible baroque church nicknamed the Sistine Chapel of America. The exterior is stationed above several stairs; the white bell tower is iridescent in the sun while the mountains surround the church in the background. The pillars of the façade are made of alternate, smoothed stone, the second story adorned with a mosaic of Andean life. Inside the church you are immediately surrounded by a haze of frankincense. The columns are gilded to the ceiling where geometric designs add to the hypnotic artwork of the church. With the wind of the high plains calling, you continue on to Puno and your hotel. As the largest high altitude navigable lake in the world, Lake Titicaca sparkles outside your window."

        "description": "The sun rises over Puno and radiates along the water of Lake Titicaca. Venture out onto the lake, the scent of fresh water drifts into the air and mist bounces off of your cheeks. The boat glides through the water. Islands decorate the horizon; however, a few islands seem to shimmer in the morning light. They drift with the wake of the lake and your boat nestles into a small dock. You have arrived at one of the famous floating islands of the Uros. The islands are made with dried totora shoots, wound and woven to make a steady surface. You can feel the rough shell of the dried grass on the soles of your feet. The fragrance drifts through the open air of the lake. The houses are made from the same reeds as the island itself. The locals are as colorful as the textiles you saw in Pisac market, bright pinks and reds gleaming along the clear waters of the lake. After the floating island you will continue along Lake Titicaca until you come to the gentle natural harbor of Taquile Island, a stationary island almost 30 miles east of Puno. The slope of the island is steep from shore to tip with terraces that stretch along the sides of the island allowing for agriculture and irrigation. The town sits along a tiny plateau with some homes edging along the less steep slopes of the hills. The roofs are a bright pink while the stone buildings keep the interior cool in the summer and warm in the winter. At the top of the island you can see the expanse of the lake, where the vastness of the water comes to light within the main square of the town. The sun meanders across the sky and you make your way back to the boat to return to the shores of Puno."

        "description": "The sparkling clear waters of Lake Titicaca drift beneath you as you fly over the Andes and away from the undulating mountains and vibrant colors. Arrive back in Lima and settle into your luxurious accommodations, located in the beautiful neighborhood of Miraflores. Stroll along the winding walkways where the scent of the sea blows in on the back of the breeze. The Kiss, a large statue in Lover’s Park, showcases two people wrapped in an eternal embrace overlooking the ocean. The cool air of the ocean sweeps across the city and brings you back to the memories of the Machu Picchu and sitting amidst the clouds."

        "description": "Lima stretches out like a distant oasis as you make your way out of the city and into the arid desert of Ica, which is also an important agricultural region of Peru. The sweet smell of grapes and dry earth stretches across the open desert plain. When you arrive in Ica you will board a sightseeing plane and ascend into the open sky to view the famous and mysterious Palpa and Nazca Lines. Scattered around the Nazca plateau, the lines are large geoglyphs showing a variety of natural and geometrical objects, from a bird to a monkey, carved into the earth and stretched over an expansive area only visible from the sky. Continue on to the Haucachina Lagoon to experience the oasis within the sand dunes of the desert. It feels as if you have traveled to the Sahara, with dunes rising and surrounding you in every direction. The palm trees sway in the desert breeze. The natural spring of the oasis is cool against your skin. The sun is warm as it drifts across the sky. From secluded relaxation along the water to the loud rush of adrenaline that comes with dune buggies, around the oasis you can soak in the sun or the sand, both offering the warm embrace of the desert before arriving in the town of Paracas."

        "description": "Today you will venture away from the desert oasis of Paracas and cruise along the cool, sweet ocean to the Ballestas Islands. The mist is refreshing and cool blowing in the breeze, while the fresh saltwater scents wraps around you. Look back at shore and see the stationary candelabra of Paracas drawn into the hillside like the Nazca Lines. The Ballestas Islands are a series of rock formations that have become a haven for wildlife along the Peruvian coast. Over the crash of waves you can hear sea lions barking. Their slick bodies lounge in the sun along the shore. Sunlight shines through the craggy holes in the rocky islands like tunnels to nowhere. Once on shore you will journey to the stunning Lagunillas located in the Paracas National Reserve. You can see the arid hills reach the corners of the sea and roll into the horizon. Climb the rocky terrain and look out into the water, the coarse earth hard against your palms. You can hear the crash of waves and the soft whisper of the breeze. Enjoy a delicious and rich lunch at San Jose in Chincha, a colonial hacienda that dates back to the 17th century. The hacienda stretches the length of a city block with arches opening the heart of the building to the outside world. The opulence of the building and the decadence of the food seems like it couldn’t have changed in almost 400 years. After lunch you will return to Lima for your flight home. From the winding eclecticism of Lima to the magical wildlife of the Amazon, the cultural sensations of Lake Titicaca to the unique lines that decorate the Nazca plain, you have traversed Peru and have seen that the city of Machu Picchu that floats in the clouds and the oasis of Paracas as it twinkles beneath the sun. The world is filled with wonders; however, none can beat the Inca-credible wonders of Peru. If you'd like to extend your Peru vacation, take a look at the trip reviews for Machu Picchu . You will get ideas and read about what other travelers enjoyed in Peru."
