      "title": "Lima – Touchdown and Sunset Stroll",
      "description": "Lima opens up along a pristine turquoise-blue coastline and welcomes visitors from around the world with arms stretched open. Locals carry on with the hustle and bustle of daily life in the third largest metropolitan area in the Americas, which is home to one-third of the country's population. Cars eagerly honk as they weave their way between other cars, bikes, and tour buses. Young children skip in the distance past carefree couples who are leisurely strolling through the Parque del Amor . Street vendors perform what looks like a circus plate twirling act as they tend to dozens of skewers of meat, rotating each perfectly on smoky hot coals until they are golden brown. As you step foot on the tarmac, the fresh scent of sea salt and citrusy, lemon-lime aromas will waft in your direction. Your private transport will escort you to your five-star, luxury accommodation in the prestigious neighborhood of San Blas. By mid-afternoon, the hot Peruvian sun will begin to wane in the sky, which is perhaps the best time of the day to experience the city in its full beauty. Sky gliders sway back and forth in the distance against the backdrop of a warm, yellow-orange horizon, and talented musicians serenade passersby and families that are set out on picnic blankets in the grassy, public parks. At sunset, you can choose from a plethora of decadent dining options, each with magnificent views of the Pacific Ocean's iridescent, rolling waves."

You will amble along the alluring, grassy cliffs of Parque Grau where cyclists and skateboarders may enjoy a scenic ride and couples relax on mosaic-tiled benches that overlook the seaside.

The dotted white skyscrapers of this modern neighborhood carve out only a small portion of the city's rich history. You will follow your guide to the elegant, cobbled streets of the Old City where you can photograph the exquisite post-colonial architecture of Basílica y Convento de San Francisco de Lima and the Government Palace of Peru.

      "title": "Arequipa – Visit to Santa Catalina Monastery and San Camilo Market",
      "description": "Of course, the grandeur of Peruvian gastronomy extends far beyond the coastal lowland plains on the western shores. You will travel inland to the post-Columbian city of Arequipa to the south. Pristine white facades of downtown buildings flank the central plaza while vibrant red-orange walls pop out from unassuming alcoves. You will take a short flight and touchdown in Arequipa mid-morning. Then, you will follow your guide on a customized tour of key architectural and historical points of interests. It will be impossible to miss the allure of the Santa Catalina Monastery because of its blood orange exterior that warmly welcomes public visitors. In fact, much of the interior passageways and tunnels are also donned in the same vibrant, rich hues that will make you feel as if you are stepping foot in a fanciful storybook. Inside, you will marvel at the ornate religious artifacts and discover the riveting blend of indigenous culture and Spanish influence after the great conquests of the 16th and 17th century. At lunchtime, you can bite into the flavors of this hearty, mountain cuisine that will be sure to warm you up and fill your belly. You can sample the famed rocoto relleno , which is a deliciously sweet, red pepper that is stuffed with meat and eggs and topped with a layer of oozing, melted cheese. You can also enjoy a heavenly spoonful of Arequipa's adobo stew. In the afternoon, you can get lost in the effervescent San Camilo Market where locals call out daily deals with the velocity of a seasoned auctioneer. Electrifying yellows and greens of produce pop against the clay tile floors, and friendly-faced vendors cut open the milky white chirimoya fruit to entice hungry customers. As the day wears on, you can quench your thirst at one of many colorful fruit stands that are inside the market where you can watch vendors squeeze fresh, frothy mango, papaya, and guayaba juices before your eyes. Once you have received your fill of adventure for the day, your private guide will transfer you back to your luxurious accommodation."

      "description": "As the new day breaks, a new hideaway of delectable eats will be calling your name. You will carry on your foodie tour to the serene town of Puno at the base of Lake Titicaca. In the morning, you will board a cruise boat and spend several hours touring the highest navigable lake in the world: Lake Titicaca. The unique lake is straddled between the national border of Peru and neighboring Bolivia. You can even catch a glimpse of the spirited marine life that flocks in the tranquil waters below. You will step foot atop the curious, floating islands that were built by the Uros people hundreds of years ago. As the Inca Empire gained power and land, the Uros were forced to flee from the valleys of south-central Peru. Consequently, they sought refuge in the Puno region, but instead of staking claim along the water's edge, they created buoyant island colonies that they fashioned from thick layers of reeds that are native to the lake. You will partake in a reed weaving demonstration and peruse jewelry and textiles that have been handmade by the Uros people. In the late afternoon, you will sit down lakeside for a scenic meal that overlooks the sparkling waters of Lake Titicaca. A renowned local chef will serve you the region's prized delicacy: fresh lake trout that are seasoned with expert execution and topped with refreshing slices of lemon."

      "title": "Cusco – Qorikancha, Plaza de Armas, and Restaurant and Bar Tapas",
      "description": "You will venture to the birthplace of the Inca Empire to experience the ultimate convergence of Peruvian food and culture. You will also wind through the cobblestoned streets of post-colonial Cusco and past extraordinary relics of the ancient Empire. Soon, you will arrive at your hotel in the white stucco neighborhood of San Blas where you can settle in with perhaps the most symbolic of all cusqueño delicacies: mate de coca tea. This light green tea, which is made from Peru's endemic coca leaf, is used for spiritual practice and is said to offset hunger and the effects of altitude sickness. Early in the afternoon, you will meet your expert guide at the Plaza de Armas. The ornate, central fountain trickles in the background, and hurried residents make their way to mass at the adorned Cusco Cathedral. As you peel off towards Avenida del Sol , the wafting, buttery smells of choclo , which is a thick-kernel corn, will fascinate your senses. It is the perfect salty-sweet snack as you meander down Cusco's central artery to reach Qorikancha . Here, you will admire the original gold leafing and beautiful floral landscaping of this Sun Temple, which not only withstood Spanish invasion but three devastating earthquakes as well. After a relaxing break at your hotel accommodations, you will convene once again at the Plaza de Armas for a tapas tour of Cusco's Novo-Andean cuisine, which blends traditional ingredients with modern-day flavors from around the world. You will begin at one of the many luxurious restaurants along the plaza's perimeter to sample antojos de queso en salsa de maracuya, which is a cheese and spinach dish that is marinated in a sweet passion fruit sauce. Later, you can venture to the neighborhoods of San Blas and beyond to indulge in a quinoa risotto or potato stew."

      "description": "The next morning, you will depart Cusco's city limits to uncover some of the Inca Empire's most renowned jewels. You will begin at the site of Tambomachay, which is just a short, 20-minute drive from Cusco. Here, you can behold the ruins of the former Inca bathing spas. For hundreds of years, nobility luxuriated in the natural spring waters that were redirected to the site via aqueducts and other water channels. Later, you will continue on the same winding dirt road to the ruins of Saqsaywaman. Among the Inca Empire's grandeur is a palpable sense of military might. The remnants of the Saqsaywaman fortress is a testament to the fortitude of Inca structure and design and its ability to evade outside threats until the fateful Spanish Conquest. In the evening, you will travel to a nearby village for a warm welcoming and smoky outdoor barbecue around a crackling fire as you look out on the starry sky and serene city below. Here, your cooks will serve you the most authentic of Andean dishes: cuy , or grilled guinea pig, which is considered a delicacy in the region. This hearty meal is served with a side of peppers and tomatoes, which is perfect for satisfying a big appetite. After dinner, you will wind back down the dirt path towards your cozy hotel accommodations in San Blas."

      "title": "Sacred Valley – Chinchero, Moray, Maras, and Pachamama Barbecue",
      "description": "Today marks the first day in your journey to Peru's coveted ruins of Machu Picchu. You will start your day early in front of your hotel where you will meet your local guide. As you begin to weave along the central byway of the Sacred Valley, steep Andean mountain peaks will fall into the rearview mirror, and grassy green pastures will rise to the forefront. The intense Andean sun may shine brightly on the luscious foliage, and the water of the Urubamba River may sparkle with every churn. You can bump along the entrance to your first stop in the Valley at Chinchero. This village, glowing white with post-colonial stucco design, was once the coveted resort town for Cusqueño nobility. Today, the village warmly welcomes visitors from around the world. First, you will sit in on a natural yarn dyeing class to learn about indigenous dyeing techniques that are still used to this day. Then you can get comfortable on an outdoor patio for a delectable home-cooked lunch that is locally known as pachamanca . This dish, which literally means \"Earth Oven\" in Peru's native Quechua language, entices diners with its delicious beef, pork, and lamb mixture that is served with fava beans and potatoes. As its name suggests, this meal is cooked over hot coals in a hole that has been dug into the ground and then covered with corn husks. In the evening, you will visit the fascinating sites of Moray and Maras, both of which were integral parts of Incan innovation. At first, in Moray, Inca agriculturalists developed a practice that is known as agricultural terracing, whereby steep, step-like layers are built into a hillside to allow for optimal farming and irrigation. These concentric circles serve as stunning examples of Inca ingenuity. Secondly, at Maras, you will get to see the sparkling salt basins that were built hundreds of years ago as the Inca harvested an abundant salt supply. Even to this day, salt is harvested from the same large, cascading basins."

After a well-rested night beneath a blanket of a clear, starry night sky, your private transport will take you to the acclaimed ruins of Ollantaytambo. You can join your tour guide at the base of the former citadel as you unpack the site's fascinating history. You will start at the beautiful agricultural terraces that cascade from the hillside of Ollantaytambo's central plaza to the Urubamba and Patakancha Rivers, which are located deep in the cradle of the valley. You will behold the carefully constructed quarries and perfectly positioned storehouses that are set high into the mountainside to ward off decay. As you trek to the storehouses, you will learn more about the Incas' line of defense as they thwarted attempted attacks by the Spanish in the 16th and 17th centuries. In the afternoon, you will travel to a quaint, local village where you will sip on the delicious mate de coca tea as you discover the cultural nuances of the herbal remedy to this day. As you take three of the leaves, your expert instructor will teach you how the Andean people place the leaves between two fingers, fan them out towards the sky, and then blow on each leaf to give thanks to Pachamama , or \"Mother Earth.\" Then, you will take a bite of the leaf as the locals do to for a boost of daily caffeine. Your guide will then prepare steeping cups of the herbal tea for you as you look out on the stunning terraces of Ollantaytambo that are visible in the distance."

      "description": "Your second day of discovery at the coveted Machu Picchu ruins will bring you to the site of the Sacred Rock and Intihuatana, which is a massive stone that has been formed in the shape of an altar. Both places allude to an Inca history that is rich with spiritual practices. Many historians believe that Sacred Rock was created as a geographical representation of the surrounding terrain while others assert that it was used for astrological study. Regardless, both serve as prime examples of Inca design and their acute stonework abilities. Later in the day, you will have the option to summit Huayna Picchu, which is an impressive mountain peak that sits at Machu Picchu's rear. The steep climb, though strenuous, rewards its hikers with breathtaking views of the outstretched valley below. For those travelers opting not to make the climb, you will have additional time to tour the ruins and explore the final portion of the Inca Trail. In the afternoon, you will return to the base city for a soothing dip in the medicinal hot springs that gave the city its name. You will climb the secluded path that leads to the steamy water's edge. There, you can relax your muscles and unwind. Once you have dried off and worked up an appetite, you will stroll to the lively, central plaza for a three-course meal of classic Andean dishes like the patasca , which is a corn-based soup. You may also choose from a variety of hearty vegetables, beef or chicken, and potato medleys."
