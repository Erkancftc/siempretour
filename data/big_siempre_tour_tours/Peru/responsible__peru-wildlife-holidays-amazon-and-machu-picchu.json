  "generalInfo": "Peru is a well known holiday destination, whether it is to explore the wonderful and world famous ruins of Machu Picchu or to experience the upper Amazon rainforest there are many reasons to visit Peru. But few trips combine the very best wildlife watching in the Amazon Rainforest and visits to South America's most iconic historical site. This is one such trip and we are sure that anyone wishing to visit Peru for the first time and get an appreciation for what Peru is all about.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>Boasting the greatest diversity of mammal life in the world and being one of top bird watching locations in the world (ranking number 4 for the number of bird species); Manu National Park in Peru’s Upper Amazon Rainforest is a wildlife enthusiasts dream. <br/><br/>It is often very difficult to see a lot of wildlife in the dense thick tropical rainforests, but what makes Manu National Park so special is there are wide open rivers where wildlife can be see on the banks, ox-bow lakes which accumulate wildlife, canopy walk ways and towers which allow great views across the forest as well as salt and clay licks which provide wildlife with much needed minerals and attract them from miles around. <br/><br/>These factors make the wildlife watching in Manu National Park better than most other locations in the upper Amazon Rainforest. It is the salt and clay licks in particular which are adored by many species of parrots and macaws. <br/><br/>The pristine lakes and rivers that seldom have visitors are home to many caiman and families of giant otters and of course the forests around Manu are home to some of the Amazon’s most iconic and accessible wildlife. Whilst spotted jaguars may still be very difficult the smaller mammals (particularly primates) and of course the birds should entertain us as we delve deeper and deeper into the Amazon. <br/><br/>Whilst in Manu we will visit 4 different lodges / camps. The first being in the cloud forests on the border of the Amazon and home to a variety of wildlife that is not usually found in the rainforest further down. But the rainforest is not the only thing that the Peru has to offer, we will also travel into the Andes and visit the historically and culturally important site of Machu Picchu, one of the true wonders of the world.<br/><br/>Machu Picchu is regarded as one of the 7 Wonders of the World and is one of the most iconic and wonderful locations in the world to visit, so many people come and see the ruins and we will spend 2 full days exploring the site and getting expect guidance into its history and the cultural importance of the site to ancient and modern Peruvians.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner where mentioned). There will be filtered or boiled water available for each guest each day. We have our own private AC vehicles with an excellent driver for all vehicular transfers. You will have a local cultural and naturalist guides. The guides have spent years in Peru and know the places and wildlife and cultural monuments and sites intimately. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>We choose September - November as a good time for this itinerary, this is due to the weather being drier during this time of year than the northern hemisphere summer.  <br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced zoologist (where possible - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us), local naturalist or guides as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• Our local Machu Picchu expert guide is provided for your guided visits to the site and is an expert in the region and Incan history in general.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it.<br/>• This specific wildlife tour is one of the few in the world that explores remote and wilderness areas of Ecuador in the company of expert guides.<br/>• We provide camera traps for you to set up and you are free to use any and all of the photographs and videos that this camera trap gets during your stay.  <br/>• All the above reasons give this, our unique Peru Wildlife &amp; Cultural Holiday a great success rate of seeing rare wildlife. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Peru which explore other areas and focus on other species such as the Amazon rainforest and more specific birding holidays as well as many other species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/> <br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour visits three distinct locations, firstly the Incan capital of Cusco and the historical and world famous site of Machu Picchu in the Central Andes and then we travel into the remote and wild upper reaches of the Amazon on the eastern slopes of the Andes.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>Some of this trip is at relatively high altitude and whilst there is not much walking (in terms of trekking) on this itinerary, we do walk around Machu Picchu and have walks in the lower altitude in the Amazon. There can be uneven ground and so we advice to be used to walking for 1-2 hours in heat and some experience of being at altitude is good but far from necessary.<br/>There is one optional hike up to a view point overlooking Machu Picchu, this is a steep climb and can be physically demanding, however it is optional.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking. We can also include specialist equipment on request such as camera traps, infrared cameras, thermal imaging equipment and spotlights. .<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 15 Years Old",

      "description": "Cloud Forest - Travelling & Wildlife Watching Early this morning you will leave Cusco and make our way along the spectacular 165km road through a variety of Andean ecosystems and Quechua villages. The drive usually takes around 8-10 hours and we will have some breaks where we can experience some of the Andean villages and small farmsteads as we pass by. The architecture is a mix of Quechua and colonial which makes for a very scenic drive before we reach a pass that overlooks the Amazon Basin. Along the way you may see puna teals, Andean ducks and puna ibis in the high altitude habitats and then as we descend a little to get to the Cock of the Rock Lodge you will begin to hear the calls of birds such as quetzals, trogons and wood rails, and see a variety of orchids that grow in the perpetually damp cloud forest. Our lodge for the night is also home to the tamest and most accessible Andean cock-of-the-rock lekking site in the world. Also found around the lodge (alongside the plethora of bird species) are woolly monkeys, brown capuchin monkeys and very occassionally Andean bears. Some of the more common and impressive bird species we will try and see here are emerald toucanet, torrent duck, golden-headed quetzal, grey-breasted mountain-toucan, Amazonia umbrellabird, blue-banded toucanet, fruit-eating tanagers, red-crested cotinga, banded-tail fruit-eater, tyrant flycatchers and the blue-crowned mot-mot. If we are in time (depending on the traffic, road conditions and how often we stop) we will visit the lek this evening to see the lodge’s namesake bird before retiring for the evening. (all meals included today)."

      "description": "Manu National Park - Wildlife Watching This morning we will visit the Andean cock-of-the-rock lekking site before breakfast back at the lodge. After watching the impressive display and listening to the strange croaking calls of the males we will leave the lodge and head further down the Andeans and into the Amazon Basin and in particular to our next lodge the Amazonia Lodge located inside the huge Manu National Park. This park has the largest diversity of mammal life in the world and some of the largest numbers of plants, insects, reptiles, amphibians and bird species in the world as well. The journey will be different from yesterdays as we will only be able to make some of it by vehicle, before we board boats and continuing the journey through the Amazon Rainforest. The lodge is located in the tropical lowland rainforest of Manu Biosphere Reserve. The lodge has a very impressive bird list that is around 630 species strong at present, there are also many mammals recorded from the lodge grounds including 8 species of primates and some rarer sightings such as Brazilian tapir, jaguar, puma and peccaries. We will make the most of the afternoon and evening here before dinner and our first night in the Amazon Rainforest. (all meals included today)."

      "description": "Manu National Park - Wildlife Watching This morning you will spend some time around the lodge, to see what bird life and other wildlife is around the lodge in the early morning. Then after breakfast we will board our boats and carry on further into the Amazon and to our next accommodation. The Aguaje Camp is a rustic camp located deep in the forest, on the banks of the Manu River and close to the trail that takes to you to the Salvador oxbow lake, this is the largest and most beautiful of Manu’s lakes. Around the Cocha Salvador it is possible to see giant otters and around the camp itself it can pay to keep an eye out for brown-mantled tamarins, black-capped squirrel monkeys, gray woolly monkeys and Peruvian spider monkeys. Being so deep into the forest lots of the wildlife is visible around the camp and with a full day tomorrow we hope to see many species that are difficult or impossible to see elsewhere. (all meals included today)."

      "description": "Manu National Park - Wildlife Watching Today we will enjoy a full day exploring the trails and waterways around Aguaje Camp, the wildlife here is not as regularly disturbed by people as around some of the other larger and busier lodges. So we will spend the day with our local expert guide and see what animals we can find, in general during the day the wildlife that is readily seen in the rainforest are primates, aquatic animals and also the hundreds of different bird species. After dark we can also try and find some of the nocturnal species such as opossums, night monkeys, caimans and possible very rare mammals that only come out in the dead of the night.

      "description": "Manu National Park - Wildlife Watching This morning will be our last around Aguaje Camp and we will have some time to see the wildlife again before heading on the river again and this time heading to Manu Wildlife Centre. We will take a packed lunch and spend a good portion of the day slowly travelling to the centre and trying to see wildlife along the river banks as we travel. The centre is located on the Madre de Dios River and the wildlife is abundant here, as well as trails and canopy towers the centre is also close to a salt lick that is very productive for macaws and tapirs and also two large oxbow lakes that are good places for wildlife watching. Travelling along the river to the centre we will try and spot aquatic wildlife such as caiman, giant otters and hoatzins as well as other wildlife. Once we arrive at the centre you will have some time to settle in and familiarise yourself with the private lodge located in its own 16,190 ha. rain forest reserve adjacent to the one million-acre protected area named the “Amarakaeri Reserved Zone”. Over the next three full days we will explore this area in full and finish our exploration of the Peruvian upper Amazon. (all meals included today)."

      "description": "Machu Picchu - Travelling & Sightseeing This morning we will leave the hotel and be taken to the train station, from here we will get the train to the Sacred Valley. The Vistadome train passes through picturesque Andean scenery, passing traditional villages, Inca ruins and rushing rivers. You will descend 1,300m through the Sacred Valley of the Incas and follow the Urubamba River to Aguas Calientes (which is now called Machu Picchu Pueblo). After dropping off your luggage at the station we’ll take the 20-minute bus ride up to Machu Picchu, perched 600 meters above the river. After lunch your archeological guide will take you on a walking tour of the site. It is important to have your camera equipment in a small bag ready to take on the bus to the site so that we can leave the train and catch the bus straight away. The famous lost city of the Inca is one of the most magical and mysterious places on Earth. Situated on the spine of a jungle cloaked granite peak towering some 600 meters above an entrenched meander of the roaring river below, the site is frequently shrouded in misty clouds pierced by the powerful equatorial sun. Constructed from precisely sculptured granite blocks carefully joined with the projecting exposed stone of the surrounding mountain, the site may well be the finest architectural achievement of the new world. In the late afternoon we will head back to the town and have the rest of the day to relax in the stunning Andean surroundings. Tomorrow we will make the climb up Huayna Picchu which offers stunning views over the ruins. (breakfast is the only meal included today)."

      "description": "Machu Picchu - Sightseeing This morning we will once again get the bus to the ruins to further explore the vast city of Machu Picchu, at 10am we will start the ascent of Hauyna Picchu (this means Young Peak) and is a peak in which the Urumbamba River bends. The Incas built a trail up the side of the Huayna Picchu and built temples and terraces on its top. The peak of Huayna Picchu is about 2,720m above sea level, or about 360m higher than Machu Picchu. The top of the mountain was the residence for the high priest and the local virgins. Every morning before sunrise, the high priest with a small group would walk to Machu Picchu to signal the coming of the new day. The Temple of the Moon, one of the three major temples in the Machu Picchu area, is nestled on the side of the mountain and is situated at an elevation lower than Machu Picchu. Adjacent to the Temple of the Moon is the Great Cavern, another sacred temple with fine masonry. The other major local temples in Machu Picchu are the Temple of the Condor, Temple of Three Windows, Principal Temple, “Unfinished Temple”, and the Temple of the Sun, also called the Torreon. Only 400 people are allowed to climb the peak per day and we will be in the latter group as the clouds will hopefully have lifted allowing for excellent views over the ruins. The climb is steep and can be slippery when wet so we are best to take our time in getting up to the top. After exploring the site more we will get back to the hotel (via the bus) and then board the train back to Cusco. The rest of the evening will be free to rest. (breakfast is the only meal included today)."
