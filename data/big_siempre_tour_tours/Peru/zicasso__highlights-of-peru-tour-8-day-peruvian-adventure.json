You can look out toward the water's edge as the Madre de Dios river teems with its lively inhabitants. By mid-morning, your expert guide will meet you at your accommodation, and today you will be provided with a more in-depth perspective on the rainforest's inhabitants and the people who are working vehemently to protect them. First, you and your guide will once again board your riverboat as you set out for the Tambopata Research Center. Here, you will meet researchers, scientists, students, and volunteers who work to protect indigenous plant and animal life and educate the public about how best to preserve the Amazon Rainforest. You will see several animals up close, including toucans, anacondas, and choro monkeys who all call the center home during their rehabilitation. Researchers will also lead you on a short hike around the nature preserve where you will learn about the surrounding flora. After a short rest at your lodge in the afternoon, you meet your guide at the water's edge. After a brief ride down the river, you will learn about the Amazon's other revered inhabitants: native tribal groups who have called the jungle home for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. Even among Peruvians, this group of people remains largely unknown and isolated. While these groups do not routinely participate in the area's tourism, you will get a flavor of local culture when you try juane de pollo , which is a native delicacy that consists of rice and chicken that is wrapped in massive banana leaves."
