  "generalInfo": "The north-west of Peru is an undervalued yet wonderful part of this large and diverse country. Exploring this region and looking for it's wildlife is a great way to see various species which are not commonly seen elsewhere. Animals like spectacled bears (the original inspiration for Paddington Bear), Sechuran foxes, Andean condors and white-winged guans are all seen with ease in the amazing Chaparri Eco-Reserve.  <br/><br/>This trip combines the dry forests of the north with the world famous cultural and historic site of Machu Picchu in the central Andes.<br/><br/>This unique trip brings you closer to rare wildlife and allows you to experience the Incan wonder of engineering like never before. The small private reserve of Chaparri takes in injured and orphaned Andean bears with a view to rehabilitating them into the wild, so you can see their project and understand how they are working tirelessly to protect one of the most endangered and enigmatic species in the whole of South America. the captive rehabilitated bears live here along with an increasing wild population of bears and we hope to see certain species that are not found in other areas of Peru.<br/><br/>Throughout the itinerary you'll be accompanied by expert full time guides, often including: professional zoologists (where available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us), English speaking local naturalists and a local driver for all transfers. Being in the company of a naturalist is the best way to learn more about ecology and animal behaviour and will help you identify different species and interpret behaviours. <br/>Each location and habitat visited on this tour is unique and home to a set of wildlife different from the next. <br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner where mentioned). There will be filtered or boiled water available for each guest each day. We have our own private AC vehicles with an excellent driver for all vehicular transfers. You will have a local cultural and naturalist guides. The guides have spent years in Peru and know the places and wildlife and cultural monuments and sites intimately. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>We choose September - November as a good time for this itinerary, this is due to the weather being drier during this time of year than the northern hemisphere summer.  <br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced local naturalist or guides as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• Our local Machu Picchu expert guide is provided for your guided visits to the site and is an expert in the region and Incan history in general.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it.<br/>• This specific wildlife tour is one of the few in the world that explores remote and wilderness areas of Ecuador in the company of expert guides.<br/>• We provide camera traps for you to set up and you are free to use any and all of the photographs and videos that this camera trap gets during your stay.  <br/>• All the above reasons give this, our unique Peru Wildlife &amp; Cultural Holiday a great success rate of seeing rare wildlife. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Peru which explore other areas and focus on other species such as the Amazon rainforest and more specific birding holidays as well as many other species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/> <br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour visits two distinct locations, firstly the Incan capital of Cusco and the historical and world famous site of Machu Picchu in the Central Andes and then we travel north-west to the dry coastal forests and in particular the Chaparri eco-reserve.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>Some of this trip is at relatively high altitude and whilst there is not much walking (in terms of trekking) on this itinerary, we do walk around Machu Picchu and have walks in the lower altitude Chaparri Reserve. There can be uneven ground and so we advice to be used to walking for 1-2 hours in heat and some experience of being at altitude is good but far from necessary.<br/>There is one optional hike up to a view point overlooking Machu Picchu, this is a steep climb and can be physically demanding, however it is optional.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking. We can also include specialist equipment on request such as camera traps, infrared cameras, thermal imaging equipment and spotlights. We also provide all snorkelling equipment onboard the boat in the Galapagos.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 15 Years Old",

      "description": "Machu Picchu - Travelling & Sightseeing This morning we will leave the hotel after breakfast and be taken to the train station, from here we will get the iconic glass-roofed train to the Sacred Valley. The Vistadome train passes through picturesque Andean scenery, passing traditional villages, Inca ruins and rushing rivers. You will descend 1,300m through the Sacred Valley of the Incas and follow the Urubamba River to Aguas Calientes (which is now called Machu Picchu Pueblo). After dropping off your luggage at the hotel we’ll straight away take the 20-minute bus ride up to Machu Picchu, perched 600 meters above the river and have lunch in the neighbouring cafe. After lunch your archeological guide will take you on a walking tour of the site. It is important to have your camera equipment in a small bag ready to take on the bus to the site so that we can leave the train and catch the bus straight away. The famous lost city of the Inca is one of the most magical and mysterious places on Earth. Situated on the spine of a jungle cloaked granite peak towering some 600 meters above an entrenched meander of the roaring river below, the site is frequently shrouded in misty clouds pierced by the powerful equatorial sun. Constructed from precisely sculptured granite blocks carefully joined with the projecting exposed stone of the surrounding mountain, the site may well be the finest architectural achievement of the new world. In the late afternoon we will head back to the town and have the rest of the day to relax in the stunning Andean surroundings. Tomorrow we will make the climb up Huayna Picchu which offers stunning views over the ruins. (breakfast is the only meal included today)."

      "description": "Machu Picchu - Sightseeing This morning we will once again get the bus to the ruins to further explore the vast city of Machu Picchu, at 10am we will start the ascent of Hauyna Picchu (this means Young Peak) and is a peak in which the Urumbamba River bends. This is a pretty hard climb and for people not wanting to do this you can spend the day around Machu Picchu and take in the sites at your own pace. The Incas built a trail up the side of the Huayna Picchu and built temples and terraces on its top. The peak of Huayna Picchu is about 2,720m above sea level, or about 360m higher than Machu Picchu. The top of the mountain was the residence for the high priest and the local virgins. Every morning before sunrise, the high priest with a small group would walk to Machu Picchu to signal the coming of the new day. The Temple of the Moon, one of the three major temples in the Machu Picchu area, is nestled on the side of the mountain and is situated at an elevation lower than Machu Picchu. Adjacent to the Temple of the Moon is the Great Cavern, another sacred temple with fine masonry. The other major local temples in Machu Picchu are the Temple of the Condor, Temple of Three Windows, Principal Temple, “Unfinished Temple”, and the Temple of the Sun, also called the Torreon. Only 400 people are allowed to climb the peak per day and we will be in the latter group as the clouds will hopefully have lifted allowing for excellent views over the ruins. The climb is steep and can be slippery when wet so we are best to take our time in getting up to the top. After exploring the site more we will get back to the hotel (via the bus) and then board the train back to Cusco. The rest of the evening will be free to rest. (breakfast is the only meal included today)"

      "description": "Chaparri Eco-Reserve - Travelling Today will be a travelling day as we swap the central Andean peaks for the northern dry forests. Firstly we will be taken to the airport in the morning to catch our flight to Chiclayo (via Lima). Once we arrive in Chiclayo we will meet our new local guide and travel to Chaparri EcoLodge (around 1.5 hours), the lodge is located in Chaparri Eco Reserve which is located in the dry forests of Northern Peru. Providing a tranquil escape in a spectacular landscape of the foothills of the Andes with excellent wildlife viewing opportunities, this lodge will be our base for the next 4 nights. We will settle into the lodge today and possibly have a short afternoon trip out (depending on the time we make it to the lodge). Over the next 3 full days we will fully explore the reserve. (breakfast and dinner included today)."
