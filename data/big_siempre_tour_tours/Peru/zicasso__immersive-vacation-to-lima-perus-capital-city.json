Nearby, children will squeal with excitement during a game of tag or soccer in a grassy green park, and flowers will burst with colors. Meanwhile, couples will meander down a scenic pedestrian strip that snakes along the dazzling coastline. Upon landing at the Jorge Chávez International Airport, you will meet your private airport transfer.

Then, in the evening, you will venture to the opulent neighborhood of Miraflores, where locals and visitors alike delight in a sunset meal as waves crash in the distance. Families will gather nearby to look out on the water as paragliders disappear from a rocky cliffside into the horizon. A plethora of high-end dining options await you, each overlooking the iridescent coastline. A moonlight stroll at water's edge will prove the perfect way to culminate your first night as you sip on the lime undertones of Peru's frothy pisco sour ."

      "title": "Lima – Tour of City Highlights and Private Ceviche Cooking Class",
      "description": "In the morning, you will wake with a creamy cup of coffee or a Peruvian tea that is known as mate de coca. Then, you will meet your knowledgeable guide in front of your hotel for a customized tour of the city's highlights. Together, you will amble down picturesque stone streets that are flanked by intricate balconies and shady palm trees. You will soon come to the bright yellow facade of the Church and Convent of San Francisco. Once inside, you will marvel at the lavish wood carvings and meticulous hand-painted artwork as you learn about the influence of the Spanish conquistadors in Peru. The church's basement level offers a fascinating look at the catacombs where more than 30,000 people were buried in the early 1800s. As you return to street level, you will notice gorgeous post-colonial balconies as they hang over the downtown city streets. Your guide will lead you to excellent examples of this exquisite architecture, which will only be two of the nearly 1,600 Spanish-style balconies that are scattered throughout the city. Finally, you will come to the prestigious Plaza de Armas where vibrant facades pop against the muted stone streets, and shady palm trees offer relief from the heat as you learn more about Peru's recent past and politics since its founding as a Republic in 1821. In the afternoon, your taste buds will water during an authentic ceviche cooking class that will be led by a world-renowned chef. You will learn about the origins of this delectable meal and Peru's most famous dish before rolling up your sleeves to put your newly developed culinary skills to the test. You will begin by marinating fresh shrimp with the tantalizing flavors of zesty lemon and lime. Your instructor will then lead you in chopping tomatoes, onions, jalapenos, and cilantro to add a satisfying crunch into the mix. You can finish your dish off with a sprinkle of salt and pepper before relaxing on a gorgeous, moonlit patio to indulge in your masterpiece."

      "description": "Steamy temperatures of the hot desert climate will subside as thrill-seekers whiz across the undulating sand dunes of Huacachina. On your third day in Peru, you will break away from the hectic bustle of downtown Lima and prepare for the thrill of a lifetime atop the dunes in the Ica province.

      "title": "Paracas/Islas Ballestas – Scenic Boat Cruise and Beach Relaxation",
      "description": "Peru’s ocean waters will glisten as the sun rises in the sky, and gulls may swoop down without warning as they search for something to eat. Beachgoers will set out brightly colored towels and blankets for a peaceful day of rest while cobalt sea waters teem with vivacious marine life. Today, you will relocate your adventures to the sea when you board a luxurious boat cruise to the Islas Ballestas . Peru is well-regarded for its incredibly diverse plant and animal life, and you will soon see why. As you navigate the rolling waves of the sparkling Pacific Ocean, you will soon come to a rocky alcove where dozens of native sea lions, which are also known as the \"Sea Wolf\" or \"South American Sea Lion,\" have taken refuge. On the rocky cliffside, you will be sure to spot the easily recognizable and waddling feet of the Humboldt penguin. Then, you can check out the myriad of seabirds that may be circling overhead, including gulls, pelicans, and terns. You may even spot the native Guanay . Not all sea animals are visible at first glance, though. You may need to scan the deep blue waters for such unique creatures as the Humpback whale, which makes the migration north to warmer temperatures. Although you will have a chance to see the whales, there is no guarantee that they will be spotted. The marine otter also often hides itself away here, so consider yourself lucky if you happen to catch a peek of either of these creatures. In the afternoon, the sandy shores of Paracas will be the perfect spot to relax as you look out on the shimmering coastline. You can dig your toes into the sandy shoreline before choosing from several authentic dining options, each with idyllic coastal views. Later, you will indulge in one of many coveted Peruvian dishes like escabeche de pescado or arroz con mariscos . You will then spend the night at your cozy villa, which will be a five-star accommodation in Ica's countryside."

      "title": "Pachacamac District – Exploration of Ancient Civilizations and Ecotourism",
      "description": "While the buzzing energy of modern life is in full swing in the nation's capital, hints of a storied past are also tucked behind nearly every corner, spanning thousands of years. Remnants of ancient civilizations, even those that pre-date the Inca Empire, exude from every corner. Despite the Spanish conquest of the 16th and 17th centuries, many of these relics remain largely intact. You will visit one such example on today's trip to the Pachacamac District. This archaeological site along the Lurin River has been inhabited since as early as 200 AD. Here, you can tour the massive compound of this ancient civilization. Shallow stone steps of the Temple of the Sun span 30,000 meters and will lead you to the former site of ritualistic offerings. Here, you can take a look at the Tauri Chumbi Palace, Calle Norte Sur , and the carefully constructed gravesites. In the afternoon, you will experience the best of Peru's ecotourism. Considered one of the most geographically diverse regions in the world from towering mountain peaks to low-lying valleys and from grassy plains and sparkling coastlines to the hidden wonders of the Amazonian Jungle, Peru is an ideal location for a scenic hike among luscious green foliage. You will venture to Lomas de Lucumo, where you can trek through the dense cloud forest along well-established trails. You should also keep watch for bursting flowers, mossy green cliff sides, and hilly terrain. At the peak of the rainy season, a mystic fog may descend on the region and beckon you to indulge in a closer look. At each bend in the road, new beauties are unveiled. In the evening, you will return to Lima for your final evening in the city. Water's edge will set the scene for an idyllic last night in the city while you bite into citrusy ceviche and sip on sweet chica morada juice."
