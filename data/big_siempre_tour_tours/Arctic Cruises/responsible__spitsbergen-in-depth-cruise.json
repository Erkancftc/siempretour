      "description": "Svalbard Archipelago: Over the course of the next nine days we will immerse ourselves in the spectacular coastline of Spitsbergen, the largest island in the Svalbard archipelago, with our unique Polar vessel allowing us to visit remote and seldom-visited areas on a constant search for wildlife and historical and scenic experiences. Our exact route and itinerary will be dependent on ice, sea and weather conditions and will be determined on a day by day basis - this is true expedition sailing after all. Exploring as many remote areas as possible we will visit ice-covered fjords with breathtaking mountain scenery and glaciers, land at historical and cultural sites and spend time sailing through the ice in search of polar bears hunting seals. Making land at unforgettable stops across the island we will hope for sightings of Arctic fox and Svalbard's unique reindeer, learning all about the area's distinctive tundra and geological features as we go. With plenty of days for exploration, we will attempt to circumnavigate the island if possible. If ice conditions are favourable we will hope to sail through Hinlopen Strait towards the island’s east coast, before sailing south into the Freemansundet area. As with all Polar expeditions, the conditions will determine our route however, and we may decide to explore alternative routes to make every moment of our time in this truly remote destination count. The route taken may also depend on which part of the season you are sailing in; late season voyages often result in a full circumnavigation of the island as the waterways are less ice-clogged and a late-season voyage could take us to the seldom-explored areas of Kvitoya and Nordaustlandet. On early season voyages there are more large ice floes and Arctic pack ice, which although means we may not be able to venture entirely around the island, will usually bring more frequent wildlife viewing. Whichever route we take we will be on a constant lookout for wildlife, and with near 24 hour daylight, there are lots of opportunities, so be prepared to be called at any time for close up polar bear, walrus or whale sightings. We will also see lots of birds, including hopefully the rare and lovely ivory gull, plus little auks, guillemots, puffins and more. Each day will be spent exploring by Zodiac or on foot experiencing once-in-a-lifetime encounters and scenic opportunities."
