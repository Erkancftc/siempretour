  "generalInfo": "Our trips are led by experienced natural history experts and we aim to navigate deep inside dramatic fjords and enjoy daily guided walks across spectacular tundra, dotted with a unique flora, fauna and a fascinating human history.~<br/><br/>Spitsbergen is home to more than 2,000 polar bears, large numbers of walruses, reindeer and Arctic foxes, as well as huge colonies of birds, The Midnight sun and ice-free shores help facilitate the exploration of the unspoilt natural beauty of this area.<br/><br/>With its rugged mountains, sweeping tundra and ancient glaciers, Svalbard  lies just 600 miles from the North Pole. This true Arctic wilderness represents a remote and fragile region, steeped in history and rich in wildlife.<br/><br/>A voyage on the waters of the Arctic seas is not one you merely take to reach your destination but one to savour in itself; giving you time and space to remove those urban cobwebs and revitalise the mind. Sitting quietly the edge of a creaking glacier or amid a noisy colony of Little Auks are the memories you will take away.<br/><br/>From the outset, the seascape is both rich and expansive, where one may marvel as colossal whales raising their tail flukes from the water; follow beautiful skuas wheeling through the skies after smaller birds or watch as iconic polar bears walk along frozen pack ice in search of seals. <br/><br/>We provide you with the opportunity to explore Spitsbergen onboard a beautiful 34 passenger three masted sailing ship.  We will sail when wind and sea conditions allow and welcome your participation in the sailing as much or as little as you wish.<br/><br/>This charismatic vessel offers en suite accommodation, delicious meals, a cosy bar and plenty of deck area to relax, observe and find your own space.  As the sails unfurl and catch the winds, a touch of exploration and romanticism is added to your Arctic adventure. <br/><br/>All of these trips include a programme of lectures by noted naturalists and the leadership of experienced expedition staff. <br/><br/>Arctic Spring Departures (May)<br/>The most optimistic highlight of the year in the Arctic is the rise of the sun and the recession of the Arctic Sea Ice. You can see this taking place in full force in the early Arctic Spring.<br/><br/>There is a true sea change taking place during this period with a lovely combination of Midnight Sun yet Winter Wonderland feel to Spitsbergen. Passage to the North may sometimes still hindered by sea ice, but from our start point in Longyearbyen the Gulf Stream will be forging a warm water way through. The mountain landscapes of Spitsbergen are also changing fast, from an almost uniform snow white to black where rocky mountains emerge from within.<br/><br/>North Spitsbergen Sailing expedition (June - July)<br/>Our North Spitsbergen sailing voyages provide access to some of the best opportunities to see the prolific Arctic birdlife; with king eider, Sabines gulls and Arctic skuas all found alongside the more common guillemots and little auks. Around Ny Ålesund, reindeer are dotted across the tundra and ringed seals haul themselves out in the shadow of the towering, groaning glacier. Trips along the north-western coast provide the best opportunities to see beluga; with these gentle white whales coming close into shore with their calves and sightings of both walruses and polar bears in this area are common. <br/><br/>Departures<br/><br/>33 passenger sailing brigantine<br/>(8 days /7 nights)<br/><br/>01 - 08 May 2026 (Ski &amp; Sail)<br/>29 May - 05 Jun (Hike &amp; Sail)<br/>Price from €3,540pp sharing<br/><br/>(11 days / 10 nights)<br/>Longyearbyen - Longyearbyen<br/>05 - 15 Jun 2026<br/>25 Jun - 05 Jul 2026<br/>05 - 15 Jul 2026<br/>Price: from €4,990 pp sharing<br/><br/>Please contact us for detailed day-by day itineraries.",
