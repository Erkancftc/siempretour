The bustling streets of the city fill with Josefinos--residents of San Jose--and music, astounding murals and museums packed with layers of gold. A private transfer greets you at the airport and escorts you to a gorgeous hotel located in the heart of the relaxed city known for its fast-pace in contrast to the surrounding country. The hotel is located on a serene shady street and offers you a quiet oasis close to the pulsing beat of the capital. The halls are decorated with lush tropical flowers that emanate a sweet and exotic aroma. The central market echoes with life at all times of the day. The bright lights of the city illuminate the precious landscapes to come. The scent of exotic spices and coffee beans drift through the aisles of the circular marketplace. Vendors showcase bright fruits reminding you of the tropical setting outside of San Jose with giant watermelons standing on tables or sweet mangos shining with yellow and green rinds. The delicious fruits represent nature’s abundance in Costa Rica, fed by the tropical climate, volcanic soils, and large following of organic cultivation."

      "description": "The morning spirit fills the city with activity. Children rush through La Sabana Park and watch the ducks swim around the pond. The scent of fresh coffee from Costa Rican sourced beans fills the dining room at breakfast. Today you make your way from the capital city’s crowds to the tranquil trees and beaches of the Caribbean. Arrive at your jungle lodge and find an entire gorgeous resort made for with seclusion in mind by combining the jungle ambiance with exceptional luxury. The surrounding trees provide shelter for the wildlife of Costa Rica’s cherished rainforest, including howler and capuchin monkeys. The Pacuare River careens around the foothills of the Talamanca Mountains. The hotel is situated between the towns of Turrialba and Siquirres. The roofs are made from palm leaves and your own private deck looks out over the canopy that runs along the rolling jungle hills. Relax in the comfortable waters of your private trickling plunge pool and let the day drift away or, for an intimate experience in the privacy of the jungle terrain, you could partake in a soothing couples massage. The sounds of birdsongs mix with the waters rushing from the river for a peaceful soundtrack as you and your loved one find comfort in the company and the aroma of jasmine blending with the herbaceous trees of your surroundings."

      "description": "The beauty of the rainforest can be viewed from the comforts of your private plunge pool or with an excursion through the towering trees. The day is at your leisure to enjoy the remarkable landscape as you desire, whether cozying up to your partner and marveling at the panorama or taking an adventurous ride through the trees, together. A day of canyoneering takes you into the charm and awe of the rainforest. A series of rope bridges lead you beneath the canopy still overlooking the forest floor. A troop of capuchin monkey scrambles through the trees shaking the distant branches. The rush and splash of whitewater from a waterfall echoes from a small cliff. You notice the pool billowing below. Mist rises from the rippling water and provides a refreshing touch to the warm tropical heat. Your guide leads you down the cliff-side and you can feel the cool rushing water tapping at your shoulders. Your guide straps you in for a short but thrilling descent to the base of the precipice. The rocks are firm but wet. The waterfall splashes beside you. Orange-chinned parakeets twitter in the canopy. Your heart pounds from the thrill of abseiling and the beauty of endless views. After an adventurous day, you settle into the evening with the sensual delights of a three-course dinner and the soothing sounds of the surrounding jungle after dark."

      "description": "The rainforest sings in the morning with the low guttural call of howler monkeys hooting after sunrise. They can grow to over 35 inches long and produce calls audible for up to three miles. Leaves rustle and the cool, misty air wraps around your skin. After breakfast, you begin the exciting half-day river rafting tour along the Pacuare River. The river borders the Talamanca Mountains and leads to the Atlantic Ocean traveling a length of more than 65 miles. The water is a pure turquoise, cool and crisp to the touch. The calm and serene setting lets you float downstream. Tall, craggy cliffs line the river and you can hear the rapids in the distance. You maneuver around large boulders. Trees sprout from the rugged bordering cliffs and shade the waterway. The rapids come quick and strong. The mist splashes up from the water and hits your cheeks. You paddle and push your way through the extent of the path above the rapids until the water turns placid. You float alongside small waterfalls and listen for herons or the calls of white-chinned swift. In the afternoon, your private transfer escorts you to a gorgeous hotel near the base of the popular Arenal Volcano. Your room has a private view to the conical peak with a window framed by the lush tropical landscape supported by the rich minerals in the volcanic soil."

      "description": "The morning is filled with naturally sweet treats such as ripe, juicy mangos and creamy bananas. The luscious scent of coconut fills the room and the saccharine taste of pineapple lingers on your tongue. After breakfast you venture out on a guided tour through the canopy to experience the jungle from the perspective of a bird. The air brushes against your cheeks as you soar across the first zip line on a course ranging between 40 and 1,400 feet in length. High in the treetops, you become familiar with the avifauna and the warm sunlight beaming through the open trees. An ornate hawk-eagle perches in the trees and decorates the branches in view of the line. They grow up to 27 inches tall with a wingspan reaching nearly 60 inches wide. Their prominent crest raises when excited. As you glide to a series of platforms you have a remarkable view of the volcano. The steam rises out of the crater and mixes with the sporadic clouds. The lush rainforest displays an everlasting grandeur in the blossoming flowers and dense leaves. The vibrant diurnal life of the wild fades in the warm afternoon as sloths, monkeys, and avifauna seek shade in which to rest. You return to the comforts of your hotel and indulge in the allure of the natural hot springs."

      "title": "Tambor – Enigmatic Wild",
      "description": "The Nicoya Peninsula is known for its relaxed atmosphere along a sensual coastline. The sapphire water brushes against the soft sand and peels up the gold-sand beach. Waves create picturesque barrels before crashing down and filling the air with the soothing and familiar sound. The shoreline presses against the edge of rainforest with trees climbing the roaming foothills and mountains. Your private transfer collects you at the Tambor Airport after a short flight from Arenal. You can hear the sounds of howler monkeys calling in the forest trees before they hide from the mid-morning heat. You reach the grounds of your accommodation, which overlooks the palm trees lining the soft gold sand of Playa Tambor. The tranquil setting blends the elegant twittering of the tropical birds with the soothing sound of lapping water. The resort provides a private location surrounded by the unspoiled beauty of nature for an unforgettable, romantic setting. Relax in the intimate location in view of Whale Bay and the lush hills shaping the volcanic valley. The remainder of the day is yours to experience the majesty of the resort at your leisure. The restaurant on the property features seafood caught fresh that morning and popular dishes blending traditional Costa Rican flavors and seductive international delights. The resort demonstrates a commitment to sustainability in daily practice while also providing the nearby villages with educational supplies to inform a new generation about the importance of living in a healthy and vibrant coastal community. The spa provides an elegant, secluded destination amidst the foliage where you can relax in a jacuzzi or stretch your muscles in an empowering yoga session. For a more active adventure to experience as a couple, you set out onto the trails leading into the trees for a guided birding expedition searching for the nearly 300 bird species recorded around the property, which includes the elusive and threatened scarlet macaw. The trails consist of bridges and resting areas spread across more than four miles. Your guide quickly points out a purple gallinule, whose plumage shimmers with dark purple hues around the head leading to a green back and light blue forehead."

      "description": "The day is yours to indulge in the romance and seclusion of your resort as you wish. Journey through the jungle on a guided trek or lounge on the soft, hot sand at the fringe of the lapping water. For an exciting and active tour, you venture out with your guide on a kayak expedition for a different view of Costa Rica’s fabled ecosystems. As you venture on to the ocean, the paddle drips refreshing water down the pole and onto your fingers. The sunlight glints against the white sands of the coastline. Your guide leads you along the seascape bordering Curu Wildlife Refuge, a small preserve protecting nearly 210 acres of pristine scenery. Pelicans glide over the clear water, dipping their open beaks beneath the surface to scoop up unsuspecting fish. You continue inland along the mangrove estuary, finding playful white-faced capuchin monkey foraging for berries. The monkey reaches a length of nearly 18 inches with a tail extending another 22 inches long. Their tail assists the monkey when feeding by supporting their body weight when foraging or helping them balance when running through the trees."

      "description": "Today is another day of luxury and exploration. At breakfast, you take the time to indulge in the simple pleasures of a freshly brewed cup of Costa Rican coffee, finding the hints of citrus and caramel in the flavor. After the meal, you can choose your own adventure by visiting the far reaches of the Nicoya Peninsula’s beauty ranging from Playa el Carmen to the 17th-century church of San Blas. Stroll along Waterfall Trail and see the natural geography create spectacular rainbow-clad waterfalls. The rainfall streams down the rolling hills and sudden cliffs to create a collection of elegant cascades and deep pools. Roseate spoonbills graze on the marshy riverbanks. They resemble pink flamingos in both size and color. Montezuma Falls is one of the most celebrated falls in the country and is an accumulation of three separate cascades. The lowest of the falls trundles down a cliff from nearly 80 feet above the waiting pool. Thrill-seekers climb up to the top of the cliff and dive from the highest point down into the rippling water below. A rope allows daredevils to swing from the cliff and plunge into the depths of the water near the splashing curtain of the cascade. The tallest waterfall thunders down with powerful force while the two smaller falls bead down with more elegance. The greenery opens around the pools and you can dip your body into the water for a refreshing stop surrounded by the flourishing greenery of the smallest falls at 15 feet tall."

Your instructor welcomes you like a member of the family. You find bowls with salt, harina flour, and water on the table. You quickly learn how to mix the ingredients to make a dough before rolling out small balls which you will flatten before cooking.

      "description": "Lounge on the beach and let the sunshine wash over your skin or take part in a private guided tour through the hills. The days in the diverse landscape and ecosystems of Manuel Antonio National Park overflow with possibility. You return to the water to explore the mangroves at Damas Island that create wide and narrow canals leading into the ocean. Follow your guide alongside the winding and leaning estuary to observe the natural marvels of the island. The water from the ocean is cool as it drips off of your paddle. The trees line the banks and sprout from the water itself. White-headed capuchin monkeys watch you from the trees. Their tails curl around the branches and their watchful eyes follow you upstream. Your guide points to a dangling vine before you realize it is actually a boa constrictor. The snake can reach 13 feet in length and can weigh 100 pounds. Every push of your paddle takes you deeper into the island’s winding canals and into its secluded reaches in search of more unique wildlife sightings you can share with your loved-one as a couple."

      "description": "The sounds of the national park are incandescent. When you wake in the morning the rainforest is already alive with calls from howler monkeys and the waves splash against the coastline. Your final day can be spent relaxing poolside and watching the palm trees create the unique and gorgeous skyline or venturing into the Manuel Antonio National Park in search of the endangered squirrel monkey. In the early afternoon, you board a catamaran for an exploration of the sea and the sunset. The sparkling water opens up along the horizon and you can see the rolling hills of the national park carpeted in dense jade. Cliffs rise against the edge of the placid water texturing your view of the landscape. The water contains an inviting warmth with a slight salty aroma. When the boat stops you can jump into the sea and look at the coral making its home on the ocean floor. Schools of yellow-tailed surgeonfish wade through the bright water. Butterfly fish swim with the elegant coloring of butterfly wings. As the sun begins to set you find the splendor of the horizon burning with rich and enchanting brightness. Suddenly the flaming sunset cools and the stars light up the night."
