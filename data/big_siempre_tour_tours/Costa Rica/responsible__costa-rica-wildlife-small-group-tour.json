  "generalInfo": "This small group wildlife holiday plunges headlong into the valleys, rainforests and white-sand coastlines that carve Costa Rica. Poas Volcano gives you a toucan’s-eye view of the countryside. Arenal Volcano comes complete with hot springs. And you’ll spend a day around the Pacuare River, choosing to white water raft through forest-cloaked canyons.<br/><br/>The national parks rustle with wildlife. Sail to Tortuguero National Park, where toucans and howler monkeys flit between the jungle canals and lagoons. People-shy ocelots, tapir and jaguar also hide away here. The Savegre Cloud Forest is a treasure trove of natural history and rare birdlife. Manuel Antonio National Park is a different flavour of reserve, backing onto the sand-swept Pacific Coast. This is the place to spot capuchin monkeys and sloths.<br/><br/>With two weeks under your belt – and plenty of free time – this small group wildlife holiday to Costa Rica gives you the transport and accommodation, but also the breathing room you need, to explore this country.",

      "title": "Join trip in San Jose",
      "description": ": Our tour starts today in San Jose, Costa Rica's cosmopolitan capital. Lying in a fertile valley, at an altitude of 1,150 metres, coffee and sugar are big industries here - coffee is even planted between buildings and along the roadsides on the outskirts of the city. For those arriving in time, our tour leader plans to meet you in the hotel reception at 7pm for a welcome meeting, and for those that wish there'll be the chance to go out for dinner. There are no other activities planned today, so you're free to arrive in San Jose at any time. If you'd like an airport transfer, you'll need to arrive into San Jose's Juan Santamaria International Airport (SJO), which is around a 30-minute drive from our hotel. If you miss the welcome meeting, your tour leader will inform you of any essential information as soon as you catch up. If your flight arrives earlier in the day, you might like to head out and explore the city - the barrios are easy to navigate, laid out in a grid pattern of avenues and streets. The National Museum (Museo Nacional De Costa Rica) is also well worth a visit."

      "title": "Visit the Doka Coffee Estate; drive to San Gerardo de Dota and the Savegre Cloud Forest",
      "description": ": This morning, we'll head to the Doka Estate, renowned across Costa Rica for its premium coffee production. This estate is a cornerstone of Costa Rica's rich coffee heritage, where you'll gain insights into the entire process, from cultivation to roasting, and learn why Costa Rican coffee is celebrated worldwide for its quality and flavour. You'll also discover how coffee has shaped the country's culture and economy over generations. After our visit to Doka Estate, we'll drive south out of San Jose for around four hours, down to the wild cloud forest of Savegre, famously one of the best places in Costa Rica for sightings of the elusive Resplendent Quetzal. The peaceful region gives us the perfect introduction to Costa Rica's nature. Hikers will enjoy the forest trails and the journey through the alpine-like hills, while nature lovers visit for its biodiversity - the area around San Gerardo de Dota contains around 200 species of bird and countless plant types including various orchid species. This afternoon, we'll explore the trails around our lodge, perhaps crossing the path of the river, as we delve into the surrounding cloud forest. It's worth noting that our lodge for the next two nights is at high altitude and can get chilly. We'd recommend packing a couple of warm layers."

      "title": "Early morning search for quetzal; free day to explore Savegre Cloud Forest",
      "description": ": We'll have an early start today, as we set out to explore the trails surrounding our lodge in the search for the quetzal. The males of the species are vivid, with a red breast, green crest and the iconic long green tail that dangles from the branches. Despite the bright colours, they're effective at camouflage and are surprisingly difficult to pick out among the green trees. Binoculars are a useful addition to your kit here, as our tour leader will be diligently attempting to find us one of these famous birds. After returning to the lodge for breakfast, we'll have the rest of the day free. There are enough walks and trails around the lodge to easily spend a day here. The forest is rich in flora and fauna, and the mountainous cloud forest landscapes are the perfect canvas for keen photographers."

      "title": "Travel to rural Turrialba; free afternoon and evening meal at a traditional finca (farm)",
      "description": ": Today, we'll head to Turrialba, an important agricultural region thanks to its fertile land and the origin of much of Costa Rica's coffee, sugar and Macadamia nuts, not to mention dairy. The journey will take around three hours. We'll arrive in the afternoon and take some time to explore the small town before dinner. This evening, we'll be visiting a typical 'finca' (farm), for a traditional meal, giving us a chance to try the local cuisine."

      "title": "Whitewater rafting through the forest-covered Pacuare River",
      "description": ": One of Costa Rica's most scenic rivers, the Pacuare is great for both rafting aficionados and enthusiastic newcomers. Calm stretches between the class III-IV rapids give you time to appreciate the passage through rainforest-topped canyons and tumbling waterfalls. Macaws and blue morpho butterflies wheel past as we raft through the steep, green walls of the canyon. Our adventure will be led by experienced rafting guides, who'll teach us the basics, so don't worry if you haven't tried rafting before. The first section of the canyon is mainly II-III rapids, giving us a chance to practice our skills. We'll then move into the III-IV rapids. The river has a good mix of rapids along the way, giving us the perfect mix of adventure and fun. It's worth noting that, while it's possible to raft year-round, it does depend on weather conditions. If the water levels on the Pacuare are low, there's another section of the river called 'Finca San Martin' that we'll raft instead - this is a four-mile stretch of class III rapids interspersed with calmer sections, creeks and waterfalls. After our rafting adventure, we'll have lunch on the river before returning to our hotel in the early afternoon. This evening is free to relax and recoup from the day. If you're not a confident swimmer, or the thought of rafting isn't for you, we can organise an alternative activity for you. You could choose to take a trip to CATIE and its huge botanical garden, or alternatively a visit to the community-led Aquiares coffee plantation, where you'll learn about the coffee-making process as well as some of the culture and traditions of the area. The Tour Leader will ask your group on the first day or two of the tour to confirm whether you want to raft or not so that they can make the reservations. *Please be aware that Class II-III white water rapids are available to all adults on rivers throughout Costa Rica. However, for Class IV rapids and above, some rivers may have lower and upper age restrictions (65 years+). For specific information, please consult with our tour leader."

      "title": "Journey by bus and boat to Tortuguero National Park",
      "description": ": This morning, we'll take a two-and-a-half-hour drive to Costa Rica's luscious Caribbean coast, driving through extensive banana plantations. From either Cano Blanco or Pavona, a boat will take us to our spectacular lodge in the Tortuguero National Park, where we'll spend the next two nights. Its complex canal system and narrow lagoons link small, isolated settlements and are rich in fish, including rainbow bass and grouper. They also support an abundance of birds, such as herons, storks and kingfishers as well as 60 species of mammal with howler and spider monkeys in the treetops. Upon arrival at our lodge, we'll take a short walking tour of the car-less village of Tortuguero."

      "title": "Full day to explore Tortuguero National Park searching for wildlife",
      "description": ": Today we'll begin to explore the Tortuguero National Park. To kick off our day, there's the optional activity of a bird-watching trip by boat at dawn, where we'll have the opportunity to spot some of Costa Rica's spectacular birdlife. Water birds such as herons, egrets and kingfishers are among the birds that may be spotted, although other species of birds such as toucans may be found in the area. Later this morning, we'll go on a nature walk to understand more about the area's unique ecosystem. Then, this afternoon, we'll take to the waterways for further exploration. On our travels, we may come across the howler monkey, aptly named by the way it noisily protects its territory. Much shyer animals in this area include ocelots, tapir and the incredibly elusive jaguar. Please note some departures may do the waterways tour in the morning and the nature walk in the afternoon. Your tour leader will confirm. Throughout the year, you might be lucky enough to see different species of turtle nesting close to our lodge. The best time to see this spectacle is between July and September when over five thousand green turtles come ashore to nest on Tortuguero's beaches. At this time of year, there's the option of an evening turtle walk in the company of experienced guides."

      "description": ": Leaving our lodge this morning, we'll travel by boat back to either Cano Blanco or Pavona, before stopping for lunch at Guapiles. After lunch, we have the chance to stop at a traditional Costa Rican Frutería, where we have the chance to try the many delicious fruit that this region of the world is known for. Our final destination of the day is Puerto Viejo Sarapiqui. The total journey by bus today will take approximately four hours. After checking into our hotel, this evening we'll take a night walk in the Selva Verde Rainforest, in search of nocturnal species such as snakes and tarantulas."

      "title": "Morning nature walk in Selva Verde Rainforest Reserve & Chocolate tour",
      "description": ": Our lodge has many onsite trails in the secondary rainforest, leading right into the Selva Verde Reserve. This morning, we'll take a short walk on some of the trails, through a tropical paradise of towering almendro trees and keel-billed toucans. After, we'll visit La Tirimbina for a chocolate tour. During the two-and-a-half-hour tour, we'll learn the secrets and wonders of one of mankind's favourite foods: chocolate. Originally from Central America, the cacao plant has an extraordinary history; it was one of the most important products for the Mayan and Aztec cultures. The discovery of America led to the introduction of chocolate in Europe, transforming it into the product we all know today. This afternoon is free for optional activities."

      "title": "Travel to Fortuna, hike Arenal Volcano, optional hot springs visit",
      "description": ": This morning, you have the opportunity to explore a Pineapple plantation on an optional tour, to delve into the fascinating world of this remarkable fruit, for which Costa Rica is renowned as a global exporter. Later, we travel one hour (70kms) to La Fortuna. The town was renamed after an eruption in 1968 that decimated the towns around the volcano's western flanks. Translated as 'fortune', La Fortuna refers to the town's luck in being located on the volcano's eastern side, and so, fortunately, escaping destruction. In the afternoon, we'll drive just over an hour to Arenal, skirting around the great central volcanic massif, passing through fertile farmlands that are rich with tropical crops. Arenal is a classic conical volcano which was famous for its nightly eruptions until it went quiet in 2010. We'll be exploring the national park on foot, taking a hike on the flanks of the volcano, which are covered by a tangled mass of vegetation on one side and starkly barren on the other. Our tour leader will point out interesting flora and fauna and provide more information about the science and history of the volcano, before taking us to a viewpoint for a closer look. The excursion will take approximately 3 hours. Tonight, you have the option to visit the hot springs."

      "description": ": Today is free for you to explore the Arenal area as you choose. There are local treks to waterfalls if you'd like to head out into the surrounding nature. For wildlife lovers there's the option to join a wildlife spotting tour, seeking the famous sloth, the poisonous blue jeans dart frog and the multi-coloured toucan among other species. There are also hanging bridges and zip-wire adventures, which allow you to discover the rainforest at canopy height, either by flying through it or taking a walk across suspension bridges, with a birds-eye view. Your tour leader will be able to provide information on all the options."

      "title": "Drive south to Manuel Antonio National Park",
      "description": ": Leaving the volcano behind us this morning, we'll depart early to descend to the Pacific Coast, enjoying staggering views over the Gulf and Peninsula of Nicoya. Heading south, we'll pause at Carara Biological Reserve, famed for the scarlet macaws and abundant birdlife which populate this transitional forest and do a 1.5 hour hike here. Finally, we'll continue along the Pacific Coast to Manuel Antonio National Park, where we'll spend the next three nights. It's worth noting that while Manuel Antonio is a haven for nature lovers, it has grown in popularity in recent years and so is often busier than you might expect. Our journey time today will be between five and six hours."

      "title": "Explore Manuel Antonio's wildlife and beaches",
      "description": ": This morning, we'll explore the Manuel Antonio National Park, famous for its beautiful beaches and rich wildlife. During our time in the park, we're likely to see white-faced capuchin monkeys, coatimundi (part of the raccoon family) and tiny squirrel monkeys. This is also one of the best places in Costa Rica to see sloths. The sloth's diet is mainly made up of buds and leaves. As leaves provide little energy, sloths move only when necessary and even then, very slowly so they're quite easy to spot! The remainder of the day can be spent relaxing on the white sandy beaches, enjoying a swim in the warm, azure waters. The sunsets from this coast are spectacular and must be seen to be believed. Please note that Manuel Antonio National Park is closed on Tuesdays. If Day 13 of your departure falls on a Tuesday, our included park visit will take place on Day 14 instead."
