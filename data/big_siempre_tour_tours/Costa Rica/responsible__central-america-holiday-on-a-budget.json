  "generalInfo": "This budget Central America tour takes you to some of the best places in the region, whilst keeping costs down. Travelling by private minibus in a group of no more than 16 explorers, you get all the camaraderie of a road trip, without getting bogged down in the planning. <br/><br/>Starting in the city of Antigua in Guatemala, and ending in San Jose, capital of Costa Rica, this tour takes you through Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua, too: that’s five countries over 17 exciting days. There are some long drives – the longest is 14 hours from El Salvador to Granada, Nicaragua – but the trip has been carefully designed so there are plenty of rest days too. <br/><br/>You’re not just on the road: you get multiple nights in some of the most enticing destinations, and free days to explore independently, or with new friends if you want. This mix of social and solo time is great and flexible. You can choose to relax at a beach resort in El Cuco, El Salvador – or go kayaking instead. In Monteverde, Costa Rica, go mountain biking, or for a hike in the cloud forest. <br/><br/>This trip is popular for a reason – it’s a great way to see a great deal of Central America, and a great deal of fun, too. <br/>",

      "title": "Antigua.",
      "description": "Bienvenidos! Welcome to Guatemala. With crumbling churches, bustling markets and bohemian cafes set against a monumental volcano, Antigua is the perfect place to begin your adventure. Your adventure officially begins with a welcome meeting at 6 pm tonight. If you arrive early, maybe satisfy your cravings and learn the art of old-world chocolate production at the ChocoMuseo or sit by the fountain and people-watch in Central Park. After the meeting, the night is yours – maybe head out with some of your fellow travellers for a tamale (a classic staple of Mesoamerica with dough, meat and sauces steamed and served in a corn husk)."

      "title": "Copan, Honduras.",
      "description": "Rise and shine early this morning to beat the rush-hour traffic around Antigua. Departing at about 7 am, you’ll drive towards Copan. Along the way, watch the passing scenery and learn about local life in Guatemala as you head for the border. Cross into Honduras, arriving in the small town of Copan in the early afternoon. While most people use Copan as a base to explore the nearby ruins, there are plenty of other points of interest, both along the cobblestone streets and set into the lush surroundings. Maybe get started in the Central Plaza and follow your nose to a cafe for the afternoon."
    },
    {
      "dayNumber": 3,
      "title": "Copan, Honduras.",
      "description": "This morning, meet up with a local guide and explore the World Heritage-listed ruins of Copan – the southernmost of the great Maya sites. It's unique because of the numerous elaborate stelae (carved columns) still intact among temples, excavated vaults and walls inscribed with ancient faces. After your exploration, the rest of the afternoon is free to choose your own adventure. Maybe check out some fine feathered friends at the Macaw Mountain Park or visit the Temple of Rosalila. You could also head to the nearby natural hot springs - this optional tour gives you hours of soaking in mud, steaming natural baths and refreshing pools in the lush jungle, with an included dinner."

      "title": "Copan to Suchitoto via Guatemala.",
      "description": "You’ll wave goodbye to Copan this morning and head across the border to Guatemala and into El Salvador. It’s a long travel day, so make sure you’ve got a good book or your favourite road trip games handy. When you arrive in Suchitoto, you’ll head out on a leader-led orientation walk of the town – widely considered the cultural capital of El Salvador. Admire the elaborate building facades, get your bearings and enjoy the surroundings. Then, get your chef’s hat on with a pupusa-making demonstration. Pupusa (cornmeal flatbreads) is a classic Salvadorian recipe from the Pipil culture and is usually stuffed with some delicious ingredients, like cheese or chicharron (fried pork)."

      "title": "Suchitoto.",
      "description": "This morning, head to a local designer’s home for an indigo-dying demonstration – Suchitoto is one of the best places in the world to produce indigo (used to dye clothing or other items blue). You’ll visit a local designer transforming tradition into modern design to learn the history of the indigo trade. This small enterprise supports single mothers by providing them with an income for their children’s education, food and independence. Watch the demonstration, then get hands-on and try it for yourself. The rest of the day is free in Suchitoto. The town overlooks the Embalse Cerron Grande – also known as Lago Suchitlan, this freshwater lake is a haven for migrating birds, particularly falcons and hawks. Maybe grab a historically-minded group for a guided walk through Cinquera Forest, where guerrilla fighters used the forest as cover during the Civil War."

      "title": "Leon.",
      "description": "Rise nice and early for a full day of travel as you cross the Gulf of Fonseca to reach Nicaragua by boat. In the afternoon you'll reach Leon – the second-largest city in Nicaragua. When you arrive, join your leader on an orientation walk through the charming city streets to get your bearings. Leon is a relatively quiet city, which makes strolling the murals and contemporary architecture a real treat! Tonight, maybe head out to dinner with your group – as always, your leader will have the best recommendations."
    },

      "dayNumber": 8,
      "title": "Leon.",
      "description": "Today is a free day to make the most of Leon. Maybe visit the street food area behind the Lady of Grace Cathedral and try a Nica taco (made with maize, the taco is rolled, deep fried and then served with shredded cabbage smothered in cream). You could also take on a thrilling volcano sandboarding adventure on the black slopes of Cerro Negro Volcano. Maybe you’d just like to explore the city’s contemporary art or wander the Leon Cathedral."

      "dayNumber": 9,
      "title": "Granada.",
      "description": "This morning, you’ll drive to the oldest city in the New World – Granada. Along the way, you’ll have the chance to stretch your legs and take in the view at Laguna Apoyo – a volcanic crater lake formed around 23,000 years ago. Enjoy some free time for lunch near the viewpoint. Then, stop at the lakeside town of Masaya, where you’ll go on an orientation walk with your leader and get the chance to browse the stalls at the town’s famous artisan market before continuing to Granada. Featuring Moorish and Andalusian architecture, Granada is set on the banks of Lake Nicaragua and is surrounded by active volcanoes. When you arrive, your leader will take you on an orientation walk through the leafy Parque Central and La Calzada – a busy pedestrian street with plenty of bars and restaurants. The afternoon is yours to explore the city at your own pace."

      "title": "Granada.",
      "description": "This morning you’ll have breakfast with your group at Cafe de las Sonrisas – a cafe run entirely by people who are hard of hearing. The owner is aiming to bridge the gap and inspire other business owners to employ local people living with disabilities. After, the rest of the day is yours. Maybe hit the Convento y Museo San Francisco and view the collection of indigenous stone statues. Hundreds of evergreen islets dot the waters of vast Lake Nicaragua and you can spend a few hours exploring them by boat or hire a kayak and find your own way around, waving at the fisherman who live in wooden huts along the way. Just remember not to swim, as freshwater sharks live in the water!"

      "title": "Monteverde.",
      "description": "Today is another early start as you get ready for a full day of travel. Journey to Monteverde, where you can begin exploring this afternoon on an orientation walk with your leader. Monteverde was founded as an agricultural community in 1951 by a group of North American Quakers. These environmentally aware settlers also established a small wildlife sanctuary, which has since grown into the internationally renowned Monteverde Cloud Forest Biological Preserve. Cloud forests are like rainforests, but instead, draw their water from a semi-permanent cloud covering the region. This is truly a nature lover's paradise! More than 2000 plant species, 320 bird species and 100 mammal species call Monteverde home."

      "dayNumber": 12,
      "title": "Monteverde.",
      "description": "Begin the day with breakfast at a local women’s cooperative cafe. The cafe started with eight women in 1982 and has grown in number over the years, enabling many women without any formal education to generate income for their households without having to leave home, meaning they can continue caring for their children. In store, there are a variety of handmade products – be sure to check them out! The rest of your day is free to explore Monteverde at your own pace. Maybe zoom through the treetops on a ziplining adventure, or for a more relaxed experience, discover Costa Rica's agricultural heritage on a coffee and chocolate tour. Tonight, you’ll have the option to end your day with a night walk through the cloud forest to spot nocturnal creatures in their natural habitat."

      "title": "La Fortuna.",
      "description": "This morning, head out to the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve, where you’ll join a local guide to walk the reserve trails. As you walk, learn about the fascinating biodiversity of the region, look for the resplendent quetzal and listen for the sounds of howler monkeys. This afternoon, take a minibus to the shores of Lake Arenal, where you’ll then take a boat across the lake to the little town of La Fortuna. On a clear day, you'll have fantastic views of the surrounding area. Watching the massive Arenal Volcano loom larger as you approach is a spectacular sight. Once you reach La Fortuna, take another vehicle to the hotel, then freshen up and head out on a leader-led orientation walk."

      "dayNumber": 14,
      "title": "La Fortuna.",
      "description": "Why not start your free day today with a smoothie and plan how you want to explore? Maybe take a guided nature hike through the forest surrounding Arenal Volcano, keeping an eye out for rare plants and animals, or see the forest from a series of hanging bridges that offer a great vantage point for spotting wildlife like sloths and rainbow-coloured birds. The volcano’s inner workings also mean that the area is home to several thermal hot springs – an ideal way to relax in the middle of nature. Or maybe check out the 70 m tall La Fortuna waterfall set in the middle of the rainforest and hit the lake on a stand-up paddleboard. A boat safari in Cano Negro Wildlife Refuge offers the opportunity to see lizards, crocodiles and tropical birds in their natural habitat, so if you’re craving more wildlife, this option is perfect!"

      "title": "San Jose.",
      "description": "Spend your final morning in La Fortuna learning the art of Costa Rican tortillas. A local family will guide you through the process, and you’ll get to try the results over lunch. Then, watch the volcano fade into the distance on your private transfer to Costa Rica's capital – San Jose. When you arrive, head out on an orientation walk with your leader to see the main highlights. When you’ve got your bearings, maybe visit the Gold Museum, which has a fantastic collection of pre-Spanish gold art. If you're in the mood for some shopping, maybe head to the outdoor market in the Plaza de la Cultura or the city's Central Market, where you can buy anything from handicrafts to seafood. Tonight, why not join your fellow travellers for an optional farewell dinner."
