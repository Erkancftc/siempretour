  "generalInfo": "Our Costa Rica activity holiday is a twelve day adventure where we take on the challenge of traversing the country, totally under our own steam. In summary, we hike, raft and kayak across this spectacular natural wilderness and so this fully supported expedition will appeal to active adventure seekers. We start in the capital city of San Jose,  cycle along the Pacific coast, trek through the Central Highlands, raft through the Pacuare River Valley on Class II-IV rapids, and then take a slightly slower route down another day by kayak. Finishing at Costa Rica’s Caribbean coast at Caño Blanco. <br/><br/>We stay in the heart of local communities on this Costa Rica adventure tour, in eco camps or lodges, while also meeting indigenous communities living in the famously beautiful cloud forests. Costa Rica is also famous for its prolific wildlife too, of course, and our adventures will take us into rainforest where we are often enveloped by bird song and monkey calls.  <br/><br/>You do need a good level of fitness for this trip, with some moderate to challenging hikes or bike routes along the way. <br/>",

A few kilometers along the highway we turn off and ride along a dirt track beside the Savegre River. A few hours into the ride we get our first taste of Costa Rica’s undulating terrain as we head toward the mountains of the Pacific Coast. In the town of Londres we take a break and enjoy some local color before continuing our ride to camp in the small community of Esquipulas. Cycling distance: 47km"

With only 16 kms to cover, there is plenty of time to enjoy the vistas of the rainforest covered mountains ahead of us and the beautiful Pacific Coastline behind us. The trek route takes us up to an altitude of over 800 metres before we drop back down into a valley to our camp in the community of Naranjillo. Trekking distance: 16km"

      "description": "Although today is challenging, our previous activities have stood us in good stead for our day’s mixture of trekking and biking. The day starts with a crossing of the Naranjillo River and a steep climb out of the valley along a trail through the rainforest. We will be trekking around 13 km in total today. At just over 1300 metres, the forest opens up to our first glimpse of Costa Rica’s abundant coffee industry. From here we continue trekking up and down through coffee plantations for several hours until we get to an altitude of 1950 metres. Here we switch back to biking and enjoy an exhilarating descent and ascents of 13 km on paved roads into the quaint village of Santa Maria where we refortify with some typical Costa Rican fare and rest up in comfortable local cabins. Trekking distance: 13km, Cycling distance: 13km"

      "description": "Today we tackle the hardest, steepest climb of our adventure. The challenge before breakfast is mountain biking a 14 km uphill stretch to the Continental Divide, bringing us to an altitude of 2330 metres - the highest peak of our journey. Following the rule that everything that goes up must come down, the remainder of the day is mountain biking at its best - mostly downhill on dirt roads and single-track trails. We finish the afternoon in the beautiful Orosi Valley where rich pastures and dark green forests of coffee carpet the land and we rest for the night in the town of Orosi after our exhilarating ride. Cycling distance: 46km Cycling Terrain: The first 14 kms are all on paved roads, then a mix of paved roads and rubber roads."

      "description": "We are amidst both cloud and rainforest today but by now we are well into our stride of climbing mountains. After breakfast, we mountain bike along a river to the Tapantí National Wildlife Refuge. This is an area of vast rugged terrain covered with dense primary rainforest. Leaving our bikes, we take to the mountains trekking amongst thousands of trees covered with ferns, bromeliads, mosses and other epiphytes until the small settlement of Taus, where we jump back on the bikes to continue with our last section of cycling on dirt roads to the town of Pejibaye, where local families will welcome us with fresh coffee. The group is then divided into different houses in the village where dinner and a bed are provided for the night and breakfast the following morning. This makes for a great cultural exchange so remember to bring your phrase books! Cycling distance: 10km & 6km. Cycle Terrain: Paved roads and rubber roads. Trekking distance: 12km"

      "description": "After saying goodbye to your new Costa Rican family our day starts with cycling, followed by whitewater rafting. We begin the day’s bike (approx 40kms) towards the whitewater rafting put-in at La Cruz, which is the gateway to the raging Pacuare River. Here we have lunch and embark on a whitewater rafting journey through pristine rainforest. The rapids section of the river is approximately 30 kilometers of Class II-IV rapids. The Pacuare is the most scenic rafting river in Costa Rica and one the world’s classic whitewater experiences. By afternoon we arrive at our comfortable riverside camp, El Nido del Tigre. Nestled between the sounds of the rainforest and the hum of the river we take time to explore this lush environment and look out for wildlife such as Toucans overhead. Spacious tents on fixed platforms board the edge of the river and nestle in the surrounding forest. The camp is fully functional with its own supply of pure spring water, shower and sanitary facilities. The name of the camp, El Nido del Tigre, comes from the giant patches of ginger plants that carpet the main floor of the main area of the camp. When the ginger reaches a certain height it falls over creating flattened areas in the shape of a tiger’s paw - hence its name, which translates to “the nest of the tiger”. From the centre of the nest, trails radiate throughout the forest and along the river. There is an open area for those who like the odd game of ball or Frisbee. If this is too much after a day on the river, seek out one of our quiet reading areas, set yourself down with a refreshing drink and just ‘be’ for a while. Cycling distance: 40km Cycling Terrain: Mostly paved roads but the last 8kms are downhill on rubber roads. Rafting distance: 10km"

Your guides will be with you and so make the most of this free day at the camp by spending it enjoying El Nido del Tigre and the surrounding area. Hiking through the rainforest to a waterfall, floating down a rapid with just a life jacket, or relaxing in a hammock around the camp, are all possible activities. Trekking distance: 12km"

      "description": "Today the Pacuare takes us through virgin rainforest, cascading waterfalls and river carved canyons. We manoeuver through the exhilarating Class III and IV rapids and point out the intricacies of the rainforest at the river’s edge. The Class IV rapids are exciting and separated by calm stretches which enable you to stare at the near vertical green walls towering hundreds of metres above the river, which makes this a magnificent and unique river trip. Along the way we take time out to do some hiking to spectacular waterfalls and have lunch on the shore. Tonight’s camp marks the end of the rapids and the beginning of the banana lined slow moving waters of the Pacuare River. We take-out in the heart of banana plantation country at Finca Pacuarito, where we rest for the night before an early start in the morning. Rafting distance: 17km"

      "description": "THE SWEET TASTE OF SUCCESS...This morning we jump on our bikes for a short ride through banana plantations to the town of Goshen where we begin the final leg of the traverse in kayaks down the Pacuare leaving the rapids behind as the river eases into the Caribbean lowlands where banana plantations gradually swallow the receding rainforest. The river slows to a tranquil pace as we are rafting the last mile of the river, completing the mosaic of the landscapes we have experienced. At the end of the adventure, we reach the mouth of the Pacuare as it meets the Caribbean Sea, celebrating our passage with bubbly in the surf, while enjoying a well-deserved rest. After some time on the beach we are picked up by a motorboat and transferred down the canals to the coastal town of Caño Blanco where we are transferred back to San Jose. Cycling distance: 27km Cycling Terrain: All rubber roads. Kayaking distance: 12km"
