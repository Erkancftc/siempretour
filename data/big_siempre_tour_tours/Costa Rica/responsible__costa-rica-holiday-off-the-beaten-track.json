      "description": "Through the Jungle to Tortuguero: The amazing landscape of Tortuguero is not accessible by road. Instead you’ll find rivers meandering through the pristine rainforest to the famous nesting ground of countless turtles. Fill your senses with the sounds of the rainforest, listen to howler monkeys in the distance, smell the tropical hibiscus or spot tiny red frogs in the grass. At the end of your stay in the rainforest you’ll travel by boat and shuttle bus to La Fortuna."

      "description": "Lava Flows of Arenal Volcano: As you head towards La Fortuna, at the foot of Arenal volcano, you’ll notice the landscape becoming more mountainous and the winding road becoming more pot-holed. The mighty volcano and beautiful countryside is one of the most iconic images of Costa Rica. We’ll arrange for you to stay in a comfortable wooden cabin hotel, just outside the popular tourist town. During your stay, you will take a hike through the lush landscape, with the volcano as a beautiful back-drop before being transferred to the hot springs where you can unwind. Next up a bumpy ride to the Juanilama community, today’s journey will take around 1 hour."

      "description": "At Home with the Tico: Today you will travel to a lesser explored area of Costa Rica – one hour north of La Fortuna and Arenal Volcano. Arriving in a typical Tico village at the Juanilama community, you will be immersed in local culture and tradition, learning all about everyday rural life. The initiative was launched by a group of women to introduce travellers to villages and communities off the usual tourist trail and give the women a sense of independence and entrepreneurial spirit. During your time here you will join one of the women to learn about the produce they grow in this area. She will tell you about the plants and their many uses whilst you collect ingredients for your cooking lesson afterwards at her home. You’ll help whip up a traditional meal, using the local produce before enjoying your last meal in the community. Next, we will organise a private transfer to Boca Tapada. If you’re travelling by hire car you’ll hop in and make your own way there."
