      "title": "Central Valley – Romance on a Plateau",
      "description": "After landing at the Juan Santamaria International Airport, you will be picked up and transferred to the Central Valley. Luxury awaits, and your hotel will be tucked away on a coffee plantation on the hills above Costa Rica. You will experience real privacy here, and you will not see anything artificial in your immediate vicinity. Today will be at your leisure, and you can spend as much time as you please in and around your suite. Self-guided walking trails can lead you through the coffee plantation, where you can find more places of privacy and the peaceful atmosphere of Costa Rica. Costa Rica is known as a destination for adventure, but on your first day, you will also discover that it is a premier choice for a relaxing getaway."

      "title": "Central Valley – Coffee Plantation Tour",
      "description": "Aromas will tantalize you as you set off on a private tour of the coffee plantation. Everything is produced ecologically here, and the plantation was organic since long before organic certifications were created. By wandering among the bushes, you will witness how coffee is grown and harvested. In the harvest season of October to January, you can indulge in bean picking as well. After the plantation, you can get involved in the coffee-making procedure from clearing and drying berries through roasting techniques and how to keep the beans fresh. Part of your tour will be a professional coffee cupping session. You will learn how to discern the quality of beans through their look, smell, and taste."

      "title": "Bajos del Toro – Escaping to Tropical Cloud Forest",
      "description": "Today, you will have a short transfer to Bajos del Toro, so you can relax, especially when fresh coffee is brought to your balcony. Your next lodge will be situated in a forest reserve. Here, creeks flow gently between the trees, and the trickling sound will be omnipresent throughout your stay. Waterfalls hide in the reserve, and you can search for them without a guide by walking down a series of small trails. After checking in, you can try out the spa. There is a yoga deck and a grand bar area, where you can relax with drinks throughout the afternoon. Today will be at your leisure, and there are plenty of romantic activities that you can arrange locally, including horseback riding, river rafting, and a zipline experience through a nearby forest canopy."

      "title": "Bajos del Toro – Spa Indulgence and Cooking Class",
      "description": "This morning, you will have a couple’s rainforest aromatherapy session in the spa. Candles will flicker, and the whispering breeze of forest life will travel through the spa. Your itinerary will be entirely customizable, so you can adjust anything and everything to your moods and desires. You can even choose to move this spa session to another day or at another time. This afternoon, you will be provided with a private, organic cooking class in the hotel’s kitchen. First, you will wander through the gardens, smelling the fresh produce and picking out ingredients from the soil. This is a country of organic cooking, and there is a real nuance to the food, especially when you are guided by expert chefs."

      "title": "Bajos del Toro – Amorous Dinner in the Treetops",
      "description": "Just beyond the reserve, you will find a rural village where traditions have been carefully preserved. Here, women sit on their doorsteps and will smile as you pass, children play along lanes of cobblestone, and locals open their doors, so you can develop a better understanding of their traditions, especially those that are different from the rest of Costa Rica. With a magnifying glass, you can venture on a micro safari to discover all the strange and tiny specimens of the garden. Dona Olga is another local who operates a house with an open door, and she can teach you how to make tortillas. This afternoon, you can choose another activity in the Bajos del Toro area or venture back to your lodge for some more waterfall walks. As dusk appears, you will wander down a hidden path before ascending into the treetops."

      "title": "Arenal – Dreamy Volcano Views and Spa",
      "description": "By continuing your eco-tour through Costa Rica, you will travel into the Arenal region. A majestic volcano will take center stage, and you can often see flumes of steam escaping from its summit. This is one of the country’s most active volcanos, but it is currently safe to explore the slopes. Arenal is also a destination with dozens of activities that you can try, so this afternoon can be tailored to your interests. Your hotel will have a spectacular view of Arenal. The suites are split across two levels, and dreamy views can be expected from your balcony. There is also a spa, and you will be treated to a couple’s treatment upon your arrival."

      "title": "Arenal – Canopy Tour and Forest Charm",
      "description": "Gondolas soar serenely above the forest floor and offer supreme views of both the volcanoes and lakes. After rising to the top of the forest, you will descend by a series of ziplines. In total, you will travel more than 1.7 miles down through the rainforest with each of the eight lines providing a glimpse of forest life and its winged inhabitants. After gliding down, you can continue your exploration by walking across long suspension bridges. Nearly all the rainforest’s organisms live in the canopy, so you will see more in the canopy than on the forest floor. Back at your hotel, you will find privacy, and today’s tour can be as long or as short as you like."

      "title": "Punta Islita – A Beachfront Getaway",
      "description": "Today’s journey will be the longest of your vacation because it will take around four hours to reach Punta Islita on the Pacific Coast. The transfer will be in a private sedan, and there will be sublime views along the way. Your beachfront getaway will be partially hidden by the forest, continuing the theme of privacy and space. You will be staying in one of the villas that will be complete with stunning ocean views that will extend from your private swimming pool. This small resort has all the facilities that you may expect from a premium beachfront property, including a fusion restaurant and an infinity-edge pool that overlooks the sand. From the villa, you can walk barefoot to the beach and a quiet piece of the coast."

      "description": "These two days can provide you with more downtime. Like the rest of the properties on your journey, this hotel holds a four-leaf rating for sustainable tourism, which was awarded by the Costa Rican tourist board. This rating is a key indicator of ecological and sustainable practices, including preserving the natural surroundings and supporting local communities. The hotel also has a spa, and a couple’s spa ritual will be included in your stay. These two days can also be active. You can explore the nearby forest on horseback or take to the canopy once again with a zipline excursion. Small bays dot the coast, and there is some excellent snorkeling that you can enjoy."

      "description": "An airport has just opened in Punta Islita. This is destined to increase tourism, so you will be visiting Punta Islita at the right time before it gets too crowded. Currently, there is only one flight per day, which is a morning departure that will take you back to San Jose. Dayroom hotel use in San Jose can be arranged if there is a long wait for your international flight."
