      "title": "Antigua.",
      "description": "Bienvenidos! Welcome to Guatemala. With crumbling churches, bustling markets and bohemian cafes set against a monumental volcano, Antigua is the perfect place to begin your adventure. Your adventure officially begins with a welcome meeting at 6 pm tonight. If you arrive early, maybe satisfy your cravings and learn the art of old-world chocolate production at the ChocoMuseo or sit by the fountain and people-watch in Central Park. After the meeting, the night is yours – maybe head out with some of your fellow travellers for a tamale (a classic staple of Mesoamerica with dough, meat and sauces steamed and served in a corn husk)."

      "title": "Copan, Honduras.",
      "description": "Rise and shine early this morning to beat the rush-hour traffic around Antigua. Departing at about 7 am, you’ll drive towards Copan. Along the way, watch the passing scenery and learn about local life in Guatemala as you head for the border. Cross into Honduras, arriving in the small town of Copan in the early afternoon. While most people use Copan as a base to explore the nearby ruins, there are plenty of other points of interest, both along the cobblestone streets and set into the lush surroundings. Maybe get started in the Central Plaza and follow your nose to a cafe for the afternoon."

      "title": "Copan, Honduras.",
      "description": "This morning, meet up with a local guide and explore the World Heritage-listed ruins of Copan – the southernmost of the great Maya sites. It's unique because of the numerous elaborate stelae (carved columns) still intact among temples, excavated vaults and walls inscribed with ancient faces. After your exploration, the rest of the afternoon is free to choose your own adventure. Maybe check out some fine feathered friends at the Macaw Mountain Park or visit the Temple of Rosalila. You could also head to the nearby natural hot springs - this optional tour gives you hours of soaking in mud, steaming natural baths and refreshing pools in the lush jungle, with an included dinner."

It’s a long travel day, so make sure you’ve got a good book or your favourite road trip games handy. When you arrive in Suchitoto, you’ll head out on a leader-led orientation walk of the town – widely considered the cultural capital of El Salvador. Admire the elaborate building facades, get your bearings and enjoy the surroundings. Then, get your chef’s hat on with a pupusa-making demonstration. Pupusa (cornmeal flatbreads) is a classic Salvadorian recipe from the Pipil culture and is usually stuffed with some delicious ingredients, like cheese or chicharron (fried pork)."

This small enterprise supports single mothers by providing them with an income for their children’s education, food and independence. Watch the demonstration, then get hands-on and try it for yourself. The rest of the day is free in Suchitoto. The town overlooks the Embalse Cerron Grande – also known as Lago Suchitlan, this freshwater lake is a haven for migrating birds, particularly falcons and hawks. Maybe grab a historically-minded group for a guided walk through Cinquera Forest, where guerrilla fighters used the forest as cover during the Civil War."

The owner is aiming to bridge the gap and inspire other business owners to employ local people living with disabilities. After, the rest of the day is yours. Maybe hit the Convento y Museo San Francisco and view the collection of indigenous stone statues. Hundreds of evergreen islets dot the waters of vast Lake Nicaragua and you can spend a few hours exploring them by boat or hire a kayak and find your own way around, waving at the fisherman who live in wooden huts along the way. Just remember not to swim, as freshwater sharks live in the water!"

      "title": "Monteverde.",
      "description": "Today is another early start as you get ready for a full day of travel. Journey to Monteverde, where you can begin exploring this afternoon on an orientation walk with your leader. Monteverde was founded as an agricultural community in 1951 by a group of North American Quakers. These environmentally aware settlers also established a small wildlife sanctuary, which has since grown into the internationally renowned Monteverde Cloud Forest Biological Preserve. Cloud forests are like rainforests, but instead, draw their water from a semi-permanent cloud covering the region. This is truly a nature lover's paradise! More than 2000 plant species, 320 bird species and 100 mammal species call Monteverde home."

The cafe started with eight women in 1982 and has grown in number over the years, enabling many women without any formal education to generate income for their households without having to leave home, meaning they can continue caring for their children. In store, there are a variety of handmade products – be sure to check them out! The rest of your day is free to explore Monteverde at your own pace. Maybe zoom through the treetops on a ziplining adventure, or for a more relaxed experience, discover Costa Rica's agricultural heritage on a coffee and chocolate tour. Tonight, you’ll have the option to end your day with a night walk through the cloud forest to spot nocturnal creatures in their natural habitat."

      "title": "La Fortuna.",
      "description": "Why not start your free day today with a smoothie and plan how you want to explore? Maybe take a guided nature hike through the forest surrounding Arenal Volcano, keeping an eye out for rare plants and animals, or see the forest from a series of hanging bridges that offer a great vantage point for spotting wildlife like sloths and rainbow-coloured birds. The volcano’s inner workings also mean that the area is home to several thermal hot springs – an ideal way to relax in the middle of nature. Or maybe check out the 70 m tall La Fortuna waterfall set in the middle of the rainforest and hit the lake on a stand-up paddleboard. A boat safari in Cano Negro Wildlife Refuge offers the opportunity to see lizards, crocodiles and tropical birds in their natural habitat, so if you’re craving more wildlife, this option is perfect!"
