Of course, you can come to Costa Rica to chill out, but this suggested 15 day itinerary emphasises the active and adventurous fun to be had in this dynamic little country, from canopy walkways and treetop zip lines, to rafting on the Balsa River *, hiking, horse riding and surfing. <br/><br/>Costa Rica is more than just an adventure playground, though. It has unique wildlife, dramatic scenery, towering volcanoes and excellent beaches on both its Pacific and Atlantic coasts.<br/><br/>This activity and nature holiday can be completely tailor made to suit your interests and preferences. Choose the standard of accommodation you prefer, from mid to top range, or opt for a mixture. You can decide how you travel once here, too, choosing between self driving, private transfers and shared buses. And you can, of course, select the exact mix of activities and excursions that appeals to you – the itinerary below is just a suggested starting point from which to build your holiday.<br/><br/>Costa Rica’s short dry season lasts from December to April, and this is also peak season. May to November is the ‘green season’ which typically features short bursts of rain in the afternoons clearing in time for spectacular sunsets and warm, sunny mornings. Many visitors to Costa Rica prefer this time of year, as prices can be reduced, the scenery is refreshed and it’s less busy. There are other benefits, too, including seeing turtles laying eggs on some beaches. We wouldn’t recommend travel to Costa Rica in September and October, as this is when the rains are heaviest.<br/><br/>*Children must be 10 years or older to join in with the rafting detailed in the itinerary below. <br/>",

    "generalInfo": "If you’ve always wanted to visit Central America, but you weren’t sure where to start, why not see it all? This carefully designed itinerary gives you five out of the seven Central America countries in 16 days. <br/><br/>Your adventure starts in Costa Rica, before crossing into Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, and finishing up in Guatemala.<br/><br/>You’ll spend the most time in Guatemala and Nicaragua, but still have a few days in Costa Rica. El Salvador, rarely visited, gets a look in – you’ll spend most of your time here around tranquil Lake Suchitoto and the colonial town on its shore. Honduras is worth a short stop, too, for its Mayan ruins. Copan is considered one of the most spectacular achievements of the Maya people. It’s a UNESCO heritage site but doesn’t get the same volume of visitors as other Mayan ruins.<br/><br/>Prepare to cover big distances and stick to the schedule – this is a fast-paced trip, travelling by bus and boat. The longest drive is into El Salvador from Nicaragua – which takes a day, but which is broken up with sightseeing. <br/><br/>When it comes to cities, you’ll be visiting San Jose, Costa Rica’s colourful capital, and colonial gems like Granada in Nicaragua. In Antigua de Guatemala enjoy all the delights of the city, from its colourful handicrafts to its great food. <br/><br/>Volcanoes add to Central America’s lively nature. There’s Masaya Volcano National Park where you can stare into the crater of Masaya and see lava bubbling. Spend time on the shore of Lake Atitlan in Guatemala, surrounded by volcanoes. <br/><br/>With one of two oceans never far away, you can’t come to this part of the world and not have a bit of beach time. On the Nicaragua coast, San Juan del Sur adds a welcome bit of downtime in a whirlwind tour.<br/><br/>With this trip truly racking up the distances, you’ll probably want to save Panama and Belize for another time – after all, this part of the world is magnetic, and you’ll need an excuse to come back. <br/>",

Set in a beautiful valley between the volcanoes of Agua, Fuego and Acatenango, its cobbled streets and pastel-coloured buildings make it one of the most charming and picturesque cities in Central America. Despite the damage caused by a series of earthquakes and floods over the centuries, Antigua's colonial heritage has seen it designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Due to the number of evening flights into the international airport, our tour leader plans to do the welcome meeting on the morning of day two and will leave a message in our hotel reception with details on timings and everything else that you'll need for the day. There are no activities planned today, so you're free to arrive in Antigua at any time. If you'd like an airport transfer today, you'll need to arrive into La Aurora International Airport (GUA). The drive between the airport and our hotel can take between 90 minutes and four hours depending on the traffic and the time of day. If your flight arrives earlier in the day, we recommend a stroll around the compact centre of town, famed for its well-preserved Spanish Mudejar-influenced architecture."

The best way to experience the market is to throw yourself into the melee and haggle with the traders or escape to the beautifully colourful cemetery, located just a short walk away. Following our visit, we'll travel to Lake Atitlan. An ancient volcanic caldera, Lake Atitlan is considered one of the most spectacular lakes in the Americas and is the deepest in Central America.

They still wear traditional dress, with women in particular sporting colourful blouses featuring embroidered geometric and bird designs. This is a lively village, bustling with both visitors and locals going about their business. Our second stop is San Juan La Laguna, a community famous for its indigenous traditions, particularly the population of descendants of the Tz'utujil Maya, who maintain their customs, language, and traditional clothing. The town stands out for its peaceful atmosphere and colourful streets, where small workshops showcase local crafts, especially textiles, paintings, and handmade products. It's also known for its vibrant art and culture scene, with murals adorning various parts of the town, depicting scenes of daily life and traditions of the region.

Please note, crossing borders can be a slow process, so ensure you have a book and snacks with you to keep you going. When we arrive into Copan where a local guide will escort us around the spectacular ruins - one of the richest archaeological sites to be uncovered in Central America and now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Anyone familiar with Catherwood's incredible drawings (which first appeared in John Stephens' 1841 narrative - 'Incidents of Travel in Central America and Yucatan'), will recognise scenes and objects from this marvellous site. Stephens actually bought the entire site from a local farmer for just $50. The Great Plaza is one of the most amazing achievements of the Classic Maya period and contains the greatest collection of Maya sculpture anywhere in Meso-America. Next door is the Acropolis - a group of massive pyramidal structures where royal power was once concentrated. Ascending one structure is the famous Hieroglyphic Stairway. Composed of some 2500 individual glyphs, its sides flanked by serpentine birds and snakes, this is the New World's longest inscribed Pre-Colombian text. Copan has been the subject of exploration and investigation since the 1830s. Remarkable finds continue to be unearthed by archaeologists, making it the most thoroughly researched and understood of all Maya sites."

At the heart of the city is the Basilica of Esquipulas, famous for housing one of the most venerated images in Central America: the Black Christ of Esquipulas, a figure of the crucified Christ with a serene expression that attracts thousands of believers every year, especially during the Fiesta de Cristo Negro, celebrated every January 15. We then continue to the border with El Salvador and on to Suchitoto. Nestled between the mountains and Suchitlan Lake, this charming colonial town, with its cobblestone streets and pretty houses, is a little slice of El Salvador at its timeless best.

This small village of Cinquera emerged from the brutality of the civil war, which raged throughout the 1980s, and has established a grassroots tourism project that serves as a living museum of the wartime era, with the ex-guerrillas and their families acting as guides. The community's aim is not only to educate people about this important part of El Salvador's history, but also to protect the forest from illegal logging - the trees are a haven for birdlife, and there are numerous swimming holes and waterfalls hidden within. We take a 3-kilometre/1.9-mile hike through part of the reserve and spend some time with a former guerrilla fighter learning about his experiences.

If the weather's choppy, expect some sea spray- so a poncho or rain jacket might be a good idea. The crossing should take around two to three hours. Our destination is the port town of Potosi. From Potosi, its a 2.5 hour drive to Leon.

    "generalInfo": "This budget Central America tour takes you to some of the best places in the region, whilst keeping costs down. Travelling by private minibus in a group of no more than 16 explorers, you get all the camaraderie of a road trip, without getting bogged down in the planning. <br/><br/>Starting in the city of Antigua in Guatemala, and ending in San Jose, capital of Costa Rica, this tour takes you through Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua, too: that’s five countries over 17 exciting days. There are some long drives – the longest is 14 hours from El Salvador to Granada, Nicaragua – but the trip has been carefully designed so there are plenty of rest days too. <br/><br/>You’re not just on the road: you get multiple nights in some of the most enticing destinations, and free days to explore independently, or with new friends if you want. This mix of social and solo time is great and flexible. You can choose to relax at a beach resort in El Cuco, El Salvador – or go kayaking instead. In Monteverde, Costa Rica, go mountain biking, or for a hike in the cloud forest. <br/><br/>This trip is popular for a reason – it’s a great way to see a great deal of Central America, and a great deal of fun, too. <br/>",

The volcano’s inner workings also mean that the area is home to several thermal hot springs – an ideal way to relax in the middle of nature. Or maybe check out the 70 m tall La Fortuna waterfall set in the middle of the rainforest and hit the lake on a stand-up paddleboard. A boat safari in Cano Negro Wildlife Refuge offers the opportunity to see lizards, crocodiles and tropical birds in their natural habitat, so if you’re craving more wildlife, this option is perfect!"

Bursting with Mayan heritage and natural beauties, from the Caribbean to the Pacific coast, volcanoes to cloud forest, cayes to caves, Central America is just made for a long adventure of this nature. On this trip we travel through Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica. <br/><br/>Our adventure begins on Mexico’s stunning Yucatan Peninsula, where we mix beach life with ancient Mayan ruins. The former at Playa del Carmen and the latter at nearby Tulum, which is also the first Mayan archaeological site on our trip. Beach life continues in beautiful Belize, where the cayes and coves are very much part of Belizean life. We also head inland in Belize to experience other aspects of its luscious landscapes and fascinating mix of Mestizos, Maya and Garifuna cultures, at San Ignacio. <br/><br/>Guatemala is next on our list, a land full of stunning Mayan relics and dramatic volcanic peaks. We dedicate eight days of this holiday to Guatemala, with every day offering something very different. Such as Tikal National Park, with the ancient Mayan city at its heart, the contemporary Mayan culture in Chichicastenango , the beautiful Lake Atitlan and the wonderful capital of Antigua. <br/><br/>Moving further south, we spend five days in Honduras, which is one of the largest countries in Central America, and where tourism infrastructure is a bit thinner on the ground. What isn’t lacking is ancient Mayan culture, at Copan, beautiful beaches and dramatic volcanic terrain. <br/><br/>After a quick sojourn in San Salvador, mixing coast at El Cuco with culture at Suchitoto,  Nicaragua is next, where we spend nine days exploring this unique country and possibly one of Central America’s most underrated. It is also Central America’s largest country, and we follow its Pacific coast visiting the historic cities of Granada and Leon, as well as the vast Lake Nicaragua, home to Ometepe Island. Here you can hike to the top of a volcano or go hiking in the jungle. It’s a whole other world on Ometepe. <br/><br/>The finale of this Central American is no other than Costa Rica, where both wildlife watching and adventure opportunities are second to none. Hike through Arenal Volcano National Park or up into the Monteverde cloud forest, and spend a couple of days in the vibrant capital of San Jose. <br/><br/>",

This region of western Honduras is a remote province of velvety green hills and rushing rivers, dotted with whitewashed colonial villages where the horse is still the main form of transport. Its genial atmosphere comes in part from its relative prosperity gained through trade in coffee and tobacco, and through the tourism generated by the Mayan ruins. Spend the night at Copán Ruinas, an attractive, cobbled village close to the site. There is time for a short hill walk, a visit to some nearby hot springs, but the main attractions, of course, are the archaeological site and the superb new museum, both of which you visit the following day. Copán is unique, not so much for its impressive temples, but for the exquisite stelae and their artwork: huge, intricately carved statues depict the complicated history of the area and its great rulers. One of the highlights is the imperious hieroglyphic stairway; each of its 63 steps is sculpted with hundreds of different glyphs that describe important events in Copán’s rise to prominence among the elite city states of the Mayan world. Copán flourished between 250 and 900 AD, at which point its prosperity mysteriously declined. Within about 100 years, this once-sophisticated city had been reclaimed by the jungle, only to be discovered by the Spanish conquistadors in the late 16th century, and subsequently excavated 300 years later."

Guatemala is unique in Central America; a mysterious, timeless country in which half of the population is Mayan. Many, especially women in the highlands, still dress in their traditional hand-woven clothing, similar to that which was worn over a thousand years ago. Antigua is a colonial city of cobbled streets, overhanging tiled roofs and a beautiful, leafy central plaza. There is an abundance of huge, ruined churches, convents and monasteries, testament to a time when Antigua was the country’s capital and its main religious centre. It seems that every doorway opens onto a leafy tiled courtyard that you’ll discover on your guided tour. A dramatic backdrop of smouldering volcanoes reminds you how the city was destroyed by an eruption in 1773. Antigua is a welcoming place to relax and unwind, do some shopping and enjoy some excellent food, or just to wander around the ruined convents and enjoy the flowers in their beautifully tended gardens."

        "description": ": Our trip starts today in Panama City, Panama's eclectic capital with its curious mixture of old colonial Spanish architecture and modern American city buildings. Built on the back of the trade and plunder from the Spanish colonies in South America, Panama City was a key trade route as gold and silver were transported by mule through the rainforest of the Darien region, up to the Caribbean. Due to the number of evening flights into Panama City, our tour leader plans to do the welcome meeting on the morning of day two and will leave a message in our hotel reception with details on timings and everything else that you'll need for the day. There are no activities planned today, so you're free to arrive in Panama City at any time. If you'd like an airport transfer today, you'll need to arrive into Tocumen International Airport (PTY), approximately a 45-minute drive away from our hotel."

        "description": ": This morning, we'll visit the Miraflores Locks to see the famous Panama Canal and appreciate the scale of this engineering miracle. Running 50 miles, the canal was carved out of the rainforest and through hillsides, lakes were dammed and locks built. After a serious French attempt costing more than 20,000 lives, the US successfully completed this remarkable endeavour after ten years of toil in 1914. This afternoon has been left free for you to indulge in a little exploring of your own. 'Casco Viejo', full of Spanish plazas and colonial buildings, is a total contrast to the giant skyscrapers of the modern town and a great place to absorb the ambience of the city."

The volcanic soil makes this a productive region, abundant in coffee and banana plantations, sugarcane crops and livestock. Heading for the provincial capital of David, we'll transfer into the cool fertile highlands to the town of Boquete. Located amidst a spectacular natural setting Boquete is a perfect base for walking into the surrounding hills, relaxing, or bird watching."

We'll cross the border at Guabito, into the Caribbean lowlands of Limon Province. It's worth noting that border crossings can take some time so we recommend bringing a book and snacks. Puerto Viejo lies at the confluence of the Puerto Viejo and the Sarapiqui rivers, an area of tropical rainforest that was once an important hub on the Caribbean trade routes. The area lies in the shadow of the Central Cordillera Mountains, sandwiched between the Braulio Carrillo N.P. to the west and the Tortuguero N.P. and Barra del Colorado National Refuge to the east."

This area has been at the forefront of conservation for several years and La Selva Biological Station on the outskirts of town has done a great deal to involve the local community directly in the research and conservation of the area. You may like to take a walk along one of the many trails, or perhaps take a boat ride along the river, to see for yourself some of the beautiful forest that covers this fertile region. In the afternoon, we'll drive on, skirting the great central volcanic massif, past fertile farmlands, rich with a diversity of tropical crops, bringing us within sight of Arenal, Costa Rica's most active volcanic cone. This classic cone, which rises to 1,633 metres, is covered by a tangled mass of vegetation on one side whilst the other is starkly barren and scarred by lava flows. We recommend an evening bath in the nearby thermal baths this evening (optional)."

After our visit, we'll continue to the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve, one of the last remaining habitats in Central America of the famous Resplendent Quetzal, only occasionally sighted by eager travellers. The reserve covers an area of 10,522 hectares and contains a staggering diversity of flora and fauna; 2,000 species of plant, 400 species of birds and 100 different species of mammals."

The National Park has room for two volcanoes, of which one is still active, surrounded by a lush area of lagoons and craters, punctuated with steaming vents and pools of boiling mud. The changing elevation ranges of the park have resulted in an area of diverse habitats that house a variety of vegetation and wildlife. On arrival we'll have the option to relax at our eco-lodge, or alternatively, we can choose to do some nature walks in the National Park, take a horse ride to the Oropendola Waterfall, or walk to the park's mud and hot springs."

This approximately three-kilometre hike is moderately difficult due to the uneven ground and the many large roots and rocks to tackle, but we'll take a leisurely pace and enjoy the diverse scenery of the trail. We'll be crossing bridges, walking through the forest and across fields, all the while discovering the most impressive features of the park: the steam vents, or fumaroles. These incredible volcanic features pop out of the woods and forests as if from nowhere, along with bubbling ponds and mud pools from the underground volcanic heat and gases. During the first section of the trail, we'll have the opportunity to spot wildlife in the forest, from a variety of bird species (toucans, blue-crowned motmots and flycatchers among many others), as well as spider monkeys, coatis or sloths if we're lucky. This afternoon, we have free time to enjoy some of the many optional activities on offer. There is plenty of hiking to be had nearby, as well as horse riding or a walk to mud and hot springs."

We cross into Nicaragua at the land border crossing called 'Frontera Penas Blancas' - this information will be needed when applying for your Honduras visa for your point of entry into the CA-4 countries. Border crossings can take some time so please be patient. Once in Nicaragua, a short drive brings us to San Jorge, the departure point for ferries to Ometepe Island. Ometepe is made up of two volcanoes connected by an isthmus; indeed its name comes from the Nahuatl language and means 'two hills'. The perfect cone of Concepción volcano soars from the depths of Lake Nicaragua to 1610m, only just dwarfing the neighbouring Maderas volcano at 1,394 metres. Our time here is free for you to explore at your own pace and there are many things to do during our time here. You can explore by local bus or truck, perhaps searching out pre-Colombian petroglyphs carved by the indigenous people, or taking in some of the highlights of the island and some short walks on the volcanic slopes (all optional). The forests echo with the sounds of howler monkeys and parrots and the canopy hides sloths and hawks amongst its lush foliage. Alternatively, you could visit the San Ramon Falls. For the less energetic, some of the black sand beaches are the perfect spot to drink in the stunning views across the lake."

Atmospheric Granada is a colonial gem, situated at the foot of Mombacho volcano on the northwest shore of Lake Nicaragua. It was the first colonial city in Nicaragua, founded in 1524 by the conquistador Hernandez de Cordoba and is set off by baroque and renaissance buildings which is a pure visual delight. We'll have a city tour this afternoon, which will include visits to the Parque Central, the Monument to the War of Independence, the plaza and the convent of San Fransisco, which holds the largest collection of stone sculptures from the early Americans who lived in Granada before the Spaniards."

This is a short but demanding hike, covering 1.5 to 2 km in total and taking around 2.5 to 3 hours due to the terrain. The trail starts at 1,025 metres and descends to 900 metres, meaning there's an elevation loss of 125 metres on the way down and a matching elevation gain of 125 metres on the way back up. While the ascent and descent are gradual rather than steep, the nature of the trail requires a steady pace. This afternoon has been left free for you to continue exploring Granada at your own pace."

        "description": ": We'll drive to the old colonial capital of Leon today, lying in the shadow of the Cordillera de los Maribios Mountains. Defined by its graceful Spanish colonial architecture and fascinating political history, we will soon discover why Leon is considered to be Nicaragua's historical, cultural, educational and religious capital. The best way to explore this captivating city is by foot, as much of its charm lies in the narrow colonial streets and architecture, art galleries, museums and cafes. Leon's history is fascinating, like no other town in Central America. The town was dismantled, moved, and rebuilt due to volcanic activities, ransacked (and reconstructed!) by pirates, it won and lost its struggle as the most important city in Nicaragua against Managua, and several presidents were assassinated here. It's the place where famous poets are buried, where the largest cathedral in Central America stands, and is a hotbed for revolutionaries due to the big university located in Leon. On arrival, we'll embark on an orientation walk of the city. The afternoon is left free for optional activities. You may opt for a hike on the nearby Cerro Negro Volcano - one of the most active volcanoes in Nicaragua. The hike takes approximately 90 minutes at a moderate pace, and there are stunning views across the Pacific Ocean as well as the surrounding countryside. The fun is in bouncing down the volcano, as we run/jump/walk down through the scree."

        "description": ": This morning, we wave goodbye to Nicaragua and head to the smallest country in Central America- El Salvador. Don't let its size fool you; the country is teeming with towering volcanoes, a spectacular coastline, and beautiful colonial towns and villages. We start our day by driving to the coastal town of Potosí, before hopping on the water taxi across the Gulf of Fonseca. On the journey, you can see the islands of three countries: El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua. Be prepared for a wet boarding or landing- you may need to wade into waist-deep water to get on or off the boat. It is worth bringing aqua shoes or flip flops for this day. A dry bag would be desirable. Once on board, the crossing can be bumpy- adding to the sense of adventure! If the weather's choppy, expect some sea spray- so a poncho or rain jacket might be a good idea. The crossing should take around two hours, plus some time to enjoy the beach. Our destination is the port town of La Unión. On arrival, we will head out to Conchagua town for a walk and an optional group dinner. The country's national dish is pupusas-these delicious circles of corn dough are stuffed with a mixture of black beans, vegetables, cheese, and meats. We estimate our journey time door to door today will be around 7 hours. Please be patient; crossing borders can be quite a slow process, so ensure you have a book and snacks with you to keep you going."

Founded in 1525 by the Spanish conquistador Pedro de Alvarado, it was declared a city in 1546. Upon arrival your tour leader will provide you with a panoramic city tour of all the capital's main sights. After free time for lunch, we will head to the Joya de Cerén Archaeological Site, around 1 hour drive from San Salvador. This pre-Hispanic farming village, much like Pompeii and Herculaneum in Italy, was buried by the eruption of the Laguna Caldera volcano around AD 600. The remarkably well-preserved remains offer a unique glimpse into the daily life of Central American communities who farmed the land during that period. In the afternoon, we'll have a 90-minute drive to the peaceful lakeside town of Suchitoto, where we will spend the next two nights."

It will take around six hours including a lunch stop and customs formalities, before we arrive at this small, relaxed town just the other side of the Guatemala-Honduras border. With a small plaza principal, and some cafes and restaurants to enjoy, the town of Copan is so unassuming that it's hard to believe that it's home to one of the jewels of the ancient Mayan world. We may not have a lot of time here when we arrive, but we'll take a stroll around the charming town centre this evening before dinner.

Everyone familiar with Catherwood's incredible drawings (which first appeared in John Stephens' 1841 narrative - 'Incidents of Travel in Central America and Yucatan') will recognise scenes and objects from this marvellous site. Stephens actually bought the entire site for US$ 50 from a local farmer! The Great Plaza is one of the most amazing achievements of the Classic Maya period (AD 750) and contains the greatest collection of Maya sculptures anywhere in Meso-America. The famous Hieroglyphic Stairway is composed of 2500 individual glyphs; its sides are flanked by serpentine birds and snakes. We have the whole day to enjoy this special place, leaving you plenty of time to explore on your own.

Alternatively, you might like to visit the close by Mayan site; Iximche, once the capital of the Cakchiquel Maya, founded in the 15th century. Set within pine forests the ruined city was once believed to be home to some 10,000 people at its height, until the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors resulted in its eventual destruction in 1526. There is also the option, on one of your two days in Antigua, to visit the Maya site of Tikal.

This is an ideal place to shop for those last-minute presents, or just enjoy the ambience of its lakeside setting. Alternatively, you could visit Guatemala City, the bustling country capital, which is situated on a high plateau (1,495 metres) and possesses all the usual contradictions found in large Latin American cities: elegant tree-lined boulevards and high-rise architecture alongside crowded shanties.

La Fortuna is home to the famous Arenal Volcano, a lush destination full of nature and adventure – something for all the family. Despite La Fortuna becoming more and more popular, it still maintains that ‘small-town’ feeling and is the perfect place to explore the greenery of Costa Rica. Take a wander around the national park, over the volcanoes or head into the waterfalls for a slightly cold but refreshing dip before visiting the stunning hot springs for some relaxation. Whilst here you’ll also take a night tour with a local guide to find all the different frogs living in the forest."

Over the next few days, you and your family will explore the cloud forests of Monteverde, a hilltop town with a laid back feel and plenty of family-friendly activities. You’ll stay in a lodge on the outskirts of town, perfect for getting back to nature. You’ll explore the tree-tops on a guided walk through the cloud forest as you cross hanging bridges high above the forest floor, learning about the biodiversity of the plants here and keeping your eyes peeled for sleeping sloths high up in the trees. If your kids are adrenaline-junkies then we can also add on a gondola ride and zip lining, just ask your travel specialist."

We begin the day’s bike (approx 40kms) towards the whitewater rafting put-in at La Cruz, which is the gateway to the raging Pacuare River. Here we have lunch and embark on a whitewater rafting journey through pristine rainforest. The rapids section of the river is approximately 30 kilometers of Class II-IV rapids. The Pacuare is the most scenic rafting river in Costa Rica and one the world’s classic whitewater experiences. By afternoon we arrive at our comfortable riverside camp, El Nido del Tigre. Nestled between the sounds of the rainforest and the hum of the river we take time to explore this lush environment and look out for wildlife such as Toucans overhead. Spacious tents on fixed platforms board the edge of the river and nestle in the surrounding forest. The camp is fully functional with its own supply of pure spring water, shower and sanitary facilities. The name of the camp, El Nido del Tigre, comes from the giant patches of ginger plants that carpet the main floor of the main area of the camp. When the ginger reaches a certain height it falls over creating flattened areas in the shape of a tiger’s paw - hence its name, which translates to “the nest of the tiger”. From the centre of the nest, trails radiate throughout the forest and along the river. There is an open area for those who like the odd game of ball or Frisbee. If this is too much after a day on the river, seek out one of our quiet reading areas, set yourself down with a refreshing drink and just ‘be’ for a while.

The thick layer of clouds makes it more difficult for the sun to break through, providing a slower rate of evaporation, which gives the plants plenty of life-giving moisture, which in turn promotes a huge biodiversity. Monteverde cloud forests is host to 100 species of mammals, 400 species of birds, and 1,200 species of amphibians and reptiles.

Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries Isla del Caño was used as a refuge for pirates along the Pacific coast, while today, it is best known for its spectacular offshore diving and unique historical past. Turquoise water rings Isla Del Caño, as do a great number of coral reefs. In fact, the waters that surrounded the island contain the largest amount of coral-building organisms along the Pacific side of Costa Rica—there is brain coral, head coral and sea fans, to name just a few. Add to this excellent visibility and an enormous amount of marine species, and you’ve got the makings for magnificent snorkelling and scuba diving. Beneath the water you may be able to spot manta rays, tuna, needlefish, barracuda, snapper, white-tipped reef sharks, olive ridley sea turtles, moray eels, dolphins, and both humpback and pilot whales. Considering all of this, it’s not surprising that many people regard Isla Del Caño as the best scuba diving spot in the entire country. However, because it is a biological reserve, diving numbers are strictly regulated – there are 5 dive sites and only 10 divers are allowed to be in the water at one time. The island itself doesn’t harbour as much biodiversity as does the ocean. There is an intact evergreen forest, as well as a sampling of rubber and cocoa trees. Boa constrictors, pacas, bats, tree frogs and a variety of insects can be spotted, in addition to several species of birds that use the island as a stopping point during their migration south. A number of white-sand beaches dot the island, and hiking trails extend across much of the terrain. Hotel Casa Drake"

    "generalInfo": "This journey from the Pacific to the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica takes you to some of Central America’s best wildlife and marine life viewing opportunities. It also provides an intense experience of rainforest, cloud forest, marine turtle and primate research and conservation.<br/><br/>Corcovado National Park<br/>For wildlife and marine life, the Corcovado National Park in the Osa Peninsula is a must for any visit to Costa Rica. The area has been described by National Geographic magazine as '..the most wildlife intense place on earth', both because of its primaeval forest and abundant offshore life. The western side of the Corcovado provides more than 30 miles of beach where the rainforest meets the Pacific Ocean. Populations of howler, capuchin, spider and squirrel monkeys are so healthy along the coast that they live in closer proximity than you are ever likely to find elsewhere.<br/><br/>Offshore, humpback whales from both the northern and southern hemispheres migrate. 17 kilometres from the coast of the northern Corcovado is the Caño Island Biological Reserve. Aside from Cocos Island way out in the Pacific, this is where you will find the country’s best marine life, both on the surface and beneath it. Dolphins are a feature of most visits to the island. Olive Ridley turtles and manta rays are also often seen at the surface and below. The coral reefs and steep drop-offs provide excellent snorkeling if you wish, with some huge shoals of fish and pelagic visitors such as sharks and barracudas. We can pre-arrange diving for certified divers.<br/><br/>Whilst you will experience the Corcovado based from a premium ecolodge, we begin your visit to the Caribbean coast ‘on location’ at one of Costa Rica’s most important leatherback turtle reserves. It was initially established to protect one of Central America’s most important nesting grounds for the giant Leatherback Turtles. It also protects a growing area of rainforest, the future protection of which your visit with us helps to protect.<br/><br/>Leatherback Turtle Conservation<br/>Giant Leatherbacks are the largest of the marine turtles, with the biggest measured specimen some 2.4 metres in length. Between mid March and early June, hundreds of leatherbacks come to our reserve to lay their eggs. Whilst they can move around freely in water, their quest to lay eggs is a monumental struggle. A pregnant female must first locate a beach and then drag her huge body five or more metres out of the sea using fins designed for water. These same fins then need to dig a metre deep hole in which she lays her eggs before covering them back over with sand. You can’t help but feel the strain of her quest and gain a sense of her vulnerability out of the water.<br/><br/>Fortunately, nesting leatherbacks are protected by law in Costa Rica and projects like those you will visit on this extension help to protect leatherback eggs from poachers and dogs. You will be asked to take great care in watching this process. Once a female has begun this process it is unlikely she will stop, but it is important to avoid upsetting her with torches or camera flashes.<br/><br/>The Leatherback Turtle Reserve was established to protect 6 kilometres of some of the most important leatherback nesting sites in Central America. Green turtles also arrive in large numbers here, but the Tortuguero National Park is best known for green turtles. Tortuguero literally means ‘place of turtles’ and it is the green turtles largest nesting site in the Western Hemisphere in fact. They start to arrive in July, which is about halfway into the period when leatherback hatchlings climb their way up through the sand and run the gauntlet of predators into the sea. Green turtle egg laying usually runs until October and hatchlings can be seen taking to the sea as late as November.<br/><br/>Both the reserve and the Tortuguero National Park are fantastic locations for spotting lowland rainforest wildlife and birdlife. Jaguars sometimes appear on the beaches in Tortuguero and puma tracks are often found at the reserve, as well as peccary and more than 265 species of bird. Howler monkeys and white fronted capuchins can be seen everyday, and for part of the year you will be able to follow and assist a primate researcher in her twice daily studies in the behaviour of this, the New World’s most intelligent primate.<br/><br/>In travelling between the Pacifc and Caribbean you will experience the stunning cloud forest scenery of the Braulio Carillo National Park and the La Selva Research Station. Here you will be able to learn about one of the longest established research projects in Costa Rica and observe some of the incredible 448 species of birds found here.",

Accessible only by boat or light aircraft, this vast network of waterways, canals and swamps is remarkably tranquil and devoid of noise pollution. On reaching the pier, we board a small motorboat for the journey to our lodge (up to 1hr 30min) which is on a small strip of land between the Caribbean Sea and the main lagoon. Please note the transfer from San José to Tortuguero is not private for Exodus clients. Our afternoon is spent in Tortuguero village, where it’s possible to visit the Sea Turtle Museum (a donation will be requested at the entrance). Tortuguero is probably most famous as a nesting site for the endangered green turtle, which can be seen coming ashore to lay eggs from late July to October (as part of an optional excursion). Hawksbill, loggerhead, and giant leatherback turtles also nest in this region, and from late August through to November, baby turtles hatch and make their way to the ocean.

If you miss the welcome meeting, your tour leader will inform you of any essential information as soon as you catch up. If your flight arrives earlier in the day, you might like to head out and explore the city - the barrios are easy to navigate, laid out in a grid pattern of avenues and streets.

The walk from the Irazu Volcano carpark to the crater viewpoint is a gentle incline of under 10 meters. However, the high altitude may cause some shortness of breath. If you have any concerns, please speak with your tour leader. There are two crater viewpoints at Irazu and we'll aim to visit both of them. We'll have time to explore before continuing for one hour to Turrialba. The fertile land around Turrialba makes it an important agricultural region for coffee, sugar, and Macadamia nuts, as well as dairy production, with its cheese being popular throughout the country.

This afternoon, we'll head out on a jungle trek to understand more about the area's unique ecosystem. It's amazing to think that 33% of the jungle's total biomass is made up of ants and termites. For bird lovers, the country's different species outnumber those found in the whole of Europe with storks, parrots, and hummingbirds among the many birds to be spotted. Throughout the year, you might be lucky enough to see different species of turtle nesting close to our lodge. The best time to spot them is between June and September when over 5,000 green and leatherback turtles come ashore to nest on Tortuguero's beaches. At this time of year, there's the option of an evening turtle walk to take in the spectacle.

The two-and-a-half-hour tour exposes the secrets and wonders of one of mankind's favourite foods - chocolate. Originally from Central America, the cacao plant has an extraordinary history; it was one of the most important products for the Mayan and Aztec cultures. The discovery of America led to the introduction of chocolate in Europe, transforming it into the product we know and love today. We'll start by taking a short hike through a forest to a former cacao-growing plot, learning about the cacao tree along the way. Upon arrival at the plot, we'll be treated to a demonstration of the artisanal process by which cacao fruit is transformed into chocolate.

Soon we'll catch sight of the famous Arenal Volcano. Rising to 1,670 metres, the volcano is covered by a tangled mass of vegetation on one side, while the other is starkly barren. Having remained dormant for hundreds of years, it erupted unexpectedly in 1968 destroying the small town of Tabacon on its west side. After this, it was known for its regular explosions which became a huge spectacle, until 2010 when it went quiet once again. This afternoon, we'll drive to the Mirador del Silencio Reserve, where we'll have a short nature trail walk to observe endemic flora and fauna at the foot of the volcano. Brimming with giant trees, weird and wonderful plant species and a spectacular view of Arenal, it's no wonder that the reserve has been featured in several films. Many species of fauna can also be seen here, including different types of snakes, howler monkeys and many species of birdlife.

The last leg of our journey takes us along bumpy roads, but our lush destination more than makes up for it. Perched on the Continental Divide between the Pacific and the Caribbean, it's thought that there has been indigenous habitation in Monteverde since 3000 BC. However, the turning point in its recent history came in 1950, when a group of pacifist Quakers from Alabama moved here to avoid subscription in the Korean War. They sought a lifestyle in a country in which they could embrace their peaceful beliefs and continue to cultivate their dairy farms. These families went on to establish the community of Monteverde and some of its famed cloud forest reserves. Today's lunch is a hands-on cooking class, offering a fantastic opportunity to explore the Costa Rica's flavours, spices, and traditions through its cuisine. You'll have two menu options to choose from: Arroz con Pollo, a festive dish often served at special occasions like weddings and baptisms, and Traditional Casado, a well-balanced meal showcasing a variety of flavours and textures. Both options include a main dish, sides, dessert, and a drink. No matter which you choose, you'll gain practical experience preparing traditional recipes while learning about their cultural significance. Once we're all fed and watered, we can look forward to an afternoon of optional activities. There's a butterfly farm and orchard garden to explore. Your tour leader will be able to give more information on the choices available.

Sacred to the ancient Maya and Aztec people, it's considered to be one of the most beautiful birds in the world. Quieter and less touristy than its famous neighbour, our visit here gives us a good chance to spot wildlife.

We begin with a short transfer to Punta Uvita, where we'll board a RIB boat for a thrilling 90-minute crossing to San Pedrillo Ranger Station in Corcovado National Park. Be prepared for a wet boarding - Punta Uvita has no pier, so you'll need to wade into waist-deep water to get onto the boat. It is worth bringing aqua shoes as well as good walking shoes for this day. A dry bag would be desirable. Once on board, the crossing can be bumpy, adding to the sense of adventure! Between July and October, whales can sometimes be spotted in the bays along the Pacific coastline, while turtles, dolphins, and a variety of marine birds may be seen year-round. On arrival, we'll meet our expert local guide, who will lead us along trails weaving through protected primary forest and coastal pathways. Sturdy, well-worn walking shoes are essential, as the terrain includes exposed roots and uneven ground. Corcovado is home to an astonishing variety of wildlife, with 140 species of mammals and an abundance of birdlife. During our time in the park, we're likely to encounter white-faced capuchin monkeys, coatimundis (relatives of the raccoon), and tiny squirrel monkeys. Sloths, coatis, and even the occasional tapir may also make an appearance. Our morning walk lasts around three hours, followed by a well-earned picnic lunch at the ranger station. In the afternoon, we take a shorter 30-minute stroll before returning to our boat for the 90-minute journey back to Punta Uvita and onwards to our hotel. We'll aim to arrive in time for a well-deserved sundowner. *Please note that if travelling in the month of October, parts of Corcovardo National Park will be closed and we will therefore replace it with a visit to the spectacular Marino Ballena National Park."

Arriving in a typical Tico village at the Juanilama community, you will be immersed in local culture and tradition, learning all about everyday rural life. The initiative was launched by a group of women to introduce travellers to villages and communities off the usual tourist trail and give the women a sense of independence and entrepreneurial spirit. During your time here you will join one of the women to learn about the produce they grow in this area. She will tell you about the plants and their many uses whilst you collect ingredients for your cooking lesson afterwards at her home. You’ll help whip up a traditional meal, using the local produce before enjoying your last meal in the community. Next, we will organise a private transfer to Boca Tapada. If you’re travelling by hire car you’ll hop in and make your own way there."

Go with the flow and swim in the energising waterfalls of Costa Rica’s secret cloud forests. Far from tourists or crowds, discover the lost river in Guanacaste’s unique dwarf forest and bathe in undiscovered hot springs. Finish up on the golden coast, where the dry jungle fringes the lapping Pacific Ocean’s edge.  <br/><br/>Beginning in the Central Valley, you’ll be transported north to the lesser-discovered cloud forests of Bajos del Toro, staying in a private reserve. Follow gentle footpaths through the valley towards three thundering falls, and soak in your private hot tub with a glass of bubbly. In the mornings, sample the best local Costa Rican coffee, which is grown and ground nearby. Spend the evenings trying your hand at mixology crafting cocktails with local ingredients, creating a signature taste for your honeymoon. <br/><br/>Head west towards Rio Perdido, the ‘lost river’. This is where adrenaline and adventure kick in, and unlike during other Costa Rica honeymoons, it’s time for adventure travellers to show off their bravery and wicked dare-devil skills. Gear up and hold a steady grip as you climb from the deepest canyon, traverse the rocky landscape on floating walkways, and zipline from one outcrop to another. Swim in a natural thermal river and drift off to the sounds of the forest above. Make sure to watch out for howler monkeys just outside your room.  <br/><br/>Finish up with a healthy dose of sun, surf, and sea air on Guanacaste’s golden coast, with sunset views over the Pacific Ocean, and with plentiful opportunities for excursions, you’ll have time to reflect on an epic adventure.",

Amazing views of this virgin tropical rainforest area, appear before your eyes as you descend this true exploratory land. Wildlife is abundant, with sloth, toucans, parrots, coatis, morpho butterflies and colorful frogs being common sights. The 18 mile one day run includes a total of 52 rapids. Few rivers in the world can offer you so many. The first 4 miles consist of fun class II-III rapids which is a perfect time to test your new river skills and gain confidence in your team. Here you can find pockets of secondary growth forest that is extremely beautiful. After about 40 minutes we will enter the famous Pacuare River Gorge, which is 5 miles of some of the best white water rafting Costa Rica has to offer. You will also see the Huacas waterfall, a 150-foot dramatic drop into the river. After the gorge the rivers opens up to a 5-mile stretch on the Valle del Pacuare, where the river has a different character. It is wide open, which gives you the opportunity to rest a bit and take the opportunity to do some wildlife spotting. The forest remains just as lush, and the rapids just as fun. We finish in Siquirres, at our own private Exploration Center where you can take a shower, change and enjoy the gardens and terrace while having a beer or two and reflecting with your new friends about the great adventure you just shared."

Even though it is a small country, it is bursting with biodiversity, and this trip covers many of its most beautiful spots, visiting national parks, cloud forests and islands. <br/><br/>It is also superbly set up for tourism, allowing us to stay in small and locally owned accommodation along the way, from ecolodges located in tropical gardens to a waterfront accommodation on the Osa Peninsula only accessible by boat. <br/><br/>The trip starts inland, in the capital San Jose and then, using private minibus, we head to the Caribbean Coast to explore two amazing national parks, with two days in each. First, we go to Tortuguero National Park, which we travel through by boat as this is the only way to access it and see its eponymous turtles, otters, caiman and manatees. On land, we hope to see monkeys, caiman, iguanas, butterflies and myriad birdlife. From here to Cahuita National Park, where you can hike on trails that dip in and out of coast and jungle, or take an optional snorkelling trip out on the reef. One more inland idyll before hitting the Pacific coast is Savegre Cloud Forest, where we have two nights to enjoy, in particular, its extraordinary birdlife. The forest is most famous for being home to the elusive and exquisite resplendent quetzal. <br/><br/>There are few things more resplendent, however, than the final few days of this trip which are spent on the Osa Peninsula and Corcovado National Park. This is home to about 50 percent of Costa Rica’s incredible wildlife, from scarlet macaws to manatees, tayras to tapirs. We take a trip to Caño Island, where we hope to see dolphins and, in season, humpback or even orca whales. The former come here between July-November and the latter December-April. Osa Peninsula is one of the best ways to end a wildlife holiday, with plenty of beach time too so that you can chill out before your return home. <br/>",

Protecting around one-third of the Osa Peninsula (some 164sqmi/425sqkm), Corcovado is the largest national park in Costa Rica and encompasses 13 major ecosystems across various elevations, with montane forest, cloud forest, fresh water and mangrove swamps among them. Scientists have recorded half of all the species in Costa Rica on this peninsula alone. On today's hike along the parks trails, we may see all four monkey species in Costa Rica (squirrel, howler, white-faced capuchin and spider), tamandua (anteaters), two- and three-toed sloths, peccary, tapirs (including the endangered Baird’s tapir) and many reptiles, insects and amphibians. Puma and jaguar also prowl this area, but are very difficult to see. With more than 500 tree species, the bird count stands at an impressive 365 and the park protects the largest population of scarlet macaws in the country, which can frequently be seen and heard flying overhead. In October, when the national park is closed, we typically visit El Camino de la Danta, a wildlife-rich trail home to white-faced monkeys, scarlet macaws, toucans and more.

Passing different vegetation, we drive towards the summit and then follow a path that leads to a wonderful view across the huge crater. Irazu is one of the most active volcanoes in Costa Rica, though it has recently entered a dormant phase – a relief to the farmers and property owners who make their living on the fertile slopes. On a clear day, you can see both the Caribbean and Pacific coastlines from the summit. Remember to bring a jacket as it can be windy and cold at the viewpoint of this elevation (Irazu summit is 11,260ft/3,432m high). After, we continue to Cartago city, home to a spectacular domed basilica, where we have lunch. It’s then back to San José, where we visit Avenida Central and explore the main city highlights.

Originally from Central America, the cacao plant has an extraordinary history - it was one of the most important products for the Mayan and Aztec cultures. The discovery of America led to the introduction of chocolate in Europe, transforming it into the product we know and love today. Our tour starts with a short hike through a forest to a former cacao-growing plot. Upon arrival, we'll be treated to a demonstration of the artisanal process of chocolate making. There'll be plenty of opportunities to taste different kinds of chocolate, prepared on the spot in the traditional way.

The final leg of our journey takes us along some bumpy roads, but the bumps are well worth it to enjoy the lushness of the cloud forests. Perched on the Continental Divide between the Pacific and the Caribbean, it's thought that there has been indigenous habitation in Monteverde since 3000 BC. However, the turning point in its recent history came in 1950, when a group of pacifist Quakers from Alabama moved here to avoid subscription in the Korean War. They sought a lifestyle in a country in which they could embrace their peaceful beliefs and continue to cultivate their dairy farms. These families went on to establish the community of Monteverde and some of its famed cloud forest reserves. The drive from Arenal will take around five hours. On arrival, we'll have free time to explore at our leisure. This evening, we'll embark on a guided night walk through the cloud forest, seeking out nocturnal species like pacas (pronounced \"pah-kuh\")-a large rodent native to Central and South America-as well as tarantulas, snakes, frogs, and toads."

This morning, we'll have a guided walk in the Monteverde cloud forest, walking the paths that wind their way through gigantic ferns and trees covered with draping lichen and moss. The jungle floor is often littered with blossoms that fall from the high canopy providing a carpet of colour amidst the endless green. Next, we head high up into the canopy to the included 'hanging bridges'. The amazing view paired with the adventure of crossing a swaying suspension bridge is a must do when in Costa Rica.

Be prepared for a wet boarding - Punta Uvita has no pier, so you'll need to wade into waist-deep water to get onto the boat. It is worth bringing aqua shoes as well as good walking shoes for this day. A dry bag would be desirable. Once on board, the crossing can be bumpy, adding to the sense of adventure! Between July and October, whales can sometimes be spotted in the bays along the Pacific coastline, while turtles, dolphins, and a variety of marine birds may be seen year-round. On arrival, we'll meet our expert local guide, who will lead us along trails weaving through protected primary forest and coastal pathways. Sturdy, well-worn walking shoes are essential, as the terrain includes exposed roots and uneven ground. Corcovado is home to an astonishing variety of wildlife, with 140 species of mammals and an abundance of birdlife. During our time in the park, we're likely to encounter white-faced capuchin monkeys, coatimundis (relatives of the raccoon), and tiny squirrel monkeys. Sloths, coatis, and even the occasional tapir may also make an appearance. Our morning walk lasts around three hours, followed by a well-earned picnic lunch at the ranger station.

Birdlife thrives here with more 425 species recorded. Santa Elena is also one of the best places to spot noisy howler monkeys swinging through the trees. In the afternoon, it’s possible to join an optional coffee tour to learn about the importance of this crop to the socio-economic development of the country or join a canopy tour to get a different view of the forest.

You'll also discover how coffee has shaped the country's culture and economy over generations. After our visit to Doka Estate, we'll drive south out of San Jose for around four hours, down to the wild cloud forest of Savegre, famously one of the best places in Costa Rica for sightings of the elusive Resplendent Quetzal. The peaceful region gives us the perfect introduction to Costa Rica's nature. Hikers will enjoy the forest trails and the journey through the alpine-like hills, while nature lovers visit for its biodiversity - the area around San Gerardo de Dota contains around 200 species of bird and countless plant types including various orchid species. This afternoon, we'll explore the trails around our lodge, perhaps crossing the path of the river, as we delve into the surrounding cloud forest.

Calm stretches between the class III-IV rapids give you time to appreciate the passage through rainforest-topped canyons and tumbling waterfalls. Macaws and blue morpho butterflies wheel past as we raft through the steep, green walls of the canyon. Our adventure will be led by experienced rafting guides, who'll teach us the basics, so don't worry if you haven't tried rafting before. The first section of the canyon is mainly II-III rapids, giving us a chance to practice our skills. We'll then move into the III-IV rapids. The river has a good mix of rapids along the way, giving us the perfect mix of adventure and fun. It's worth noting that, while it's possible to raft year-round, it does depend on weather conditions. If the water levels on the Pacuare are low, there's another section of the river called 'Finca San Martin' that we'll raft instead - this is a four-mile stretch of class III rapids interspersed with calmer sections, creeks and waterfalls. After our rafting adventure, we'll have lunch on the river before returning to our hotel in the early afternoon. This evening is free to relax and recoup from the day. If you're not a confident swimmer, or the thought of rafting isn't for you, we can organise an alternative activity for you. You could choose to take a trip to CATIE and its huge botanical garden, or alternatively a visit to the community-led Aquiares coffee plantation, where you'll learn about the coffee-making process as well as some of the culture and traditions of the area. The Tour Leader will ask your group on the first day or two of the tour to confirm whether you want to raft or not so that they can make the reservations. *Please be aware that Class II-III white water rapids are available to all adults on rivers throughout Costa Rica. However, for Class IV rapids and above, some rivers may have lower and upper age restrictions (65 years+). For specific information, please consult with our tour leader."

Perched on the Continental Divide between the Pacific and the Caribbean, it's thought that there has been indigenous habitation in Monteverde since 3000 BC. However, the turning point in its recent history came in 1950, when a group of pacifist Quakers from Alabama moved here to avoid subscription in the Korean War. They sought a lifestyle in a country in which they could embrace their peaceful beliefs and continue to cultivate their dairy farms. These families went on to establish the community of Monteverde and some of its famed cloud forest reserves. The drive to Monteverde will take approximately four and a half hours from Arenal. On arrival, you're free to enjoy one or several of the many optional activities available in the area. One of the most popular activities is to walk the hanging bridges that extend over the reserve, giving you the chance to get a bird's eye view over the canopy. Couple this with the thrill of zooming through the trees on a zip wire and it makes for an exhilarating afternoon. For something less adrenaline-filled, you could choose to visit the local butterfly or orchid garden.

Leaving the cloud forest behind us, we'll descend to the Pacific Coast, enjoying staggering views over the Gulf and Peninsula of Nicoya. Heading south, we'll cross the Rio Tarcoles Bridge, from which huge crocodiles are regularly seen. We'll stop for a short walk in the Carara Biological Reserve, famed for the scarlet macaws and abundant birdlife which populate this transitional forest. Finally, we'll continue along the Pacific Coast to Manuel Antonio National Park, where we'll spend the next two nights. Our journey time today will be approximately four hours."

        "description": ": Manuel Antonio National Park is famous for its beautiful beaches and rich wildlife. We'll spend the morning exploring the park, where white-faced capuchin monkeys swing from the trees, and poison-dart frogs hide under the protection of lush tropical plantlife. Coatimundi (part of the raccoon family), tiny squirrel monkeys and howler monkeys also make their home in the park - we might spot them on our exploration. Manuel Antonio is also one of the best places in Costa Rica to see sloths. As their diet of leaves and buds gives them little energy, sloths move only when necessary and even then very slowly, making them very easy to spot! Our guides will know where they are most likely to be found. The remainder of the day can be spent relaxing on the white sandy beaches and enjoying a swim in the warm azure waters. The sunsets from this coast are spectacular and have to be seen to be believed. It's worth noting that, whilst beautiful, Manuel Antonio is an increasingly popular destination and so might be busier than you'd expect. Please note that Manuel Antonio National Park is closed on Tuesdays. If Day 6 of your departure falls on a Tuesday, our included park visit will take place on Day 7 instead."

        "description": "KAYAKING THE CANAL WATERSHED - Impressive and thrilling, the Panama Canal entrance is the door to one of the most highly travelled waterways in the world. The striking engineering of the Canal is able to handle more than 12,000 ships per year. Throughout the day and night massive ocean cruise liners, container ships, yachts and watercrafts of all kinds arrive from different continents. The Bridge of the Americas is another incredible manmade wonder of this trip. With 1,700 m in length and 120 m high, it was the first permanent structure to link North America and South America across the Panama Canal. Paddling in front of the Panama Canal from stable, efficient sea kayaks accompanied by professional guides, this venture provides a great perspective of Panama's best sites. As the sun drops below the horizon, soothing sunset colours of this coastal paddle are enchanting. Bird watching and relaxing on a remote beach surrounded by tropical forest gives a good sense of nature's handiwork on Pacific coasts. Along the shore, common species include soaring magnificent frigates, gliding brown pelicans, darting flocks of parrots and various wading migratory shore birds. Kayaking the entrance of the Panama Canal at sunset is a memorable half day escapade among the world's most astonishing man made structures and nature's equally amazing environments.

On arrival, a guide will be waiting to welcome you and drive you (approx. 1 hour) to the Finca Lerida Hotel in Boquete, where you will spend the next 3 nights. INTRODUCING BOQUETE - Tucked away amongst rolling green hills, Boquete is a small town which sits in a unique microclimate at 1,000m above sea level. The valley is swathed in lush forest, the fertile volcanic soils bringing life to coffee plantations, fruit orchards and farmland. Not only is it beautiful but Boquete provides opportunities for an array of outdoor adventures, including hiking, climbing, rafting and canopy excursions. It’s a great place to spend a few days - start your mornings with a cup of fresh local coffee and make the most of the activities available here. HALF DAY FINCA LERIDA COFFEE EXPERIENCE - The coffee experience begins in the fields of Boquete where you can catch a glimpse of the three vital factors that influence the coffee’s quality: the soil, the micro-climate, and the particular genetics of the variety. Learn about the history, origin, qualities and secrets of coffee handling. Then, in the second phase of the experience, you'll learn about coffee production all the way from ripe coffee cherry to roasted bean. What makes this experience unique, besides the invaluable ecological reserve that the coffee plantation shares, is its history that was always tied to Toleff Boche Mönniche, the Norwegian engineer that hand-built the main house and built the first gravity-flow coffee plantation in Panama. The experience ends at the tasting table where the long, intense and complex coffee process ends. This is also the place where you find out whether or not a whole year’s work produced a high quality coffee. Taste the different varieties of coffee and learn how to distinguish between different taste notes. Instruction will be given on how to prepare a good cup of coffee by learning about water temperature, time, toasting and grinding, and different brewing methods like Coffee Maker, French Press, Drip brew and Boiling. This experience illustrates the coffee culture in a fun way, helping you to enjoy this legendary aromatic drink. After this experience, a cup of coffee will never taste the same. (Meals - Breakfast)"

    "generalInfo": "We’ve focussed this particular trip on a spectacular area of Costa Rica that takes you ‘off the beaten track’ yet captures some of the best wildlife areas and experiences to be had in Central America. Starting in Alujuela Province, just beyond the city limits, you’ll instantly be immersed into a rural Costa Rican landscape where escaping into the cloud forests to marvel at the vast myriad of flora and fauna is a must. The following days are spent at the beautiful Cano Negro Wildlife Reserve on the border with Nicaragua, featuring waterways, dense jungle and shallow wetlands. Jaguars are frequently spotted along with capuchin monkeys, alligators, black river turtles and white-tailed deer. Tenoria national park sits just to the North of the better-known Arenal, yet with the turquoise blue waters of Rio Celeste and lush, jungle-clad Tenoria, it’s a standout destination in its own right. Nosara sits on the western fringes of Guanacaste and is one of the most beautifully remote beaches in the country- as perfect for surfing as it is for turtles and marine life.",

The refuge was initially construed as being 200 m wide from Punta India to the mouth of Rio Nosara. This area was increased to include the 200 m strip to Punta Guiones in 1985. Finally, in 1992, with the institution of the new \"Wildlife Law\", came the final definition of the refuge and in 1993 the amplification to the three-mile maritime limit as it is today. After an undetermined waiting time, close to the last quarter of the moon cycle, the \"arribada\" will begin. At first, few hundred turtles will come out on the beach, followed by a steady stream of animals for the next three to seven days.

    "generalInfo": "From the Pacific Ocean to the Caribbean Sea, this experience combines Costa Rica's most abundant lowland rainforest habitats, some of its best marine life and a huge variety of ecological zones from coast to coast, with its cloud forest-clad volcanic Central Highlands in between.<br/><br/>Expert local guides will help you to explore 7 of the country's most important protected areas. Three of these are in the highlands of Costa Rica comprising the Monteverde National Park, the inspiring community owned cloud forest reserve of Santa Elena, and cloud forests of the Arenal Volcano National Park. On the Pacific coast we take you to the Corcovado National Park where primary rainforest runs unbroken from hilltops to the sea.  On the Caribbean Coast, the similarly rich Tortuguero National Park forests are bisected throughout by a system of waterways which allows us to explore by small boat, or kayak too if you wish. At Caño Island Biological Reserve we find the country's most abundant marine life, which almost always includes dolphins; and regularly includes whales above the water; turtles, sharks, rays and coral reefs beneath.<br/><br/>The Corcovado National Park in the Osa Peninsula is undoubtedly a wildlife highlight for any visit to Costa Rica. The area has been described by National Geographic magazine as '..the most wildlife intense place on earth', both because of its primaeval forest and abundant offshore life. The western side of the Corcovado provides more than 30 miles of beach where the rainforest meets the Pacific Ocean. This is where terrestrial and marine ecosystems combine with coatis, macaws, and tapir coming out of the forest and onto the beaches; whilst turtles and even bull sharks come in from the sea, swimming into the Corcovado's tidal streams. Flocks of pelicans look like pterodactyls as they glide low over the Pacific waves and float in formation above your head. This coastline feels truly primordial.<br/><br/>17 kilometres from the coast, close to Osa's northern Drake's Bay, is the Caño Island Biological Reserve. Aside from Cocos Island way out in the Pacific, this is where  you will find the country's best marine life, both on the surface and beneath it. Dolphins are a regular sight, but you may also be lucky enough to see Humpback Whales. These can be seen both on northwards and southwards migrations along the coast. Olive Ridley turtles and manta rays are also often seen at the surface and below. The coral reefs and steep drop-offs provide good snorkelling if you wish, with some large schools of fish, ubiquitous white-tipped reef sharks and dense clusters of barracudas. We can pre-arrange diving for certified divers.<br/><br/>The Tortuguero National Park on Costa Rica's north eastern Caribbean coast is another excellent place to see lowland rainforest wildlife and birdlife. There are 309 species of bird here; and between July - October it is one of the best places in the world to see green turtles laying their eggs on its beaches. From late March to early June, Tortuguero can also be a good place from which to see giant leatherback turtles nesting. Many of your explorations here will be by boat, but for those keen to experience the forest in paddled tranquillity, we can incorporate guided day break forest wilderness kayaking.<br/><br/>Of Costa Rica's cloud forests, Monteverde is probably the most famous. Costa Rica's national bird, the Resplendent Quetzal, is an important draw here; as well as its abundant hummingbirds, insects and cloud forest flora. We will take you to explore the forests here, privately guided; as well as providing the option of an exhilarating descent along 15 canopy zip lines. <br/><br/>For some focused guided natural history and scenic treks we take you to the Santa Elena Cloud Forest Reserve and pathways into the cloud forests of the Arenal National Park. Again, this will be privately guided. Alternatives we can incorporate at Arenal are horseback riding, mountain biking and zip lines, for a more energetic experience of the fantastic landscapes here. <br/><br/>A privately-guided boat trip to the Caño Negro Refuge is something else which we include in these trips. Close to the Nicaraguan border, this area provides a wonderful combination of wetland and rainforest habitats - excellent for seeing wading birds such as roseate spoonbills, glossy ibis and black-necked stilts; as well as millions of migratory birds which escape the northern hemisphere Winter. Spectacled caiman are a constant threat to these birds, with good opportunities to see these; as well as the potential for larger crocodiles, spider monkeys, capuchins and howler monkeys.<br/><br/>Like any of our Costa Rica experiences, this one can be tailored to meet your timings, preferences and special interests. We can easily add in, or swap locations to incorporate more relaxation, adventure, a higher standard of ecolodge where available, or allow for a more intensive look at certain birdlife, wildlife or marine life. Other locations you may be interested to consider add include the  Manuel Antonio National Park on the Central Pacific coast.",

Your guide can point out a brown-throated three-toed sloth clinging to a tree as the moss on their back allows them to blend in with the leaves and branches avoiding predators like the harpy eagles and jaguars. As you travel down the tranquil waterway, the boat disturbs the river causing a green basilisk lizard to scatter across the water. The lizard is also called a Jesus Christ lizard for its ability to run on the top of the water when scared. In the afternoon, you can continue your exploration of the tropical jungle with a thrilling zip-line excursion. Traveling through the trees along two miles of zip lines brings the tree-line to life. Your guide will strap you onto the cable and you can soar up to 360 feet above the canyon floor in view of the trundling whitewater of La Fortuna Waterfall. The view during your solitary flight will provide a moment of quiet reflection as you feel the wind against your cheeks, hear the chirping of tropical birds, and watch the water spill 200 feet off the mountain in the waiting pool in the distance."

        "description": "The tropical scenery of Arenal gives way to the unique contours of the Cloud Forest in Monteverde, home to a distinctive ecosystem feeding off the daily mist. Your private transfer will escort you to the banks of Arenal Lake as you travel by taxi boat across the foot of the volcano. Boats venture onto the water filled with local fishers searching for common snook or rainbow bass. Jaguar and tapir often linger along the shoreline when thirsty, touching the secluded areas of the lake that spans 33 square miles. The area of Monteverde clings to the slopes of the Cordillera de Tilarán where farms, nature reserves, and a chain of villages hide among the blanket of jade canopy and winding trails. Enjoy the beautiful tranquility of your luxury accommodations in Monteverde before your guide greets you in the lobby ready to introduce you to the coffee tradition of the province. A local farmer will lead you through his property along the slopes of La Trocha , a steep road overlooking the Gulf of Nicoya leading into the San Luis Valley. You can find ripe berries growing from the coffee plant, which are in fact the grains used to brew coffee once properly dried. When fresh from the bush, the berries have a tart flavor and sweet aroma. The coffee plant also drops the scent of jasmine into the air with small white flowers growing along the edges. Wander through the cooperative learning area to learn about the proper harvest time, drying period, and the different levels for roasting the beans amid the drifting scents of oranges and bananas emanating from the plantation. At the end of the tour, your guide will teach you how to taste coffee to find the delicate flavors and vibrant aromas that the coffee has taken from the soils of specific terrain such as caramel or cocoa, or even hints of dried fig and lavender."

Your guide will lead you along the trails for insight into the unique flora and fauna that is thriving in the 25,946-acres of protected landscape. The isolated mountain peaks and varied slopes protect a variety of hummingbirds and orchids, as well as the strangler figs and leafy elephant ears. Sloths sleep in branches up to 20 feet above the forest floor, and orange-kneed tarantulas hide behind the protruding sinewy sprawl of fig roots. You can hear the Jurassic call of howler monkeys, which often clearly echo through the trees for up to three miles. The monkeys grow up to 36 inches long excluding their tails and forage on fruits and nuts in addition to blooming flowers. Six out of the 12 species of cat in the Neotropics are found in Monteverde including the Jaguarundi, a small cat weighing up to 22 pounds with a long tail and short legs. It hunts birds, reptiles, and small mammals during the cooler hours of the day, allowing for a possible sighting during your exploration of the captivating mountainous terrain.

Take your time kayaking through the extensive network of canal created by the mangrove swamp. Root systems and gnarled branches rise out of the placed estuary, and the lush canopy filters the sunlight onto the reflective water. The sporadic sounds of bird-calls and the moans of howler monkeys shape the untamed ambiance of the tropical destination. Heron perch on the protruding roots resting in the growing warmth of the morning and long green iguanas rest on fallen logs. Your guide will likely spot a boa constrictor looping its long, heavy body through skewering branches reaching an average of 13 feet long and weighing 60 pounds. From the kayak, the giant snake resembles one of the swollen, fallen trees scattered around the mangroves. You can also keep your eyes open for crab-eating raccoons and spectacled caiman. The large lowland reptile can grow to over six feet long with a bony ridge between its eyes resembling glasses. They rest in the refreshing mixture of salt and freshwater to cool their bodies down in the tropical heat. You can also search the trees for the elusive and endangered spider monkeys. As one of the few places in the world protecting the species, the island estuary allows the distinctive New World monkey to wander through the canopy up to 98 feet above the water foraging on fruits, leaves, flowers, and insects. Their shy demeanor makes them more difficult to spot than the capuchin monkey in the area but also more exciting to discover with their disproportionately spindly limbs and prehensile tail reaching 35 inches long."

Large, light brown, ring-tailed coatis scour the underbrush in search of food. The green ridges slope into the banks of Arenal Lake and bougainvillea drapes across houses and restaurants. Periodically, clouds drift overhead, drawing your eye to the spectacular view of the perfect cone-shaped peak of Arenal Volcano.

Your guide escorts you away from the resort after the meal leading you into the heart of the celebrated Manuel Antonio National Park. The protected park was established in 1972 in order to preserve the natural beauty of the 1,700 acres of land and 136,000 acres of ocean. Rocky coves lead to beaches covered in powdery white sand. Tropical forests edge the shoreline leading inland creating a barrier between the waves ascending mountains. Before the canopy covers the walkway, your guide points to a hawk circling over the forest in search of prey. A troupe of white-headed capuchin monkeys scrambles through the trees above. They have prehensile tails reaching 21 inches long that help them balance while foraging. The kids jump in fear when they hear a low, guttural moan echoing in the trees thinking it could be a jaguar or puma. Instead, the sound comes from a howler monkey warning you against encroaching on its territory. When you reach the beach, a black spiny-tailed iguana perches on the rocks resting in the sun."

The toco toucan has a yellow-orange bill reaching nine inches long encompassing up to 50 percent of its body mass. They pluck ripe fruit from the trees or feed on frogs and small reptiles as well. The peaceful exploration of the water provides access to more wildlife than the hiking trails due to the quiet, still air of the secluded island."

The plantation began as a sugar mill in the 1940s when oxen pulled carts between Monteverde and Santa Elena. While walking through the coffee section of the plantation, you try your hand at harvesting, learning the touch and time-consuming process of picking the berries off the vine and into the woven basket. You watch as the machines crush, peel, and roast the beans, bringing forth the comforting, familiar aroma of coffee. You continue to the sugar cane stalks, which can grow to 13 feet tall. Your guide pulls away the stalk that resembles bamboo and breaks it. A sweet fragrance immediately fills the air. Your guide explains how to make a fresh sugar loaf out of the processed stalks, as well as a delicious drink made from the raw juice.

The sunlight pierces through the treetops. Vanilla and cinnamon grows on the property, adding harmonious layers of fragrance to the herbaceous aroma of the trees. A chocolate plant takes fives years before it produces a viable cocoa pod. The trees on the plantation carry large orbs that resemble papayas. The orange and red pods contain the seeds out of which producers make chocolate. Your guide offers you a pod to break open. The thick shell makes a thud against the table as it cracks in half. You sample the beans inside, tasting the sweet white gelatin. The bean itself is bitter and hard. It takes about a week of constant attention to dry the beans. Roasting the cocoa helps release the natural oils from the beans, which gives the decadent, rich flavor you associate with chocolate. You help your guide grind the roasted beans into a paste and mix it with sugar for your first taste of the fresh, handmade dark chocolate containing 70 percent cocoa. The velvety texture coats your tongue. You could eat the entire bowl as a snack and still crave more.

        "description": "The sunlight washes over the rainforest canopy around the ridges of the Central Valley. The view from the open-air dining room at breakfast is familiar and comforting. You sip a fresh cup of coffee made from beans sourced from Finca Rosa Blanca’s plantation. Your guide leads you away from the resort and into the heart of San Jose to visit the Central Market. The indoor market retains an Old World ambiance beneath the 19th-century circular architecture. More than 200 shops line the narrow alleys, along with small restaurants known as sodas . The vibrant atmosphere draws up to 20,000 visitors to the market daily, representing a unique blend of history and contemporary culture. The cooks in the sodas use traditional recipes that fill the market with the aromas of garlic, cumin, or cinnamon. Ripe, small bananas known as plantains offer a sweeter flavor and creamier texture than the bananas you are used to back home. Vendors sell agua dulce (sweet water) and handmade tortillas stuffed with fried cheese. Merchants offer handcrafted boots and saddles. You find a watermelon larger than a small dog set beside a box filled with the ruby tendrils of lychees. You continue to the Café del Barista located in the Aranjuez neighborhood. A custom corrugated roof covers the space above the café-style tables and chairs. The baristas take pride in their knowledge of the coffee beans regionally sourced from around Costa Rica, along with their ability to craft sensational coffee and cocktails that highlight the flavors of the brew first and foremost. A menu above the bar provides a list of cocktails in which the café specializes. Instead of the menu, you tell the barista what flavors you enjoy, allowing them to express their creativity in crafting a cocktail that features sweet and earthy flavors. The first asks if you want the cocktail hot or cold before crafting a decadent espresso, mixing it with milk, coconut, and a hint of tobacco. In the afternoon, you reach the Savegre Hotel in San Gerardo de Dota. The floor-to-ceiling windows in the lobby provide a spectacular view of the surrounding nature at all hours of the day. The tranquil ambiance is welcoming after a day of traveling through San Jose. A charming fire flickers in the lobby to offer warmth and a cozy setting against the cool temperatures of the highlands. Shrubs and flowering wild fruits attract a myriad of birds that like to perch in the shading oaks."

The sunlight burns away the clouds and brings a perfect blue sky. The hidden coffee bar is located at Kilometer Marker 50 and is known for sourcing coffees from six different micro-mills around the Tarrazú region. A micro-mill is a small, family-owned plantation. The scent of fresh espresso fills the lively space. The baristas welcome you with friendly smiles, offering a drink to warm you after stepping inside from the cooler mountain climate. You begin with an espresso, listening to the barista explain the flavors you might find after your first taste. You take a moment to let the hot, decadent drink coat your palate before finding the rich cherry flavor that the barista spoke of. The creamy texture leads to a smoky finish. You feel like a wine connoisseur discussing the different aromas and subtle tastes of a select wine. You can enjoy an experience similar to your tasting at Café del Barista by sampling a rum cocktail meant to highlight and enhance the flavors of the coffee. After sampling a variety of the coffee brewed from beans around the different plantations of Tarrazú, your guide takes you to one of the micro-mills for a better understanding of the unique properties of the region that produces Costa Rica’s most coveted coffee. The small farm grows coffee at an elevation of 16,400 feet above sea level. Harvesters handpick the crop to ensure the best quality of the beans. The volcanic soil adds to the minerals feeding the sensational berries. The altitude can quickly take your breath away while walking through the coffee field. The strong sunlight brings delightful warmth to the terraces. You sit near a quiet lagoon with a fresh-brewed cup of coffee from the Tarrazú region, indulging in the panorama of the surrounding landscape and the scent of almonds and tangerines drifting upwards from your cup."

You stop along the way at the trailhead leading to the Savegre Waterfall. Your guide takes you on a path lined with lush trees and flourishing underbrush. The cool mist has dissipated, offering a warm morning beneath the canopy of the cloud forest. Moss dangles from the trees and glistens with moisture after capturing dew from passing clouds. Your guide tells you to stay alert for resplendent quetzals that are known to nest near the top of the trail. The males have scarlet breasts and lustrous turquoise wings. Bright yellow flowers blossom with textured ridges along the petals. The grass grows nearly to your knees. You can hear the rushing waters of the Savegre River brushing against the rocks and the swaying underbrush along the banks. Birds chirp and twitter over the sound of the cascade. You reach the end of the trail where a smooth rocky outcropping looks over the waterfall. The breeze carries the refreshingly cold mist and splashes your cheeks. Ripples in the pool settle to a glassy surface, allowing you to see down to the riverbed. The trail takes you one and a half miles round trip, returning to the car that shuttles you onward to Manuel Antonio and the Arenas del Mar Beachfront and Rainforest Resort. The boutique luxury hotel and resort offers a sustainable experience blending the marvels of the surrounding rainforest with the splendors of the protected beaches. Condé Nast Traveler once placed the property on the Reader’s Choice Award Top 15 Resorts in Central America, surrounded by what Forbes called one of the world’s most beautiful national parks. Enjoy the sea breeze from your private balcony.

Howler monkeys return to their lively guttural groans sweeping through the three square miles of protected area of Manuel Antonio. The famous national park is Costa Rica’s smallest but contains exceptional wildlife diversity with nearly 110 different species of mammals and over 180 different types of birds. The breeze carries the scent of the saltwater, which fades beneath the aroma of fresh coffee. Your guide greets you in the lobby after breakfast and escorts you to a fantastic spice plantation located on more than 25 acres of cultivated land against a backdrop of 125 cares of thriving primary and secondary forests. The trails lead to thriving black pepper, allspice, and turmeric plants. Orchids grow in the shade of the trees, absorbing the moisture in the morning air and hiding in the comfort of the shade. You find the vanilla plants growing lush and proud in the coastal humidity. Your guide explains the budding flower is in the orchid family and remains the only orchid people eat. In order to grow the edible segments of the vanilla bean, the flower must be hand-pollinated within 12 hours of blossoming. The pods are cured, which accounts for the fragrant enzymes producing the fragrance you find familiar and seductive. The drying process takes up to four months before the pods reach a deep brown color with white crystals coating the bean’s surface. You return to Arenas del Mar after visiting the spice market on the plantation. The remainder of the day is yours to explore the trails in the rainforest in search of endangered spider monkeys or walk along the powdery white sand of the Pacific beaches."

Streams pour over rocky banks. The tiny rapids imitate mist as the water rushes down the hillside. The park stretches over 11,600 acres and was established in 1979. The Tárcoles River winds through the park and is known for its infamous inhabitants. Crocodiles linger around the muddy banks of the Tárcoles River Bridge.

You feel as though you are traveling through the Amazon jungle, enjoying the adventurous spirit of this unique ecosystem. The trees begin to shake above you, and you discover a restless white-collared manakin. The robust yellow and white breast stands out from the surrounding greenery and the male calls to the female with a loud snap that sounds like a twig breaking. A Jesus Christ lizard springs up from a rock as you pass, running across the river’s surface to reach the safety of the banks. Your guide points into the distance at the purple-throated fruitcrow, which inhabits humid lowland forest. Their glossy plumage glistens, and the purple-red patch on its upper throat shines in the sun."

The perfume of jasmine fades beneath the enticing aroma of coconut. You will embark on a scenic flight over the jungle terrain and return to San Jose and the Central Valley. Your private transfer greets you upon arrival and escorts you to San Gerardo de Dota, set deep within a mountain valley. The crisp air creates a refreshingly cool afternoon. Orchards line the basin beneath the stunning cloud forest divided by the rushing waters of the Savegre River where sportsmen arrive been May and June for fly fishing season. After taking the time to settle into the comforts of your hillside lodge, you will meet your guide and follow the trail along the Savegre River on a nearly three-mile hike. You dip your fingers into the passing water to feel the chillier temperatures that pass through the mountains. A grated bridge passes over the first waterfall where the whitewater falls over the rocks and into the narrow banks below. For a truly unique viewing experience, you step inside a small cave to reach a hidden cascade. The trickling water echoes beneath the rocks and sprays mist around the cavernous space. Tropical roots reach out of the ground, helping to support the soil. The second waterfall is larger than the first and curves against the bordering boulders. An acorn woodpecker peeks out from a nest as you pass, and you notice its yellow and black plumage contrasting the faded colors of the bark. A few steps farther and you find a collared redstart, these encounters offering just a glimpse of the 110 birds identified in the park."

The berries from the trees resemble tiny avocados but feature a bit of sweetness that is attractive to the birds. The cool air bites at your cheeks and the mist rolls around the treetops before fading away beneath the rising sun. You hear a deep, smooth note repeated in a simple pattern and quietly and carefully follow the melody to discover the rare bird known for its beauty. You spot the male quetzal perched on the branches above you. His wings shimmer with a lustrous green against the deep red patch on his chest. His elegant tail dangles up to 26 inches long and resembles a streamer rustling in the gentle breeze. You stare at the glistening plumage and stunning display of nature’s beauty without pause until the bird flies away with its tail fluttering in its wake."

The mountains reach an altitude of nearly 9,850 feet above sea level. Sloths relax in the trees and cling to bark, blending into the canopy, while tapirs forage on the undergrowth. The endangered squirrel monkey travels across the branches, and pumas seek shelter in the treetops during the day’s heat. The sporadic clouds drift through the sky, opening for a sensational view of Talamanca Cordillera and the volcanoes of the Central Volcanic Mountains, beyond which lies the Central Pacific coast. The red-fronted parrotlet has a crimson forehead and yellow edges on its tail and gathers in small groups within the cool forest.

Nearly 185 distinctive bird species inhabit the park, along with over 100 types of mammals that wander along the vine-strewn cotton trees and manzanillos growing along the shoreline. Beach almond and coconut palms rustle in the breeze and red, white, and buttonwood mangroves create a maze of saltwater canals. Brown pelicans fish offshore and rest in the small wake on the water. You quickly find the Amazon kingfisher with a bronzed green coat and white collar. They perch on high branches while hunting fish and crustaceans, diving into the water at high-speeds before returning to their spot on the branch. Your guide quietly points to a red-capped manakin. The elusive bird inhabits subtropical and tropical lowland forest. They grow to a height of four inches, and the males shine a velvety black with a bright red head and nape.

After breakfast, you follow your guide onto a small boat to traverse the mangrove forest in search of a different view of the avifauna and wildlife of Costa Rica’s smallest national park. The sunlight pierces through the canopy as you drift along the tranquil canals while gray fox forage in the underbrush and three-toed sloths sleep in the trees. A scarlet macaw watches you pass below. Seeing a macaw in the wild carries a special feeling of accomplishment and wonder. A groove-billed Ani resembles a crow with a parrot’s bill and a long, black tail that dangles off the branch. You can see the gentle parallel grooves swooping down its beak to its nose. A blue-capped motmot hides in the trees with its turquoise crown standing out from the leaves. The tassels on their tails waggle from side to side, letting predators know they’ve been seen."

After your meal, you meet your guide for the day and head to the banks of the Pacuare River in the Pacuare Gorge. The river runs over 67 miles until it reaches the Caribbean coast. Steep walls covered in lush greenery edge the river. The echoing rush of the water replaces the sounds of the city. The sky is bright above you and the gorge walls block out the remaining vast blue. The unfettered rainforest is home to sensational life, from active monkeys in the daytime to colorful frogs at night. The scent of wet granite and damp earth emanates from the riverbanks. Butterflies flutter before your eyes, their metallic blue and green shimmering in the sunlight. Hawks circle in the sky in search of breaching fish as you descend down the lower River. You paddle with your guide, coursing down the powerful whitewater of class III rapids. The mist sprays your cheek with cool, refreshing water. The rapids ease and the river returns to a serene, calm waterway leading you to a secluded lodge.

The community has lived in harmony with the mountainous terrain and lush rainforest along the banks of the Pacuare River. Families traditionally lived in small groups scattered around the jungle and have maintained their heritage in the continuation of their language and customs. The short walk takes you into a traditional circular hut after which the main lobby at Pacuare Lodge was modeled. The circular, thatched roof reaches a conical point at the center. A member of the tribe plays a handmade ocarina crafted to resemble a frog. A number of the residents of the local community showcase fantastic masks made to resemble the local fauna, such as jaguar and monkeys, representing the spiritual connection the community has with nature and wildlife. You have breakfast with a family, sharing the distinct differences in the culture sustained for more than 1,500 years. You learn the community has no word for “love” or “leadership” in the Cabécar language. Instead, they refer to both using the same word, “respect.” This term also relates the community’s relationship to the forest, acting as part of the ecological web connecting the wildlife and flora. You return to the lodge to meet your private transfer escorting you to Arenal. You notice sloths moving unhurriedly in the trees. Their fur helps camouflage their bodies against the canopy."

A strong and cool breeze rushes over the water’s surface. The trees sway and leaves rustle. Rainbow bass flicker beneath the water and are incredibly active around sunrise and sunset.

After landing at the country’s main international airport, you will be met by your local guide and transferred to the Caribbean. Upon your arrival, you will check-in to a lodge that basks beneath the frame of Irazu volcano. Here, you have time to rest before lunch.

The road will twist and turn, leading you toward a summit that features three craters. Pools will shimmer and will be visible when you peer into one of the craters, fumaroles will spit out sulfuric gases, and bubbling mud pools will change before your eyes.

The Rio Pacuare twists through canyons and forest to the Caribbean Sea. Tropical birds tend to flutter around the banks, forest shrouds the water, creating a green canopy that will provide shade throughout the day. Most of the river is calm, so you will spend the morning drifting through nature. There are also places of grade II and III rapids, where your family adventure will take on an exhilarating feel. This white-water rafting experience is usually possible for all children over the age of six. Where you start will depend on the time of year because the guides cannot take young children on the grade IV rapids. While a few rapids will stir adrenaline and excitement, most of the rafting trip will be serene as you look for birds and slowly make your way toward the Caribbean. After lunch and some time to rest, your journey will continue to the Guapiles Highway. Upon your arrival, you will pass under a tunnel to emerge in Braulio Carrillo National Park, where a beautiful road will lead you further into the wild. To complete your journey, you will need to travel by boat. Although this may all seem like a tiresome journey, there is wildlife all around, and the variety of transport methods will make the day seem like an expedition. Once you are in Tortuguero, you can rest along the river and listen to monkeys as they howl."

Without roads or villages, it is a place where rare birds fly above river otters and capuchin monkeys jump past endangered iguanas. On the Caribbean Coast, you can experience iconic scenes with breathtaking golden beaches that are mostly without footprints. During your time on the coast, you will also be able to witness four different sea turtles throughout the area. With two full days, you can fully explore both paradigms. Today, you will explore the coast. First, you will cruise along a 22-mile beach, where you cannot swim, but you can watch your kids run off some energy. Traveling onward, your guide will show you a safe place for swimming and snorkeling. Beneath the surface, you might catch a glimpse of a green or loggerhead turtle. Leatherback turtles dominate the area from February to July, and these are the world’s largest turtle species, making them an incredible sight, even when you are looking down from a private boat. Your day on the coast will be flexible. Usually, your guide will lead you back to your lodge in the afternoon, where you can relax and watch for monkeys. After dark, you will return to the beaches in search of hatching sea turtle eggs. The next generation of turtles will crack out of their shells after dusk, and with a roving spotlight, you will be able to watch their first steps, which will prove to be a wildlife experience as intimate as it is authentic."

Hopefully, a large capuchin monkey troop will swing past you, bringing wide-eyed wonder among your kids. Usually, you can see howler monkeys in the trees, and sometimes sloths hang down from branches that rise above the water. After a morning tour, your afternoon will be flexible, so you can choose whether to venture deeper into the jungle or to soak up some sun on the Caribbean Coast. You should note that Tortuguero is not the best place for swimming because the waters can be wild or inaccessible.

You can even take teenagers on a longer hike in search of white-faced monkeys, colorful crabs, and stunning viewpoints. Hiking can be complemented by snorkeling, and the marine world here is one of the finest in Central America. With a local guide, you can snorkel in calming water as stingrays glide around the bottom. Sometimes, you will not be able to distinguish their camouflage until they move. Octopus also lurch in the water, and nurse sharks provide stunning views beneath the surface. If snorkeling is not for your family, then Gondoca Manzanillo will be a good alternative. Here, you can witness playful dolphins, manatees, and caimans on a boat tour or from tandem kayaks.

These barons built grand mansions to display their wealth and prestige between the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Chic cafes, trendy restaurants, fashionable art galleries, and elegant hotels have returned much of the faded glory to the unique palatial designs featuring art deco, neoclassical, and neo-Mudejar aesthetics.

The scent of jasmine fills the air from the large blossoming coffee bush, which is a member of the jasmine family. You will enter a private tasting room at the end of your tour, where your guide will teach you how to properly taste coffee. By tasting the different samples offered, you can notice a combination of sweet, sour, and bitter notes similar to honey, molasses, and citrus connoting the rich complexities of properly brewed Costa Rican coffee. As you finish your coffee exploration, you will then continue to the charming town of Sarchi, which is celebrated as the cultural heart of Costa Rica.

While nocturnal, they will spend a particularly hot day relaxing in the refreshing waters submerged up to their necks. The unique tapir is recognizable due to its cream-colored coast and elongated snout known as a proboscis used for picking leaves, fruit, and grasses.

The incredible biodiversity of Costa Rica become your focus while wandering through the forest canopy in view of the Arenal Volcano. The sunlight pierces the treetops that shed scattered light on the foliage that grows against the base of the trees and the rich soil. Your guide might comb the trees to find a resting boa constrictor that is blending in with the branches. They can live up to 3,280 feet above sea level to survive in the savannah or in the premontane wet forests, growing to nearly 10 feet in length on average. Capuchin monkeys race through the trees living in elevation between 4,922 and 6,562 feet above sea level. Their prehensile tails help them balance when traveling across the canopy. The troop averages 15 members who spread around the treetops laterally when foraging for fruits, nuts, or insects. Upon returning to the comforts of your gorgeous hotel, you will have the remainder of the day at your leisure to relax in the soothing waters of the natural thermal springs for which Arenal is renowned. The subterranean volcanic activity heats the waters that pour through the region to support elegant spa-like facilities and public community pools.

Nesting season for the leatherback takes place from October to March, when thousands of the turtles return to the place from which they hatched in order to lay their eggs. The cool sea breeze carries the aroma of briny water over the soft sand along the coastline and blends with the aroma of freshly opened coconut. Your guide will offer information on the leatherback turtles as you explore the coast.

Your private transfer will be ready to escort you away from the Peace Lodge and lead you to cloud forest at Monteverde. The scenic drive will bring you along the mountainside, and your driver can point to the treetops so that you can catch the wild toucans as they perch on the open branches.

The bacon is hardy and crispy, sourced from the family farm, along with the sharp cheese and fresh organic coffee. After savoring it all, the day is yours to discover the majesty of Monteverde Nature Reserve as you desire, whether you explore the hanging bridges or opt to hike across the protected landscape. Whatever your choice, your guide will greet you at your hotel and lead you along the network of trails that illuminate the remarkable diversity of the flora and fauna of the cloud forest. The persistent low-level cloud cover feeds the trees across the landscape, increasing the mosses covering the vegetation to help absorb and retain the moisture. You will traverse the trails in search of the captivating birdlife that populates the diverse terrain and gives rise to the rebirth of the resplendent quetzal in the region. Your guide will listen for the sharp whistle of the rufous-tailed jacamar and the shrill, two-noted shriek of the fiery-billed aracari as you step over the fallen leaves and venture around roots that protrude from the soft soil. You may hear the slight high-pitched whimper echo through the trees, and your guide will look to the tree branches and point to a dangling emerald tail reminiscent of a jungle vine flush with leaves. You can trace the tail to the iridescent blue, gold, and red plumage of the rare quetzal. Their tail feathers grow to a length of 26 inches and resemble a streamer. The bright colors of the male help to attract females during mating season, which varies between February to July, depending upon the regional location of the bird. You will continue to Old Monteverde, a town founded 50 years ago by Quakers emigrating from the United States. You will stop to visit a small café known for its assorted chocolates before stepping into farmland on which the café grows cacao beans. Your guide will introduce you to the large pod that more resembles a papaya than a chocolate bean. The rugged exterior grows to over an inch thick and protects the cacao bean from the elements. Harvesters pull the pod from the trees, open it, and let the beans dry naturally in the heat, constantly blending the mixture. Your guide will invite you to blend the beans by hand to learn the process the Maya and Olmec civilizations used before brewing the ground cacao to produce a rich, thick and slightly bitter hot chocolate."

You can take one of the two main hiking trails that circle the wildlands, the longer of which reaches nearly three miles with branches that lead to Laguna Meandrica and several marshes. Your guide might quickly point into the trees at a two-toed sloth clinging close to the bark. Their shaggy fur and slow, deliberate movements allow them to blend into the foliage. The loud, deep guttural call of a howler monkey echoes up to three miles across the park defining their territory or guarding their mate. The sound fades as the tropical heat of late morning settles over the park. Your guide can lead you to a known nesting area for scarlet macaws, who tend to perch on royal palms and fight over the ripe fruit.

The cosmopolitan atmosphere reflects the collection of cultures from around the country, and the depth of history on the streets is displayed in refurbished colonial mansions. Mountains encircle the valley floor and bring a unique skyline to the city. You arrive in San Jose and are met by a private transfer at the airport. Your charming hotel offers you a view of the mountainside and a quiet garden separate from the bustling streets of the city. Almost half of Costa Rica’s population calls San Jose their home. The Central Market was built in the 1880s and continues to be a lively center for the city’s shopping. Find over 200 stalls, restaurants, and shops lining the expansive city block that fills the single pavilion. The zesty citrus of fresh ceviche emanates from the restaurants and fruit stands display gigantic watermelons. Street acts perform exuberant musicals in the Plaza de la Cultura and the wonderful smiles of the locals continue through the evening."

The thunderous rush of a waterfall echoes in the trees. Parakeets nest in the sweeping forest. They can grow up to seven-inches and have a distinctive tapered tail that that grows to almost half their body length. They chirp and tweet in elegant song that carries over the sound of the waterfall.

The soft white sand sweeps around the bay in a crescent shape and the trees rustle in the breeze. Enjoy a morning hike and witness where the sea meets the trees. Squirrel monkeys swing from branch to branch and the exotic birds like the blue-crowned motmot are almost blinding with iridescent feathers. There is something both majestic and serene about exploring the countless trails of the park and of Costa Rica. The flowers are charming and the wildlife is spellbinding. Over 109 species of mammals call the national park home, including Hoffmann’s two-toed sloth. As you come to the beach you are more likely to find the black spiny-tailed iguana. The reptile can grow to over four feet in length and they usually have a whitish gray or tan color. They spread out on the rocks and bask in the sunlight. Waves crash against the rocky outcrops and spritz into the air. You find the combination of the trees and water both thrilling and beautiful. The biodiversity is unique and stunning, allowing you to explore the rainforest. Do as the iguana does and spread out on the beachside and indulge in the hot, soft sand and cool water of the pristine beach. The day drifts by and you relax without a care in the world amidst the soothing sounds of the water."

The fascinating gallery space spans five floors displaying 7,000 artifacts that have been preserved over the centuries. The kids will be engrossed with the stories of the native peoples who crafted the images of fertility goddesses, shamans, frogs, and snakes by hand. Your guide can point out the distinct Mayan influences on individual pieces, and your kids will likely pause at the stunning ceramic head with a dramatic row of serrated teeth that stand out from the surrounding precious stone images glinting in the soft light. After a quick pass through the museum, the indoor design of Mercado Central will keep any jet lag at bay as your eyes take in the range of local spices to coffee beans grown around the country, as well as vibrant produce like delicious mango and rich avocado.

The neighborhood will feel like an interactive art center with many of the aristocratic homes now containing hotels, cafes, restaurants, and offices. You will then travel to the town of Sarchi with your private driver for an overview of the artisan crafts for which the Central Valley is known. You will pass beneath the twin-towered church that soars over the village and visit the artists as they craft sensational wood furniture, leather goods, and the traditional ornate oxcarts that are a symbol of rural life in Costa Rica. The carts played a key role in the transport of goods to the markets during the country’s history, making the unique and ornate designs on the carts culturally and aesthetically meaningful. Markets in town heavily feature the works of local artists and showcase handmade bowls and sophisticated jewelry, stylish dressers, and rocking chairs ingrained with images of Costa Rican wildlife.

After breakfast, your guide will meet your family in the hotel lobby and whisk you to the banks of Penas Blancas River as it winds along the foothills of the Tilaran Mountains. Sections of the river hold high-class rapids, but you will board a raft along the pristine waters for an incredible wildlife viewing safari. Your guide will steer your raft as you listen to the chirping birds that are often interrupted by the guttural groan of howler monkeys. At first, the kids might think it is a predatory cat, but your guide can explain how the howler monkey call can echo through the trees for up to three miles. A bare-throated tiger-heron might perch on the edge of the brackish water remaining still as you pass. It can reach 32 inches tall and feeds on the insects and frogs hiding in the mud alongside the river. A troop of capuchin monkeys might scramble through the trees, and the kids will love watching the monkeys spring from the branches with their white fur standing out from the foliage. Their tails grow up to 22 inches long and help the monkeys balance along narrow branches and when reaching for distant foods like nuts and berries. At dusk, you will venture to a private reserve on which an owner has allowed the rainforest to regrow, which in turn has become new stomping grounds for some of Costa Rica’s captivating nocturnal wildlife. The kids will likely cling to your guide as you follow the marked paths searching for the numerous frog species hiding around the private reserve, hearing the high-pitched chirp of a dink frog and finding the bright blue, yellow, and orange markings of a red-eye treefrog clinging to an umbrella leaf."

The adventures of your day will continue in the afternoon with a zip line tour above the forest canopy. The exhilarating experience takes you up to 95 feet off the ground as you fly above and through the verdant trees with views spreading to the azure waters of the Pacific in the distance. You can hear the twittering birds around you while the cable hums as you glide through the air with the wind brushing against your cheeks. Your heart will race as you speed down the nearly mile-long course that takes you over a minute to reach the end of the line. After traversing the sky, you can take a deep breath in the butterfly garden to view some of the 1,200 types of butterflies found in Costa Rica, which accounts for 18 percent of the entire world’s butterfly population. The blue Morpho is one of the most popular butterflies to see due to its iridescent blue wings outlined with black tips. The butterfly is the largest in the world with a wingspan that is eight inches wide. The Glass Wing butterfly equally captivates your family due to its clear wings that are outlined with a crisp orange color resembling stained-glass."

Costa Rica’s dry region of Guanacaste hosts the longest migration season of humpback whales during the year accounting for the pods traveling from the north between December and April or from the south between July and November. Nearer to the coastline, your guide can point to Olive Ridley turtles as they poke their heads out of the water as you pass. Eventually, you might notice a whale fin break the water’s surface, followed by the large head of a humpback slowly emerging. The whale can reach up to 52 feet long and is popular for its distinctive surface behaviors like leaping from the ocean. They migrate up to 16,000 miles each year feeding on krill and tiny fish populations. Viewing the whales in the wild is a memorable experience the family will share long after you return home from Costa Rica."

Your guide will show you the fermentation and seed-drying processes before you help roast the beans. Roasting the cocoa will release the familiar aroma of dark chocolate, and grinding the beans will produce a fine, powdery texture. Cooking the powder will turn the cocoa into cajuli, or liquid chocolate. You will be delighted by your first taste of pure, hot chocolate before finding a slight, bitter quality that tends to bite through the richness. You will also personalize the drink with your preferred flavors, adding sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, or marshmallows to the mixture until the drink contains your perfect blend of spice and sweetness.

Whether watching an artist detail a small oxcart with intense focus or caressing the complex features of a hand-carved rocking chair, Sarchi highlights the beautiful local artistic heritage."

        "description": "In the morning, the sound of howler monkeys will roar through the jungle canopy. The New World monkey lives in groups with up to 20 others and can call throughout the day as they communicate between their group with a territorial cry. After breakfast, the day is yours to enjoy the beauty of Costa Rica’s treasured Pacific coast and the charms of Costa Ballena at your leisure. The jungle reserve connected to your hotel boasts a stunning private, tiered waterfall where whales often swim past the powdery white sands of Punta Uvita Beach. Couples can also learn to paddleboard on the calm waters of the nearby Mangrove canals or enjoy the thrills of a whitewater rafting excursion on the Coto Brus River. Take to the skies on a stunning ziplining tour that allows you to stream through the rainforest canopy like a chestnut-mandible toucan. Sail above the forest floor and across valley streams connected by eight cable lines where the wind will brush against your cheek as you glide between platforms and watch the emerald leaves of the forest blur. Searching the canopy will reveal hidden treasures like feeding toucans, snacking on nuts, and observing resting, two-toed sloths clinging to the trees. The common Hoffman’s two-toed sloth has two heavy toes ending with long curved claws. They can grow up to 28 inches in length and move with slow, focused movements. This will be an excellent opportunity to take pictures and interact with these unique creatures. In the evening, you can relax in the romantic ambiance of your hotel with a couple’s spa treatment accentuating the splendors of the setting and the natural resources of the local landscape. The scent of jasmine and sea-salt fills the room for a relaxing atmosphere. You immediately feel soothed and more connected as a couple as your muscles unwind. The sporadic sounds of passing birds remind you of the tropical setting spreading in and around your opulent accommodations relieving the tension in your shoulders, neck, and back."

You will have another day at your leisure that allows you to bask in the sunlight alongside the infinity pool or venture out into the wilderness for another deep exploration of Costa Rica’s captivating biodiversity. Your guide will lead you away from the hotel for the day, eager to introduce you to the majesty of Corcovado National Park. The protected landscape overtakes nearly 40 percent of the Osa Peninsula, acting as a bastion for marvelous endangered wildlife such as the Baird’s tapir, giant anteater, and the world’s largest population of scarlet macaws. The trails winding through the jungle terrain highlight 164 square miles of one of the most cherished and diverse biomes on the planet. You will explore these trails under the supervision of an experienced guide who is incredibly knowledgeable about the region. Your guide may find a troop of spider monkeys running along the upper branches. The endangered species has a long, prehensile tail reaching 35 inches long which helps them balance in the trees, either when running through canopies, or dangling from vines. Continuing your expedition deep into the national park will also reveal the hiding place for a flock of scarlet macaws. These birds are famous for their stunning plumage that shines with red, yellow, and blue hues that also grow up to 32 inches long. You can hear their high-pitched throaty squawk, which can carry for miles when searching for a group. They scour the trees looking for fruits, nuts, and seeds but also gather around clay licks filled with sodium-packed dirt. Viewing the colorful and dynamic wildlife in their natural habitat can emphasize the natural charm of the region that is amplified by the romantic ambiance of your luxurious accommodations while giving you a taste of both the luscious jungle and the serene beaches that litter this majestic region."

Coffee plantations grow along the ridges of the mountains surrounding the Central Valley. A slight blue haze hovers above the thriving plants at over 5,575 feet above sea level where the crops cease to grow. The grandeur of former plantation moguls and the mansions in Barrio Amón symbolize elegant taste and highlight the natural wealth of the landscape found in Costa Rica. The neighborhood leads north and west of Plaza España and was constructed between the 19th and 20th centuries. Colorful, flower-clad walkways add layers of elegance to the art deco, concrete, and Victorian architecture supporting the arts center of the San Jose. Upon arrival, your private transfer greets you at Juan Santamaria International Airport and escorts you out of the Central Valley towards Arenal. The town of La Fortuna creates its own charm in the shadows of the Arenal Volcano. Spiny iguanas scramble through the bushes outside of the narrow streets and sloths linger in the trees that shade the creek. You pass through town for a view of the Arenal Volcano, which erupted from three separate craters in the 1960s. The sporadic clouds fade and offer a view of the perfect cone peak at more than 4,475 feet above sea level. The rainforest canopy clings to the edges of the road and turns the foothills of the marvelous volcano a shimmering emerald. You settle into the luxuries of your secluded resort celebrated for its gorgeous landscape and quiet ambiance. After spending time relaxing in your suite that provides a partial view of Arenal Volcano, you venture to nearby heated pools. The water trickles over the rocks, providing a soothing and serene atmosphere. Steam rises from the pools and rushing streams due to the temperature of the water that ranges from 72 to 105 degrees Fahrenheit. Consider reading some of our traveler's reviews for Costa Rica vacations to learn more about this exciting experience."

        "description": "Sunlight spreads across the rainforest canopy and brings the sounds of wildlife to the resort. Howler monkeys groan in the refreshing cool of the early light. Their deep, guttural calls make you think of wildcats or dinosaurs instead of monkeys. The sound of their calls echoes for up to three miles and connotes the territory of a particular troop. Your resort, Montaña De Fuego, offers several \"enjoy the moment\" activities celebrating this beautiful morning. These activities include a morning guided bird-watching session, an indigenous Malaku culture experience, and a tour of the on-site farm, where children may collect chicken eggs and learn about farm animals. After your morning activity, your guide will escort you from the hotel lobby to the mystical hanging bridges and walkways for an unrivaled perspective of the rainforest. You will travel over 15 suspension bridges taking in the herbaceous aroma that emanates from the trees and the scent of jasmine that blends with the spicy musk of fern trees. The loud chirp of a keel-billed toucan draws your attention. The bird’s yellow breast is striking as it stands in contrast to the emerald leaves and dark branches. Seeing a toucan in the wild is thrilling, from the unique, drawn-out caw to the rainbow of tropical colors featured on their beaks. For the first time, you notice that the toucan’s feet are light blue, matching the small streak on the bottom of their chins. The exhilaration of walking along a suspension bridge never wanes and only increases with the wildlife you find coursing through the canopy. White-headed capuchin monkeys graze on nuts and berries, utilizing their prehensile tail to help balance as they reach the far branches. After wandering through the vibrant rainforest, you return to your resort for some relaxation."

You find subtle notes of almond and tangerine accompanying the delicious sweetness of fresh pineapple and passion fruit. After the meal, you set out with your guide on a canyoning adventure and into the depths of the rainforest around Arenal. This exciting excursion is wildly different from the calm walk that you took through the treetops the previous day. A 4x4 jeep takes you on a rough track surrounded by dense trees and a small slope. Your guide offers insight into the types of animals most often found in the forest, including deer, tapir, and the occasional jaguar. Parrots squawk in the treetops, and you can hear the rushing water of a nearby cascade. After an in-depth tutorial on the safety measures of your excursion, your guide fits you into the harness and lets you lean back against the edges of a cliff. The waterfall you heard before now trundles over the precipice beside you at 150 feet. You imitate the motion of your guide pressing your feet into the solid rock face and propelling your body away, gliding closer to the ground. Mist from the waterfall coats your cheeks and is refreshingly cool in the tropical heat. You arrive at the bottom of the canyon and step into the rushing river to continue your active exploration of the scenery. Watercourses over your legs and the pebbled riverbed undulates beneath your feet. You slide down a rock that has been smoothed naturally over time as the water rushes over the landscape. After the fun of your extreme experience, your private transfer escorts you into the mountains at Monteverde to experience the wonders of the Cloud Forest. Your resort offers a cozy, luxurious ambiance into which you easily settle.

The moisture from the clouds leaves dew in the canopy and along the forest underbrush where moss coats the branches, grounds, and fallen logs. Instead of feeding off of rain, the local greenery feeds off the clouds, showcasing one angle of Costa Rica’s fascinating biodiversity. The clouds dissipate before breakfast, and your guide greets you at the hotel before escorting you into the Cloud Forest and Biological Reserve to follow the trails that wind through the more than 40 square miles of protected landscape. The cool temperature is a striking difference from the tropical warmth you felt at Arenal. Along the trail, your guide explains that Monteverde contains two and a half percent of the world’s biodiversity, with Costa Rica housing an astounding five percent, though it only represents one one-hundredth of the world’s landmass. Your guide excitedly points to fresh jaguar tracks near the base of a tree. The day is filled with fascinating birdcalls, and you strain in your attempt to identify which of the region’s 400 different species you are hearing. Follow your guide in search of the resplendent quetzal, a rare bird returning in numbers to the cooler climates of Costa Rica’s cloud forests. The males are known for their ruby-red breast and the iridescent green plumage along their backs and wings. Their tails grow long and delicate like streamers, reaching up to three feet in length. You reach a secluded portion of the trail and find the dangling feathers of a quetzal, leading upwards to the male bird perching on a quiet branch and shining in the sunlight."

After breakfast, you return to the treetops for a zip line excursion, eager to feel the wind against your cheeks and to delight in the views over the dew-filled trees. You travel to Selvatura Park, a conservation area encompassing 1,200 acres. You step into the trees ready to glide along more than 2 miles on 15 separate cables. The sounds of nature abound with the short bursting call of the orange-bellied trogon. You keep your eyes peeled for a fiery-billed aracari, a type of toucan known for its gorgeous bill that shimmers with red and orange, and a bright yellow and crimson underbelly that shines against the trees. After soaring through the sky, you spend some time in the hummingbird garden, taking a peaceful walk amongst the fluttering wings and colorful plumage. The magnificent hummingbirds grow to five and a half inches long and look dark until the sunlight catches flashes of bronze, green, and violet feathers. Your private transfer escorts you down the mountainside of Monteverde, and west toward the Pacific.

Your guide leads you from the hotel lobby to the banks of the mangrove forest. Canals wind along the protruding roots of the riverine trees where the salt and fresh waters converge. The trees have evolved by filtering the saltwater from their systems in order to thrive in this unusual ecosystem while also helping to keep the soil from eroding. You step into a kayak and float up the river in search of the fascinating wildlife that inhabits Costa Rica’s smallest national park. Manuel Antonio comprises three square miles of protected land where you will listen to the tranquil sounds of the forest as the water drips from your paddle into the still canal. White-headed capuchins ramble through the branches and your guide points to a small crocodile resting in the sunlight on the banks. A vine above the water suddenly moves, and you realize the thick body belongs to a boa constrictor that you have startled with your arrival. Snowy egrets stand out with pristine white plumage that glows against the surrounding greenery and brown underbrush. They graze on the marshy banks in search of insects or crabs, and as you get closer to the estuary, your guide points into the water at sponges and oysters. Baby black-tipped sharks swim in the transparent canals close to the mouth of the ocean.

Cliffs rise against the edge of the placid water texturing your view of the landscape. The water contains an inviting warmth with a slight salty aroma. When the boat stops you can jump into the sea and look at the coral making its home on the ocean floor. Schools of yellow-tailed surgeonfish wade through the bright water. Butterfly fish swim with the elegant coloring of butterfly wings. As the sun begins to set you find the splendor of the horizon burning with rich and enchanting brightness.

A private vehicle will bring you to the shores of Lake Arenal, where you will board a private boat for a stunning crossing of Costa Rica’s largest lake, with magnificent views of the Arenal Volcano on a clear day. You'll feel the warmth of the tropical sun on your skin as you watch its majestic cone mirrored on the sparkling, deep-blue water. As you make your ascent, the air grows cool and damp, carrying the fresh scent of rich earth as the vegetation transforms into a tangled, emerald world of dripping mosses and giant ferns. Back at your hotel, your room opens up to the sounds and sights of the forest, offering a chance to unwind on a private terrace overlooking the misty canopy or explore the hotel's nature paths. In the evening, you will embark on a thrilling guided walk, discovering the unique nocturnal creatures of this high-altitude ecosystem."

        "description": "Spend your morning on a private guided hike in the world-renowned Monteverde Cloud Forest Preserve, a sanctuary of biodiversity. Your guide will help you navigate the misty, moss-draped trails, searching for the forest’s most prized resident, the resplendent quetzal. It’s a bird of almost mythical beauty, with iridescent emerald plumage and a long, flowing tail. In the afternoon, immerse yourself in the flavors of the region with a coffee, chocolate, and sugar cane adventure. This hands-on tour takes you through the entire process, from seeing the ripe coffee cherries on the plant to learning about the fermentation of cacao. Smell the rich aroma of roasting beans and taste the sweet juice of freshly milled sugar cane for an authentic taste of Monteverde’s agricultural heritage."

        "description": "Today you will journey from the cool mountain air of the cloud forest to the warm, sun-kissed Pacific coast of Manuel Antonio. During your private land transfer, you will stop for an exciting adventure. Board a private safari boat for a tour of the Tárcoles River, famous for its massive American crocodiles. Your expert captain will skillfully guide the boat close to the muddy banks, pointing out what at first look like fallen logs, until a slow blink or a massive, toothy yawn reveals a colossal crocodile basking just feet away. You'll be close enough to appreciate the texture of their ancient, armored skin and feel the thrill of their powerful presence. The river is also a haven for birdlife, offering chances to spot scarlet macaws, herons, and kingfishers. After lunch, you will continue to your luxurious hotel in Manuel Antonio, arriving in time to witness a spectacular sunset over the Pacific Ocean. This is the perfect moment to find a comfortable seat on your private terrace, perhaps with a cool drink in hand, and simply let the soothing sound of the waves wash over you as the sky ignites in a fiery spectacle."

Follow your private guide down a lush rainforest trail, where dappled sunlight filters through the canopy and the air is thick with the scent of life. Their trained eyes will help you spot the hidden wonders: a sloth hanging motionless like a part of the tree, the flash of a colorful iguana in the undergrowth, and the antics of white-faced monkeys chattering overhead. The path ends in a breathtaking reveal, as the forest parts to show one of Costa Rica's most beautiful beaches, its white sands kissed by the brilliant blue Pacific. The afternoon invites a different kind of immersion. Trade the quiet observation of the jungle for the exhilarating energy of the ocean with a private surf lesson. Feel the warm Pacific water and the buoyant strength of the surfboard beneath you. It’s a playful way of learning to read the ocean's cues, paddling to meet a wave, and feeling that incredible surge of power as you rise to your feet, connecting with Costa Rica's legendary beach culture."

You’ll paddle a sea kayak along a coastline of dramatic cliffs and secret coves, a perspective of the park inaccessible from shore. Then, you'll slip into the world beneath the waves. In the tranquil waters of Biesanz Bay, you’ll don a snorkel mask to find the silent, vibrant life of the coral reef, swimming amidst schools of colorful tropical fish. As your day seems to close, one final world awaits. After sunset, venture back into the rainforest, where the narrow beam of your flashlight will reveal the shy, secret life of the jungle after dark, an entirely new cast of creatures that only emerges once the sun has set."

This is not a place of bustle, but it is a low-slung capital that is easy to explore on foot in addition to being very safe for families. The historic center and oldest neighborhoods of San Jose can prove extremely relaxing places to ease into Costa Rica and to make first impressions of the country. After landing at the country’s major international airport, you will be met by a local guide and transferred to a luxurious boutique hotel in the city’s center. Your guide will discuss different options in San Jose, so you can plan the afternoon based on your energy and interests. By indulging in a stroll through the city center, you can admire wonderful 19th-century mansions and a string of plazas that have been enlivened by street traders and locals. There’s an exotic atmosphere here, and it is easy to see that you have landed in a place very different from home. San Jose is also symbolic of the country as it is safe, welcoming, and easy to feel at home.

It seems inaccessible because it appears like a magnificent cone too steep or fierce to explore. On the contrary, Poas is Costa Rica’s most accessible volcano because a drivable road ascends to the summit. This means that your family can discover a very active volcanic crater in all its glory without needing to spend a full day hiking up steep slopes. After a relaxed morning, your local guide will lead you to Poas Volcano National Park for an afternoon around the summit. Mud pools may bubble magically, gasses will hiss, and steam will likely float around the crater rim. You will be able to smell the sulfur as it seeps from the caldera. This will be an experience that highlights the grandeur of volcanos, which will impress everyone with the Earth’s raw power. Various hiking trails can lead you around or down the volcano, so there are options to hike if you wish. You can also just enjoy the summit before driving back to San Jose for another laid-back evening in the city’s old-world core."

It will be just over two hours to La Fortuna, and Arenal volcano will provide you with a compass point, guiding you into the country’s infamous destination. Once you arrive, you can check-in early to one of Costa Rica’s most iconic resorts before meeting your private guide to plan out the next three days. Arenal is known as Costa Rica’s adventure hub, but it is an extremely laid-back destination at heart, especially when you can utilize private hot springs and thermal pools at your resort. Your next destination of Monteverde will provide you with a more wilderness type atmosphere. La Fortuna is great for families because there is a choice regarding what you can do without needing to go beyond your comfort zone. The town is packed with small restaurants and cafes, so there is also a wide variety of places to dine and things to do during the evenings.

        "description": "Ziplining is the iconic adventure in Arenal because the area has some of the coolest and highest ziplines on the planet. Most kids love it although you should note that the minimum height for this activity is 1.20 meters. Children aged 6 to 12 are harnessed in with an instructor and go tandem ziplining. Anyone older can safely sip through the trees by themselves. Lines will lead you across green valleys and high above the treetops with a stunning volcano that rises in the distance. After a short introductory line, you can travel through the area on a series of 12 different lines, each one with a different view of the volcano and forest. A sky tram and skywalk will also be a part of your half-day experience. Arenal is the best place in Costa Rica for family ziplining. Therefore, it is virtually a must-do during your three days in La Fortuna. The rest of the time can be relaxed or active. You should consider a visit to a wildlife sanctuary, where sloths and monkeys create excitement and enchantment. You can also go kayaking or indulge in a boat tour on Lake Arenal. Easy hiking trails can lead you to small waterfalls and a sense of forest serenity. Afterward, you can rest in the natural hot springs and feel the allure of nature’s therapeutic powers."

        "description": "Traveling to Monteverde is quite an adventure by water and by road. After leaving the resort, you will travel around the volcano before taking a private boat across Lake Arenal. This journey will position you in the midst of nature with a volcano reflecting in the water and clouds hanging lazily in the forests. You will then move to the road, where you will zigzag higher into the clouds with stops to search for unusual birds and monkeys. Sometimes, Monteverde reflects its cloud forest name. It is mystical and magical, and the journey will lead you in and out of the clouds. At other times, the views will be completely clear, so you can catch glimpses of the Pacific Ocean in the distance. La Fortuna has all the amenities and options you would expect from a popular tourist town. The experience will be different in Monteverde, where you will be staying at an all-inclusive wilderness lodge. At your lodge, there is an incredible amount of space for your kids to explore in nature. For three days, you will not see many other people as you hideaway in this untouched corner of Costa Rica. Hiking trails start directly from the lodge grounds, and you may even hear monkeys howling in the night. These three days will be an escape into Costa Rican nature and will be complete with colorful birds and mist-shrouded sunsets from your private balcony."

        "description": "Over 100 mammals and more than 200 different birds occupy Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve. The trees rise high as they cling to mountain slopes, and mist sometimes swirls, adding to the enchantment. It may feel like a lost wilderness, but Monteverde is very accessible for children of all ages. Hanging bridges connect the treetops, and some of them are 800 feet in length. They are also very safe, and even toddlers can walk on them. A morning or afternoon on the hanging bridges will prove to be a unique opportunity for your family to explore and enjoy the forest. It is also an activity that is usually best done in the morning, so you can really savor the wow factor before exploring Monteverde’s details. Your expert guide will also lead you along the forest floor in search of different monkeys and birds. Quetzals are only one of the endangered birds that can be encountered here. If you are lucky, your kids will be able to identify three different monkey species. If the skies are clear, then it will be worth taking the sky tram to the top of the forest. If it is not clear, then the wildlife walks will be an excellent option because you can usually get closer to animals when it is misty. On one of the days, you will also partake a nighttime wildlife walk, which will prove to be a surreal experience in search of nocturnal life. Aromas and sounds will guide you through the darkness, and you can never predict what you may encounter."

        "description": "Monteverde is a wild place. The animals are wild, and you cannot get too close. You cannot even predict what you will encounter, which is different from a wildlife sanctuary, where rehabilitated animals mean more close-up experiences and guaranteed encounters. En route to Tamarindo, you will stop at a small sloth sanctuary, which will be the ideal place to learn about these strange creatures and what can be done to ensure their survival. As they hang from trees, you can watch your children as they peer into the weird and wonderful world of an animal that is not found at home. Monkeys are other residents of the sanctuary, so if you are yet to see howlers or capuchins, this will be the morning to fill any gaps. After lunch and tasting at an organic cacao farm, you will continue to Tamarindo, which is a pristine beach town on the Pacific coast. Your family resort is perched on the sand with barefoot access to the beach that possesses relatively calm waters. A number of other beaches and bays can be visited nearby, including some that are ideal for beginners who are learning to surf. Pacific escapism will be the essence for the next three days with lazy days on the sand and plenty of space for your children to burn some energy. The small town has some excellent dining options, and you can also dine at the resort’s restaurant, which has a very diverse and family-friendly menu."

This is one of the best places in Central America for learning to surf, and you are never too old to learn, even if this may be an activity more suitable for your kids. Surf instruction programs can be two hours in the water with a private instructor or a two-day course with morning and afternoon surf sessions. Surfing may mean that you spend some quiet time reading a book on the beach, while the experienced surfers in your family paddle out to the waves in the wider Tamarindo area. Other than the sea and the surf, there is not too much to do here, which is part of the appeal. Your local guide can lead you to beaches along the coast, so you will not be restricted to the quiet sand on your doorstep. Wildlife refuges and sanctuaries can also be found nearby, which add a little monkey magic to your experience. Three days on the coast will also complete your journey through Costa Rica’s classic landscapes. After the city, volcano, and cloud forest, you will now be bathing in the sunshine as the Pacific waves slowly lap against the shore."

Before this flight route, it was too long of a drive to include both destinations in two weeks. Now, you can wake up this morning, enjoy a leisurely breakfast, fly 40 minutes, and find yourself surrounded by wildlife. You will touch down, and a local guide will transfer you to your beachfront resort, where you will spend the final two days enjoying similar Pacific pleasures to those in Tamarindo. The Manuel Antonio experience is not just about the coast. This is Costa Rica’s smallest yet most biodiverse national park, and it is home to a staggering variety of flora and fauna. It is remarkable how much coexists in such a small and accessible space, which is something that you will discover when your private guide leads you along the forest trails. Monkey troops will swing by, causing you to stop and gasp, sloths will cling onto the trees, and bizarre iguanas will walk across the trails. You can spend two hours immersed in it all, and suddenly, the trail will open to the beach for a completely different kind of bliss."

It is very much a destination for hopping between highlights, so it is ideal as a final stop after you have experienced the wildlife and wilderness of the rest of the country. Your children can still be excited by the encounters, and you will not need to spend hours searching through the forest. You should note that the park does get busy with other visitors, so it does not have the same feel as elsewhere in the country. Today will be completely flexible, so you can venture on a self-guided walk in the national park or stick to the Pacific coastline for a final day in the sun. Around the late afternoon, you will set sail onto the ocean to enjoy a Costa Rican sunset with sundowners. With the wind whizzing past, it will be an idyllic way to culminate your vacation and complete your two weeks in Costa Rica. Your captain will provide your children with the opportunity to steer the boat and can teach them about sails and knots.
