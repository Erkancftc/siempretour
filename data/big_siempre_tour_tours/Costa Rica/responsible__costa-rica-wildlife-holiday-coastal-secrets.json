  "generalInfo": "This two-week Costa Rica wildlife holiday, travelling with a small group and expert wildlife leader, takes you from one stunning Costa Rican coast to the other, with a cornucopia of creatures in between. Even though it is a small country, it is bursting with biodiversity, and this trip covers many of its most beautiful spots, visiting national parks, cloud forests and islands. <br/><br/>It is also superbly set up for tourism, allowing us to stay in small and locally owned accommodation along the way, from ecolodges located in tropical gardens to a waterfront accommodation on the Osa Peninsula only accessible by boat. <br/><br/>The trip starts inland, in the capital San Jose and then, using private minibus, we head to the Caribbean Coast to explore two amazing national parks, with two days in each. First, we go to Tortuguero National Park, which we travel through by boat as this is the only way to access it and see its eponymous turtles, otters, caiman and manatees. On land, we hope to see monkeys, caiman, iguanas, butterflies and myriad birdlife. From here to Cahuita National Park, where you can hike on trails that dip in and out of coast and jungle, or take an optional snorkelling trip out on the reef. One more inland idyll before hitting the Pacific coast is Savegre Cloud Forest, where we have two nights to enjoy, in particular, its extraordinary birdlife. The forest is most famous for being home to the elusive and exquisite resplendent quetzal. <br/><br/>There are few things more resplendent, however, than the final few days of this trip which are spent on the Osa Peninsula and Corcovado National Park. This is home to about 50 percent of Costa Rica’s incredible wildlife, from scarlet macaws to manatees, tayras to tapirs. We take a trip to Caño Island, where we hope to see dolphins and, in season, humpback or even orca whales. The former come here between July-November and the latter December-April. Osa Peninsula is one of the best ways to end a wildlife holiday, with plenty of beach time too so that you can chill out before your return home. <br/>",

      "description": "Our adventure begins early this morning, leaving San Jose behind as we travel to Tortuguero National Park in northeast Costa Rica. Accessible only by boat or light aircraft, Tortuguero has a vast network of waterways, canals and swamps that are remarkably tranquil, unspoilt and devoid of noise pollution. On reaching the pier, we board a small motorboat for the journey to our lodge (up to 1hr 30min) , which is a short distance from the main lagoon. Please note the transfer from San José to Tortuguero is not private for our groups. This afternoon your tour leader will host the main welcome briefing when we gather as a group to get to know each other and learn more about the adventures ahead. We also visit Tortuguero village, where it’s possible to enter the Sea Turtle Museum (a donation is requested at the entrance). Tortuguero is probably most famous as a nesting site for the endangered green turtle, which can be seen coming ashore to lay eggs from late July to October (as part of an optional excursion). Hawksbill, loggerhead, and giant leatherback turtles also nest in this region, and from late August through to November, baby turtles hatch and make their way to the ocean. Today's travel time will be in the region of six hours including a stop for breakfast. Accommodation: Aninga Lodge/Evergreen Lodge (or similar)"

In the morning wildlife is usually at its most active and with the help of our expert guide we are likely to encounter monkeys, caiman, iguanas, butterflies and many of the 300-plus bird species recorded here. We’ll take a second boat trip this afternoon or you can relax at the lodge and enjoy the facilities. Accommodation: Aninga Lodge/Evergreen Lodge (or similar)"

Our bus will be at the pier waiting to drive us to the Cahuita region on the Caribbean coast, where we check into our hotel. Caribbean culture pervades this part of Costa Rica and is reflected in the music, food and laid-back lifestyle. The white-sand beach here is fringed by tall palms, behind which is the dense, wet tropical forest of Cahuita National Park. Accommodation: Ciudad Perdida (or similar)"

Today we visit the national park, taking a walk that follows the coastline through rainforest and past impressive Caribbean beaches. Although fairly small in size, there is plenty of diversity in the park. The rest of the afternoon is yours to explore the beach, join an optional snorkelling excursion (subject to local conditions) or simply relax. Accommodation: Ciudad Perdida (or similar)"

      "description": "Our next destination is Turrialba Valley, a rich agricultural region in the Central Highlands. The topography of this region is mountainous, with waterfalls, rivers and caves – the varied elevation supports a wide range of plants (including orchids, bromeliads, lichens and mosses) and animals (including anteaters, ocelots and tapirs). In the afternoon, enjoy a guided tour around Aquiares, one of the most prominent coffee estates in Costa Rica. Of course, you’ll learn about the coffee-making process and taste the final product, but the tour also reveals how the Aquiares team is putting a strong emphasis on sustainability by reducing their carbon footprint and supporting the local community.

Our visit includes a guided walk in the Dr Jorge León Arguedas Botanical Garden, during which we will see and learn about the approximately 400 different species that are observed and interpreted here, as well as receive an explanation of myriad exotic fruits that are found at the facility. After lunch, we continue to San Gerardo de Dota and Savegre Valley Cloud Forest. This is said to be one of the best places in Costa Rica to see the beautiful, colourful and notoriously shy resplendent quetzal and we have two nights here to discover the region. These endangered birds rely on the cloud forest for their habitat; the males are particularly striking with a green crest, red breast and tail feathers that can reach a metre in length. A good pair of binoculars will be helpful for quetzal spotting as these birds camouflage themselves well among the wet leaves. After lunch, we take a short walk into the cloud forest.

      "description": "Early in the morning, our journey continues towards the small town of Sierpe, where we board a small motorboat to Drake Bay on the Osa Peninsula. Passing the huge mangrove swamps that line the Sierpe River, our boat crosses the ocean before arriving at Drake Bay. This region is very remote and with extremely limited road access, which means most supplies, visitors and locals, must arrive by boat. Getting here is part of the adventure. The bay is spectacular, with just a handful of lodges on the horizon and the rest thick verdant forest and rocky coves as far as the eye can see. Our next three nights will be spent at the Drake Bay Wilderness Resort, a family-run property close to the 'town' of Drake Bay and with ocean views from every corner.

      "description": "December to August (drier months) This morning, we board a small boat towards Caño Island. During this 45-minute boat ride, there may be opportunities to spot migrating whales or playful dolphins (orca are occasionally spotted here between December to April and humpbacks might be seen in July and August). Marine life is the biggest highlight of this area, with hawksbill and olive ridley turtles, manta rays and white-tipped reef sharks just some of the likely encounters on today’s snorkelling excursion. This area has been rated as having some of the best snorkelling in Costa Rica, with a huge marine diversity living in the protected reef (visibility subject to weather conditions). On returning to Drake Bay, we enjoy lunch then embark on a 1mi (1.5km) walk to Cocalito Beach. Wildlife including iguanas, macaws and toucans are often spotted along the route, and elusive tapirs are also seen less frequently. There is time to rest on the golden sands and take in the secluded beauty of Cocalito before returning to the hotel. September to November (wetter months) Today we visit a community rural tourism project that has developed to protect the area's flora and fauna, and provide an economic benefit to the local people. We start the day with a short boat ride to the village of Drake Bay then take a 30-minute transfer to Finca Paz y Flora, home to many bird species who are attracted by the resplendent gardens. We walk on the Trillo de la Danta, or Tapir's Trail, within a primary tropical forest. Keep an eye out for collared peccaries, agouti, monkeys and shy tapirs. Towards the end of the walk, we reach a scenic waterfall where it's possible to cool off with a dip in the clear waters. We enjoy a traditional lunch served in banana leaves before returning to our hotel. Accommodation: Drake Bay Wilderness Resort (or similar)"

      "description": "When National Geographic describes an area as “the most biologically intense place on Earth,” it must be worthy of investigation. This morning, we board a small boat for a 30-minute journey to San Pedrillo Ranger Station, our entrance point to Corcovado National Park. This is undoubtedly the most secluded and tranquil region in Costa Rica. Protecting around one-third of the Osa Peninsula (some 164sqmi/425sqkm), Corcovado is the largest national park in Costa Rica and encompasses 13 major ecosystems across various elevations, with montane forest, cloud forest, fresh water and mangrove swamps among them. Scientists have recorded half of all the species in Costa Rica on this peninsula alone. On today's hike along the parks trails, we may see all four monkey species in Costa Rica (squirrel, howler, white-faced capuchin and spider), tamandua (anteaters), two- and three-toed sloths, peccary, tapirs (including the endangered Baird’s tapir) and many reptiles, insects and amphibians. Puma and jaguar also prowl this area, but are very difficult to see. With more than 500 tree species, the bird count stands at an impressive 365 and the park protects the largest population of scarlet macaws in the country, which can frequently be seen and heard flying overhead. In October, when the national park is closed, we typically visit El Camino de la Danta, a wildlife-rich trail home to white-faced monkeys, scarlet macaws, toucans and more.

Delving into the network of tributary rivers and streams offers a chance to learn more about the role of mangroves in the ecosystem and the numerous creatures that depend on them, including fish, crabs, birds, molluscs and shellfish. In Sierpe town, we transfer to our private minibus and commence our journey to San José.

      "description": "Begin with a trip to Irazu Volcano National Park in the Cartago province, located within the Central Mountain Range around a 90-minute journey from San José. Passing different vegetation, we drive towards the summit and then follow a path that leads to a wonderful view across the huge crater. Irazu is one of the most active volcanoes in Costa Rica, though it has recently entered a dormant phase – a relief to the farmers and property owners who make their living on the fertile slopes. On a clear day, you can see both the Caribbean and Pacific coastlines from the summit. Remember to bring a jacket as it can be windy and cold at the viewpoint of this elevation (Irazu summit is 11,260ft/3,432m high). After, we continue to Cartago city, home to a spectacular domed basilica, where we have lunch. It’s then back to San José, where we visit Avenida Central and explore the main city highlights. We stop at the Central Market, a lively and traditional space where you can find a variety of local goods, including souvenirs, handicrafts, coffee, and typical Costa Rican snacks – a great spot to pick up gifts.
