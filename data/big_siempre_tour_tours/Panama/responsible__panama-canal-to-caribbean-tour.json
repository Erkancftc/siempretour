      "description": "Stories of Two Cities and the Panama Canal - The journey begins with an immersive exploration of Panama City, a capital defined by contrast and connection. We start with a visit to the evocative ruins of Panamá Viejo, the original city founded in 1519 and later destroyed by the infamous pirate Henry Morgan. Here, among the stone walls and cathedral remnants we begin to understand Panama’s origins as a critical junction of trade and empire. The narrative continues in Casco Viejo, the “new” colonial city founded after the destruction of the first. The intertwining stories of these two cities reflect the resilience and strategic importance of Panama through the centuries. We visit the Mola Museum, showcasing the intricate textile art of the Guna women; the beautifully curated Panama Canal Museum, housed in the former headquarters of the French and American canal builders; and the boutique Cacao and Chocolate Museum at Casa Coronel, which celebrates Panama’s growing artisanal chocolate culture. After lunch at a local restaurant, the journey continues to the Panama Canal Visitors Center at Miraflores Locks. From the observation terraces, witness massive ships navigating the narrow locks and gain a deeper appreciation for the engineering marvel that reshaped world trade. The day concludes with dinner at a carefully selected restaurant, offering local cuisine in a warm setting. Overnight at Central Hotel Panama or similar (BLD)"

      "description": "The Emberá People and Fort San Lorenzo - An unforgettable day unfolds with a cultural and historical expedition to the Caribbean side of the isthmus. Traveling north, we reache the banks of the Gatun River where dugout canoes await to take you into the forest and toward an Emberá community. Nestled in a remote setting, the village offers a rare opportunity to engage with Panama’s indigenous heritage. The Emberá proudly share their traditions, music, dances, and cosmology, as well as insights into their craftsmanship and connection to the land. Enjoy a traditional lunch is prepared by the community. The adventure continues to Fort San Lorenzo, dramatically perched above the mouth of the Chagres River where it meets the Caribbean Sea. This UNESCO World Heritage Site, once a key defense point for the Spanish Crown, echoes with tales of pirates, conquests, and gold-laden galleons. Surrounded by tropical forest and history, it is a place where nature and empire collide. After returning to the city, the day ends with dinner at a local restaurant.

      "description": "From the Pacific Coast to the Highlands - After an early breakfast, head to the airport for a short flight to David, the capital of Chiriquí province. Upon arrival, the journey continues to the Gulf of Chiriquí National Park, a protected marine wonderland scattered with lush islands and coral reefs. A boat excursion reveals the area’s vibrant biodiversity with opportunities to snorkel in crystal-clear waters, paddle along quiet mangrove-lined coasts, and spot marine life from the boat. A picnic-style lunch is served on one of the secluded beaches, offering a true taste of tropical serenity. In the afternoon travel to Boquete, a picturesque mountain town on the foothills of Volcán Barú. Known for its cool climate, cloud forests, and world-class coffee, Boquete provides a stunning contrast to the coast. The road climbs steadily into the highlands, passing rolling green hills and dramatic ridges until arriving at the lodge nestled in nature.

      "description": "Hanging Bridges, Coffee & Rum: A Day in the Highlands - The cool mountain air and misty forest canopy set the stage for a morning of discovery in Boquete’s cloud forest reserve. Suspended walkways and well-maintained forest trails offer a gentle but immersive way to explore the highland ecosystem. As we move through the treetops on a series of hanging bridges, witness the interplay of light and foliage and may catch glimpses of hummingbirds, toucans, or even the elusive resplendent quetzal among the bromeliads and moss-draped trees. Those with a taste for adrenaline may choose to replace the forest walk with an optional zipline adventure through the canopy. Later in the day, the focus turns to one of Panama’s most prized exports: coffee. A local finca opens its doors for a behind-the-scenes experience of specialty coffee production from the growing of high-altitude beans to their harvest, roasting, and final tasting. The aromas, techniques, and passion of the producers elevate this from a simple visit to a sensory journey. As the sun begins to dip behind the hills, enjoy a distinctly Panamanian rum experience where you will sample artisan rums and learn about the unique sugarcane heritage of the region. Lunch and dinner are enjoyed on-site, in the quiet comfort of the mountain lodge. Overnight at Boquete Tree Trek Lodge or similar (BLD)"

      "description": "La Amistad International Park and the Charm of Boquete - Today, we head into La Amistad International Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site shared by Panama and Costa Rica. This vast transboundary reserve protects one of the most biodiverse and pristine highland habitats in Central America. With local guides leading the way, follow trails that wind through mist-laden forests where cascading waterfalls and birdsong accompany each step. The area is a haven for birdwatchers, nature photographers, and anyone who appreciates raw, untouched landscapes. After a morning immersed in nature, returns to Boquete to explore the town’s colorful streets, artisan shops, and flower-filled gardens. There’s time to take in the relaxed rhythm of local life and perhaps sip a cup of freshly brewed geisha coffee at a café. Lunch is served at a local restaurant, while dinner back at the hotel caps off this full and varied day. Overnight at Boquete Tree Trek Lodge or similar (BLD)"

      "description": "Across the Continental Divide to Bocas del Toro - The journey eastward from Boquete to the Caribbean begins early, tracing one of Central America’s most scenic overland routes. As the road climbs through the Cordillera Central, breathtaking views unfold - cloud forests giving way to alpine meadows, then descending into lush tropical lowlands. The transition from one side of the continental divide to the other is as dramatic in scenery as it is in climate. The final stretch takes us to the port town of Almirante, where water taxis await. Crossing the tranquil waters of Almirante Bay, we arrive at Isla Colón, the lively heart of the Bocas del Toro archipelago. This Caribbean outpost is known for its laid-back energy, vibrant Afro-Caribbean culture, and rich natural beauty. After checking in to the hotel, there’s time to settle in and enjoy dinner at a local restaurant, where fresh seafood and tropical flavors take center stage.

      "description": "Coral Reefs, Mangroves and the Ngäbe-Buglé People - The morning begins on the water, weaving through turquoise channels and tangled mangrove forests that frame Bocas del Toro’s marine paradise. With masks and snorkels on hand, the group explores vibrant coral reefs teeming with life — tropical fish darting between sea fans and brain corals in warm, shallow water. Between snorkeling sites, the boat glides past islands fringed with coconut palms and echoing with bird calls. Later, the focus shifts inland with a visit to a Ngäbe-Buglé community, where we are welcomed with hospitality and pride. The encounter offers a meaningful window into the traditions, social structure, and crafts of one of Panama’s most populous Indigenous groups. It’s a respectful cultural exchange that balances observation and participation. Meals today are enjoyed at local restaurants in the island town, which by now feels like a home base within the archipelago. Overnight at Palma Royale Hotel or similar (BLD)"

      "description": "Nature and Relaxation in Bastimentos Marine National Park - A short boat ride takes us to Bastimentos Island, home to a national marine park that protects a remarkable range of coastal ecosystems. The day unfolds at a relaxed pace, blending beach time with nature walks through coastal rainforest trails. Whether watching for sloths and red frogs in the forest or simply enjoying the rhythmic lapping of waves on a golden-sand beach, this is a day to slow down and appreciate the unspoiled beauty of Panama’s Caribbean coast. Lunch and dinner are again taken at local restaurants, where the flavors of the sea mingle with Caribbean spices. The day concludes with a gentle return to Isla Colón, under skies often filled with stars and the soft glow of the moon on the water. Overnight at Palma Royale Hotel or similar (BLD)"

      "description": "Forest Canopy and Iconic Architecture - The last full day in Panama begins with a nature-focused experience just outside the capital. At Soberanía National Park, the group walks the trails of the rainforest in search of toucans, monkeys, and perhaps even a sloth hidden in the canopy. The journey includes a stop at the Rainforest Discovery Center, where an observation tower rises above the treetops for panoramic views and excellent birdwatching. This final immersion in Panama’s biodiversity is as rewarding as it is refreshing. In the afternoon, visit the Biomuseo, an architectural landmark designed by Frank Gehry, dramatically situated on the Amador Causeway. Inside, the museum’s engaging exhibits reveal how the rise of the isthmus shaped the planet’s climate, species, and human history. As night falls, enjoy a farewell dinner at one of Panama City’s best local fare restaurants, where stories and highlights of the trip are shared among new friends.
