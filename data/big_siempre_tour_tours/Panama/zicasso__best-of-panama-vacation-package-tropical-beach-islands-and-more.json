Enjoy the view of treetops among the variety of hanging bridges connecting the trails and search for the sulfur-winged parakeets or dozens of hummingbird species known to feed heavily on the blossoming flowers. After embracing the treetops, you have the option of indulging in the local tastes of coffee with a plantation tour, learning how the volcanic soil and temperate climate impact the flavor as your guide takes you through the growing and roasting techniques before offering a sample that may result in fruity notes of berry, citrus, and mango."
