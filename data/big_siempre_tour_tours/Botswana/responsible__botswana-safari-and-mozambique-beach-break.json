  "generalInfo": "Fabulous barely scratches the surface of this tailor made fortnight in Botswana and Mozambique. Starting from Victoria Falls you’ll fly to both of Botswana’s wildlife abundant hot spots - the Okavango Delta and Chobe National Park – before departing for a beach break on the Indian Ocean.<br/><br/>Luxurious and absolutely unforgettable, this two week safari and beach tour promises the best of all worlds with canoe rides, game drives and guided bush walks adding to the adventure of exploring in southern Africa.<br/><br/>From lions and leopards to elephants and buffalos, animal encounters will come thick and fast with views from above just as incredible as what you’ll experience on the ground. Light aircraft transfers not only promise aerial awesomeness but also provide an efficient means of covering long distances. This means more time for wildlife watching activities in a series of different locations. <br/><br/>Your accommodation, too, is situated in some exceptional areas to watch animals with traditional safari lodges, luxury tented camps and chalets built from reeds all inviting a warm welcome as well as a good night’s rest.<br/><br/>Completing the Botswana safari section with a luxury beach break in Mozambique is just as amazing as you can imagine with stretches of sand untouched by tourism encouraging diving, snorkelling and sea kayaking in the deep blue hues of the ever-present Indian Ocean.<br/>",

      "description": "You take a morning flight to Mozambique, followed by a connecting light aircraft transfer to Benguerra Island. Set in a natural acacia forest bordering Benguerra Bay and encircled by silver beaches, coral reefs and turquoise seas, this Lodge offers seclusion and privacy in a tranquil setting. Your days are free to explore the Island's natural beauty on foot or in an open Land Rover, try your hand at some of the many activities, or simply indulge in the experience of being \"castaway\" in luxury. While you may simply choose to recline within the shade of a beach umbrella, there are many wonderful activities to enjoy. The island is a snorkeller and scuba diver`s paradise due to the abundance and variety of Marine life and unspoilt beauty of the reefs around the island. Less strenuous activities include a traditional dhow cruise, a picnic on a deserted beach or Exciting saltwater fishing from a boat. Accommodation for 4 nights is in a twin cabana with en suite bathroom on a full board basis including local drinks, activities (snorkelling, picnics, Land Rover trips, island tours, dhow cruising, village visits, sea kayaking, bird watching, nature walks, star gazing) and laundry.
