  "generalInfo": "Botswana is considered Southern Africa’s premier game viewing destination. The remote wilderness, limited access for visitors and abundant game make for an exceptional wildlife safari. This tour is the essence of why we started our tours.<br/><br/>DEPARTS: MAUN on Thursday at 17:00pm, ENDS: LIVINGSTONE-ZAMBIA on Saturday at+/-08:00am.<br/><br/>Highlights<br/>* Moremi Game Reserve–game drives<br/>* Savuti–game drives<br/>* Chobe National Park–game drive and river cruise<br/>* Victoria Falls–adventure activities<br/><br/>Overnight - 2 nights on safari we stay at designated campsites in national parks and towns. Formal campsites have hot and cold showers, laundry facilities &amp; telephones.5 nights we “camp wild” without fences in the wilderness areas. On these nights the crew will erect a bucket shower (with hot water off the fire) and a pit latrine (with seat!). 2 nights at a lodge in Livingstone with en-suite rooms and air-conditioning. Meals - 9 breakfasts,6 lunches and 5 dinners will be provided by the crew, prepared at the vehicle and eaten around the camp fire except for the last 2 breakfasts at the lodge in Livingstone. Transport for this safari you travel in a custom-built 4WD Land Cruiser with 12 forward facing seats (of which 8are “window” seats). Roll-up canvas sides allow you to feel part of the bush. Limited participation - an essential part of your safari is some participation. From putting up your tent to packing the truck in the morning–it’s all part of your adventure and when everyone puts in a little effort the trip will run smoothly. Your tour leaders will do all the meal preparation, but we do ask the clients to help (on rotation) with the washing up. If there are 9 or more clients on the tour, then a supply vehicle and camp assistant travel with the group through the national parks (days2-6). The camp assistant will help with meal preparation and washing up and make your life a little easier!<br/>",

      "description": "MOREMI & SAVUTI We have 4 nights in these conservation areas with time ot explore the various habitats. We spend our time on game drives watching the plentiful wildlife including hippos, Cape wild dogs, elephant, buffalo, lion & other game. Moremi Game Reserve rates as one of the leading wildlife areas of the world and we take our open 4WD vehicle into Moremi for fantastic game viewing! Grasslands, floodplains, forests, lily lagoons and winding water channels combine to form a variety of game viewing habitats. Moving north over the sand ridge and into the Mababe depression we arrive at the Savuti Marsh. This open grassland area attracts herds of zebra and wildebeest, which in turn draw the large lion prides for which Savuti is famous. We camp wild in the central Chobe National Park at either Savuti or Zwei-Zwei."

In the early morning we search for game on the flood plains of the Chobe River. The late afternoon game viewing \"sundowner\" cruise is a highlight as we see the mighty elephant herds returning to the Chobe River to quench their thirst. We camp at Kasane on the Chobe River for night 11."
