  "generalInfo": "Designed by overland travel experts with the ambitious and culturally curious traveller in mind, this is an epic two-month odyssey taking in Kenya, Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and finally South Africa. Journeying in a comfortable and spacious vehicle with a small group of fellow adventurers, you’ll bond over a range of unforgettable experiences in iconic destinations from Victoria Falls to the plains of the Serengeti, and sharing duties at the locally run campsites you stay at along the way. <br/><br/>This Nairobi to Cape Town overland tour is the kind of trip where you start waking up at sunrise with the birds because you’re in a hurry for the day to begin. You’ll enjoy absolutely spectacular wildlife-watching throughout: on the floor of Ngorongoro Crater, roaming the Serengeti, on the riverbanks of the Okavango Delta, from horseback on a game ranch in Zimbabwe. These safaris are led by hugely knowledgeable local guides able not only to point out the animals to you, but to explain their behaviours. They’ll also tell you about the threats to the animals’ survival and how conservation efforts are making a difference – several of which, such as the Otjitongwe Cheetah Preservation Park in Namibia, are directly financially supported by your holiday. <br/><br/>But – as awe-inspiring as it undoubtedly is to watch as elephants cautiously approach a floodlit waterhole by night, to swim with dolphins off Zanzibar or to head out in search of the critically endangered Black rhino, it’s often the little moments in-between that will stay with you longest after your trip comes to an end. That might be spending an hour with a Maasai elder in their village to learn a little about their traditional ways of life. It could be the satisfaction of clambering to the summit of a towering Sossusvlei sand dune to take in the sunset. Or it could simply be having a laugh with a new friend as you take your turn at the washing-up station on the campsite. <br/><br/>This kind of trip does not suit everyone. It is best-suited to those content to rough it a little, to work together as part of a team, and above all to share their space. And it introduces you to people throughout who are also prepared to share space with Africa’s amazing wildlife, even though it sometimes inconveniences or even sometimes endangers them. Because they know the benefits that responsible travellers on trips such as this can bring to their communities. <br/>",

      "description": "Nairobi to Arusha and the Serengeti We depart Nairobi early in the morning and immediately find ourselves in hot savannah grasslands with acacia trees providing the only shade. Various game, usually zebra and giraffe can be seen as we head south and cross the border into Tanzania. We spend the night at Meserani Snake Park, on the route from Arusha to the Serengeti. Over the next 3 days you can take our optional Add-on to enjoy a safari into the Serengeti National Park and Ngorongoro Crater. These areas are one of the world's great wildlife hotspots, and you are sure to see a huge variety of different game species including Elephant, Lion, Cheetah, White Rhino, Buffalo, Hippo, Antelope, Crocodile and Pink Flamingos as well as vast herds of wildebeest roaming the plains. For those who don't want to add this safari experience onto the trip, there are options to visit the Snake Park, visit a local Masai Village to learn about their culture and way of life. You can also arrange day trips into the Serengeti or Ngorongoro Crater (bear in mind these will involve a lot of travel time to and from the park, and therefore much more limited time actually on safari)."

We will stop off for a couple of nights at the village of Marangu where you have the opportunity to climb to Kilimanjaro base camp, or take a walk through the lush surroundings passing through coffee plantations, rivers, waterfalls, caves and visiting a local blacksmith. Leaving Marangu, a day's drive brings us to the coast and some welcome time on a beautiful Indian Ocean Beach at Bagamoyo before we continue to Dar Es Salaam. The truck will be based here for 4 nights while the group heads to Zanzibar."

During our time there we'll visit the bustling streets of Stone Town and its famous spice markets, old slave forts and dungeons. We'll also spend 3 nights relaxing on Zanzibar's famous white beaches, where there are many options available locally to arrange scuba diving, snorkelling, and dolphin boat trips."

      "description": "Dar es Salaam to Lake Malawi After meeting the Zanzibar ferry we begin the journey through the interesting and mountainous hinterland of Tanzania. In the afternoon, after negotiating some appalling roads, we pass through the peaceful Mikumi National Park. African safari travel is synonymous with wildlife, and in this national park we usually see Elephant, Giraffe, Zebra and Antelope from the roadside. Passing through lush mountainous landscape and plantations - we enter Malawi which is dominated by its huge freshwater lake. Camping in Malawi sums up the spirit of an Africa overland trip with Oasis. We spend several days at friendly laid back campsites where most people choose to relax on the sandy beaches or try their hand at scuba diving, snorkelling or windsurfing as we follow the lakeshore south. If you are more inclined to just relax - then there is no better place than on the shores of Lake Malawi. This really is a warm friendly country - making it easy to wander off and meet up with your local hosts in one of the many villages or schools nearby. You can also view first hand the talent of the local artisans and purchase some exquisite pieces of furniture and carvings made out of ebony and mahogany."

      "description": "Through Mozambique to Harare From Lake Malawi, we continue on to the capital Lilongwe in the south of the country where you can check out the local markets. Our African Overland trip then leaves Lilongwe to cross into Mozambique and head for Zimbabwe. We follow the infamous Tete Corridor which was well known in the days of Mozambique's long running civil war as the Gun Run. Thankfully these days things are a lot different and we spend a few days passing through the country. We then enter Zimbabwe and travel via the capital, Harare. Arriving into Zimbabwe's cosmopolitan city, you can enjoy many of the sights in and around the city centre. There are many markets throughout the city from craft markets to the hectic local Mbare market, and you can also stroll through the botanical gardens, or enjoy the nightlife in one of the many bars throughout the city."

Here you have the opportunity to take a hike through the mountain wilderness area, or hike to the nearby Bridal Veil Falls, or simply enjoy the stunning surroundings from this sleepy village whilst strolling through the village market. Our next stop is then at the Great Zimbabwe Ruins, the site of what was once the greatest medieval city in Sub Saharan Africa and where the name Zimbabwe is derived, literally meaning house of stone."

After a couple of enjoyable nights here, we move on and enter Matabeleland and the town of Bulawayo. You have the option of an exciting day's venture from here into Matobo National Park with a local safari company. You will have a unique chance to get out on foot to try and spot the elusive Black Rhino - amongst hordes of other game. This is one of the few places in Africa that this type of safari is available. There is also the opportunity to visit Cecil Rhodes' grave and Ancient Rock Paintings."

      "description": "Bulawayo Victoria Falls If we can, then from Bulawayo we like to follow a journey that is steeped in history and say goodbye to the truck for a night and take the overnight train from Bulawayo to the mighty Victoria Falls. However, in recent years the service has been unreliable at best, and not suitable for us to use. Your crew will update you whether we think we can include this on your trip. If we can, then expect basic conditions, but the views and experience of looking out the window and watching the world go by more than make up for it. Alternatively we will drive from Bulawayo to Victoria Falls, arriving late in the afternoon. For some, Mosi oa Tunya - The Smoke That Thunders, is the highlight of their African safari. From the main road, in the bush 20kms away, a cloud of mist and spray can be seen against the blue sky. As you get closer, a low rumble like thunder can be heard. When you arrive it is a surprise to discover the enormity of Victoria Falls. One mile wide and hurling over 5 million cubic metres of water a minute into the Zambezi Gorge this sight is breath taking at any time of year. The water levels vary hugely depending on the time of year, but it is always an amazing spectacle - in fact it can actually be better when there is a little less water, as there is less spray blocking the falls from view. The Gorge below the falls is also the setting for one of the most adrenaline fuelled grade 5 white water rafting rivers in the world. But there is also plenty to do here for the less active too. Why not take a day trip over the Victoria Falls bridge to view the falls from Zambia, take the Flight of Angels - a great way to get a birds eye view of the falls in a microlight or helicopter, enjoy a civilised afternoon tea at the Victoria Falls Hotel, join a Sunset Boat Cruise or a more sedate Canoe trip. For those who want to make the most of the adrenaline activities, get your fix with the Gorge Swing, Abseil or 'enjoy' one of the highest commercial Bungee Jumps in the world."

      "description": "Chobe, Salt Pans & Okavango Delta We depart Victoria Falls and also leave Zimbabwe, crossing into Botswana where we spend the night at Kasane, on the outskirts of the Chobe National Park - famous for its hordes of Elephants, as well as an abundance of other wildlife. You will have a chance to spend the afternoon on an included boat cruise on the Chobe River - a less intrusive way to view game and wildlife - as well as the Namibian frontier across the river. There is also time to take an optional game safari into the park if you wish. We then head south into the Kalahari Basin - known for its dry, desolate and expansive plains. On our way we will pass the Nata Bird Sanctuary, and the Makgadikgadi Salt Pans, one of the largest salt flats in the world. After we arrive in Maun, you will have an opportunity to leave the truck to venture into the Okavango Delta. Local poler guides will navigate the extensive waterways using canoes similar to their traditional Mokoro's (dug out canoes). This is a great experience - and a great way to have a chance of seeing some of elusive wildlife of this unique desert oasis. After the mokoro trip on the water, you will have a number of opportunities to go on game walks with rangers - giving you the chance to see elephant, crocodile and hippo up close and personal. The Okavango Delta is one of the world's largest inland waterways and its calming serenity will leave those who experience it feeling supremely relaxed. There is also the opportunity to experience the heights of African adventure travel too"

      "description": "Maun to Etosha Travelling west we enter Namibia and continue toward Etosha National Park - recognised as one of the worlds greatest wildlife viewing areas. The semi desert is quite a contrast to the more fertile terrain we have been used to, and the desert elephants that make their home here are a famous highlight. The night sky ablaze with shooting stars and the warm glow of our campfire makes for unforgettable camping experiences. Besides game drives done on our truck, we can also game watch by night at one of the floodlit water holes where we may well spot Rhino, Elephant and Giraffe among a host of other wildlife."

We will aim to make a bush camp amidst the stunning Spitzkoppe Rock formations. Known as the Matterhorn of Namibia - the Spitzkoppe is part of the Erongo Mt range and was formed over 100 million years ago after the collapse of a gigantic volcano. The scenery is striking from every angle - even more stunning as the granite massifs turn red at sunset."

The Cool Atlantic Ocean and the prominent Benguela current provide a perfect location for feeding and breeding for the Cape Fur Seal. We will then drive down the Skeleton Coast, where desert sand dunes come right to the sea, and several shipwrecks can be seen still on the beaches. For the next two days, our Africa overland trip will be based in Swakopmund - Namibia's adventure gateway. You can choose between a variety of activities and excursions here"

At Sossusvlei we stop and explore this spectacular area and red dunes, including the iconic Dune 45, which we climb before breakfast one morning. We can also visit the stunning scenery of Deadvlei, where 800 year old black preserved trees stand out in huge contrast to the orange sands and blue sky behind them. Continuing south we enter the semi-desert, and wide-open countryside of cattle ranching until we arrive at one of Africa's most sensational natural features, Fish River Canyon. We stop here for a couple of hours to take in the awesome scenery. We'll then continue and cross the border into South Africa and also cross the Orange River - a rich source of diamonds."
