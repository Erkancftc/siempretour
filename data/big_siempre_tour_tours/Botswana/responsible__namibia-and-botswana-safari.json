  "generalInfo": "This two week Namibia &amp; Botswana tour offers the perfect introduction to these interesting and culturally unique countries. As well as a getting a glimpse of Zimbabwe and its most spectacular natural heritage site of Victoria Falls. Travelling in a small group on an overland truck specially designed for long trips through this wide variety of terrain, your journey starts in Namibia at its adventure hub of Swakopmund. If you arrive early you will have an option to take on a variety of experiences here from skydiving to sand boarding. <br/><br/>One of the cultural highlights of our time in Namibia is meeting the Himba people, semi-nomadic bush people who share with us some of the fascinating aspects of their lifestyles, from painting their skin with ochre and ask to communal pastoralism. After our time with the Himba, we head to the country’s celebrated Etosha National park. Here we spend two days taking in the Etosha Pan’s superb wildlife including lions, elephants and rhinos. Before heading into Botswana on day seven of the trip, we take some time in Namibia’s capital city of Windhoek. <br/><br/>Botswana boasts the most spectacular array of wildlife experiences, the first being the Okavango Delta where we spend three days. Before that we spend time with the San community in Ghanzi, thought to be ancestors of all the world’s human beings, due to their high genetic diversity.  At Okavango, we explore the immense inland data on foot and by boat, taking in its network of winding channels and small forested islands. All of which act as a giant watering hole and feeding fest for 164 different mammal species. This is followed by a day at Chobe National Park, Botswana’s oldest park, which also has one of the highest densities of wildlife in Africa, especially elephant herds. <br/><br/>There are few better finales to a trip through southern Africa than at Zimbabwe’s Victoria Falls known  locally as ‘Mosi-oa-Tunya’, which means ‘the smoke that thunders’. <br/><br/>**Important Note:** The  itinerary below is written with an optional activity package so that you can pick and choose adventures according to your budget. You need to book these in advance so do chat to us about your interests. <br/>",

      "description": "Okavango - Khwai Conservation Area (Okavango Delta) For the next two nights, you'll be separated from your main truck as we venture deeper into the Okavango Delta. Before we depart from Maun, it's really important that you pack a small bag with only the personal belongings you'll need for these two nights. Please remember to pack lightly – space will be limited, and you'll appreciate not carrying excess weight. Your accommodation in the Khwai Conservation Area can best be described as a rustic mobile fly camp. You'll be staying in a comfortable Meru-style tent, which is equipped with two single beds. Each tent also boasts adjoining en-suite amenities, including a bucket shower system for a refreshing wash and a chemical toilet for your convenience. Today, our journey truly begins as we make our way towards the heart of the Okavango Delta. For early risers, there's an incredible opportunity to experience an optional scenic flight over the Delta. This offers a breathtaking aerial perspective of the labyrinthine waterways, islands, and floodplains, providing an unparalleled view of this natural wonder (please note, this is dependent on time and suitable weather conditions). After your optional flight, or if you choose not to fly, you'll be collected from Maun and transferred to the Khwai Conservation Area in smaller, more agile safari-type vehicles. This ensures we can navigate the varied terrain effectively. Upon arrival, our experienced guide will provide a comprehensive briefing, preparing us for what to expect during our exciting afternoon mokoro excursion into the Okavango Delta. These traditional dugout canoes offer a unique and peaceful way to explore the Delta's pristine channels. (Please note"
