  "generalInfo": "This safari adventure takes you deep into the heart of the Okavango Delta, with stays at two exceptional camps: Shinde and Kanana. <br/><br/>At Shinde, a secluded northern delta hideaway, offers seven safari tents and a family suite among ancient trees. The solar-powered lodge features decks, lounges, a dining area, fire deck, curio shop, and pool. Enjoy day and night game drives, guided walks, motor boat trips, and mokoro excursions, spotting elephants, lions, and abundant birdlife.<br/><br/>At Kanana Camp in the southwestern delta, eight spacious tents sit among ebony and acacia trees, each with raised decks overlooking winding channels. The open-sided lounge, dining area, cocktail bar, and plunge pool offer a relaxed retreat. Seasonal activities include game drives, mokoro excursions, boating, fishing, guided walks, sunset cruises, and visits to a rare heronry. Guests can also sleep under the stars on the sleepout deck (April–November).<br/><br/>Airstrip transfers are 10 minutes to Shinde and 30 minutes to Kanana, making both camps easily accessible yet wonderfully remote.",
