  "generalInfo": "From the stunning tropical beaches of Zanzibar to the wildlife of Etosha National Park in Namibia and the cosmopolitan city of Cape Town this trip enables you to experience a diversity of African wildlife, scenery and cultures. There's time to relax and take it all in, interspersed with options to really up the adrenaline with white water rafting, bungy jumping and tandem sky dives! Note: This is one of our Overland Adventures which are run using one of our specialist famous yellow overland expedition trucks. Trips are run on a participatory basis – you’ll be involved in the day to day running of the trip and have fun taking turns helping to shop and cook for the group. Expect to sometimes get dusty and dishevelled and not to be able to have hot showers every night. Groups of up to 24 people are led by our crew of two. Please note that the accommodation on this trip is predominantly camping, though there may be opportunities to upgrade this locally where rooms are available. Please see the trip inclusions for an approximate percentage of camping and room nights. Our Overland Adventures provide once in a life time experiences and whilst some safari activities may be included in the itinerary, or be available to book locally, this should not be considered a traditional safari holiday, though we consider that part of the fun!!",

      "description": "Nairobi to Arusha and the Serengeti We depart Nairobi early in the morning and immediately find ourselves in hot savannah grasslands with acacia trees providing the only shade. Various game, usually zebra and giraffe can be seen as we head south and cross the border into Tanzania. We spend the night at Meserani Snake Park, on the route from Arusha to the Serengeti. Over the next 3 days you can take our optional Add-on to enjoy a safari into the Serengeti National Park and Ngorongoro Crater. These areas are one of the world's great wildlife hotspots, and you are sure to see a huge variety of different game species including Elephant, Lion, Cheetah, White Rhino, Buffalo, Hippo, Antelope, Crocodile and Pink Flamingos as well as vast herds of wildebeest roaming the plains. For those who don't want to add this safari experience onto the trip, there are options to visit the Snake Park, visit a local Masai Village to learn about their culture and way of life. You can also arrange day trips into the Serengeti or Ngorongoro Crater (bear in mind these will involve a lot of travel time to and from the park, and therefore much more limited time actually on safari)."

We will stop off for a couple of nights at the village of Marangu where you have the opportunity to climb to Kilimanjaro base camp, or take a walk through the lush surroundings passing through coffee plantations, rivers, waterfalls, caves and visiting a local blacksmith. Leaving Marangu, a day's drive brings us to the coast and some welcome time on a beautiful Indian Ocean Beach at Bagamoyo before we continue to Dar Es Salaam. The truck will be based here for 4 nights while the group heads to Zanzibar."

      "description": "Dar es Salaam to Lake Malawi After meeting the Zanzibar ferry we begin the journey through the interesting and mountainous hinterland of Tanzania. In the afternoon, after negotiating some appalling roads, we pass through the peaceful Mikumi National Park. African safari travel is synonymous with wildlife, and in this national park we usually see Elephant, Giraffe, Zebra and Antelope from the roadside. Passing through lush mountainous landscape and plantations - we enter Malawi which is dominated by its huge freshwater lake. Camping in Malawi sums up the spirit of an Africa overland trip with Oasis. We spend several days at friendly laid back campsites where most people choose to relax on the sandy beaches or try their hand at scuba diving, snorkelling or windsurfing as we follow the lakeshore south. If you are more inclined to just relax - then there is no better place than on the shores of Lake Malawi. This really is a warm friendly country - making it easy to wander off and meet up with your local hosts in one of the many villages or schools nearby. You can also view first hand the talent of the local artisans and purchase some exquisite pieces of furniture and carvings made out of ebony and mahogany."

Our African Overland trip then leaves Lilongwe to cross into Mozambique and head for Zimbabwe. We follow the infamous Tete Corridor which was well known in the days of Mozambique's long running civil war as the Gun Run. Thankfully these days things are a lot different and we spend a few days passing through the country. We then enter Zimbabwe and travel via the capital, Harare. Arriving into Zimbabwe's cosmopolitan city, you can enjoy many of the sights in and around the city centre. There are many markets throughout the city from craft markets to the hectic local Mbare market, and you can also stroll through the botanical gardens, or enjoy the nightlife in one of the many bars throughout the city."

Here you have the opportunity to take a hike through the mountain wilderness area, or hike to the nearby Bridal Veil Falls, or simply enjoy the stunning surroundings from this sleepy village whilst strolling through the village market. Our next stop is then at the Great Zimbabwe Ruins, the site of what was once the greatest medieval city in Sub Saharan Africa and where the name Zimbabwe is derived, literally meaning house of stone."

After a couple of enjoyable nights here, we move on and enter Matabeleland and the town of Bulawayo. You have the option of an exciting day's venture from here into Matobo National Park with a local safari company. You will have a unique chance to get out on foot to try and spot the elusive Black Rhino - amongst hordes of other game. This is one of the few places in Africa that this type of safari is available. There is also the opportunity to visit Cecil Rhodes' grave and Ancient Rock Paintings."

      "description": "Bulawayo Victoria Falls If we can, then from Bulawayo we like to follow a journey that is steeped in history and say goodbye to the truck for a night and take the overnight train from Bulawayo to the mighty Victoria Falls. However, in recent years the service has been unreliable at best, and not suitable for us to use. Your crew will update you whether we think we can include this on your trip. If we can, then expect basic conditions, but the views and experience of looking out the window and watching the world go by more than make up for it. Alternatively we will drive from Bulawayo to Victoria Falls, arriving late in the afternoon. For some, Mosi oa Tunya - The Smoke That Thunders, is the highlight of their African safari. From the main road, in the bush 20kms away, a cloud of mist and spray can be seen against the blue sky. As you get closer, a low rumble like thunder can be heard. When you arrive it is a surprise to discover the enormity of Victoria Falls. One mile wide and hurling over 5 million cubic metres of water a minute into the Zambezi Gorge this sight is breath taking at any time of year. The water levels vary hugely depending on the time of year, but it is always an amazing spectacle - in fact it can actually be better when there is a little less water, as there is less spray blocking the falls from view. The Gorge below the falls is also the setting for one of the most adrenaline fuelled grade 5 white water rafting rivers in the world. But there is also plenty to do here for the less active too. Why not take a day trip over the Victoria Falls bridge to view the falls from Zambia, take the Flight of Angels - a great way to get a birds eye view of the falls in a microlight or helicopter, enjoy a civilised afternoon tea at the Victoria Falls Hotel, join a Sunset Boat Cruise or a more sedate Canoe trip. For those who want to make the most of the adrenaline activities, get your fix with the Gorge Swing, Abseil or 'enjoy' one of the highest commercial Bungee Jumps in the world."

      "description": "Chobe, Salt Pans & Okavango Delta We depart Victoria Falls and also leave Zimbabwe, crossing into Botswana where we spend the night at Kasane, on the outskirts of the Chobe National Park - famous for its hordes of Elephants, as well as an abundance of other wildlife. You will have a chance to spend the afternoon on an included boat cruise on the Chobe River - a less intrusive way to view game and wildlife - as well as the Namibian frontier across the river. There is also time to take an optional game safari into the park if you wish. We then head south into the Kalahari Basin - known for its dry, desolate and expansive plains. On our way we will pass the Nata Bird Sanctuary, and the Makgadikgadi Salt Pans, one of the largest salt flats in the world. After we arrive in Maun, you will have an opportunity to leave the truck to venture into the Okavango Delta. Local poler guides will navigate the extensive waterways using canoes similar to their traditional Mokoro's (dug out canoes). This is a great experience - and a great way to have a chance of seeing some of elusive wildlife of this unique desert oasis. After the mokoro trip on the water, you will have a number of opportunities to go on game walks with rangers - giving you the chance to see elephant, crocodile and hippo up close and personal. The Okavango Delta is one of the world's largest inland waterways and its calming serenity will leave those who experience it feeling supremely relaxed. There is also the opportunity to experience the heights of African adventure travel too"

The semi desert is quite a contrast to the more fertile terrain we have been used to, and the desert elephants that make their home here are a famous highlight. The night sky ablaze with shooting stars and the warm glow of our campfire makes for unforgettable camping experiences. Besides game drives done on our truck, we can also game watch by night at one of the floodlit water holes where we may well spot Rhino, Elephant and Giraffe among a host of other wildlife."

We will aim to make a bush camp amidst the stunning Spitzkoppe Rock formations. Known as the Matterhorn of Namibia - the Spitzkoppe is part of the Erongo Mt range and was formed over 100 million years ago after the collapse of a gigantic volcano. The scenery is striking from every angle - even more stunning as the granite massifs turn red at sunset."

The Cool Atlantic Ocean and the prominent Benguela current provide a perfect location for feeding and breeding for the Cape Fur Seal. We will then drive down the Skeleton Coast, where desert sand dunes come right to the sea, and several shipwrecks can be seen still on the beaches. For the next two days, our Africa overland trip will be based in Swakopmund - Namibia's adventure gateway. You can choose between a variety of activities and excursions here"

At Sossusvlei we stop and explore this spectacular area and red dunes, including the iconic Dune 45, which we climb before breakfast one morning. We can also visit the stunning scenery of Deadvlei, where 800 year old black preserved trees stand out in huge contrast to the orange sands and blue sky behind them. Continuing south we enter the semi-desert, and wide-open countryside of cattle ranching until we arrive at one of Africa's most sensational natural features, Fish River Canyon. We stop here for a couple of hours to take in the awesome scenery. We'll then continue and cross the border into South Africa and also cross the Orange River - a rich source of diamonds."

      "description": "Cape Town to Little Karoo We depart from Cape Town taking a leisurely drive along the coastal roads to the Cape of Good Hope, a rocky headland at the southern end of the Cape peninsula. Here you have a chance to walk up to the upper lighthouse, or take a ride on the Flying Dutchman Funicular for some spectacular views. After visiting the Cape we follow the coastline on to our next stop. We overnight in Hermanus/Gansbaai and the next day there are a number of marine options - Whale watching, Shark Cave Diving and Dyer Island Nature Reserve. From here we will head for the most southern tip of Africa at Cape Agulhas - which is the dividing line between the warm Indian Ocean and the cooler Atlantic Ocean. The seas around Cape Agulhas are very treacherous and have caused numerous shipwrecks, to help reduce fatalities the Cape Agulhas Lighthouse was built in 1848 and is the 2nd oldest working lighthouse in South Africa. From August to December Southern Right and Humpback Whales may be spotted along the coast - as they feed in the nutrient rich waters off the southern coast. From Cape Agulhas we pass through the Outeniqua Mountains to the Little Karoo - we will visit an Ostrich farm to learn more about the worlds largest bird. The Ostrich has been around for 8 million years and a feather was actually discovered in King Tutankhamun's tomb in Egypt. 97% of the world's population of Ostriches lives in the Karoo. We will also explore Cango Calcite Caves recognised as one of the world's finest network of Calcite caves. The bizarre formations of Stalagmites and Stalactites represent over a million years of slow formation."

We travel through the popular resort of Knysna, located on a tranquil lagoon that is protected from the sea by two enormous cliffs known as 'the heads'. We visit the Tsitsikamma Forest, where you will be able to hike along the coast and view the crashing waves at the mouth of the scenic Storms River, and maybe spot dolphins and whales in the ocean. Optional excursions in this region include mountain biking, black water tubing, and the mother of all bungee jumps at Bloakrans Bridge - the highest jump in the world at 216 metres. From the Garden Route we continue along the coast and in the summer months (October to March) there will be an opportunity to stop at one of the beaches we pass before we head inland to Addo Elephant National Park which has recently been extended to include part of the coast and is now home to the BIG 7 - lion, rhino, elephant, leopard, buffalo, whale and shark! On our game drive we hope to spot some of the many elephant that the park is famous for, which are the most southerly population in Africa."

This little country is completely surrounded by South Africa and is covered by mountains from 1000m to 3000m high. The scenery here is tremendous and the mountain air crisp and fresh. Here we will see Lesotho's horsemen dressed in their blankets and gumboots trotting around the hillsides. We spend a couple of nights at Malealea Lodge, Lesotho's most famous countryside retreat tucked up high in the mountains. Here there are isolated waterfalls, cool rock pools ideal for swimming, and peaceful hikes in the surrounding hills. This is also a great place to try pony trekking - one of the best ways to enjoy the scenery is atop a sure footed Lesotho pony. We drive through the lowlands of Lesotho and visit Thabo Bosiu or Mt. Moorosi with a local guide (time & weather permitting). This mountain stronghold was the home of Chief Moshoeshoe, the founder of the Basotho nation.

There are over 130km of walking trails around the park-many of which are easy, half day strolls, through beautiful countryside of grassland dotted with patches of yellowwood forest and proteas set against the stunning backdrop of the Amphitheatre. Heading north we pass through small towns and villages, through Afrikaaner heartland, making our way to South Africa’s largest city, Johannesburg.
