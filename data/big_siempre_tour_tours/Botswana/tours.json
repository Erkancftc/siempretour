    "generalInfo": "Trek to see the mountain gorillas, swim with dolphins, walk in search of rhino or, relax on sandy tropical beaches. Add in a few adrenaline activities such as bungy jumping, white water rafting, gorge swings or quad biking along with stunning gameparks such as the Serengeti, Etosha, Addo and Ngorongoro Crater and some fantastic activities such as Whale watching and Shark Cave Diving will make this a trip to remember. Note: This is one of our Overland Adventures which are run using one of our specialist famous yellow overland expedition trucks. Trips are run on a participatory basis – you’ll be involved in the day to day running of the trip and have fun taking turns helping to shop and cook for the group. Expect to sometimes get dusty and dishevelled and not to be able to have hot showers every night. Groups of up to 24 people are led by our crew of two. Please note that the accommodation on this trip is predominantly camping, though there may be opportunities to upgrade this locally where rooms are available. Please see the trip inclusions for an approximate percentage of camping and room nights. Our Overland Adventures provide once in a life time experiences and whilst some safari activities may be included in the itinerary, or be available to book locally, this should not be considered a traditional safari holiday, though we consider that part of the fun!!",

        "description": "Nairobi to Lake Naivasha and the Masai Mara After loading the truck with all our gear, we depart Nairobi this morning and head north into one of Africa’s greatest natural features, the East African Rift Valley. Stretching from the Dead Sea in Jordan down to Mozambique in Southern Africa, our first view is from the top of a steep escarpment. Overland trips through East Africa will allow you to experience some of the most dramatic scenery in the world, and the Rift Valley is a definite highlight. The valley floor seems to sweep on forever and is dotted with volcanic peaks, shimmering lakes and countless springs. Our journey takes us into the heart of the Rift Valley to Lake Naivasha. We camp near the lake shore where Hippos sometimes feed at night! Here you can walk to Elsamere, the house of Joy Adamson - of Elsa the Lion and Born Free fame, and enjoy a film of her life - and cream teas! You can also hire mountain bikes and cycle or walk through Hells Gate National Park - the only game reserve in Kenya in which you are permitted to do so. Or for a less active but equally enjoyable game viewing experience - visit the Crater Lake Game Sanctuary. Both offer excellent scenery and opportunities to spot hyrax, abundant bird and plant life along with several types of gazelle, impala and eland. Next we head to one of Africa’s most famous wildlife reserves, the Masai Mara. Famous for its dense concentration of animals and birds, and for its important place in the annual wildebeest migration (July to October), you will have a great chance to see lions, elephants, buffalo, leopards, cheetahs and also rhino if you are lucky. We include a morning and afternoon safari, while an additional evening safari may be available to arrange locally on our arrival day if we have made good time."

        "description": "Kakamega Rainforest and Jinja After leaving the Masai Mara, we drive west to the Kakamega Rainforest, a remnant of the ancient rainforest that stretched across Central Africa. This is a real contrast to other wild areas we’ll visit, and the forest is home to various mammals including colobus and Debrazzar monkeys, pottos, bush pigs and giant forest hedgehogs, as well as a great selection of colourful birdlife. A guided walk in the forest is included here. Next, we make our first border crossing as we cross from Kenya into Uganda and continue on to camp near Jinja - Uganda's adventure playground. Here, on the edge of Lake Victoria, the Nile begins its 6700km journey to the sea. We spend the next few days a little downstream from the source of the Nile. This is a spectacular area and a superb place to go whitewater rafting or kayaking. You can also organise quad biking, horse riding or a visit to a local education project."

        "description": "Kalinzu Forest Reserve & Queen Elizabeth National Park A long day’s drive now takes us west through swamps, patches of forest and fertile green countryside. As we travel through Uganda, we'll pass through a number of small towns and villages; Mpigi, where you will see roadside stalls manufacturing and selling traditional musical instruments; Kyazanga, where we can buy fresh rotisserie and roasted meat and vegetables, as well as roasted plantain bananas. We will also be able to make a photo stop where our route crosses the Equator. Our destination is Kalinzu Forest Reserve. Here we have a great opportunity to take an optional hike into the forest to see some habituated chimpanzee families. Permits need to be booked several months in advance, so please get in touch if you would like to add this experience. Only 12 permits are issued each day to minimize disruption to the animals, and a local guide will take you through the forest to find the group. You then have an hour watching and following them before returning to camp. You should see many other monkeys, birds and other wildlife during the trip too. If you don’t book the chimp trek, then various other walks are available in the forest to see waterfalls, birds, primates, and other wildlife. The forest has four main paths for nature walks, including the valley trail, the waterfall path, the river trail, and the Palm trail. These can all be arranged when you get there. After our day in the forest, we take a short drive to Katunguru on the edge of Queen Elizabeth National Park. We have a free morning here to take a wide range of optional village walks, learning about the culture of the Basongara, Bakonjo and Banyabindi who live in Queen Elizabeth National Park. Then in the afternoon, we include a guided boat cruise on the Kazinga Channel, where you can look out for hippos, crocodiles, elephants, buffalos, waterbucks and a huge range of bird species. Next, we spend the morning on a game drive on our truck, as we drive south through Queen Elizabeth National Park and on to our next stop, Lake Bunyonyi."

        "description": "Gorilla Trekking, to Kigali We have a whole day set aside today to visit Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park and Mgahinga Gorilla National Park which are home to several families of Highland Mountain Gorillas. Getting up close to these amazing creatures is truly a once in a lifetime experience and one of the highlights of the trip. You have the opportunity to trek to see the Gorillas in Uganda (bookable as an Add on). It is estimated that only around 700 of these gentle giants remain. This mountainous area on the borders of Rwanda, Uganda and Zaire (now renamed Democratic Republic of Congo) is their only natural habitat and they are periodically threatened by poachers and political instability in the area. One permit allows you to spend about 50 to 60 minutes with one of the gorilla families. Trekking to find them in groups of 8 people can take anywhere from half an hour to 5 hours. The organisations and well-trained guides that continually monitor and protect the families are conscientious and responsible. We will base ourselves near the village of Kabale which will give you the opportunity to trek the Mountain Gorillas and visit the beautiful Lake Bunyonyi, where you will have the opportunity to visit a pygmy village. If permits are limited, we may adjust the itinerary slightly to spend an extra day here to give everyone in the group the opportunity to see the gorillas. After our latest forest adventure, we pass through mountain ranges and cross the border into Rwanda and continue to the capital, Kigali. Here we can visit the genocide memorial, which is a moving and humbling experience."

This park provides a unique safari experience, distinct from other national parks in Uganda. Its compact size means it's easy to explore, and its varied landscapes support a wide range of wildlife species. It is also one of the Ugandan parks to offer adventurous night game drives, which you will have the option to take. Starting at around 6.30-7pm and taking 2-3 hours, you can explore the savannah plains with an experienced ranger guide, using spotlight torches to view nocturnal animals, such as leopards, white tailed mongoos, bush baby, bush pigs, genet cats, hippos feeding as well as other animals like impalas, waterbucks, zebras, elands, giraffes and topi among others. A morning safari into the park is also available the next day. From Lake Mburo we drive on to Uganda’s capital, Kampala. Kampala has had a turbulent past, but these days it is a friendly and safe city. We have a free evening to spend in local cafes and nightspots where you can get to know the local people. Then we head north to see the spectacular Sipi Falls. There are three waterfalls here on the Sipi River as it cascades into the Kyoga Basin from the slopes of Mount Elgon. The highest is just under 100m and there is an exciting abseiling option available here."

Various game, usually zebra and giraffe can be seen as we head south and cross the border into Tanzania. We spend the night at Meserani Snake Park, on the route from Arusha to the Serengeti. Over the next 3 days you can take our optional Add-on to enjoy a safari into the Serengeti National Park and Ngorongoro Crater. These areas are one of the world's great wildlife hotspots, and you are sure to see a huge variety of different game species including Elephant, Lion, Cheetah, White Rhino, Buffalo, Hippo, Antelope, Crocodile and Pink Flamingos as well as vast herds of wildebeest roaming the plains. For those who don't want to add this safari experience onto the trip, there are options to visit the Snake Park, visit a local Masai Village to learn about their culture and way of life. You can also arrange day trips into the Serengeti or Ngorongoro Crater (bear in mind these will involve a lot of travel time to and from the park, and therefore much more limited time actually on safari)."

African safari travel is synonymous with wildlife, and in this national park we usually see Elephant, Giraffe, Zebra and Antelope from the roadside. Passing through lush mountainous landscape and plantations - we enter Malawi which is dominated by its huge freshwater lake. Camping in Malawi sums up the spirit of an Africa overland trip with Oasis. We spend several days at friendly laid back campsites where most people choose to relax on the sandy beaches or try their hand at scuba diving, snorkelling or windsurfing as we follow the lakeshore south. If you are more inclined to just relax - then there is no better place than on the shores of Lake Malawi. This really is a warm friendly country - making it easy to wander off and meet up with your local hosts in one of the many villages or schools nearby. You can also view first hand the talent of the local artisans and purchase some exquisite pieces of furniture and carvings made out of ebony and mahogany."

        "description": "Bulawayo Victoria Falls If we can, then from Bulawayo we like to follow a journey that is steeped in history and say goodbye to the truck for a night and take the overnight train from Bulawayo to the mighty Victoria Falls. However, in recent years the service has been unreliable at best, and not suitable for us to use. Your crew will update you whether we think we can include this on your trip. If we can, then expect basic conditions, but the views and experience of looking out the window and watching the world go by more than make up for it. Alternatively we will drive from Bulawayo to Victoria Falls, arriving late in the afternoon. For some, Mosi oa Tunya - The Smoke That Thunders, is the highlight of their African safari. From the main road, in the bush 20kms away, a cloud of mist and spray can be seen against the blue sky. As you get closer, a low rumble like thunder can be heard. When you arrive it is a surprise to discover the enormity of Victoria Falls. One mile wide and hurling over 5 million cubic metres of water a minute into the Zambezi Gorge this sight is breath taking at any time of year. The water levels vary hugely depending on the time of year, but it is always an amazing spectacle - in fact it can actually be better when there is a little less water, as there is less spray blocking the falls from view. The Gorge below the falls is also the setting for one of the most adrenaline fuelled grade 5 white water rafting rivers in the world. But there is also plenty to do here for the less active too. Why not take a day trip over the Victoria Falls bridge to view the falls from Zambia, take the Flight of Angels - a great way to get a birds eye view of the falls in a microlight or helicopter, enjoy a civilised afternoon tea at the Victoria Falls Hotel, join a Sunset Boat Cruise or a more sedate Canoe trip. For those who want to make the most of the adrenaline activities, get your fix with the Gorge Swing, Abseil or 'enjoy' one of the highest commercial Bungee Jumps in the world."

You will have a chance to spend the afternoon on an included boat cruise on the Chobe River - a less intrusive way to view game and wildlife - as well as the Namibian frontier across the river. There is also time to take an optional game safari into the park if you wish. We then head south into the Kalahari Basin - known for its dry, desolate and expansive plains. On our way we will pass the Nata Bird Sanctuary, and the Makgadikgadi Salt Pans, one of the largest salt flats in the world. After we arrive in Maun, you will have an opportunity to leave the truck to venture into the Okavango Delta. Local poler guides will navigate the extensive waterways using canoes similar to their traditional Mokoro's (dug out canoes). This is a great experience - and a great way to have a chance of seeing some of elusive wildlife of this unique desert oasis. After the mokoro trip on the water, you will have a number of opportunities to go on game walks with rangers - giving you the chance to see elephant, crocodile and hippo up close and personal. The Okavango Delta is one of the world's largest inland waterways and its calming serenity will leave those who experience it feeling supremely relaxed.

Here there are isolated waterfalls, cool rock pools ideal for swimming, and peaceful hikes in the surrounding hills. This is also a great place to try pony trekking - one of the best ways to enjoy the scenery is atop a sure footed Lesotho pony. We drive through the lowlands of Lesotho and visit Thabo Bosiu or Mt. Moorosi with a local guide (time & weather permitting). This mountain stronghold was the home of Chief Moshoeshoe, the founder of the Basotho nation. We continue through Lesotho's tiny capital Maseru, and re-enter South Africa."

The Tugela River plunges spectacularly over the edge of the Amphitheatre wall, dropping around 800m through a series of five falls. There are over 130km of walking trails around the park-many of which are easy, half day strolls, through beautiful countryside of grassland dotted with patches of yellowwood forest and proteas set against the stunning backdrop of the Amphitheatre. Heading north we pass through small towns and villages, through Afrikaaner heartland, making our way to South Africa’s largest city, Johannesburg. Built as a result of the gold rush, the city has grown into one of the wealthiest cities in the world.

Rivers, lagoons, savannah, woodland, Moremi offers some excellent game viewing.

We spend our time on game drives in Moremi GR and the surrounding concession along the Khwai River where the lagoons attract the thirsty animals to drink in late afternoon. Our lodge is on the private concession north of Moremi, where our boma overlooks a large pan where we enjoy our meals while watching the animals drinking and enjoy the wilderness far from civilization. On the morning of day 10 we have one last game drive on the concession before heading back to our lodge in Maun. [2 x tented bush lodge, 1 x lodge Bx3, Lx3, Dx2]"

This makes the Okavango Delta, as this swamp is known, one of the largest inland deltas on Earth and a true natural wonder. The delta islands are home to a vast array of wildlife, including all the usual suspects, though numbers reach their peak during the dryer winter months when animals, including many of the larger ones, migrate here. We head into the delta in mokoro dugout canoes poled by local villagers who have grown up here. Camping with our local guides, we learn more about their lifestyle and culture; in the evening of Day 5, we're also treated to traditional music and dance of the BaYei and Hambukushu ethnic groups, an unforgettable chance to learn more about their culture. The camp will be put up by the polers and we use canvas dome tents with camp stretchers, mattresses, sleeping bags and pillows provided. There is also a gazebo for shade, which doubles as a mess tent. Please note, you only need to take luggage for two nights – bags will be provided. In the delta, we get to experience African wilderness at its fullest, not least at night when the Milky Way can be seen across the sky with a billion twinkling stars.

    "generalInfo": "The remote and rugged nature of the Botswanan wilderness means that often the best and only way to get around, particularly quickly is with a light aircraft. During this tour you will be taken from location to location in your own chartered plane, increasing time in the field, by decreasing transit times. <br/>Botswana is a legendary safari destination as it is home to one of the highest densities of predators in the world, and is one of the few places where African wild dogs can be frequently seen.  It harbours the largest concentrations of African elephants and cape buffalo anywhere in the world as well as having the largest inland delta in the world. So after all that it is no wonder why Botswana is a wildlife lovers paradise and this tour aims to showcase all the very best parts of this wonderful country, Moremi Game Reserve, Savuti and Chobe National Parks are all explored during this ten day adventure.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife safaris of Southern Africa including Botswana. Botswana is a huge country with some of the most photogenic and isolated wilderness anywhere in the world. Home to the world’s largest inland delta and the huge numbers of wildlife, any trip to Botswana is a must for wildlife enthusiasts.<br/><br/>It is hard not to be mesmerised by the wealth and abundance of wildlife everywhere in Botswana. It is because of the unparalleled populations of buffalo and elephants along with vast numbers of antelopes, zebra, giraffes and other herbivores that the country boasts some of the highest densities of large predators anywhere in the world. <br/> <br/>Lions and spotted hyenas are the most common species seen on safari<br/>here (as in many other African countries) but it is the frequent sightings of leopards and the fact that Botswana is the best place in the world for African wild dog sightings that make Botswanan safaris the best place in the world to go.<br/><br/>There are so many different places to visit in Botswana, this itinerary visits three of the most popular and best for wildlife sightings. Moremi, Savuti and Chobe are all visited here and time spent in each location on safaris. <br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Maun. We have our own private chartered light aircraft and air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers and game drives. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Botswana (and elsewhere in Southern Africa). Your zoologist or naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. Whilst the trip involves a lot of camps, these are not pitch your own tent camping camps, instead these are luxury tented camps where the tents are permanent and you do not need to bring any camping equipment or sleeping bags with you. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the Botswanan wilderness, night safaris are available in some locations (subject to the local conditions on that day). You will have to speak to your guide on arrival there and book places on these (this is not included). A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>Northern Botswana stays completely dry during September, but the centre and south may receive a few scattered showers. Temperatures climb rapidly throughout the month and no longer drop below 0°C, even in the Kalahari. Average lows are between 10°C and 15°C, a bit cooler in the south and warmer in the north. By the end of September, the days are hot everywhere, averaging over 30°C and approaching 40°C in Maun and Kasane. September is another busy month in Botswana, and the popular northern camps should be booked well in advance.<br/><br/>September and October are particularly impressive along the Chobe and Linyanti Rivers. Thousands of animals rely on these waters for survival, especially elephants. Moremi is also excellent in September, although by now the days are getting very hot. The dry, thin vegetation makes for excellent wildlife viewing and the cooler mornings and evenings are best for predator spotting as they come to the channels to drink. By September, the Okavango’s barbell (catfish) run is in full swing and it’s also prime time for tigerfish in the northwest panhandle. In September, the Kalahari and pans are almost at their driest, but the full October heat has yet to arrive. <br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced zoologist or naturalist guides as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>• Our zoologist (please check the availability of our specialist zoologists for this trip when enquiring) that escorts all our safaris has great experience working with and studying wild animals all over the world and has experience in working with large mammals on 6 continents.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it. We do our best to include as many wildlife activities as possible in all of our itineraries.<br/>• Depending on budget and interest we have a range of different accommodation packages to offer, from luxury top end lodges, national park safari lodges and mobile-camps which often offer unbelievable wildlife watching deep inside national parks as well as camping. We can also arrange mobile camping safaris of Botswana is very popular and all of your camping gear will be provided.<br/>• Spend all the daylight hours searching for wildlife and visiting various natural wonders and stunning landscapes.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our Botswana wildlife safaris a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Southern Africa so that we can try and find and observe some of the rarer and more elusive species. We have great itineraries and expertise in all Southern African countries (Namibia, South Africa, Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Mozambique) and can arrange trips to find some of the rarer species such as aardvarks, aardwolves, brown hyenas and black-footed cats among other species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour visit various locations within Botswana, however they are all in the north of the country. We will start and end the trip in the capital Maun and then move north and into the heart of the Okovango Delta and the reserves of Moremi, Savuti and Chobe National Park. The trip ends with a short trip over the border to Zimbabwe and a visit to the incredible and iconic Victoria Falls.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from a vehicle and whilst there is some walking, most of the walking is over flat terrain. This doesn't require any special fitness level. The biggest consideration is the heat, it is very hot in the wilderness of Botswana during the day.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 12 Years Old<br/><br/>Photo Credits:<br/><br/>By Kgosi Kai - Own work,<br/>Diego Delso<br/>Joachim Huber<br/>By Winfried Bruenken (Amrum) - Own work",

It's also ideal for spotting bird life such as saddle-billed storks, malachite kingfishers, fish eagles and beautiful bee-eaters, as well as hippos and crocodiles. Why not grab a sundowner from the small bar onboard, then sit back and watch the sunset over the river – a perfect way to end the day."

On this moving day we shall do a mokoro excursion in the calmer back-waters of the Khwai and Mbudi channels as opposed to doing the mokoro in the quicker moving section of the Khwai River that runs through Mababe. Habitat: The Manuchira Channel is known as the Khwai River at its eastern most extremity. The day’s journey follows this water course, with the track weaving from the riverside and floodplains into the mopane veld and the woodlands that to the Mababe Private Reserve where we camp on the banks of the Khwai River before it flows out and into the Mababe Depression. We pass the magnificent Dombo Hippo Pools in the morning stopping to enjoy the scenery and the antics of the resident hippo and shall game drive through Khwai until we reach Mababe. Wildlife: The south-east mopane veld is home to mostly breeding herds of elephant whilst the more northern reaches of Mababe is home to some impressive old bulls. The mature bulls revel in the cool waters of the Khwai River and are far more approachable while drinking and bathing than the breeding herds. The river has an unusually high density of hippo as well as some huge crocodile. Leopard- (western part of NG41), cheetah, serval and lion are common predators along this route and both Xakanaxa as well as Mababe are included in the home ranges of different packs of wild dog. General game includes southern giraffe, Burchell’s zebra, tsessebe and red lechwe with roan and sable antelope being less common residents."

Exploring after dark with spotlights offers you an opportunity to experience some of the nocturnal animals that are rarely encountered during the day. We will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding wilderness on foot (please note that this activity is seasonal based on rains and grass height, your guide will determine the safety of walking in Mababe) to enjoy an up close and personal encounter with Botswana’s flora and fauna. It is important to note that night drives and guided walks are not permitted within the national parks and reserves. These activities are conducted outside the boundaries of the Moremi Game Reserve in the Mababe Private Reserve. Habitat: We spend our time between the dry-land habitats of the lead-wood and camel-thorn woodlands and savannahs and the riverside and marshy back-waters of the Khwai. Wildlife: The Khwai region boasts excellent populations of both bull elephant as well as breeding herds. Lion, leopard, serval and African wildcat are common predators of the region with wild dog and cheetah being less common. Buffalo use this area seasonally with large herds moving in during the summer rains. The swampy areas in the west are home to red lechwe.

The most challenging part of the trip is crossing the Magwikwe Sand-ridge that formed the shoreline for this massive inland sea. The winding track through this deep sand makes for interesting travel in the early summer! The old lake bed is now the Mababe Depression. The dense clay floor of the depression result in high protein feed for wildlife and the area teams with game after the rains. During the rainy season the depression is impassable due to the “cotton soil” and alternative routes must be used. Wildlife: A day when anything could happen.

Large outcrops of volcanic rock reach up out of the Kalahari sands, towering over the endless savannah. These hills provide habitat for a completely different array of small wildlife, birds and plants. The Savuti Marsh has been the stage for many of the most dramatic wildlife documentaries in Africa. The wide open country, good ungulate populations and particularly strong prides of lion and hyaena clans make for dramatic wildlife interaction and excellent viewing opportunities. The now dry Savuti Channel runs through this landscape linking the dry sand-veld, the waterholes, the hills and the grassland that was the Savuti Marsh. Wildlife: Undoubtedly it is the interaction between lion and elephant that is the most interesting aspect of Savuti. The area is inhabited by a huge pride of lions with numbers fluctuating from 20-30 members. These remarkable lions have learned over the years how to hunt these massive pachyderms that are supposedly above predation. Launching their attack under darkness and using their numbers, they manage to kill adolescent and even young adult elephant. The marsh is prime cheetah country and in the wet season it is not unusual to have the wild dog hunting here in Central Chobe."

As today is a long day we recommend either spending a night or two in Kasane at Chobe Safari Lodge or two nights in Livingstone at Taita Falcon Lodge or Victoria Falls at Ilala. For those transferring to lodges in Kasane or across to Zambia/Zimbabwe it is recommended that your transfer be organized to meet you at Kalahari Tours at 15h30. Habitat: The habitat on today’s drive takes us through the stunted mopane scrub of the Goha clay basin, across the sand-ridge and through the wonderful Zambezi teak woodlands of the Chobe Forest Reserve and along the Chobe River itself. The Chobe floodplain is tens of kilometers wide and in years of exceptional rains the water stretches as far as the eye can see. Wildlife: While there are community areas that we pass through that are settled by local tribes, for the vast majority of the day’s drive we pass through wild country where wildlife moves un-inhibited by fences or man. Roan and sable antelope thrive in the teak woodlands where the low density of predators and lack of competition for food by other ungulates makes this prime habitat for these large ungulates. Leopard occur in these woodlands in low numbers but they are highly secretive and seldom seen. The Goha region has natural waterholes that hold water well into the dry season and herds of buffalo, Burchell’s zebra, greater kudu and elephant come down to drink."

Moremi Game Reserve rates as one of the leading wildlife areas of the world and we take our open 4WD vehicle into Moremi for fantastic game viewing! Grasslands, floodplains, forests, lily lagoons and winding water channels combine to form a variety of game viewing habitats. Moving north over the sand ridge and into the Mababe depression we arrive at the Savuti Marsh. This open grassland area attracts herds of zebra and wildebeest, which in turn draw the large lion prides for which Savuti is famous. We camp wild in the central Chobe National Park at either Savuti or Zwei-Zwei."

Transport for the entirety of this safari you travel in a custom-built 4WD Land Cruiser with 12 forward facing seats (of which 8 are “window” seats). Roll up canvas sides allow you to feel part of the bush. Limited participation - An essential part of your safari is some participation. From putting up your tent to packing the truck in the morning–it’s all part of your adventure and when everyone puts in a little effort the trip will run smoothly. Your tour leaders will do all the meal preparation, but we do ask the clients to help (on rotation) with the washing up. If there are 9 or more clients on the tour, then a supply vehicle and camp assistant travel with the group through the national parks (days 5-10). The camp assistant will help with meal preparation and washing up and make your life a little easier!<br/>",

As the world’s largest curtain of falling water, Zimbabwe’s Victoria Falls is a phenomenal natural wonder. It’s a UNESCO World Heritage site and one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World, and is an unmissable sight for any trip to Zimbabwe. What you decide to do at this incredible site depends on when you travel to Victoria Falls, as river levels dictate which activities are safe. However, with such a wide variety of activities at Victoria Falls, there’s always something to see or do. Soak up the falls with a scenic and spray-filled river walk or boat ride, or swim in the Devil’s Pool, the world’s ultimate infinity pool. See the Victoria Falls from a birds-eye view with a breathtaking helicopter ride or a micro-light flight over the gorge."

The park is home to immense herds of elephants, cape buffaloes, and impalas, along with lions, leopards, and African wild dogs. <br/><br/>You’ll spend two nights at a superb river camp on the bank of the Zambezi, its tented chalets constructed sustainably with locally sourced materials and traditional techniques.

It’s a complete contrast to the bush and riverine setting of Chobe further north. <br/><br/>Early starts are common on this trip. Not only do they allow you to beat the crowds to popular wildlife-viewing spots, but they also allow for the best sightings of some animals that are at their most active shortly after dawn. One example is the meerkat, and you’ll head out to find a resident family as they forage and frolic, and hopefully pose for some photos.<br/><br/>The final stop of your Botswana trip, and another stunning change of scenery, is the Okavango Delta,  its waterways teeming with animals from hippos to crocodiles. The best way to see them is from a traditional dugout canoe, known as a mokoro . You can also take a scenic flight above the delta if you wish, for some spectacular bird’s eye views.<br/>",

Nxai Pan is well known for its huge springbok population and once the rains have started, gemsbok, elephant and zebras migrate to the region. At this time zebras come in their thousands to drop their young at Nxai Pan. These large herds of zebra, springbok and wildebeest attract many predators – lion, cheetah, jackal and both spotted and the elusive brown hyena, as well as the endangered wild dog and the secretive leopard. Activities include game drives in open 4x4 vehicles, stargazing, day trips to Baines’ Baobab and nature walks in the vicinity of the camp with the bushman staff. Following breakfast on the final day transfer to the airstrip for your flight to Maun where your Botswanan adventure finishes on arrival."

The Okavango has many faces, which change throughout the year, prompted by that most unpredictable phenomenon of all: the weather. Water levels rise and drop, expanding and shrinking islands, while animals move where the life is easiest and the grass greenest.

In Nxai Pan the landscape is dominated by short, yellow grasses, which turn green with the summer rains, worn down to white soil where zebras have made paths across the pan. Much of Nxai Pan can be explored in a day, however the real reason to visit is to take a slower pace and watch the waterholes as the wildlife arrives to drink. If you’re lucky, your patience might pay off as a hungry cheetah charges a thirsty springbok, sending a shower of dust over the waterhole.

The fourth rock, which stands apart from the others, is said to be the male's first wife. Some of the paintings are thought to be up to 24,000 years old, and as well as the chance to see ancient rock paintings, the hills offer vast views across the countryside below.

The drive takes us north to Namibia's Caprivi Strip, before heading to the riverside town of Kasane, in Botswana. The Caprivi Region has a colourful and interesting history, playing a central part in the Berlin Conference of 1890. Named after German Chancellor General Count Georg Leo von Caprivi di Caprara di Montecuccoli, the strip was once administered by the British before it was swapped for Zanzibar with the Germans at a time of great European political manoeuvring. We'll arrive in Kasane in the late-afternoon, just in time for a refreshing sundowner at our lodge on the banks of the Chobe River. A major draw of Chobe is its elephant population - it's considered to be the largest surviving continuous elephant population in Africa and is currently estimated at 120,000 strong.

In the late afternoon we'll board our boat and soak up the evening atmosphere on our sunset river cruise. Sit back and relax while sipping a cold drink and enjoying a few quiet hours along the mighty Zambezi River.

The San Bushmen community believe the hills are the site of the first creation and they painted an astonishing 4,000 rock paintings across 350 sites marking the area's significance. Here, four impressive rocks jut out of the expanse of the surrounding land, and it's believed by the San Bushmen that the largest of the rocks is the 'man', the second largest the 'woman', and the smallest the 'child'. The fourth rock, which stands apart from the others, is said to be the male's first wife. Some of the paintings are thought to be over 24,000 years old, and as well as the chance to see ancient rock paintings, the hills offer vast views across the countryside below. An expert local guide will accompany us around the site, interpreting a selection of the paintings. The tour will last around two hours, walking along a flat well-graded path. It's possible to opt out at any stage and return to the shade of the small museum located at the entrance of the site. After a late lunch back on board the houseboat, we'll head out for further wildlife viewing on board our launch.

        "description": "CAPE TOWN TO LESOTHO We depart from Cape Town taking a leisurely drive along the coastal road to the quaint coastal town of Betty's Bay in the Overberg and visit Stony Point Nature Reserve, home to a unique colony of African (Jackass) penguins. The Penguin Colony is one of only three mainland-based colonies in South Africa and for this reason it is treasured. We overnight in Hermanus/Gansbaai and the next day there are a number of marine options- Whale watching, Shark Cave Diving and Dyer Island Nature Reserve. From here we will head for the most southern tip of Africa at Cape Agulhas - which is the dividing line between the warm Indian Ocean and the cooler Atlantic Ocean. The seas around Cape Agulhas are very treacherous and have caused numerous shipwrecks. To help reduce fatalities the Cape Agulhas Lighthouse was built in 1848 and is the 2nd oldest working lighthouse in South Africa. From August to December Southern Right and Humpback Whales may be spotted along the coast - as they feed in the nutrient rich waters off the southern coast. From Cape Agulhas we pass through the Outeniqua Mountains to the Little Karoo - we will visit an Ostrich farm to learn more about the worlds largest bird. The Ostrich has been around for 8 million years and a feather was actually discovered in King Tutankhamun's tomb in Egypt. 97% of the world's population of Ostriches lives in the Karoo. We will also explore Cango Calcite Caves recognised as one of the world's finest network of Calcite caves. The bizarre formations of Stalagmites and Stalactites represent over a million years of slow formation. We spend two days winding our way along South Africa's famous Garden Route where there is a wealth of things to see and do. We travel through the popular resort of Knysna, located on a tranquil lagoon that is protected from the sea by two enormous cliffs known as 'the heads'. We visit the Tsitsikamma Forest, where you will be able to hike along the coast and view the crashing waves at the mouth of the scenic Storms River, and maybe spot dolphins and whales in the ocean. Optional excursions in this region include mountain biking, black water tubing, and the mother of all bungee jumps at Bloakrans Bridge - the highest jump in the world at 216 metres. From the Garden Route we head inland to Addo Elephant National Park which has recently been extended to include part of the coast and is now home to the BIG 7 - lion, rhino, elephant, leopard, buffalo, whale and shark! On our game drive we hope to spot some of the many elephant that the park is famous for, which are the most southerly population in Africa. Heading north we make our way towards the mountain Kingdom of Lesotho."

        "description": "LESOTHO TO ESWATINI Lesotho, often referred to as 'the kingdom in the sky'. This little country is completely surrounded by South Africa and is covered by mountains from 1000m to 3000m high. The scenery here is tremendous and the mountain air crisp and fresh. Here we will see Lesotho's horsemen dressed in their blankets and gumboots trotting around the hillsides. We spend a couple of nights at Malealea Lodge, Lesotho's most famous countryside retreat tucked up high in the mountains. Here there are isolated waterfalls, cool rock pools ideal for swimming, and peaceful hikes in the surrounding hills. This is also a great place to try pony trekking - one of the best ways to enjoy the scenery is atop a sure footed Lesotho pony. We drive through the lowlands of Lesotho and visit Thabo Bosiu or Mt. Moorosi with a local guide (time & weather permitting). This mountain stronghold was the home of Chief Moshoeshoe, the founder of the Basotho nation. We continue through Lesotho's tiny capital Maseru, and re-enter South Africa. Royal Natal National Park on the edge of the Drakensburg Mountains has an impressive natural Amphitheatre of massive rock walls. The Tugela River plunges spectacularly over the edge of the Amphitheatre wall, dropping around 800m through a series of five falls. There are over 130km of walking trails around the park-many of which are easy, half day strolls, through beautiful countryside of grassland dotted with patches of yellowwood forest and proteas set against the stunning backdrop of the Amphitheatre. Heading east now, we reach the coast and the small town of St Lucia, famous for having the largest estuary in South Africa, plus the country’s highest concentration of hippos and crocodiles. Indeed the hippos can sometimes be seen walking through the streets at night. Boat trips to see the hippos and more wildlife are available, as well as safaris into the nearby iSamangaliso wetlands and Hluhluwe/iMfolozi National Park. Next we head north for the tiny country of Eswatini"

From Eswatini we head into the southern extent of the iconic Kruger National Park to search for the Big 5 in one of the world’s best wildlife areas. We will also drive part of the Panorama Route before crossing into Mozambique. Our first stop is then in the lively capital Maputo, which is home to Portuguese colonial architecture, a fortress , cathedral and art museum all worth visiting. In the evenings we can take advantage of Maputo’s reputation as one of the best places to go out in southern Africa, visiting some of the salsa bars, sidewalk cafes and nightclubs."

As well as over 11,000 elephants, the park hosts a wide range of other wildlife that can be seen on safari. We make our way through the Eastern Highlands of Zimbabwe, and visit Chimanimani National Park where you have the opportunity to take a hike through the mountain wilderness area, or hike to the nearby bridal veil falls, or simply enjoying the stunning surroundings from this sleepy village whilst strolling through the village market. We may also have time to visit Vumba Botanic Gardens. Another stop is at the Great Zimbabwe Ruins, once the greatest medieval city in Sub Saharan Africa and where the name Zimbabwe is derived, literally meaning house of stone. We then travel across Mashonaland to Bulawayo where you have the option for a day to venture into Matobo National Park with a local safari company. You will have a unique chance to get out on foot to try and spot the elusive Black Rhino - amongst other game. There is also the opportunity to visit Cecil Rhodes' grave and Ancient Rock Paintings."

These salt pans are the largest in the world, and an eerie and awe inspiring sight. We’ll continue on the Trans-Kalahari highway towards Maun, the gateway to the Okavango Delta. Here you will have an opportunity to leave the truck to venture into the Okavango Delta. Local poler guides will navigate the extensive waterways using canoes similar to their traditional Mokoro's (dug out canoes). This is a great experience - and the best way to have a chance of seeing the elusive wildlife of this unique desert oasis. You will have a number of opportunities to go on game walks with rangers - giving you the chance to see elephant, crocodile and hippo up close and personal. The Okavango Delta is one of the world's largest inland waterways and its calming serenity will leave those who experience it feeling supremely relaxed.

After your adrenaline has been spent, we will head north through Zambia to Lake Kariba which is the largest artificial lake in the world, and also has the biggest man-made dam on the planet too, 226km long and up to 40km wide! At Siavonga there is the option to spend the night on a houseboat on the lake, watching over crocodiles and hippos and perhaps doing some fishing. Further north we stop at South Luangwa National Park which has one of biggest concentrations of wildlife in all of Africa, especially around the Luangwa River and its oxbow lagoons. The park is well known for its walking safaris, and one of the few places you can get up close with such a wide range of wildlife in Africa on foot. We leave Zambia now and cross into Malawi."

This will give you the opportunity to post gifts home or check out the local markets. Passing through lush mountainous landscape and plantations we are soon following the coast of Lake Malawi - the country’s most dominant natural feature. Camping in Malawi sums up the spirit of an Africa overland trip with Oasis. We spend several days at friendly laid back campsites where most people choose to relax on the sandy beaches or try their hand at scuba diving , snorkelling or windsurfing as we follow the lakeshore north. If you are more inclined to just relax - then there is no better place than on the shores of Lake Malawi. This really is a warm friendly country - making it easy to wander off and meet up with your local hosts in one of the many villages or schools nearby. You can view first hand the talent of the local artisans and purchase some exquisite pieces of furniture and carvings out of ebony and mahogany. The next country on our journey is Tanzania, and after a day and half drive we pass through the peaceful Mikumi National Park. African safari travel is synonymous with wildlife, and in this national park we usually see Elephant, Giraffe, Zebra and Antelope from the roadside. From here we continue travelling through the interesting and mountainous hinterland of Tanzania. Our route north then brings us to Dar Es Salaam where our truck is based in a campsite on a beautiful Indian Ocean beach. From here you will take the ferry out to Zanzibar Island for four nights and venture into the narrow bustling streets of Stone Town and its famous spice markets, old slave forts and dungeons. There is also time to relax on Zanzibar's famous white beaches, scuba dive or snorkel and swim with dolphins- before returning to Dar Es Salaam."

We will stop off at Marangu where you have the opportunity to climb to Kilimanjaro base camp or take a walk through the lush surroundings passing through coffee plantations, rivers, waterfalls, caves and visiting a local blacksmith (there is not time to do the full summit climb unless you miss the Serengeti safari option). We then continue to Arusha, and while at our camp on the outskirts of Arusha you have the option to book an add-on and travel with our local African safari partners through the Ngorongoro Crater and the Serengeti National Park. In these parks you will have the opportunity to view the abundant wildlife including Elephant, Lion, Cheetah, White Rhino, Buffalo, Hippo, Antelope, Crocodile and Pink Flamingos and of course the famous migrating Wildebeest. For those who wish - there is an option to visit a local Maasai Village and learn about their culture and way of life."

These drums were symbols of power during the monarchy, beaten during special events and are an important part of the country’s heritage. We then arrive at Bumumbura, a port city on Lake Tanganyika, where the country’s main export, coffee, is shipped from. Boat trips through Rusizi National Park here provide viewings of crocodiles and hippos as well as many water birds. The lake also has many beautiful beaches and laid back villages to explore. Leaving Burundi now, we cross into Rwanda and drive to the capital Kigali where you can visit the Genocide Memorial."

Here you can take optional treks into the forest to see the famous Golden Moneys, visit the Musanze caves and several hiking trails, or take a village tour throughout the area where you can see first hand production of local Banana beer. We’ll then head out of the hills and cross the border into Uganda, where our first stop is at the village of Kabale which will give you the opportunity to trek the Mountain Gorillas and visit the beautiful Lake Bunyonyi. Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park and Mgahinga Gorilla National Park are home to several families of Highland Mountain Gorillas. Getting up close to these amazing creatures is a truly a once in a lifetime experience and one of the highlights of the trip. You have the opportunity to trek to see the Gorillas in Uganda (bookable as an Add on). It is estimated that only around 700 of these gentle giants remain. This mountainous area on the borders of Rwanda, Uganda and Zaire (now renamed Democratic Republic of Congo) is their only natural habitat and they are periodically threatened by poachers and political instability in the area. One permit allows you to spend about 50 to 60 minutes with one of the gorilla families. Trekking to find them in groups of 8 people can take anywhere from half an hour to 5 hours. The organisations and well-trained guides that continually monitor and protect the families are conscientious and responsible. (Due to the popularity of Trekking to the Mountain Gorillas and the limited availability of obtaining Trekking Permits, those booking late may need to do the Gorilla trek in Rwanda in Volcanos National Park, which may come at an additional cost - you will be advised in advance). We head East again now, and spend a night at Lake Mburo National Park, perhaps taking a nighttime safari drive, before driving onwards through swamps, patches of forest and fertile green countryside. As we travel through Uganda, we'll pass through a number of small towns and villages; Mpigi, where you will see roadside stalls manufacturing and selling traditional musical instruments; Kyazanga, where we can buy fresh rotisserie and roasted meat and vegetables, as well as roasted plantain bananas. We will also be able to make a photo stop where our route crosses the Equator on the way to Kampala. Kampala has had a turbulent past, but these days it is a friendly and safe city. We have some free time to spend in local cafes and nightspots - where you can get to know the local people."

Here, on the edge of Lake Victoria, the Nile begins its 6700km journey to the sea. We spend the next few days downstream from the source of the Nile. This is a spectacular area, and a superb place to go whitewater rafting or kayaking. You can also organise quad biking , horse riding or a visit to a local education project. Our next highlight is the spectacular Sipi Falls. There are three waterfalls here on the Sipi River as it cascades into the Kyoga Basin from the slopes of Mount Elgon. The highest is just under 100m and there is an exciting abseiling option available here. After leaving the Sipi Falls we cross into Kenya and Lake Nakuru National Park - home to a wide variety of wildlife including Black Rhino, Hippo, Lion, Leopard, Hyena and Giraffe. However, Nakuru is a soda lake and most famous for its pink inhabitants, a flock of almost a million Pink Flamingos which feed noisily along the shoreline. Finally, the group will all go on a morning and afternoon game drive in 4x4 safari vehicles with local guides in one of the world's most famous National Parks, the Maasai Mara. Here you will have the opportunity to look out for all its incredible wildlife before making our way back to Nairobi, arriving in the early evening"

But be prepared for long journeys on this trip, with camping along the way. It isn’t five star travel, but you will have five star experiences. Starting in South Africa these include Cape Town, Cape Point Nature Reserve and the African Penguin colony at Boulders Beach. <br/><br/>Heading north towards Namibia, we spend a week of our trip in this magnificent country, exploring the contrasts of its coastline to the wildlife filled salt pans at Etosha, or the famous dunes at Sossusvlei in the Namib Desert. We also have a very memorable time with the San Bushmen community, the oldest ethnic group in Namibia, learning about their lifestyles and culture. <br/><br/>Moving into Botswana, the Okavango Delta is Africa’s largest inland delta and an oasis for wildlife, which we will explore on traditional dugout canoes or mokoros. More spectacular wildlife awaits in the contrasting landscapes of Chobe National Park, Botswana’s first national park. We spend two days here giving us plenty of time to enjoy an area with one of the highest densities of wildlife in Africa, especially elephants as there are huge herds of them here. <br/><br/>Huge is the first word that comes to mind on your final stage of this African odyssey, and that is at Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe. Nothing beats a waterfall of over a hundred metres tall, twice the height of Niagara, to bring a mammoth trip like this to a dramatic close. <br/>",

There are no boundary fences separating the village from the park and game such as elephant and hippo are often spotted roaming around the town. If on the lookout for elusive game, pay a visit to the Sedudu Valley Road, where large dead trees provide temporary homes for leopards. Within Kasane, an ancient baobab tree stands on display, once serving as a local prison. Visitors can look forward to a multitude of activities including: enjoying a game drive through the park, taking a sunset cruise down the Chobe River, visiting a local village or jumping on a day trip to the breathtaking Victoria Falls. The Chobe Boat Cruise is a wonderful way to experience the Chobe National Park. Puku and lechwe antelopes are common on the Chobe Floodplains and herds of elephants can be seen crossing the Chobe River to the islands. Other common sites are hippos and crocodiles basking in the sun. There are a variety of boating options for the Chobe boat cruises. Guests can join a standard cruise on a river cruiser taking about 30-40 people or have the opportunity to take a smaller boat and focus on photography and birding. The bigger boats have bars on board for drinks and soft drinks. All Chobe boat cruises depart from Kasane, the town which borders onto the Chobe national park. There are regular afternoon and morning departures. One of the original natural wonders of the world, the Victoria Falls is breathtaking and not suprisingly a World Heritage Site. Known locally as ‘The Smoke that Thunders’ this spectacle is accessible from both Zambia and Zimbabwe. Unlike other waterfalls, Victoria Falls has a natural catwalk across from the falls which provides spectacular viewing."

Our Foundation is proudly partnered with Helping Rhinos, which directly supports the work of the Black Mambas - the world's first all-female anti-poaching unit. Made up of a team of 36 young African women, the Mambas patrol 20,000 hectares of the Balule Nature Reserve, part of Greater Kruger National Park. Turning a traditionally male-dominated industry on its head, they’re putting their female prowess to work protecting the wildlife of Kruger National Park in an unconventional kind of way. You'll join them on a bush walk to learn how they find and destroy snares firsthand. Enjoy a special dinner by lantern light, and later, relax by the campfire with the Mambas as they share stories about their path to becoming Black Mambas and conservation work."

On arrival, perhaps stretch your legs with an optional guided hike through this beautiful national heritage site where perennial streams have carved deep gorges into the hills. Along the hike, you can stop at beautiful waterfalls cascading into deep pools surrounded by lush vegetation. The gorges are home to many birds that feed on fish and small crabs in the pools and are breeding grounds for the endangered Cape vulture. Baboons and rock rabbits live on the cliffs above the gorge and, though very elusive, leopards, hyenas and kudu can also be found here."

Surrounded by the Kalahari Desert, the pans are naturally dry and salty for a large part of the year.

You’ll enjoy absolutely spectacular wildlife-watching throughout: on the floor of Ngorongoro Crater, roaming the Serengeti, on the riverbanks of the Okavango Delta, from horseback on a game ranch in Zimbabwe. These safaris are led by hugely knowledgeable local guides able not only to point out the animals to you, but to explain their behaviours.

That might be spending an hour with a Maasai elder in their village to learn a little about their traditional ways of life. It could be the satisfaction of clambering to the summit of a towering Sossusvlei sand dune to take in the sunset.

Various game, usually zebra and giraffe can be seen as we head south and cross the border into Tanzania. We spend the night at Meserani Snake Park, on the route from Arusha to the Serengeti. Over the next 3 days you can take our optional Add-on to enjoy a safari into the Serengeti National Park and Ngorongoro Crater. These areas are one of the world's great wildlife hotspots, and you are sure to see a huge variety of different game species including Elephant, Lion, Cheetah, White Rhino, Buffalo, Hippo, Antelope, Crocodile and Pink Flamingos as well as vast herds of wildebeest roaming the plains. For those who don't want to add this safari experience onto the trip, there are options to visit the Snake Park, visit a local Masai Village to learn about their culture and way of life. You can also arrange day trips into the Serengeti or Ngorongoro Crater (bear in mind these will involve a lot of travel time to and from the park, and therefore much more limited time actually on safari)."

However, in recent years the service has been unreliable at best, and not suitable for us to use. Your crew will update you whether we think we can include this on your trip. If we can, then expect basic conditions, but the views and experience of looking out the window and watching the world go by more than make up for it. Alternatively we will drive from Bulawayo to Victoria Falls, arriving late in the afternoon. For some, Mosi oa Tunya - The Smoke That Thunders, is the highlight of their African safari. From the main road, in the bush 20kms away, a cloud of mist and spray can be seen against the blue sky. As you get closer, a low rumble like thunder can be heard. When you arrive it is a surprise to discover the enormity of Victoria Falls. One mile wide and hurling over 5 million cubic metres of water a minute into the Zambezi Gorge this sight is breath taking at any time of year. The water levels vary hugely depending on the time of year, but it is always an amazing spectacle - in fact it can actually be better when there is a little less water, as there is less spray blocking the falls from view. The Gorge below the falls is also the setting for one of the most adrenaline fuelled grade 5 white water rafting rivers in the world. But there is also plenty to do here for the less active too. Why not take a day trip over the Victoria Falls bridge to view the falls from Zambia, take the Flight of Angels - a great way to get a birds eye view of the falls in a microlight or helicopter, enjoy a civilised afternoon tea at the Victoria Falls Hotel, join a Sunset Boat Cruise or a more sedate Canoe trip. For those who want to make the most of the adrenaline activities, get your fix with the Gorge Swing, Abseil or 'enjoy' one of the highest commercial Bungee Jumps in the world."

There is also time to take an optional game safari into the park if you wish. We then head south into the Kalahari Basin - known for its dry, desolate and expansive plains. On our way we will pass the Nata Bird Sanctuary, and the Makgadikgadi Salt Pans, one of the largest salt flats in the world. After we arrive in Maun, you will have an opportunity to leave the truck to venture into the Okavango Delta. Local poler guides will navigate the extensive waterways using canoes similar to their traditional Mokoro's (dug out canoes). This is a great experience - and a great way to have a chance of seeing some of elusive wildlife of this unique desert oasis. After the mokoro trip on the water, you will have a number of opportunities to go on game walks with rangers - giving you the chance to see elephant, crocodile and hippo up close and personal. The Okavango Delta is one of the world's largest inland waterways and its calming serenity will leave those who experience it feeling supremely relaxed.

Please see the trip inclusions for an approximate percentage of camping and room nights.

Stretching from the Dead Sea in Jordan down to Mozambique in Southern Africa, our first view is from the top of a steep escarpment. Overland trips through East Africa will allow you to experience some of the most dramatic scenery in the world, and the Rift Valley is a definite highlight. The valley floor seems to sweep on forever and is dotted with volcanic peaks, shimmering lakes and countless springs. Our journey takes us into the heart of the Rift Valley to Lake Naivasha. We camp near the lake shore where Hippos sometimes feed at night! Here you can walk to Elsamere, the house of Joy Adamson - of Elsa the Lion and Born Free fame, and enjoy a film of her life - and cream teas! You can also hire mountain bikes and cycle or walk through Hells Gate National Park - the only game reserve in Kenya in which you are permitted to do so. Or for a less active but equally enjoyable game viewing experience - visit the Crater Lake Game Sanctuary. Both offer excellent scenery and opportunities to spot hyrax, abundant bird and plant life along with several types of gazelle, impala and eland. Next we head to one of Africa’s most famous wildlife reserves, the Masai Mara. Famous for its dense concentration of animals and birds, and for its important place in the annual wildebeest migration (July to October), you will have a great chance to see lions, elephants, buffalo, leopards, cheetahs and also rhino if you are lucky.

Here we have a great opportunity to take an optional hike into the forest to see some habituated chimpanzee families. Permits need to be booked several months in advance, so please get in touch if you would like to add this experience. Only 12 permits are issued each day to minimize disruption to the animals, and a local guide will take you through the forest to find the group. You then have an hour watching and following them before returning to camp. You should see many other monkeys, birds and other wildlife during the trip too. If you don’t book the chimp trek, then various other walks are available in the forest to see waterfalls, birds, primates, and other wildlife. The forest has four main paths for nature walks, including the valley trail, the waterfall path, the river trail, and the Palm trail. These can all be arranged when you get there. After our day in the forest, we take a short drive to Katunguru on the edge of Queen Elizabeth National Park. We have a free morning here to take a wide range of optional village walks, learning about the culture of the Basongara, Bakonjo and Banyabindi who live in Queen Elizabeth National Park.

Getting up close to these amazing creatures is truly a once in a lifetime experience and one of the highlights of the trip. You have the opportunity to trek to see the Gorillas in Uganda (bookable as an Add on). It is estimated that only around 700 of these gentle giants remain. This mountainous area on the borders of Rwanda, Uganda and Zaire (now renamed Democratic Republic of Congo) is their only natural habitat and they are periodically threatened by poachers and political instability in the area. One permit allows you to spend about 50 to 60 minutes with one of the gorilla families. Trekking to find them in groups of 8 people can take anywhere from half an hour to 5 hours. The organisations and well-trained guides that continually monitor and protect the families are conscientious and responsible. We will base ourselves near the village of Kabale which will give you the opportunity to trek the Mountain Gorillas and visit the beautiful Lake Bunyonyi, where you will have the opportunity to visit a pygmy village. If permits are limited, we may adjust the itinerary slightly to spend an extra day here to give everyone in the group the opportunity to see the gorillas. After our latest forest adventure, we pass through mountain ranges and cross the border into Rwanda and continue to the capital, Kigali.

Thankfully these days things are a lot different and we spend a few days passing through the country. We then enter Zimbabwe and travel via the capital, Harare. Arriving into Zimbabwe's cosmopolitan city, you can enjoy many of the sights in and around the city centre. There are many markets throughout the city from craft markets to the hectic local Mbare market, and you can also stroll through the botanical gardens, or enjoy the nightlife in one of the many bars throughout the city."

You have the option of an exciting day's venture from here into Matobo National Park with a local safari company.

        "description": "Bulawayo Victoria Falls If we can, then from Bulawayo we like to follow a journey that is steeped in history and say goodbye to the truck for a night and take the overnight train from Bulawayo to the mighty Victoria Falls. However, in recent years the service has been unreliable at best, and not suitable for us to use. Your crew will update you whether we think we can include this on your trip. If we can, then expect basic conditions, but the views and experience of looking out the window and watching the world go by more than make up for it. Alternatively we will drive from Bulawayo to Victoria Falls, arriving late in the afternoon. For some, Mosi oa Tunya - The Smoke That Thunders, is the highlight of their African safari. From the main road, in the bush 20kms away, a cloud of mist and spray can be seen against the blue sky. As you get closer, a low rumble like thunder can be heard. When you arrive it is a surprise to discover the enormity of Victoria Falls. One mile wide and hurling over 5 million cubic metres of water a minute into the Zambezi Gorge this sight is breath taking at any time of year. The water levels vary hugely depending on the time of year, but it is always an amazing spectacle - in fact it can actually be better when there is a little less water, as there is less spray blocking the falls from view. The Gorge below the falls is also the setting for one of the most adrenaline fuelled grade 5 white water rafting rivers in the world. But there is also plenty to do here for the less active too. Why not take a day trip over the Victoria Falls bridge to view the falls from Zambia, take the Flight of Angels - a great way to get a birds eye view of the falls in a microlight or helicopter, enjoy a civilised afternoon tea at the Victoria Falls Hotel, join a Sunset Boat Cruise or a more sedate Canoe trip. For those who want to make the most of the adrenaline activities, get your fix with the Gorge Swing, Abseil or 'enjoy' one of the highest commercial Bungee Jumps in the world."

You will have a chance to spend the afternoon on an included boat cruise on the Chobe River - a less intrusive way to view game and wildlife - as well as the Namibian frontier across the river. There is also time to take an optional game safari into the park if you wish. We then head south into the Kalahari Basin - known for its dry, desolate and expansive plains. On our way we will pass the Nata Bird Sanctuary, and the Makgadikgadi Salt Pans, one of the largest salt flats in the world. After we arrive in Maun, you will have an opportunity to leave the truck to venture into the Okavango Delta. Local poler guides will navigate the extensive waterways using canoes similar to their traditional Mokoro's (dug out canoes). This is a great experience - and a great way to have a chance of seeing some of elusive wildlife of this unique desert oasis. After the mokoro trip on the water, you will have a number of opportunities to go on game walks with rangers - giving you the chance to see elephant, crocodile and hippo up close and personal. The Okavango Delta is one of the world's largest inland waterways and its calming serenity will leave those who experience it feeling supremely relaxed. There is also the opportunity to experience the heights of African adventure travel too"

From the Garden Route we continue along the coast and in the summer months (October to March) there will be an opportunity to stop at one of the beaches we pass before we head inland to Addo Elephant National Park which has recently been extended to include part of the coast and is now home to the BIG 7 - lion, rhino, elephant, leopard, buffalo, whale and shark! On our game drive we hope to spot some of the many elephant that the park is famous for, which are the most southerly population in Africa."

This little country is completely surrounded by South Africa and is covered by mountains from 1000m to 3000m high. The scenery here is tremendous and the mountain air crisp and fresh. Here we will see Lesotho's horsemen dressed in their blankets and gumboots trotting around the hillsides. We spend a couple of nights at Malealea Lodge, Lesotho's most famous countryside retreat tucked up high in the mountains. Here there are isolated waterfalls, cool rock pools ideal for swimming, and peaceful hikes in the surrounding hills. This is also a great place to try pony trekking - one of the best ways to enjoy the scenery is atop a sure footed Lesotho pony. We drive through the lowlands of Lesotho and visit Thabo Bosiu or Mt. Moorosi with a local guide (time & weather permitting). This mountain stronghold was the home of Chief Moshoeshoe, the founder of the Basotho nation. We continue through Lesotho's tiny capital Maseru, and re-enter South Africa."

There are over 130km of walking trails around the park-many of which are easy, half day strolls, through beautiful countryside of grassland dotted with patches of yellowwood forest and proteas set against the stunning backdrop of the Amphitheatre. Heading north we pass through small towns and villages, through Afrikaaner heartland, making our way to South Africa’s largest city, Johannesburg. Built as a result of the gold rush, the city has grown into one of the wealthiest cities in the world.

After our time with the Himba, we head to the country’s celebrated Etosha National park. Here we spend two days taking in the Etosha Pan’s superb wildlife including lions, elephants and rhinos. Before heading into Botswana on day seven of the trip, we take some time in Namibia’s capital city of Windhoek. <br/><br/>Botswana boasts the most spectacular array of wildlife experiences, the first being the Okavango Delta where we spend three days. Before that we spend time with the San community in Ghanzi, thought to be ancestors of all the world’s human beings, due to their high genetic diversity.  At Okavango, we explore the immense inland data on foot and by boat, taking in its network of winding channels and small forested islands. All of which act as a giant watering hole and feeding fest for 164 different mammal species. This is followed by a day at Chobe National Park, Botswana’s oldest park, which also has one of the highest densities of wildlife in Africa, especially elephant herds. <br/><br/>There are few better finales to a trip through southern Africa than at Zimbabwe’s Victoria Falls known  locally as ‘Mosi-oa-Tunya’, which means ‘the smoke that thunders’. <br/><br/>**Important Note:** The  itinerary below is written with an optional activity package so that you can pick and choose adventures according to your budget.

After your optional flight, or if you choose not to fly, you'll be collected from Maun and transferred to the Khwai Conservation Area in smaller, more agile safari-type vehicles. This ensures we can navigate the varied terrain effectively. Upon arrival, our experienced guide will provide a comprehensive briefing, preparing us for what to expect during our exciting afternoon mokoro excursion into the Okavango Delta.

The scenic drive from Maun to Nata offers a fantastic opportunity to witness some of Botswana's truly breathtaking landscapes and get a feel for its rich cultural heritage. As we travel, keep your eyes peeled – there's always a chance of a wildlife encounter or two along the way. You might spot various antelope, zebras, or even some larger game as they roam the unfenced areas. Our destination for the night is Nata, where we'll settle in after a day of diverse scenery and potential wildlife sightings. Route"

This morning, we'll cross the border into Zimbabwe and travel the short distance to the iconic town of Victoria Falls. Today is dedicated to experiencing the truly spectacular Victoria Falls, known locally by the evocative name of \"Mosi-oa-Tunya\" – \"the smoke that thunders.\" You'll have the opportunity to visit this natural wonder at your leisure, taking your time to explore the various viewpoints and witness the sheer power of the mighty Zambezi River as it plunges dramatically into the Batoka Gorge below. The roar of the water and the spray that rises hundreds of metres into the air are an awe-inspiring sight, truly living up to its local name. While much of today is rightly dedicated to viewing the Falls, the bustling adventure town of Victoria Falls also offers a wide range of optional activities for those seeking an extra dose of adrenaline in the afternoon. Options can include thrilling helicopter flights over the Falls, white-water rafting on the Zambezi, or even bungee jumping. For the more relaxed traveller, there are charming craft markets to explore, offering local artworks and souvenirs, alongside inviting coffee shops where you can simply unwind and soak in the atmosphere. This evening, you have the option to join the group for a delightful optional dinner at a local restaurant.

    "generalInfo": "This 3 week trip takes you through the vast and ever-changing scenery in Namibia, venturing off the beaten track into the Caprivi Strip, where carts are pulled along the roadside by donkeys, goats and cattle wander free, and life is lived along the riverfront.  Take in the culture as you drive through: this is no museum nor village visit: it is life, carrying on without intrusion.  Experience the vast openness and serenity of the Caprivi Strip’s National Parks: lions hunting for prey, eagles soaring above, awaiting their turn, and the call of hippos and hyenas at night a reminder that you are in the wilds of Africa.  Visit Chobe National Park, renowned for huge elephant and buffalo herds: take a sunset cruise, and you might catch a herd of elephants crossing the river to get to more succulent grasslands.  Finally, cross the border into Zimbabwe: the roar of the Victoria Falls beckons: visit at sunrise for the best photography, and end the day on a sunset boat cruise: Africa will surely beckon you to return.<br/><br/>Namibia: a land of vast, open spaces, sweeping deserts, wild coastline, tall dark-sand dunes as high as skyscrapers, and diverse wildlife. Because of the mainly-gravel roads, we recommend a 4x4 vehicle to give traction and height which affords views across the expansive landscapes. This is not a mass tourism destination: roads are empty, lodges are small and distances to drive will range from 4 – 6 hours, but the rewards are great: the lack of light pollution makes star gazing immensely rewarding; seeing the sunrise over the towering sand dunes at Sossusvlei is a photographer’s dream; kayak alongside frolicking seals and dolphins off the coast; track desert adapted elephant on foot and in vehicle in the stark landscapes of Damaraland, and watch for predator activity in Etosha National Park: renowned for sightings of lion, rhino, elephant, giraffe, zebra, etc.<br/><br/>Botswana has a policy of minimising bed nights to keep mass tourism at bay: this itinerary suggests 2 nights at Chobe National Park, but you can also opt to fly into the true wilderness of the Okavango Delta, where camps are accessible only by light aircraft.  The peacefulness of the waters on this landlocked oasis, and the succulent grasses attract multiple varieties of antelope – of course then attracting attention of predators. <br/><br/>We always offer small, locally owned luxury lodges for road trips around Namibia, with a focus on Namibian culture and cuisine. From our years of experience, we recommend that the best time to go to Namibia is during the dry season, June-October, as this is not only when temperatures are manageable but also when you will get the best wildlife viewing. During these months temperatures range from 20 °C-25 °C, although they do dip at night time. The temperatures start to soar as high as 40 °C during the rainy season which, in Namibia, is between Dec-March.<br/><br/>We will provide you with detailed maps, driving directions, mobile phone pre-programmed with all supplier contacts, and 24/7 support should you require it on the ground. You will cover some distance, but never feel rushed: the spectacular scenery, endless horizons and unique experiences make a road trip in Namibia one to remember.<br/><br/>Every effort has been made to ensure your self-drive holiday is a great success with ground handlers talking you through your itinerary at the start of the holiday as well as assisting with hire car contracts before you set off. Maps, cool boxes and route notes provide further confidence for first-time drivers in Namibia in addition to accommodation contact details pre-set in a local mobile phone.  We suggest dropping the hire vehicle at the border to Botswana to avoid cross border fees, but also because transfers are easily organised between Botswana and Zimbabwe.",

Unlike other waterfalls, Victoria Falls has a natural catwalk across from the falls which provides spectacular viewing. Take a sunset cruise, east in a local restaurant, take a cycling tour around a local village, and of course, see the Falls - sunrise is the best time to go."

From the main road, in the bush 20kms away, a cloud of mist and spray can be seen against the blue sky. As you get closer, a low rumble like thunder can be heard. When you arrive it is a surprise to discover the enormity of Victoria Falls. One mile wide and hurling over 5 million cubic metres of water a minute into the Zambezi Gorge this sight is breath taking at any time of year. The water levels vary hugely depending on the time of year, but it is always an amazing spectacle - in fact it can actually be better when there is a little less water, as there is less spray blocking the falls from view. The Gorge below the falls is also the setting for one of the most adrenaline fuelled grade 5 white water rafting rivers in the world. But there is also plenty to do here for the less active too. Why not take a day trip over the Victoria Falls bridge to view the falls from Zambia, take the Flight of Angels - a great way to get a birds eye view of the falls in a microlight or helicopter, enjoy a civilised afternoon tea at the Victoria Falls Hotel, join a Sunset Boat Cruise or a more sedate Canoe trip. For those who want to make the most of the adrenaline activities, get your fix with the Gorge Swing, Abseil or 'enjoy' one of the highest commercial Bungee Jumps in the world."

There is only one day in Johannesburg, as we prepare to hit the road for the big beauty in between – Botswana. Which is where we spend most of this wildlife watching and adventure holiday. <br/><br/>This overland tour is categorised as budget because we travel as a small group, in a bespoke truck with a few long road trips, and camp along the way albeit in some stunning locations. Most camps have great facilities, but we do spend two nights in wilder bush camps, where everything is a bit more ‘au naturel’. Which is all part of the adventure. <br/><br/>Our wildlife watching journey in Botswana starts at the Khama Rhino Sanctuary, a stunning conservation project where we take an evening game drive to see their protected white and black rhino as well as many other wild animals on the edge of the Kalahari Desert. Our next wildlife wonder spot is the Okavango Delta, where we spend three days taking in this giant inland delta, home to zebra and lion, elephant and giraffe, to name but a few. See hippo from a trip across the delta in a traditional mokoro canoe and camp on a lagoon island, one of the wildest spots on the trip. <br/><br/>Your next campsite is on the edge of the Makgadikgadi Salt Pans, an extraordinary sight to behold, before moving further north to Chobe National Park which is all about the elephants. With up to 100,000 in the park, this is ele heaven. Last stop, Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe. Talk about going out with a splash. <br/>",

Surrounded by the Kalahari Desert, the pans are naturally dry and salty for a large part of the year. During this time, the arid landscape has an eerie feel, and the heat mirages can make you feel disoriented. After the rains hit, the pans become a grassy refuge for migratory birds and animals – a perfect setting for wildlife lovers!"

You’ll have to arrive at opening time (6 am from September to April and 6.30 am from May to August). This is a great time to see the falls, as the sunrise casts a unique light on the cascades and there are fewer tourists to interrupt the view. Then, you’ll leave Victoria Falls behind and head to Hwange National Park via the Victoria Falls Wildlife Trust – one of the projects our Foundation supports. Here, you can learn about the rescue and rehabilitation of wildlife, human-wildlife conflict and the Trust’s role in anti-poaching. There may also be a chance to meet any rescued or orphaned wildlife currently in their care. Hwange National Park became the royal hunting grounds of the Ndebele warrior-king Mzilikazi in the early 19th century and was set aside as a national park in 1929. Today, Hwange boasts a tremendous selection of wildlife, with over 100 species of mammals and nearly 400 bird species. The elephants of Hwange are world famous – you'll find one of the largest elephant populations in Africa here!

    "placesVisited": "",
    "generalInfo": "Botswana is home to one of the highest densities of predators in the world, and is one of the few places where African wild dogs can be frequently seen.  It harbours the largest concentrations of African elephants and cape buffalo anywhere in the world as well as having the largest inland delta in the world. So after all that it is no wonder why Botswana is a wildlife lovers paradise and this tour aims to showcase all the very best parts of this wonderful country, Moremi Game Reserve, Savuti and Chobe National Parks are all explored during this ten day adventure.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife safaris of Southern Africa including Botswana. Botswana is a huge country with some of the most photogenic and isolated wilderness anywhere in the world. Home to the world’s largest inland delta and the huge numbers of wildlife, any trip to Botswana is a must for wildlife enthusiasts.<br/><br/>It is hard not to be mesmerised by the wealth and abundance of wildlife everywhere in Botswana. It is because of the unparalleled populations of buffalo and elephants along with vast numbers of antelopes, zebra, giraffes and other herbivores that the country boasts some of the highest densities of large predators anywhere in the world. <br/> <br/>Lions and spotted hyenas are the most common species seen on safari<br/>here (as in many other African countries) but it is the frequent sightings of leopards and the fact that Botswana is the best place in the world for African wild dog sightings that make Botswanan safaris the best place in the world to go.<br/>There are so many different places to visit in Botswana, this itinerary visits three of the most popular and best for wildlife sightings. Moremi, Savuti and Chobe are all visited here and time spent in each location on safaris.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Maun. We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers and game drives. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - a zoologist is not always available, please inquire at the time of booking if you wish to have a zoologist escort for this trip) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Botswana (and elsewhere in Southern Africa). Your naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. Whilst the trip involves a lot of camps, these are not pitch your own tent camping camps, instead these are luxury tented camps where the tents are permanent and you do not need to bring any camping equipment or sleeping bags with you. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the Botswanan wilderness, night safaris are available in some locations (subject to the local conditions on that day). You will have to speak to your guide on arrival there and book places on these (this is not included). A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>Northern Botswana stays completely dry during September, but the centre and south may receive a few scattered showers. Temperatures climb rapidly throughout the month and no longer drop below 0°C, even in the Kalahari. Average lows are between 10°C and 15°C, a bit cooler in the south and warmer in the north. By the end of September, the days are hot everywhere, averaging over 30°C and approaching 40°C in Maun and Kasane. September is another busy month in Botswana, and the popular northern camps should be booked well in advance.<br/><br/>September and October are particularly impressive along the Chobe and Linyanti Rivers. Thousands of animals rely on these waters for survival, especially elephants. Moremi is also excellent in September, although by now the days are getting very hot. The dry, thin vegetation makes for excellent wildlife viewing and the cooler mornings and evenings are best for predator spotting as they come to the channels to drink. By September, the Okavango’s barbell (catfish) run is in full swing and it’s also prime time for tigerfish in the northwest panhandle. In September, the Kalahari and pans are almost at their driest, but the full October heat has yet to arrive. <br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist guides as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it. We do our best to include as many wildlife activities as possible in all of our itineraries.<br/>• Depending on budget and interest we have a range of different accommodation packages to offer, from luxury top end lodges, national park safari lodges and mobile-camps which often offer unbelievable wildlife watching deep inside national parks as well as camping. We can also arrange mobile camping safaris of Botswana is very popular and all of your camping gear will be provided.<br/>• Spend all the daylight hours searching for wildlife and visiting various natural wonders and stunning landscapes.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our Botswana wildlife safaris a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Southern Africa so that we can try and find and observe some of the rarer and more elusive species. We have great itineraries and expertise in all Southern African countries (Namibia, South Africa, Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Mozambique) and can arrange trips to find some of the rarer species such as aardvarks, aardwolves, brown hyenas and black-footed cats among other species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour visit various locations within Botswana, however they are all in the north of the country. We will start and end the trip in the capital Maun and then move north and into the heart of the Okovango Delta and the reserves of Moremi, Savuti and Chobe National Park.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from a vehicle and whilst there is some walking, most of the walking is over flat terrain. This doesn't require any special fitness level. The biggest consideration is the heat, it is very hot in the wilderness of Botswana during the day.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 12 Years Old",

Chobe National Park in Botswana is known for its big population of elephants, often seen taking a bath in the river, but scan the shores for lions, cheetahs, wallowing hippos and sunbathing crocodiles, too. You’ll also explore the waterways of the Okavango Delta, gliding along in a mokoro, a traditional dugout canoe navigated by friendly local ‘polers’, before visiting the Khama Rhino Sanctuary on the edge of the Kalahari Desert. This trip finishes in bustling Soweto. About half of Johannesburg’s three million residents live here and its surrounding areas and you’ll explore the area by bike, learning about the Soweto uprising and resistance against apartheid. It’s a great urban full-stop to an exciting adventure – the perfect introduction to Southern Africa’s wildlife, landscapes and people.<br/><br/>You’ll travel mostly by purpose-built overland vehicles, equipped with large sliding windows so you can easily see and snap game. Campsites in and around the key destinations feature a range of facilities, some more sophisticated than others, but you’ll be camping wild in the Okavango, with only dug-out toilets and no showers. You won’t be left to fend for yourself, though!  As well as your fellow travellers, you’ll be accompanied by a group leader, driver and camp assistant, who puts up the tents each night, giving you more time to relax at the end of a busy day. <br/>",

Often referred to as the adventure capital of Zimbabwe, Victoria Falls offers a thrilling combination of land, air and water-based activities. For those arriving in time, our tour leader plans to meet you in the hotel reception at 6pm for a welcome meeting and for those that wish, there is the chance to go out for dinner. There are no other activities planned today, so you're free to arrive in Victoria Falls at any time. If you'd like an airport transfer, you'll need to arrive into Victoria Falls Airport (VFA), which is around a 30-minute drive from the hotel. If you miss the welcome meeting, your tour leader will inform you of any essential information as soon as you catch up. This evening, we'll either be staying at the Batonka Guest Lodge or Pioneer Lodge. The two are sister properties located just over 1 kilometre/0.6 miles from each other and are almost identical. Both are set in beautiful, landscaped gardens and feature a swimming pool, spacious rooms, an expansive terrace where breakfast is served, a bar and a stylish lounge and dining room which are both extremely comfortable. If your flight arrives earlier in the day, you might like to choose from a host of adventurous activities including white-water rafting, canoeing and cruises on the Zambezi River.

Hwange is Zimbabwe's largest national park at just under 15,000km2. The reserve is famous for its massive elephant population, as well as over 100 other mammals and over 400 species of birds, including the African golden oriole, Bradfield's hornbill and the Crimson-breasted Shrike. If you're hoping to spot the Big Five, Hwange is one of the best parks to do so, however, its diverse wildlife population offers plenty more sightings from the rare wild dogs to giraffes and zebras. During our safaris, we'll travel in customised, open-sided land cruisers. The land cruisers are ideal for game viewing but can be a bit brisk and windy at times, so we recommend bringing layers for longer travel days. The roads through both Botswana and Zimbabwe vary in quality, so travel days can be slow and bumpy, but the scenery and wildlife more than make up for this. Our base for the next two nights is the Miombo Safari Lodge. Located just outside the national park gates the lodge is the perfect spot to immerse yourself in Zimbabwe's wild and untamed nature. Accommodation comprises of 12 spacious, en-suite chalets and the lodge offers a swimming pool, bar and a large terrace with views over the surrounding bushland."

During the season it's not unusual to see huge herds numbering in their hundreds as they seek out the water holes in the early hours of the morning. The landscape of Hwange is exceptionally diverse, ranging from vast dry savannah to lush green forests, making it a haven for most sub-Saharan species of wildlife including southern giraffes, pangolins, aardvarks and a whole range of birdlife. We'll break for a picnic lunch within the park before we head back to our lodge in the early to mid-afternoon. There'll be time for a siesta, a dip in the pool, or a spot of birdwatching before dinner. Dinner at the lodge will usually be a buffet with a selection of fresh, seasonal Zimbabwean dishes and some international dishes."

Our route takes us through open bushland interspersed with rural villages and farming communities but the major settlement along the way is the colonial market town of Bulawayo, where we'll stop for lunch. Over the next two days, we'll explore Zimbabwe's oldest national park. It was established in 1926 when it was called the Cecil Rhodes National Park (named after the British colonialist and politician) and was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2003. Today, it's known for its unique 'kopjes' stacked boulder formations, as well as for having the densest population of leopards in the world - if you want to tick the cat off your list, you have a good chance in Matobo. The park is also home to the Southern White Rhino, the second-largest land mammal on the planet. Our base for the next two nights is the Farmhouse Lodge, located on the boundary of the national park. Accommodation comprises a converted farmhouse with 12 bungalow cottages. The lodge offers a rock swimming pool, large gardens and a newly renovated bar and restaurant where we'll gather for dinner this evening."

A walking safari is an intimate way to get closer to wildlife in areas that can't be accessed by vehicles or boats. While our focus is spotting the rhinos, it's a great opportunity for us to see other wildlife species such as antelopes, zebras and wildebeests. Matobo National Park doesn't have elephants or lions, so a walking safari is perfectly safe and we'll be joined by specially trained experts. Our safari fee goes towards helping the conservation of these majestic creatures and to protecting them from poaching. This afternoon, we'll see some of the cave paintings that can be found in the park - there are more than 3,000 in total. We'll also pay a visit to World's View - the grave of Cecil Rhodes, the founding father of Zimbabwe - perched at the very top of Motopo Hills. The spot has been given its name thanks to the endless views across the plains below. In the late afternoon, we'll return to our lodge with enough time to freshen up before dinner."

Contrasting with our safari experiences so far, the landscape in this region contrasts dramatically with anything else we'll see during our tour. There's not much wildlife to be seen on the pan, but a few desert-adapted species such as brown hyenas, elephants, zebras and wildebeests inhabit the fringes, as well as the Kalahari meerkat. We'll join a local expert guide on a short walk to see these curious little mongooses and learn about the conservation work currently taking place. It's worth noting that these semi-habituated animals are wild. Although they're curious by nature and it's not unusual for them to get very close to visitors, you must resist the temptation to touch or hold them. In the early to mid-afternoon, we'll return to our accommodation for lunch and the rest of the afternoon is free to explore the surroundings or study the local birdlife. There are a number of non-guided shorter nature trails available including the Baobab Village Walk.

However, in recent years the service has been unreliable at best, and not suitable for us to use. Your crew will update you whether we think we can include this on your trip. If we can, then expect basic conditions, but the views and experience of looking out the window and watching the world go by more than make up for it. Alternatively we will drive from Bulawayo to Victoria Falls, arriving late in the afternoon. For some, Mosi oa Tunya - The Smoke That Thunders, is the highlight of their African safari. From the main road, in the bush 20kms away, a cloud of mist and spray can be seen against the blue sky. As you get closer, a low rumble like thunder can be heard. When you arrive it is a surprise to discover the enormity of Victoria Falls. One mile wide and hurling over 5 million cubic metres of water a minute into the Zambezi Gorge this sight is breath taking at any time of year. The water levels vary hugely depending on the time of year, but it is always an amazing spectacle - in fact it can actually be better when there is a little less water, as there is less spray blocking the falls from view. The Gorge below the falls is also the setting for one of the most adrenaline fuelled grade 5 white water rafting rivers in the world. But there is also plenty to do here for the less active too. Why not take a day trip over the Victoria Falls bridge to view the falls from Zambia, take the Flight of Angels - a great way to get a birds eye view of the falls in a microlight or helicopter, enjoy a civilised afternoon tea at the Victoria Falls Hotel, join a Sunset Boat Cruise or a more sedate Canoe trip. For those who want to make the most of the adrenaline activities, get your fix with the Gorge Swing, Abseil or 'enjoy' one of the highest commercial Bungee Jumps in the world."

As the sun rises, the sounds of the bush sing in chorus as the landscape starts to shift from night to day, light falling on tree stumps and anthills, and the call of birds welcoming all to Africa’s playground. In contrast, the afternoon sees activity wind down a little, a chance perhaps to encounter a pride of lions lying on the trails and tracks as they soak up the last bit of warmth before nightfall. Stretch your legs and savor a sundowner as you take in the captivating view of the setting sun, raising a glass to your safari adventure."

Flying across Botswana in light aircraft isn't just a convenient way of traveling, it's a chance to grasp the astonishing scale of the landscapes. Your international flight arrives in Maun, where a representative assists in the transfer to a small plane bound for the Central Kalahari Game Reserve.

An elephant graces the horizon, nomadic giraffes sweep past, and there's an immediate sense of wild the Central Kalahari can be.

        "description": "Water is king in the desert. There isn't much here. The Central Kalahari Game Reserve stretches for over 50,000 square kilometers, and everything is on the move, always moving in search of water. Kudu and springbok sip from a remote waterhole, their ears peeled for danger. Elephant bulls make mammoth journeys and dig for water beneath the surface. Giraffe lope across the horizon and you follow their journey to the waterhole, where a herd of buffalo controls the precious fluid. Drive on and you're also on a search, following the water trail to find sublime encounters. Impala drink at another waterhole, but they quickly disappear as a lion pride approaches. The male's mane flows elegantly, a serene brown that stretches out like a proud beard. Lionesses approach the safari truck while three cubs play impishly besides the water. Keep driving, past a zebra herd that's on the move, then onwards to a hyena who scurries on a solo mission. Cross a ridge and there might be nothing. In the Central Kalahari, you won't find wildlife at every moment. But when you do spot big game, the encounters can be mind-boggling. In such a wild land, every encounter comes with an enhanced sense of drama. This is not a land of abundance, but an evocative portrayal of nature's battle for survival. Emotion is sketched across faces, and the tension intensifies when herds meet. Spot a cheetah and follows its prowl, tracking its desperate hunt for a meal. Find a leopard and admire how it blends into the landscape. Over these two days, you take long game drives through the Central Kalahari Game Reserve, heading into remote realms and piecing together the waterholes of the desert. These bumpy journeys are filled with raw and redolent scenes, an opportunity to see Africa's wildlife at its wildest. Complementing the adventure is the camp, a luxurious base which gazes across the flickering colors of the Kalahari. A fire crackles at night and the stars glisten above, their luminescence accompanied by the distant roar of male lions. It's calm and serene here, hundreds of miles from anywhere. Particularly after the international flight, a remote camp like this helps reenergize while still encountering the big mammals."

These dried-up oceanic lakes are larger than Switzerland, and ancient evaporation has left behind a crusted layer of glistening salt. A mirage occupies every angle, whiteness blurring on the horizon with a layer of mystique. One glance and you're transfixed. This barren landscape isn't filled with wildlife, although you will spot meerkats, the odd elephant, and a collection of roaming ungulates. Instead, you're here for a submersion in one of the world's most surreal landscapes. In the afternoon, you drive an ATV across the salt pans, surrounding yourself in the enormity of it all. Then your camp provides the iconic panorama, nothing but white cascading out beyond the horizon."

        "description": "From orange to white and blue, your journey by light aircraft now takes you across the world's greatest delta. Admire the transition, subtle at first, then all-encompassing as nothing but lush colors flicker beneath the wingtips. Your destination is an island, a lost haven in the heart of the Okavango Delta. Just like the wildlife, you're heading straight for the Kalahari's ultimate bounty, the revered grasslands and woodlands that rise amidst the flowing channels of the Delta. In the Central Kalahari, you followed the wildlife prints. Now, in the Okavango, you can sit back on your camp verandah and watch the wildlife elegantly roam past. Moremi Game Reserve is the abundant centerpiece of the Delta, a place where it's impossible to count the encounters. Leopards roam through the trees and you admire, watching a female as she descends from a branch and disappears into the grass. Zebra herds splash through the water, frolicking with impala, kudu, springbok, hartebeest, and so many more antelope herds. Baboons shout from the trees and their boisterous antics forge another piece of the soundtrack. Then there are hippos, thousands of them basking in the water and rolling in the mud. And when the antelopes are in abundance there's always the scent of lions, the dominant hunters roaming freely through the landscape. For big game encounters, this is one of the finest places in the whole of Africa. Next, you land on Chief's Island and spend the day on a game drive, connecting the variety of habitats that exist in Moremi. Open grasslands are dappled with herds, thick woodland is home to primates and elephants, and you're never quite sure when the big cats will fill the experience. While the following day offers a flexible safari program, the great appeal of Chief's Island is the opportunity to explore the variety of ecosystems, making game drives an excellent choice. Walking safaris and mokoro (canoe) are also possible. And when the afternoon drifts into the evening, you always have a view from the luxury tented camp, with a procession of wildlife roaming past along the lush channels of the Okavango."

        "description": "Cross the Okavango by canoe, a slow journey that helps you fully connect with the landscape. Giraffe and elephant tower above the canoe as you weave a path through the Delta. Moving almost silently helps you get even closer, the animals not seeing you until you're right upon them. Some must be avoided, the gondolier skillfully taking you around bathing pods of hippos. Others seem to enjoy the admiration, like buffalo and zebra inhabiting the banks. The destination is an open and expressive grassland that overlooks the major waterways. From a luxury camp, you have the ultimate panorama: gaze one way for the water, then turn to spot all the wildlife of the plains. Moving away from the center of the Okavango brings a different safari experience. Local canoes are known as mokoros, and these provide an indelible means of exploration. Twist down narrow channels and most corners bring a surprise; like impala drinking, lions resting on the banks, or a hippo out of the water. You can access areas of the Okavango that can't be explored by vehicle, allowing you to venture into an often unseen wilderness. There is so much water around that it's sometimes difficult to remember that you're in the middle of the desert. Rainfall in Angola before a four-month journey brings so much life to the Kalahari. Walking safaris are equally inspiring, a chance to wander serenely through a landscape of big game. Follow the clues and you get astonishingly close. Elephants and giraffe wander by, and their size becomes more apparent. Buffalo and hartebeest reveal an unmistakable power. Local trackers ensure your safety by following all the wildlife clues, staying clear of the big cats and maximizing your encounters with dozens of different animals. Vumbura is a private reserve, and you'll hardly see other tourists. For these two days, the experience is focused on a complete immersion in the wild fringes of the Okavango, with the mokoro and walking safaris providing a serene and surreal experience."

Others curl through the northern stretches of the desert, stimulating a flourishing woodland that's home to Africa's largest collection of elephants. Some say there are 100,000 of them. Various concessions and parks converge here, and you spend your time in the Linyanti Concession, iconically situated for exploring different angles. Waterways continue to abound, and the mokoro excursions are complemented by sunset and sunrise boat cruises. A vivid swamp provides the centerpiece of the concession, its importance judged by the abundance of wildlife that call it home. Linyanti shares borders with Chobe National Park, where thick woodland brings astonishing pachyderm encounters. After trying a variety of activities, these final two days enable you to create a personalized program based on your interests. You're still deep in the wilderness, the concession only realistically accessible by light aircraft. You soar across the Okavango, taking in views of the rivers that crisscross the desert. Touch down and the sandy trails require expert guides and drivers. Access is restricted to a handful of guests staying at your camp, so every sighting is delivered with an exclusivity. Just like in the Okavango, your luxurious accommodation is elegantly perched above it all, meaning the safari experience never stops. Even when reading a book in bed, you only need to open the curtains and see hippos wading or elephants drinking. As the habitats collide, Linyanti offers an exceptional diversity of big game. There are the classic sights, those that have become such commonplace over the last ten days: lion, leopard, hippo, zebra, kudu, buffalo, impala. And of course the elephants, spotted in such staggering numbers; there could be thousands on every game drive. Then the unusual, like Sable and Roan antelope, red lechwe and sitatunga. And for a final safari treat, Linyanti is home to a stunning collection of wild dogs, rare hunters that only grace a few reserves in Africa."

        "description": "Elephants bulldoze through the forests of Chobe, barging down trees with insatiable abandon. Lion prides peek their heads out and wander languidly before the safari truck. Giraffes stand high above your vehicle, enchanting sights just a few meters away. And then down at the river, there's another giant, a huge collection of hippos wallowing in the shallows. Chobe is a haven for nature's biggest, and you don't need to look far to find them. Land at Livingstone International Airport and you'll be transferred to the north of Botswana and Chobe National Park, a relaxing 90-minute journey. Settle into your lodge and it's impossible to miss the hippos and elephants. On an afternoon game drive, you get closer, every corner seems to reveal another giant herd. There are other families here, swinging their trunks and bathing in the river. And there are many babies, giraffes, and hippos that look tiny until you get up close. Today is a chance to get up close and savor the first thrills of an African safari. Return to the lodge and the sights continue as Botswana's giants frolic in the river beneath the lodge. You can watch it all from the verandah."

Start exploring, a game drive seeking out the predators in their habitat. While most animals will inspire children, it's these intimate encounters that usually top the wish list. And as you're searching for the cats, every corner brings another elephant herd or a new collection of ungulates. Zebras gallop along; gazelles rest beneath the trees and a compact game drive route provides timeless safari memories. Return to the lodge for lunch on the verandah and spend the afternoon on a boat safari. It's a mystical ride; just sit back and admire the untouched world of the river. For the children, it's an evocative chance to be just a few meters away from wild hippos."

        "description": "A scenic flight takes you south, across the verdant carpet of the Okavango to an exclusive camp on the edge of the Moremi Game Reserve. Elephants and giraffes are spotted from the air while impalas grace the edge of the airstrip before you come into land. Raised suites overlook a lagoon, and the antics of hippos are on display for most of the day. Over the next four days, you'll be learning bush skills with indigenous guides, combining their lessons with wonderful wildlife encounters. It starts with a walking adventure, a journey through the lavish landscape of the Okavango. Subtle clues are everywhere; paws in the sand, indentations in the trees, fresh dung, stones upturned. Gradually you learn how to follow them, tracing the path a springbok herd made through the trees. For 35,000 years, the San Bushmen have perfected animal tracking; an afternoon on the trail offers an inspiring introduction to the techniques. But it's not just hunting here; it's also gathering. The locals know use for some 200 plants in the bush. There are leaves that make soap, herbs that become antiseptic cleansers, sunscreen from the ground, and the fruits that are safe to eat. Along the way, you'll be encountering zebra, antelope, and even the odd elephant in the trees. It's very safe. After all, the locals have lived harmoniously with the wildlife for millennia."

Being the gondolier is harder than it looks, but it's immensely rewarding. Take turns in handling the pole and cruising through the channels, keeping eyes alert for hippos and crocodiles. Local guides are always on hand in case you take a wrong turn. Impala drink from the riverside, the odd elephant squirts water, and a rare troop of baboons is found coming out of the trees. It's an exquisite safari, and you're learning how to navigate. There's more. Discover the tradition of making fish spears and practice how to fish using their ancient methods. And don't forget yesterday's tracking lesson. When you disembark the boat, you'll take another walking adventure, honing your ability to identify the animal prints."

        "description": "Over the last two days, the guides have taught how to track and travel in the bush. But there's far more to bush survival. Weave baskets to carry your findings back to camp. Collect materials and craft a shelter from the bounty of the landscape. Learn how to make rope from a specific plant. And discover the different types of animal traps that have been traditionally used. Over these two days, you put together your own family home in the bush, helped out by local families and guides. It's not just building, though. There's a lot of safari on these two days. Mokoro trips and game drives unveil the wonders of the Okavango. There are hippos barging around, giraffe cantering across the grasslands, and then the trail is blocked by a huge herd of buffalo. Each day is flexible, and you'll create the itinerary dependent on your mood. On a typical safari, there are a few hours of downtime after the morning activity. That's not always active enough for children. At this camp, the parents can relax and laze above the lagoon, while the guides continue the bush skills with the younger ones. Navigating is getting easier, everyone learning to piece together the subtle clues. But what about when the night falls? Out in the wild, you'll learn to steer by the stars, recognizing which glimmers take you home, paddling the canoes through the fabled waterways of the Okavango."

        "description": "This three-destination vacation ends in the Central Kalahari, a vast reserve that provides an indelible contrast to the waterways of the Okavango. It's dry and dusty, open, and uninterrupted. On a game drive, you can gaze miles across the plains, picking out the wild nomads who roam. A bashful elephant with proud tusks, a big zebra herd on the move, buffalo males clashing horns besides a waterhole. A light aircraft takes your family across the Kalahari, away from the oasis to a landscape that reflects preconceptions about Botswana safari. Your camp is tucked away, far from any roads and other tourists. It blends effortlessly into the landscape and is on the migratory trail of various species. Over a crackling campfire, you'll spot the silhouettes, big mammals roaming just 30 meters from the camp. Touch down and the first game drive goes in search of a Kalahari specialty. With their flowing black manes and luscious fur, the Kalahari lions could be the kings of any environment. They're huge, even by feline standards, the males an epitome of power and grace. Tour the waterholes, following the footprints of the ungulates to find the great predator in its realm. Turn a corner and you spot one, lazing on a rock, eyes half-open even when he appears to be sleeping. It's Africa's classic image, one that suggests that the Lion King wasn't a work of fiction."

Or you can follow a classic program of morning and afternoon drives with leisurely hours at the camp. Walking trails are guided by barefoot bushman guides, more authentic moments with the ungulate herds. Nighttime drives illuminate a new world, one that's guided by a spotlight or a glowing moon. In such a large landscape, you can travel far, or stay close to the camp. This flexibility makes the reserve a fitting choice to complete the safari. Create the itinerary on a daily basis, building a program that reflects your interest and mood. If there are revered animals you haven't seen, the safari can specifically seek out their realm. How about scenes you yet to encounter, like a cheetah stalking its prey? It's all found in the Central Kalahari, and the guides know where to look. This remote world is also the ideal place to practice bushmen skills. Tribes have lived here for some 35,000 years, flourishing in a land where crops don't grow. The children can lead the way, ably assisted by barefoot guides who offer the intermediate lesson. These extra days in the bush help everyone continue the rich immersion in both local culture and stunning wildlife."

The river wisps along the banks brushing the grass while parades of zebra linger around the watering hole, their black and white stripes mesmerizing in their collected movement. Enjoy the delights of an early morning tea or coffee before venturing out deeper into the wilderness to experience the life of the wild. The private world within the reserve allows you to discover the charm of the area in a more intimate setting. The scent of fresh grass rises from the ground. In the rainy season the fields are tall and lush giving way to the exuberantly green trees, with wide branches and thick stumps. In the peak of the wet season you can look at those same branches and find lions lingering within the shade, scouring the vast plain in search of food, away from the damp grass. Their golden fur shimmers against the dark bark; their tails sway with the delicate breeze."

Another early morning takes you away from your luxurious accommodation and back into the splendor of the landscape. Along the quiet marshland you can see sitatunga antelopes, their horns slightly twist as they stretch into the air. Their fur is dark and speckled with white. As the truck comes closer you can see the flicker of their ears as they search the field for the source of the sound becoming scared and uncertain. Their hooves have adapted to the muddy, slippery marshland allowing them to jump, kick, and even submerge into the water when afraid. However, it is in the open field that you once again find the beauty of the open space. A troupe of elephants marches along the grassland near the waterway. Their large ears sway in the afternoon heat, an internal cooling system, as they make their way closer to the water."

Along the water you can see small boats slowly moving up and down stream, filled with fishermen at work. As the early afternoon turns into early evening you will climb aboard one of the river cruisers and set out into the water. Along the banks you can see the outlying floodplains, sandridges, and forestry displaying the variety of the surrounding scenery, filled with rambunctious baboons and stoic fish eagles. The sun begins to set and the orange and purple of the night stretches along the horizon. The numerous wildlife rangers on the boat point out the countless birds swaying, calling, and flying over the water, and in the short distance–but far enough to not feel threatened–is a pod of hippos blowing bubbles beneath the water’s surface. When they come up for air their snouts and eyes stick out while their ears wiggle in the swirling air."

The sounds of the forest are never far away as you make your way from Chobe, across the Botswana/Zambia border crossing where a ferry will take you over the river, settling into the luxuries along the Zambezi at Livingstone. The majesty of Livingstone is in the culture and surroundings that create the city, most notably one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World, Victoria Falls. The falls were named by David Livingstone, thought be the first European to ever witness their grandeur in 1855, and named in honor of Queen Victoria. When you enter the gates you can see the incredible depth and width of the falls spread over a series of walkways that lead to various viewing points. From above you can watch the river trundle over the rocks and disappear in a cacophonous rising mist. Two natural pools sit along the precipice, one known as Angel’s pool, the other known as Devil’s Pool, where you can look over the steep cliff and watch the water tumble. Along the steel bridge you step through puddles and can hardly see the water due to the encompassing mist. When the water isn’t too tumultuous you can take a boat tour to the island below, wading along the waves and viewing the true magnitude of nature sprawling across a width of over 5,500 feet and a height of over 350 feet. No matter where you watch the beauty of the falls you know that the company with which you see this magnificent display of power and nature is as romantic as an evening under the stars."

For a fabulous experience, that will bring you closer to the wildlife than you have ever imagined, you can enjoy a lion walk. The excitement behind the breeding program is almost as palpable as the thrill you have of viewing lion cubs up close. The movement of the river can be heard over your pumping heart. After a brief summary and tutorial to help you understand the various factors of the project, to help breed lions and train them to live in the wild after a certain amount of time among the staff, you step in line with two cubs under the age of 18-months. Walk along the path and watch them scamper in the dust and lounge beneath the trees, all within open and close proximity to you. It is a unique experience that brings you closer to the remarkable romance of the wild and another memory of an unforgettable vacation."

The land became a national park in the early 1970s and now covers over 5,620square-miles. The woodland savanna is lush against the backdrop of the river making it a haven for giraffes. Their long, elegant necks stretch into the canopy with their golden brown fur shimmering in the light. You can see their black tongues wrapping around the tree branches and scraping the stems clear of leaves. The afternoon is yours to relax in your lavish accommodation, returning you to the beauty of the park near sunset to experience the nocturnal wildlife that brims along the savanna.

Touch down in the Xakanaxa area, and then take a boat tour through the waterways of the Xakanaka Lagoon, where the rare slaty egret is likely to be a major highlight. Coppery-tailed coucal and red-chested flufftail are found in the reeds, along with the aquatic sitatunga antelope. Large herds of buffalo carry birds on their backs, and there is a rich list of rare birds to see including the black coucal, the purple swamphen, and Allen's gallinule.

Head off in a traditional mokoro , a narrow wooden canoe that is paddled expertly along the mosaic of channels. Along these narrow channels, you will find the birds of the papyrus and reeds, and as these flow into lagoons, you will find one of the last refuges for wattled cranes. Pel's fishing owl are abundant, and it is rare to spend an hour on the water and not see this magnificent bird. Sometimes the guide brings the mokoro to a tiny deserted island where you will explore on foot and seek out the unusual nesting birds. Traveling on foot is safe in the Moremi Game Reserve, and the local trackers will use their ancestral knowledge to keep you away from the predators and larger mammals. Often you' will be crossing broad savannah and the extensive floodplains, where the open landscape offers excellent visibility. Game drives are also an integral part of the itinerary, and they allow you to cover large stretches of Moremi Game Reserve. Elephants and giraffe grace your journey, and as you scan the marshes for lesser jacana, movement in the trees will alert you to a lone leopard. During this safari, you can create a daily program dependent on your mood to combine the different activities to build a comprehensive picture of the habitat and its residents.

Stop for brunch and a quick coffee at the Dombo Hippo Pools and admire the resident mammals. The humongous yawns of the hippo could easily swallow dozens of the cute rosy-throated longclaws that fly around you. Continue north to traverse the mopane woodlands to see areas that are both lightly and densely covered areas, before roaming around the swamps of Khwai. This private concession is where habitats collide as waterbirds are joined by the residents of the woodland and the swamp. This region is one of the Okavango's most picturesque areas, and it is a crucial bird-watching destination.

        "description": "Seeing the connection between diverse habitats is one of the highlights of any Okavango bird-watching safari. Your journey north will be a rugged one as you travel on deeply rutted trails that are sometimes impassable when the Okavango is fully flooded (June to August). You will travel slowly, which will bring some enchanting encounters with the legends of the landscape. Crowned hornbill and trumpeter hornbill are found in the same panorama as large elephant herds. Verraux's eagle soar overhead, and they are not the only hunters as the open plains a great place to see cheetah. Your destination will be the Savuti Channel in the far south of Chobe, an area of permanent water that attracts a wide array of migratory species. The riverine woodland will help you to add a number of new sights to your safari including the rare olive bee-eaters, the western-banded snake eagles, the collared palm-thrush and the copper sunbirds flutter around as a lion pride comes down for a drink. After your leisurely journey, your afternoon will offer possibilities for walking safaris and game drives."

        "description": "Savuti's bird-watching potential comes from its mix of woodlands. Along with the riverine forest, there are large swaths of broadleaf woodland, a favored home of specialty species like pennant-winged nightjar, racket-tailed roller, and orange-winged pytilia. Patches of acacia woodland crop up, bringing with them the marico flycatcher, the violet-eared waxbill, and the crimson-breasted shrike. These sights will contrast with those of the Savuti marshlands, which are different to the birds that settle around the large outcrops of volcanic rock. This diversity makes Savuti Channel a prime bird-watching stop, yet also a haven for a full range of Botswana's mammals. In particular, you will be surrounded by the world's largest elephant population with almost 100,000 occupying these woodlands. It will be difficult to go more than a few minutes without seeing another pachyderm, and you will hear their hoots through the night and into the morning."

        "description": "The diversity of Chobe National Park is legendary. Over 450 species are found here in the summer months of November to March, and you can easily see 150 of them every day. For your final three nights, you will be in the north of the park where the woodland meets the broad Chobe River. It is a relatively short drive north to your camp on the river's edge, and as always, your activities will be guided by one of Botswana's premier birding guides, a local specialist with decades of experience. Local game trackers will join you on the walking safaris to guide your route away from the large numbers of elephant and buffalo. Game drives are a big part of the experience, yet the true highlight of this area will be your river cruise. In the Okavango, you will explore in small boats, either in mokoros or in motor-powered boats. On the Chobe River, you will enjoy much larger vessels with beautiful seating areas, and meals served on board. These larger boats can cover long distances, and you will spend a day venturing down the Chobe River to the Kasai Channel, where lily-covered lagoons will bring some extraordinary sights such as lesser jacana, lesser moorhen, Allen's gallinule, African rail and purple gallinule. As you return to your riverside camp, the sunset will turn the water a glistening gold color easing you into a relaxing evening."

A series of bridges and platforms run parallel to the falls and it's quite a journey.

Elephants cover the surrounding mopane forests and you quickly lose count of the trunk swinging herds that wander past the river.

        "description": "Open the curtains to elephant herds and listen to their resonant calls as you take a hot shower beneath the mangosteen trees. Your safari camp is idyllically nestled in the private Linyanti Wildlife Reserve, overlooking a hippo-filled lagoon and bordering the unfenced boundary of Chobe National Park. It's one of Southern Africa's most game-rich areas, the immense elephant numbers enhanced by bountiful leopards and lion prides. Over these three days, your local guide will craft a private itinerary that includes both Chobe National Park and the Linyanti Reserve. The former offers scale; every corner brings another elephant herd, hartebeest and kudu skip across flourishing grasslands, and hidden spots provide euphoric hunting conditions for resident prides. Game drive in Chobe and there's never a dull moment, from eagles soaring overhead to a herd of lechwe shaded by acacias. The Linyanti Wildlife Reserve offers a different experience. Access is restricted to just a handful of guests so it's highly unlikely to stumble upon another safari truck. The plains thrive with the wanderings of ungulates; giraffe poke above the treetops, impala, and tsessebe graze on short grasses, and wildebeest are joined by their renowned friends, the zebra. Such an abundance of hooves inevitably brings predators and the drama of a hunt is far more impressive when you're the only ones to witness it. While game drives bring delight, Linyanti can also offer indelible walking safaris, a chance to walk hand in hand within close proximity to the world's largest wild elephant population. And the safari experience never ends here. As a campfire crackles the silhouettes of mammals roam along the horizon it stirs evocative memories from these three days of sharing Botswana's wildlife with your partner."

        "description": "Botswana's diverse ecosystems ensure that every safari day is different. Moremi Game Reserve epitomizes this melange of environments and the next two days provide a thrillingly unpredictable safari experience. Open floodplains, woodlands dotted with acacias, riverine ecosystems, marshlands, and the famed grasslands that roll beyond the horizon. Just a single game drive can take in all these places; cheetahs chasing impala, rhinos emerging from the trees, wild dog finding a haven to hunt, and then the omnipresent elephants crossing paths with giraffe. Your safari camp is situated in its own private reserve, ensuring that short local safaris bring enchantment without the crowds. King-sized beds stand on wooden floors raised above the landscape, en-suite bathrooms offer unrivaled natural panoramas, and your private verandah is perfect for moments of solitude in Botswana's hinterland. Like every camp on this itinerary, expect five-star deluxe interiors yet harmony with the surroundings. Moremi Game Reserve forms part of the Okavango Delta, a vibrant oasis in the Kalahari Desert. Wildlife migrates for hundreds of miles to drink from the effervescent channels and your safari experiences are imbued with tropical colors and boisterous calls. After arriving on a light aircraft the itinerary is flexible. Stop for lunch in the heart of Moremi's plains, looking around at the 360-degree concoction of grazers. Safari by boat and admire the mammals that come down to drink, as well as the crocodiles that laze away an afternoon. Choose short game drives or go on an all-day adventure that crosses rutted trails and seeks out lucid eyes in the forest. Evenings are languid and bewitching, another chance for gourmet cuisine and quiet moments with your partner."

Gaze down at lavish waterways and green hues, and then across at the blistered yellow of the surrounding Kalahari. The maze of canals and lagoons call for a new safari experience: a traditional wooden mokoro canoe. Glide peacefully across the blue and sounds begin to break the silence. An endemic flock of lovebirds, the rustling of buffalo in long grass, springbok sipping along the banks, and then the haunting yelps of an ungulate being pounced upon. This beautiful and remote corner of the Okavango Delta offers a very traditional and peaceful experience. While a land camp brings constant excitement and unpredictability, a water camp is all about settling into an unhurried rhythm and allowing nature's spell to slowly take hold. The profusion of wildlife is often hiding in the canopy of green, yet patience provides rewards, and those who stay silent are treated to astonishingly close encounters with a myriad of Botswana's great mammals. You're many miles from any road, camp, or settlement. So the stars bring additional sparkle to pristine evenings, the clinking of wine glasses sometimes the only interruption to the omnipresent hush."

A journey between Okavango and Etosha may take three days by road. The aerial route catapults you from hinterland to hinterland in just a couple of hours. Take off and landing provide opportunities to witness herds from the sky and the aesthetics begin to ingrain new ideas about the scale of Southern Africa. You can fly for hours and swoop above nothing but wilderness. As the fringes of Okavango disappear behind the rear of the plane, the panorama turns a scorched yellow; you're entering prime desert landscapes and these four days in Namibia reveal two very different parched landscapes. Etosha is one of Africa's largest national parks, a vast dusty expanse crossed by nomads seeking water. Carefully positioned hides provide intimate encounters: cheetahs crossing, gemsbok and hartebeest migrating, cast-out elephant bulls with melancholy eyes. Your safari camp, perched above Etosha, is perfect for nighttime and walking safaris. Walk together and leave footprints in the dust, a skilled guide keeping you on the trail of both Black and White rhinos. Again, patience and silence provide rewards. Don't make a sound and you can feel the tingling sensation of standing less than 20 meters away from a wild horned rhino. It's another addition to this all-encompassing safari, a unique experience that will linger for decades in the memory."

Your final destination is Sossusvlei, a remarkable natural wonder and a chance to experience the uninhabited and untrammeled desert. Gaze out from your lodge and there's little but sand dunes for hundreds of miles in every direction. So just imagine the view when you watch the sunrise from a nearby dune on day 14. The sun's descent leaves lasting reflections on both days, sand transformed from yellow to orange and then the exuberant red that Sossusvlei is famous for.

The rains that fall in the highlands of Angola flow down to this alluvial fan and create an oasis of spectacular and diverse scenery, wildlife and birdlife. Your charming safari camp is an elegant lodge created from local timber, reed, and thatch and is nestled in the Moremi Game Reserve. This reserve was named after Chief Moremi of the BaTawana tribe and is the ideal location for your initiation into the wilds of Botswana. For the next two nights, enjoy your private and secluded view of the lagoon in front of camp, or venture to the cozy fireside lounge for cocktails in the evening.

The camp consists of eight gorgeous safari tents elevated on wooden boardwalks and decks, hidden in amongst the cool and inviting riverine woodland. Resident hippo will serenade you from the water on the floodplain in front of the camp. Each tent has its own viewing deck and a breath-taking view over the Delta, so that if you wish, you needn’t leave the comfort of your own room for your safari! During the next two days, experience the elegantly serene aspect of the Okavango. There is no better way to do this than to climb into a mokoro and be propelled gently through the glassy waters of the Delta by an expert poler. Serving as your guide, your poler can point out some of the hidden gems of this stunning wilderness, such as kingfishers, herons, crocodiles and perhaps even a fish or two! After a relaxed lunch and siesta, head out once more in a vehicle and end the day with an exhilarating game drive, searching for predators on the hunt in the cooler air. The next morning, why not complete the true safari experience with a bush walk where you will be able to appreciate fully the finer details of this paradise. Your guide (who will carry a rifle whilst walking as a safety precaution) will open your eyes to the science and skill of tracking animals on foot. From game drives, to bush walks, to mokoro safaris, to a relaxed sojourn in the double-tiered boat, your camp has a huge range of activities on offer to allow you to truly soak up the blissful landscapes both on land and on water. There are windy, meandering channels, wide lagoons (for some superb fishing), swaying palm trees, and cool, dark forests to explore. In this private concession, you will be able to traverse sensitively off-road if you are following a predator on the hunt and at night your guide will use a spotlight to illuminate some of the nocturnal beauties of this wilderness. Whether you wish to venture out on these many excursions or stay in the comfortable luxury of camp, the warm and friendly staff will ensure that you have an unforgettable stay."

There are many and varied activities in and around Victoria Falls. There is white-water rafting, bungee jumping, boat excursions, fishing, craft fairs, and beautiful walks for those keen on one last outdoor experience! Or, enjoy a last pampering at the hotel.

        "description": "Botswana is an immense unfenced world that teems with wildlife. Lions roam freely, elephants cross the main highway, and nature's great mammals crowd around shrinking water holes. Today you'll head out on a game drive, searching for the life that wanders across the Makgadikgadi's mirage. In front of you is a salt flat that's bigger than some US states. This used to be a lake, but for thousands of years there's been nothing but these endless stretches of white. They shine and shimmer, occasionally interrupted by short stretches of sandy desert or dry savanna. It takes a while for the eyes to get used to it, but when they do, there's a peculiar world to discover. Makgadikgadi isn't a place for spotting great lion prides or huge elephant herds. It's too hostile and dry for that, but don't worry, there will be plenty of them when you get to the Okavango! Life on these pans is for the specialists, the intriguing assortment of characters that have evolved to be different. Discover gangs of meerkats that poke their heads up from the ground, and lose hours laughing at their wonderfully comic gestures. Strange aardwolves and bat-eared foxes scamper across the ground, brown hyena are continually moving in search of a meal, and paw prints are easy to follow across the pans. It's a real adventure, slowly tracking the prints and discovering the culprit beside his lair. There are no time limits for your safari exploration. Stay for an hour beside the meerkats, drive great distances to follow a hyena, and allow the children to pick up on the animal trails."

        "description": "Sitting on a quad bike on the edge of Makgadikgadi imbues a surreal sense of freedom. Few places in the world are as desolate or untamed. Other than a few wandering Bushmen, nobody lives in this area. Not only that, hardly anyone has ever ventured into these pans. To minimize the environmental impact you drive in line, cruising out into the middle of this dried up lake on your quad bikes. Makgadikgadi induces a transfixion. For one thing, you're surrounded by a 360 degree white wonderland. A flickering mirage floats above the ground, gently merging the salt with the sky, and making the sun's position the only clue as to which direction you're heading. But look closely and no two angles are the same. Mysterious elephant prints cut across the salt, a solitary ostrich randomly appears, animal burrows dot the land, and it's hard not to imagine you're in some kind of post-apocalypse Hollywood movie. Your expedition takes you into the heart of Makgadikgadi. It's particularly impressive for teenage children as they have a vast landscape to explore, as well as the freedom to safely drive a quad bike for two days. On day three you arrive at Kubu Island and your guide sets up a makeshift camp. Watch a poignant sunset dance on the horizon, the red and orange sky perfectly reflected in the salt. Then explore the area on foot and search for signs of Bushmen and flamingos. Dinner is cooked on a log fire and you roll out comfortable beds beneath the stars. With so many twinkling stars and wisps of white, it's often impossible to pick out the individual constellations. You're a few hundred miles to the nearest town, reveling in an untouched wilderness that can't be rivaled anywhere else in the world. A delicate sunrise greets you on day four, the sun evocatively appearing on the horizon. You take a different route back to the camp, exploring great swathes of Makgadikgadi. Note that this quad bike adventure can be extended by a day or two and include more time on Kubu Island, or explore a new area of the pan. As you coast through the landscape you can follow footprints. So why not check out where the elephant tracks lead? Or see what small pawed animal crossed near your bed last night? Lose yourself in this strange world and return to the camp for a sumptuous dinner and hot shower. While you can also do shorter quad bike trips, it's recommended to spend at least 24 hours in Makgadikgadi. This allows you to appreciate how the sun's position delicately affects the landscape, as well as offering you the chance to watch the sunset and sunrise from the same position."

A local guide will accompany you and translate because many of the Bushmen tribes in Botswana don't speak the same language as each other, never mind have exposure to English. Naturally laconic and reserved, Bushmen use their actions to teach and share. Everyone can see the prints in the salt, but these hunter-gatherers can pinpoint exactly when the culprit wandered past. They move nimbly, sidestepping a route across the ground and slowly imparting their knowledge of life in the bush. The whole family is going to learn some essential bush survival and tracking skills today. It's a humbling experience, but one that's very involved. Dress yourself in animal skin and fur to look the part, see the inside of a Bushman hut, and discover traditions that have almost disappeared from the world."

Great stretches of blue suddenly appear from the plane window, cutting distinct lines through the savannah. Botswana's scale takes many people by surprise and during the flood season it might appear as though you're crossing an ocean. Your destination is the Shinde Concession, a privately managed part of this vast national park. Staying in a concession allows you to be more adventurous with your safari activities. So get ready for four days of walking safaris, game drives, going off road, and of immersing yourself in this natural phenomenon. Enjoy a delicious lunch and then head off on a game drive. Makgadikgadi is arid and sparse, so you're quickly taken aback by the lush grasses, dense forests, and huge animals that lurk in the Okavango's trees. Indulge in your first safari experience as Africa's famed mammals are found at every angle. Giraffes poke their heads over the treetops, elephant herds slowly emerge from the forest, and impala congregate in huge herds. As the sun begins to set be sure to keep your eyes peeled for leopards, the stealthy hunter prowling for an evening meal. Settle into your camp and let nature's indelible soundtrack sing you a lullaby. And remember, if you hear rustling in the night, shine the flashlight before you head out. There are no fences to stop the wildlife roaming through here!"

There's lots of water to spend the day in, and plenty of lush grass to gobble down at night. Spend today exploring the meandering waterways, taking a boat through winding stretches of hippo paradise. Sunbathing crocodiles line the banks, waterbirds flutter overhead, and groups of ungulates tentatively come down for a drink. At times it's blissfully serene, the boat slowly cutting a trail past resting hippo pods and vivid riverbanks. But take a bend and a herd of elephants block your path. They play in the river; females spray each other with long jets of water, males test their strength and half drown each other, while an old tusker just stands and drinks. At various spots the boat docks and you explore on foot, carefully following the guide into the trees. All the big cats lurk around here so your local guide picks up on clues to decide whether it's safe. Step ashore and watch warthogs comically scurry past, or giraffes elegantly roam just meters away. Then an elephant herd slowly wanders past to reach the river, cute babies struggling to keep pace with the rest. Don't expect to see many other boats or people today. Not only does a private concession allow you to do more daring safari activities, it also limits the number of other tourists, so you always have a very personal and intimate experience. Spend the whole day on boat safari and then return to the camp and watch all the wildlife from your private verandah."

Baboons call from the trees above your head, impala watch you from a safe distance, and animal tracks dictate which way you travel. Don't be scared, the locals have lived side by side with the wildlife for many generations, even the big cats. They also know the popular spots for different herds. Hippos and elephants looked huge when you saw them from the boat. But now you're standing just meters away from them, and they seem a lot bigger from this angle. Zebras gently skip past, springbok decide to dance through the trees beside you, and then you turn a corner to meet the steely stare of a buffalo. Note that this program of activities in Shinde Concession is just an example. Every guest can customize their itinerary to have more of a focus on walking safaris, game drives, or boat trips. It's also easy to combine different activities in one day, so a river cruise can take you out before a game drive brings you back."

        "description": "Head out in the early morning as an idyllic silence drops over Okavango. There is nervousness amongst the antelope and zebra. This is prime hunting time, after the night has ended but before the morning sun kicks in. Lion prides are on the move, creeping through the trees as they stalk a small herd of kudu. Your safari vehicle can get close, allowing you to watch everything unfold: the lionesses' deliberate movements, the unsuspecting antelopes, and then the split second drama as the cats are spotted and the kudu panic. It's not just lions around here. Cheetahs and leopards go out on patrol, while hyena look to pick up the scraps. Spotting them isn't always easy. They're carefully camouflaged and it takes a special eye to pick up a tail hanging from a tree branch. Take a glance at the forest and all you see is trees. Even when your guide points out the leopard you initially can't see it. But once it's spotted you wonder how you were so blind. It's there in the open, and it spotted you a long time ago. On most safari days you will rest during the early afternoon. The wildlife is having some downtime and so are the adults. Your guide will entertain the children, unraveling the wonders of the wild by teaching them some unique survival techniques. They can learn how to make camp fires, how to build a traditional bow and arrow, and how to move through the bush without making a single sound. Tonight you see a different version of the Okavango by heading out on a thrilling night safari. You're surrounded by darkness, the moonlight only able to illuminate the treetops. Stop, listen, and wait. Something is rustling nearby. Your guide shines the spotlight and a small herd of buffalo is gently revealed. They can't be more than five meters away. On a nighttime game drive you can get incredibly close to the wildlife. And the children will need to practice their new skills of staying silent in the bush!"

Kgalagadi is so dry that local folklore suggests the rivers only run once a century. It’s desolate and empty, yet the battle for survival makes for fascinating first safari encounters. Elephants dig beneath the withered channels, expertly uncovering underground streams and sharing the bounty with a herd of cute babies and relieved mothers. Thirsty nomads migrate across the evocative landscape, their shapes easily picked out along the horizon. They’re heading for the permanent waterholes, and that’s where you’ll go on your Botswana game drive. A kudu herd look to have timed their arrival perfectly, lapping up the muddy water in peace. But turn around and three prowling lionesses have decided to join the party. When you first arrive in Botswana, a light aircraft will take you from Maun to Kgalagadi, where you're welcomed by a game-filled off-road transfer to the delightfully secluded camp. You’ll see nature’s finest mammals in Kgalagadi, but you won’t see other tourists. Like most of Botswana, these vast national parks are open spaces that are explored by just a handful of visitors. It’s very different from the more famous parks of East Africa or Kruger, where there are often other safari trucks in your line of vision. It’s you, your partner, and a wonderful array of wildlife. As a campfire crackles you dine outside, the table illuminated by moonlight while a few antelope rustle in the nearby bushes.

Understanding this desolate ecosystem requires a couple of hours beside the permanent water, slowly taking in the competition for resources and the drama it brings. The kudu and eland spot the danger and wander off, happy to bide their time. But a herd of blue wildebeest aren't as smart, and the leopard’s precise movements don’t alert the sentry. As you tuck into breakfast a battle erupts; hooves kick up dust, the lame get left behind, and the cat also enjoys a breakfast feast.

Both have an endless beauty, although it’s difficult to imagine that the Kgalagadi and Okavango are in the same country. Soak up the hippo-filled channels and gaze down on the river from your private verandah. It would be easy to sit back and spend three days watching everything approach your stunning camp. Elephant herds say hello as you kiss on the balcony, giraffe greet you when you open the curtains, a lion roar interrupts an alfresco dinner, and paw prints surround the luxury en-suite tent. The wildlife is everywhere. Zebra and lions battle it out on the verdant floodplains, Nile crocodiles sunbathe on the riverbank, and various antelope species impress with their fantastic array of horns. Private game drives provide a succession of affectionate moments. Hartebeest rest their necks on another’s back, a lion pride seems to take a keen interest in your partner, and there are hundreds of isolated places to stop and share a moment.

Today’s walking safari should be no different, although you’re not going to be alone when you wander through the forest of Moremi Game Reserve. Go slow and listen. Rustling suggests that something is nearby, and then an elephant’s bellowing call flickers through the trees and drowns out your footsteps. Keep walking, peering through the branches at a herd of gazelle that hide in the distance. A skilled guide picks the route, weaving a path through forest, grassland, riverbanks, and ancient animal trails. Turn a corner and there he is, a four ton elephant staring you down. Stop. Savor the moment. Admire the astonishing proximity. Eventually the elephant wanders on and you continue your journey, the trail revealing close encounters with giraffe, buffalo, and all the antelope species which you can now distinguish. Your three days in Okavango are easily tailored to suit your mood. Walking safaris can be swapped for game drives, and vise versa, and a charming canoe safari awaits tomorrow. Each activity provides a new angle; from a vehicle you cover more distance and see more animals, while the experience on foot has a marvelous realism and a stunning evocation of nature’s power. After the drama of the safari the camp awaits, and what could be better than sitting on the balcony, wrapping a blanket around each other, and allowing Botswana’s indelible residents to sporadically interrupt the private party."

You’re in a narrow dug-out canoe, feasting your eyes along the luxuriant blue channels and rich grass covered banks. Before you reach the hippos, it’s an elephant herd that fills the channel, youngsters playfully trying to drown each other and trunks occasionally popping out from the water. Distant commotion seems to be putting everyone on edge, and as you gaze across the river your eyes meet the elevated snouts of a full hippo pod. Aggressive males are testing their strength by powering into each other. It’s not a full blown fight, but it will be if neither backs down from these opening exchanges. It’s often the hippos that provide the drama as you go on a canoe safari. Balancing the experience and tilting it towards grace and charm will be the endearing herds that drink from the shallows. Even the hyenas have a certain elegance as they greedily lap up the water as you paddle past. Hippos aside, there’s tranquility in being on the river and soaking up this epic oasis. Every mammal seems to have a smile and each sighting provides another photo opportunity. Yet it’s the sheer inescapable beauty of the Okavango that lingers longest in the memory. A million shades of green juxtapose with the crisp blue water, and a fabulous contrast is provided by the ubiquitous herds."

While every couple wants to see everything, Botswana’s greatest trick is to save a surprise and reveal something new every day. Elephants and giraffe will never have left your itinerary, but as you arrive in Chobe it’s hard not to be baffled by their numbers. Imagine the sight of 100 of Africa’s largest wild elephants, weighing in at four tons and towering above any safari truck. Now try and picture what 100,000 would look like. Nobody knows how many wander across Chobe, although recent estimates suggest that six figures is not far off. You won’t be looking for them. Sit on the bed and gaze out at a couple of herds. Come back from the en-suite bathroom and find another three herds plodding along the horizon. When you settle into bed you can’t escape their calls, and when you wake in the morning they’re beside your tent. It’s not just the elephants that come in huge numbers. Giraffe are also seemingly everywhere, poking their heads above the trees and quietly munching on the vegetation. Impala join this abundant party, as do a healthy collection of boisterous hippos. You don’t get bored. Sometimes it’s an old bull wandering lonely out of the forest. At other times you’re bewitched by tiny babies taking their first steps. Occasionally herds face each other down as they approach the water, while few moments can encapsulate the Botswana experience better than checking into your tent and discovering telltale footprints in the nearby sand. From the Okavango a light aircraft will take you into Chobe National Park, dropping you on an isolated airstrip beside the Savuti Marsh.

Slowly you force yourself forward to have a closer look at the predator. There was no need to be so worried, the lioness just wanted to sleep beside the back wheel. While the hunting scenes and immense herds imbue a stunning sense of power, Chobe packs in a dazzling enchantment. It’s on display from the splendid comfort of your camp. It elevates the moments of affection you have with each other. And it ensures that you’re constantly comparing moments and discussing your favorite memory from the day. Stop to appreciate the zebras, how they tentatively care for each other and gracefully canter away from danger. Admire the hartebeest and see how their horns indicate power in the herd. Gaze at a slumbering leopard and meet its shining eyes with your own. And find your very own piece of Africa in this pristine section of the world."

        "description": "You will arrive in Maun, the quaint town on the edge of the Okavango Delta, and breathe in your first Botswana air. You will then be met at the airport and taken to your light aircraft charter that will whisk you away into true paradise, tucked away as a unique oasis occurring within the Kalahari Desert. The Delta is one of the world’s few remaining areas of pristine wilderness. The vast majority of its sprawling wetlands are created by trapping the Angola rains that flow down from a catchment area of 200,000 square kilometers which are then caught in a tectonic basin. With the coming of these floods, the area of water in the Delta expands from roughly 6,000 square kilometers to 15,000 square kilometers. The area is subject to high levels of seismic activity because of its position over five major fault lines, two of which are named the Thamalakane and Kunyere fault lines. Astonishingly, deposition over hundreds of years has built up the Kalahari sand basin to such an extent that the “quakes” caused by the geological movements beneath the Delta are completely cushioned by the sand, and no tremors are felt. Correctly termed an “alluvial fan,” this oasis is the only perennial river that flows east and does not reach the ocean. It is the third largest Ramsar site in the world, which means it is a wetland of international importance, and its status protects it so that privileged visitors may enjoy its jaw-dropping beauty. Spread out into a hand-like shape, this alluvial panhandle is comprised of permanent swamps, deep lagoons, and channels that snake through the would-be desert sands of the Kalahari. During years of high rainfall in Angola, the flood spreads even farther across this dry land, filling up temporary channels and floodplains that in turn attract even greater numbers of game. The spectacular and diverse topography of the Delta has drawn wildlife of unmatched variety and abundance, and it is without doubt Botswana’s reigning glory. At your first camp you will behold vast and undisturbed plains and woodlands stretching out as far as the eye can see. The gorgeous camp with its authentic and luxurious tent-style rooms was designed with an understated elegance chosen especially for this camp. Your room is raised on a wooden deck, allowing you an ideal vantage point for wildlife spotting from the comfort of your own private space. Free-standing bathtubs, a writing desk and an outdoor shower (bathing under the stars is a must!) are just a few of the charming highlights of your room. Awake each morning to the rumbling territorial call of a lion in the nearby floodplains, and listen for the cackles of hyena at night as they bicker and squabble in the darkness. You may hear the hooting whistle of a Giant Eagle owl, or hear jackals calling from the distance. These are the sounds of Africa, and they are blissfully worlds away from the noise of the city. Out here the staggering sense of space will overwhelm you, and the air you breathe will be the freshest you can imagine."

Head to the main area for afternoon tea and meet your guide for the next few days, an expert with a wealth of knowledge about the flora and fauna of the area and who will take you on a journey through the paradise surrounding camp in search of stunning encounters with four-legged and winged creatures! The Okavango Delta is famous for its abundance of game and the area of this camp is no exception. You will set out into this wilderness in an open 4x4 vehicle to seek all manner of creatures and breathtaking scenery. Emerge from a cool, dark forest onto a sprawling floodplain to encounter a vast herd of wildebeest or zebra. Spot the telltale neck of the elegant giraffe poking out over a palm island, or reaching for the juicy leaves of an impossibly high acacia. There are predators to track as well; learn how to tell leopard from lion by their footprints in the sand, and don’t forget to look up above you for the sleek profile of a lounging cat! As the camp is in a private concession, you will have the opportunity to stay out after a delicious drink or two watching the sun set over the plains, and search for nocturnal creatures. At night, you may experience a new dimension to this beautiful and intriguing wilderness, and with the help of spotlights you may encounter a myriad of rare species such as aardwolf, genet, civet, hyena and even the comical Bat-Eared fox. After your exciting adventure, head back into camp for cocktails around the fire, a hearty dinner and your warm, cozy bed complemented by the natural surround-sound of the bush. Your morning wake-up call will be early (but it’s bound to be worth it) and your guide will knock gently at your door to let you know it is safe to emerge into the cool and crisp air for your next expedition. There will be a light breakfast or just a coffee for those who need a bit of a caffeine fix at that time, and off you will go into new and exciting territories for your morning’s exploration."

Nestled in a copse of Ebony trees, your camp itself is raised on wooden decks similar to Lebala, but with a unique and different style. Once again there will be delicious meals in camp and a welcoming fire to sit around in the evenings with a drink, as well as a snug lounge area to sit and relax with a book or simply take in the gorgeous view.

        "description": "Everyone dreams of the perfect African wildlife photos. You’ve probably got the zoom lens ready as you arrive in Botswana and feast your eyes on the Central Kalahari Game Reserve. But before the first game drive, it’s worth switching lenses and taking some time to capture the scene. There is your camp, secluded and charming as it sits in the middle of the famed Kalahari. A few kudu and hartebeest dot the dusty landscape, and, well, that’s about it. Botswana offers unrivaled wilderness. There are no roads, very few other tourists, and nothing to interrupt your continual immersion in nature. And as you photograph the camp’s evocative surroundings things begin to move. Perhaps an elephant that gently emerges on the horizon, maybe a carefully camouflaged hyena running through brittle grass, or a herd of wildebeest that were hiding behind your tent. After arriving in Maun you’ll transfer to a light aircraft and land in the heart of Africa’s second largest game reserve. You’ve got three days in an untouched land that covers more than 50,000 square kilometers. Enchanting sights are easily spotted from your bed. Just open the curtains and one of Africa’s greatest theater spaces dazzles in front of your eyes. As you head out on a game drive, a flurry of close-ups require steady hands and sharp shutter speeds. While the Kalahari may sometimes look barren, it’s home to a phenomenal concentration of majestic black-maned lions. Prides lounge beneath the sporadic trees, seemingly sleeping. But zoom in and most of the lions have one eye open, carefully inspecting the land without betraying their slumber. It’s not you that excited them. A gemsbok herd meanders nearby, heading to the waterhole. Capture the change in expression as the lionesses rise and plot their approach. Then follow the scene as it slowly plays out."

        "description": "The Central Kalahari Game Reserve will provide two very distinct collections of photos. There is the raw desolation and ruggedness of the landscape; grass wilts beneath the sun, dead trees rise randomly from rocky ground, and endless bushland changes color with the rains. A tower of giraffe or an antelope herd provides the contrast in the distance, while a wandering herd may require a new focal length as they pass the camp. Documenting the sheer power of the Kalahari is something that will fill these three days. But there’s also the charming close-ups; the melancholy of a lone elephant bull, a kudu’s frightened expression that quickly changes to relief, or the solemn stare of a stealthy leopard. This emotion not only adds spectacular life to the Kalahari’s power, it epitomizes the dynamic nature of an ancient environment. Over these two days you’ll be going on long morning and late afternoon game drives. Not only will you be exploring during prime lighting conditions, these times are also when the wildlife is at its most active. When the blistering midday sun comes down you take a rest or a siesta at the camp. The reserve’s sheer size means that you’ll cover long distances, looping past popular lion hangouts and stopping beside overpopulated waterholes. Such a challenging environment makes for an intense battle for survival, and this is the Central Kalahari’s unrivaled attraction; big cats out on a hunt, desperate herds searching for water, boisterous males fighting for mating rights, and scavengers seeking out a meal. Go exploring and the dramas of Kalahari life will never stop."

The landscapes seem so disparate that it’s almost impossible to believe that they’re all from the same country. Depart from the tiny airstrip and fly over the Kalahari to Makgadikgadi, a vast dried-up lakebed that provides a real challenge for photographers. A blanket of white extends beyond the horizon, the salt pans shimmering and glistening beneath the sun. Levitating above the ground is a misty mirage, blurring the contrast between land and sky into oblivion. Start taking photos. The glare poses one problem, while the intense white adds another. And where do you find contrast to bring the photo to life? Photography isn’t supposed to always be easy. These two days will take you deep into the heart of one of the world’s most surreal landscapes. Experiment, play around, and take your time, because when everything comes together the results are spectacular. On your first afternoon here you’ll be exploring the edges of the pan. Discover meerkat colonies that seem to be awaiting your arrival. They stand and turn their heads with comic timing, before scurrying across the ground and playfully joining others. Go slowly and it’s easy to approach and even shake hands with the meerkats, although any sudden movements and the whole colony humorously waddles off. As your guide walks you into the pan a peculiar cast awaits. Out of nowhere an ostrich appears and skips past. Rare aardwolves and bat-eared foxes scamper to their burrows, while brown hyena leave their prints in the salt. Return to camp and gaze skyward to another white wonderland. It’s hundreds of miles to the nearest settlement and artificial light. So leave the shutter open and get those dreamy shots of stars moving across the night sky."

You’re surrounded by the cracked salt and lost in a lunar-like landscape that baffles both eyes and camera. Evocative dead trees appear from nowhere, adding a poignant contrast to the photos. Elephant prints snake and then disappear, while bird song welcomes you to sporadic sandbanks. As you spend two days here you get used to the conditions. Gradually your shots begin to do the landscape justice, and it almost looks like you’ve been photographing the moon. Makgadikgadi reflects the unrivaled attraction of Botswana, because while many Africa countries can offer excellent photographic wildlife safari, nowhere can combine it with such crisp dazzling landscapes. Spend a whole day getting lost on your quad bike and then return to camp for another night of marveling at stars."

Impala skip past the camp, elephants and hippos are counted in their hundreds, and a wonderful cast of Africa’s greats surrounds you at every turn. The Okavango is a place where your camera must be ready at all times. Sit back on your private verandah and out of nowhere a zebra herd approaches. Open the curtains and the nearby waterhole is filled with frolicking elephants. Turn a corner during a game drive and 15 giraffe block the trail. This is a place of nonstop action, continual excitement, and thousands upon thousands of photo opportunities. Sometimes it’s too much to take in. You’re eagerly snapping away at a playful hippo pod and your guide alerts you to the lion pride that’s silently walked to within meters of the vehicle. By spending three days here you have time to relax and soak up all the enchantment. There’s no need to rush. Each safari adventure can be long and customized, allowing you to stop beside a serene scene, or follow paw prints into the wilderness.

When the water level is low everything is still green, and herds congregate for nature’s year-round banquet. When it floods, the delta becomes an almost endless sheet of water; ungulates splash through the shallows, lion prides drink with abandon, and hippo pods fill the channels, eyes and snout poking out from the blue. In the heart of the Okavango Delta is Moremi Game Reserve, a labyrinthine web of waterways, lagoons, and tiny islands. Your base will be Chief’s Island, a permanently dry landmass that couldn’t be any further from modern civilization. Many herds get trapped on the island when the water rises, while thousands of big cats are able to flourish in a relatively small area. This is arguably Botswana’s, if not Southern Africa’s, flagship safari destination, and your camp is idyllically surrounded by everything. Don’t expect much time to carefully plan your shots, as the action will be coming thick and fast. Slither down the winding river channels on a traditional mokoro , a dug-out canoe, an expert gondolier taking you past dozens of hippo pods and the enchanting life that approaches the riverbank. Swap wheels for walking boots and wander across the island, your finger shaking above the shutter as you come face to face with most of Botswana’s wild animals. That includes elephants, although expert guides ensure you never get too close to the big cats. On long game drives it feels like you’re in a wildlife documentary, the nonstop succession of predators and prey unrivaled almost anywhere in Africa.

Almost 100,000 wild elephants roam across Chobe, making this easily the largest concentration of them on the planet. Photograph the cute babies as they try and keep pace with the herd, zoom in on families that play in the water, sometimes nothing but a curled trunk poking out from below. Capture the loneliness of an old male that’s been cast out from the herd. Then zoom out and see just how many elephants you can get into one shot. Linyanti is a private reserve within Chobe National Park and if offers a wonderful degree of privacy and seclusion. Like elsewhere in Botswana, there won’t be other safari trucks ruining the image, or dozens of budding photographer’s shooting the same scene. Particularly when compared to East African safaris, Botswana’s lack of crowds ensures that the untouched world is yours, and only yours to discover. It’s the elephant herds and hippo pods that will likely dominate your first day here, so play around with the camera settings and revel in the endless opportunity to photograph nature’s largest mammals."

These Kalahari elephants are the largest in the world and they dwarf the vehicle, so don’t use the flash and startle them. Return to the camp for a lazy last lunch on your balcony, overlooking a waterhole and watching the assorted cast of characters come for a drink. The final game drive is for going slow and savoring Botswana for one final time. Watch a pair of cheetahs elegantly survey the scene before dipping below the grass. Smile as the hippos waddle into the water and boisterously push each other out of the way. Hide around a corner and wait for the rustling to get closer. What will emerge from the trees?

On these remote and barren plains it's rare that you'll come across other safari vehicles. So forget any notions of a dozen trucks surrounding a lion. For most of the time, it's just the two of you alone with nature. Turn away from the sprinting springbok herd and admire the hunters. A pride walks unhurriedly along a sandy trail, black manes flowing on the breeze and argumentative cubs trying to keep pace with their mothers. The Central Kalahari is famed for its lions, the ravenous hunters thriving in a seemingly challenging environment. Cheetahs are also a mainstay of safaris here and four days is a good amount of time to capture elusive leopard sightings.

        "description": "Wake up and the senses are immediately tickled: something can be heard grazing beside the tent, breakfast smells mingle with the heavy morning air, and you peer through the canvas at a red hartebeest herd. Take a leisurely breakfast, nothing on two legs interrupting the panorama. What's that? A finger points and the glance of excited recognition is returned by your partner. Exhilaration builds as the rhino moves closer, a lone wanderer in search of water. You want to grab the camera but you can't. The scene is too difficult to leave. That's the final one of the Big Five checked off your list, but by now you'll have learned that Botswanan safari isn't about lists of animals to see; it's about the feeling of being transported in the animals' kingdom. Continue your Kalahari adventure today with another drive heading roughly westward. As always, expect an unhurried pace and the guide occasionally waiting in the vehicle so you have priceless hours of seclusion in these game-filled hinterlands. Every moment of the experience is safari: game drives, sitting around a fire as giraffe necks silhouette against the raw sunset, or following a lion pride for over an hour as they stalk the ungulates at the waterhole. Tonight's luxury tented camp continues the theme from the last two days. So you should both expect the impressions of nature to proceed uninterrupted."

        "description": "As you cross rivers and weave onto the fringes of the Central Kalahari, new colors suddenly arrive like apparitions from a dream. A white wonderland stands before your eyes, the crusted layer of salt stretching far beyond the horizon. The Makgakigadi Salt Pan is one of Africa's most unexplored natural wonders, the carefully preserved wilderness untouched by footprints. Meerkats peek their heads from the chalky mirage, hoof prints suggest zebra are nearby, and a mirage floats just above the ground. Today's experience is one of Africa's most remote and rugged. Leave the safari vehicle and ride a quad bike into the whiteness. It's a 90 minute journey, each mile taking you further into a baffling landscape. Botswana is firmly dedicated to conservation and permanent structures are not permitted on the pan. The quad bike journey must follow a defined route that doesn't harm the landscape. Camp has been set up on a raised platform of grass with 360 degree views over the salt pan. It's very simple, but it's more than worth it. Thick mattresses are rolled out beneath the stars; a crackling fire keeps you company, and the stars shine uninhibited."

        "description": "Rumble out of the salt pan and enjoy a leisurely morning at a camp on the periphery of Makgakidadi. Enjoy a sumptuous breakfast, take a long hot shower, and then board a tiny Cessna aircraft for the next part of your safari adventure. New colors come through the window, vibrant canopies of green surrounding exuberantly blue waterways. You're still in the desert, still in a land that barely receives rain, but water cascades down from the Angolan Highlands and forms the Okavango Delta, an immense oasis and haven for millions of mammals. There are only two seats in the back of the plane and you're flying together over the Okavango. Touch down on Chief's Island, a flourishing green blanket that's inaccessible by road. Your camp is cleverly perched above the river, ensuring that wading mammals are an omnipresent part of the backdrop. It's hard to sit on your secluded veranda and not see something on four legs. Enjoy a late afternoon game drive that explores the forest. It's overgrown and rugged here; the visibility is reduced yet the spine-tingling intimacy is increased. Gaze into the branches and see a leopard lying in silence. Wait. Stay quiet. The leopard elegantly climbs down and begins its evening hunt."

        "description": "An early morning game drive continues the safari adventure. The Okavango Delta and the Central Kalahari are very different destinations; the latter is dry and remote, meaning that animal sightings are usually concentrated around permanent water. But in the Okavango you'll see mammals dappling the landscape at all angles. This afternoon provides a new perspective. Climb into a traditional mokoro canoe and an oarsman takes you along the waterways. Admire the life on the banks, everything coming down for a slurp of goodness. Elephants are particularly impressive on a boat safari. But the longest impression is left by the hippos. Hundreds, perhaps thousands of them can be seen in just one mokoro trip. Large pods rest in the channels, barely leaving a snout above the water. Others rumble across the floodplains, their hefty bulk somehow managing to lend it an air of cuteness. Return to camp for another romantic leisurely evening, a dinner table illuminated by kerosene lanterns and the two of you far away from any other guests."

You're counting elephant herds; except you've soon lost count because there are some 100,000 elephants in this national park. It's difficult to go even a few moments without seeing them. From Chief's Island you take another unforgettable air safari, the pilot swooping above the waterways and dropping you in an undisturbed corner of Chobe National Park. Views of moving elephant herds are especially impressive from the sky. Touch down and an afternoon game drive brings dazzling encounters with the pachyderms. Giraffe are similarly abundant and as you gaze across the horizon you see multiple necks poking above the treetops."

Like always, enjoy a leisurely pace, lots of privacy, and the safari to continue from your exclusive camp. There's sure to be defining moments that will stay with you for life. Perhaps the hippos rampaging around? Maybe the elusive rhino spot? A lion hunt? Or the ongoing elephant herds? Or perhaps the scene you enjoy every evening, that of just you and your partner relaxing in the heart of unfenced African animal kingdoms."

        "description": "The landscape changes but the charm continues on the second part of your Southern Africa escape. Fly over to Mozambique and gaze down at the sapphire waters. You'll be picked up from the airport in a private helicopter and taken over to your own Indian Ocean island. Hundreds of islets and sandbanks form the Bazaruto Archipelago, almost all of them uninhabited. There are only half a dozen private cottages on your island, each tucked into the trees yet elegantly opening out onto the beach and marine blue. You have your own pristine white sand beach, an attentive butler bringing anything you might need, and the absolute bliss you would expect from a tiny Indian Ocean island. Rest, indulge, and decompress in this dreamy combination of sand and indigenous forest. All drinks and meals are included and brought to your wooden cottage. Think cocktails served in freshly dropped coconuts, lobster straight from the ocean, and a chef that tailors the menu to your palate. For five days time stands still. Lie in the hammock, lounge on the sand, splash in the crystal clear shallows and enjoy the languid rhythm. A variety of activities complement the island's utopia. Traditional wooden sailing boats can be chartered to tour the archipelago. This is a UNESCO World Heritage site and the conglomeration of sandbanks hide sheltered lagoons and bays for days of enjoying the sun. Step out from your beach and a vivid marine reef awaits your snorkel. Dolphins regularly swim past and you can swim with whale sharks, the ocean's biggest fish, and a regular visitor to these waters. Go fishing or scuba diving, or simply turn over and reapply the sunscreen."

        "title": "Savuti - Indelible Residents at Savuti",
        "description": "Scorched land welcomes you to Botswana, a sweeping expanse of dusty savanna surrounding the transit hub of Maun. Views from the plane window provide an indication of scale as you transfer to a hopper flight and cross the northern half of the country. First comes the lavish waterways of the Okavango Delta, then swathes of rich green forest, and now a prehistoric landscape as you land in the very west of Chobe National Park and the Savuti Channel area. Dead trees rise from a shriveled lake bed, firmly rooted yet struggling to flourish in such a challenging environment. Savuti epitomizes the dynamism of Africa’s wildlife world. The erratic channel flows for years, and then mysteriously dries up for decades. Very recently, for the first time in almost 30 years, a once dusty lake bed has become a vibrant marsh. Savuti provides a raw and unadulterated safari experience as the competition for natural resources plays out before your eyes. Charming and intimate, your camp overlooks the Savuti Channel, the centerpiece of the region. Private wooden balconies provide platforms that gaze down on the animal world. Your luxury tent is raised off the ground on stilts, so it’s possible to sit on your sumptuous bed and watch a few buffalo wander past. Meals are served under the stars with the unmistakable trumpeting calls of elephants for company. Hidden hides have been built around the channel, providing unforgettable close-ups of the wildlife that approaches the water. Wander down and watch in awe as everything comes seemingly within touching distance. Sometimes you don’t even need the hides to get that close. The camp is perfectly blended into the environment, and elephants are among the inquisitive creatures that take a closer look. If you arrive in time then the afternoon will be spent on a game drive. If not, rest up and get your first glimpses from the balcony."

        "title": "Savuti - Spectacular Safari Around the Savuti Channel",
        "description": "It’s difficult to overstate the importance of water to this region. Since 2010 the channel has been filled with swimming crocodiles and drinking herds. Yet it was parched for decades. An indelible collection of residents has always lived in the area, but the channel’s recent transformation has seen the whole area become an oasis for wandering nomads. Head off into the surrounding hills and gaze down on Savuti from leopard territory. The stealthy cats hide high in the trees, a swinging tail betraying their camouflage. Klipspringer nimbly jump across rocky outcrops while herds of zebra and wildebeest make their irrefutable journeys through the forest. Now descend into the marsh area, tracking the footprints as an abundant cast is magnetically attracted to the water. Three days provide the opportunity to really explore Savuti’s combination of habitats. Go on game drives through the woodland; lone elephant bulls uproot trees, giraffes feed from the high branches, while kudu herds rest in the shade. When the trees rescind you’re out on open expanses of savannah, the grass color dependent on whether you’re here in wet or dry season. When the rains come the wildlife disperses across a large area, meaning that there is never a moment without something to admire. Some of the plains become near deserted during the dry months, nothing but a roaming lion pride on the parched ground. But the animals haven’t disappeared. Just follow the trail to the water. A normal safari day will combine a collection of activities with a few hours of relaxing at camp during the mid-afternoon sun. Drive on rugged trails and watch a surreal world unfold. Lionesses are out on the prowl, inspecting the water and causing a herd of zebra to curtail their morning drink. Elephants and giraffe seem to accompany every turn; endearing babies try and keep pace with the rest, lone males walk with a melancholy air, and herds compete for prime river space. Swap the wheels for a boat and saunter downstream, taking in the collection of wildlife from a new angle. There’s a charming serenity to being on the water, before it’s interrupted by a crocodile snapping at an impala on the banks. Customize your luxury Botswana safari trip with drives and boat trips, and drench yourself in Savuti’s spectacular world."

        "description": "The Savuti Channel snakes and stutters as it marks the western edge of Chobe National Park. It’s not alone. Other channels sporadically flow and become intermittent waterholes. Others have been dry for centuries, leaving behind sandy banks and winding trails. This morning your game drive follows these ancient channels, taking you on a challenging route through the rarely seen wilderness. Elands grace the trees with their majestic horns and impressive size. Buffalo herds appear lost on the open stretches of savannah. Other antelopes find solace in the woodland, knowing that there is less threat of predators here. Your destination is Linyanti in the Northwestern corner of the park, the extended game drive bringing you to a new camp and exhibiting the range of ecosystems that mark Chobe. Settle into your camp and gaze down on the permanent waterhole beside your luxury tent. As always, camp and tent don’t reflect any connotations of budget travel. The canvas walls ensure nature’s soundtrack always plays, and the tents effortlessly demonstrate Botswana’s commitment to ecotourism. Concrete would look extremely out of place. Wooden floors and decking surround the tent, while raised beds and en-suite bathrooms provide an elevated level of comfort in the bush. You’ll have hot showers and Western toilets, as well as a wandering cast of ungulates approaching your balcony."

        "title": "Linyanti - Sandy Banks, Swamps, and Linyanti’s Oasis",
        "description": "Whereas Savuti provides a demonstration of nature’s challenges, Linyanti reveals what’s possible when water always flows. Cruise along the river and stop beside a playful elephant herd. Young males test their strength by half drowning each other, their trunks rising from the depths like a submarine’s periscope. Adults splash themselves with ongoing jets of water, while babies take first swimming lessons beside a mother’s watchful eye. Open lagoons become havens for hippo pods. They spend all day in the water, and from the land, you get little more than a glimpse at some snouts. Yet a boat safari brings you within meters; males jockey for position and mating rights, huge hulks of flesh appear like stepping stones across the blue, and it’s possible to see pods that number up to 40 individuals. During the dry season, wildlife migrates for hundreds of miles to reach Linyanti’s oasis. Come in the wet season and the whole area becomes a verdant floodplain, the antelopes poetically skipping through miles of shallow water. Such abundance supports an astonishing collection of predators. Lion prides rest beside your eyes, happily allowing the safari truck to stop just meters away. At least, they appear to be resting. But an open eye suggests that a lion never sleeps. They stare provocatively, a hunter’s opportunism symbolized by this eerie scene. Linyanti provides a genuine opportunity to spot the predators out hunting. Three days of safari helps maximize your chances. Perhaps it’s a couple of lions stalking their prey from a distance. Maybe it’s the panicked yelp as a Sable antelope provides the dinner banquet. It’s not limited to lions. Leopards come out in the cool hours, dipping their necks below the grass with solemn precision. Wild dogs hunt with remarkable ingenuity, splitting up and then surrounding an impala they hounded away from the herd. When the predators aren’t your focus a dynamic array of wildlife keeps you company. A dazzling array of colors flutters across the pristine lagoon, while a sporadic soundtrack reaches your tent on the breeze. Your time here is split between game drives and boat safaris. Mornings and late afternoons are the best times to spot the wildlife, although your itinerary is flexible and can be tailored on a day to day basis."

        "description": "Chobe National Park is easily wider than a few European countries. The tracks that cross it are rough and rugged, weaving a route through riverine forests, endless marshland, rolling grassland, and dusty savannah. It’s a full day journey from west to east. Well, if you drove without stopping it might only take a few hours. But these rarely visited stretches of wilderness offer innumerable places to stop. Pull up beside a swamp for a picnic with the hippos. Stop in the trees and photograph rare Roan antelope. You’re driving along and suddenly the guide breaks sharply. Did you hit something? No. The truck reverses. A lion pride is resting in the grass and three tiny cubs are within meters of your camera. Crossing Chobe allows you to not only spot wildlife. It gives a real impression of the park’s scale. Take the elephants. In the last six days, you will have seen thousands; after all, Chobe contains the largest population of wild pachyderms in the world. Some estimates suggest that 100,000 live in this area and herds migrate here from neighboring Namibia, Zimbabwe, and Zambia. Drive across Chobe and you’ll see thousands in just a couple of hours. Just try and imagine what that looks like. Difficult isn't it? Every turn seems to bring another herd and some herds number in the hundreds of individuals. A full supporting cast accompanies the journey, so expect a day of big cats, indelible antelopes, hundreds of giraffe, and nonstop enchantment. Your destination is the banks of the Chobe River and another private verandah overlooking the wildlife."

        "description": "Wake this morning and gaze out onto the water. Elephants are already in the water, and a few hippos have made an early move for wading space. Beyond the Chobe River is Namibia, the flat grass plains offering a glimpse into Botswana’s mystical neighbor. Spend the day on an elegant river cruise, boarding a luxury barge and serenely exploring everything that comes to the riverbank. In Savuti you will have been on a boat safari in a small dig out mokoro (canoe), yet Chobe’s width and size means that larger boats can effortlessly make the journey. So relax on the top deck, drink in hand, and wait for Chobe to idyllically reveal itself. Elephants and hippos are the most plentiful wildlife attractions; it doesn’t matter how many times you’ve spotted them on this trip, every individual is always an endearing sight. Eagles soar overhead, crocodiles sunbathe on the banks, and a troop of baboons calls from the treetops. However, the highlight of an all-day Chobe cruise is soaking up the landscape. Lavish grass peeks out above the floodplains, sandy banks are covered in hippo prints, and immense trees dominate one bank, while endless savannah rolls out from the other. A delicious buffet lunch is served on board and this day provides a tranquil end to your safari adventure. After disembarking you will transfer by road to Zambia, and Victoria Falls. It’s less than an hour to this natural wonder and your exclusive lodge on the Zambezi River."

        "description": "Mosi-oa-Tunya can be heard before it’s seen. A cacophonous roar sails across the landscape, continuing day and night for eternity. It guides your journey, increasing in volume as you approach the largest waterfall in the world. Falls can be wider, or higher, but none dispense as much water as this thunderous natural wonder. As you get closer you see the mist rising above the canyon in thick clouds. Through the trees, you grab a quick glimpse of Victoria Falls before you walk out onto Knife-Edge Bridge and stand in awe at the scale. A mile-wide sheet plummets 328 feet into the abyss. During high water season, the spray rises and then descends onto the bridge, soaking everyone in seconds. Don’t try and avoid it. Getting wet is part of the experience. While high water is best for appreciating the raw power, low water times provide easier photo opportunities and better views. Whenever you visit, you’re going to be inspired. Spend the day appreciating the falls and understanding why its indigenous name means “the smoke that thunders.” A collection of walkways and narrow bridges take you along the length of the falls, before dropping you down into the canyon for a new vista. Even now the safari hasn’t finished as a collection of baboon troops patrol the walkways. The Zambezi River and Victoria Falls provide a seemingly endless array of entrainment. Pump up the adrenalin levels by bungee jumping or white water rafting, or slow down with a luxury dinner cruise. Then there is what Africa offers best; relaxing beside the river and watching an animal world go by."

This is the African landscape that most people hold in the minds, rugged, evocative, and seemingly endless. The planet’s second largest game reserve is practically devoid of people; each camp is set within thousands of miles of private big cat country and there are no fences preventing the wildlife from approaching your private verandah.

Arrive and relax on your sumptuous king-sized bed, check out the en-suite western bathroom in the bush, and open the curtains to hypnotic Kalahari vistas.

        "description": "In the Central Kalahari you’re never completely alone. Really? This is supposed to be a honeymoon! With just a handful of luxury tents, you hardly see any other people at the camp. The park’s size means that it’s rare to even spot another vehicle when on game drives. But open your curtains this morning and wave to the visiting wildlife. Perhaps an elephant is slowly marching past, or maybe a herd of hartebeest provide a colorful wake up call. You’re surrounded by the Kalahari’s inimitable residents, and they’ll be coming to say hello as often as you’ll be heading out to find them. This destination has a unique take on roads. You're miles from the nearest tire tracks, and the rugged roads are nothing like the highways at home. Black-maned lions rest beside rocky outcrops, lounging on each other with content stomachs and half-closed eyes. Or should that be half-open? Because as you slowly approach, the pride wakes from its slumber and a lioness decides to wander over for a closer look. Hold your breath and hold each other as the rest of the pride starts their inspection. Those lions aren’t interested in a loved-up couple, their dinner menu is the four-legged variety, so follow the pride as they cross endless bush and find the waterhole. In such a scorched landscape any permanent water source is a hive of activity. Take a picnic and gaze out at the scene. Ungulates greedily drink before skipping away, a cheetah pair causes brief panic and the crowd disperses, before an elephant bull takes no notice of the rest and plods up for a drink. There’s an intimacy to all these moments. And while most couples don’t want to see another pair of eyes on their honeymoon, few things can make you smile more than the charming wildlife of the Central Kalahari."

Leopards come down from the trees but pay you no attention. And there could be a kudu or springbok wandering around your camp. This thriving community of cats and ungulates is relatively unexplored by people. Leave the camp behind and head off for a night of adventure in the heart of the wilderness. Your mobile camp features all the comfort you could ask for in the bush, and the feeling of isolation could not be more absolute. This is the kind of privacy that few countries in the world can offer. As a fire crackles and a sumptuous dinner is served beneath the stars, you are free to soak up the indelible Kalahari cast that’s taking an interest in the camp. This goes way beyond a typical safari experience because the wildlife is not used to the camp. Some will be fearful of your arrival. Many will want a closer look. Thunderous lion roars fill the evenings although flames keep the cats to a safe distance, while a personal guard discreetly keeps his distance and ensures your safety. Like each day in the Kalahari you can customize the safari program, so there’s no need for early wake up calls if you don’t want them, and the dining table can be erected anywhere in the wilderness."

It’s a classic landscape, and the last three days will have offered a deep impression of scale. Today’s flight takes you over the Kalahari until the elephant herds can be spotted from the window and you land in one of the planet’s most unique ecosystems. Deserts are difficult places for wildlife, and the Kalahari symbolizes the ongoing battle for resources. Yet the Okavango reflects what is possible when abundant water flows all year round. It’s like a great animal party, nomads and wandering migrants traveling for hundreds of miles to drink from the cool rivers and open lagoons. So take in the visual euphoria as you fly over lavish blue expanses and touch down on Chief's Island. These light aircraft journeys don’t just offer a unique angle; they minimize your transfer time and quickly take you from wilderness to wilderness. Spot the wildlife before you even touch-down and then discover that a herd of giraffe has recently been crossing the runway. You’re immersed in the Moremi Game Reserve area of the Okavango Delta, Botswana’s most exclusive safari location. This country doesn’t do cheap tours. Its approach to conversation is centered on attracting a handful of discerning visitors. Drive to the camp and a dozen angles cause a sharp intake of breath. A small zebra herd gallops away as a pair of hyena come out of the trees, lion cubs hide behind long elephant grass, a deathly silence is pierced by an elephant’s echoing forest call, and a hippo pod is silently wandering down to the river. It’s a lot to take in and it’s hard to know which way to look. That’s why you have three full days here."

        "description": "As the sun begins to rise the calls begin. Hippos boisterously grunt as they plow into the water, eagerly marching into prime wading space. Elephants pierce the air with elongated calls. Rustling alerts you to something in the trees, so open the curtains and find out who is the culprit. Rise slowly and drink a coffee on your private verandah, taking in the soundtrack and admiring a herd that is also having a morning drink. A leisurely breakfast is briefly interrupted by a curious giraffe, before it’s time to board a quaint traditional wooden canoe. An experienced gondolier paddles you around the backwaters and lagoons, skillfully navigating the huge hippo pods, and slowly approaching baby elephants taking their first swimming lessons. There’s an elegance and enchantment to the waterways, each channel smothered by long elephant grass and an ongoing collection of thirsty antelopes. Disembark and walk into the forest, holding each other’s hand as you wander through the evidence of elephants and big cats. A skilled local guide keeps you safe, picking up on the clues and steering your tentative footsteps away from known leopard territory. When the trees rescind, the green floodplains provide a shock of color and a dancing collection of zebras and gazelle. Would now be a good time to kiss? Or perhaps that can be saved for five minutes later while standing next to a tower of giraffe. Tailor your itinerary when you’re in the Okavango Delta so that each day reflects your mood and wishes. A combination of game drives, canoe safaris, and walking safaris are all available, and the length of each journey is dictated by you. Stay out all day and take a champagne lunch to accompany the wildlife. Or lounge on the verandah and wait for everything to come to you. Of course there will be predatory encounters. Cheetahs stand on sandbanks, surveying the landscape and picking out a potential meal on the plains. Leopards stick to the trees, but a swishing tail will betray their camouflage and spotted beauty. The abundance of lion cubs reflects the bounty of this oasis. They follow their mothers on a hunt. But they seem unsure of the rules. Two scamper along before checking their stride and playfully fighting with each other. The mother looks unimpressed. You can’t go out hunting with two noisy youngsters in the background. There’s an affection in the pride’s interaction, and that’s what the Okavango Delta is all about. Each sighting is unique to you, and every second offers an intimacy with nature. You’re sharing the experience with each other, but there won’t be any other people on your safari, and nobody else will take home the same memories."

A completely unique reception follows, the Okavango Delta providing something that only a few privileged people get to experience. Now it’s time for the evening party and the invitations will be spread far and wide. Chobe National Park is home to almost 100,000 wild elephants, and the giraffe and hippo numbers are not too far behind. You can’t say hello to everything; there’s just too much to see and experience. Watch dozens of elephant herds drink from a channel that’s just five meters from your private verandah. Take a game drive and lose count of the number of giraffe you spot in just a few moments. You won’t see any new animals in Chobe, but the experience is completely different. It’s about shaking your head and wondering if and when the wonder will end. Other people aren’t invited to this party though. Once again you have your own piece of Botswana’s wilderness to savor."

While other days will have been about serene indulgence, today is about real adventure and completing the safari experience with a never-ending succession of wonder. Picnic beside a swamp, hippo snouts taking a peek at your lunch. Then drink champagne with an endless view over the river, struggling to count how many elephant herds you can get into one photo. After the excitement comes a final idyllic evening of privacy, nothing but candlelight and distant mammal silhouettes interrupting your romantic revelry."

Iconic Table Mountain towers above the city, providing a dramatic backdrop to the ocean and harbor. Rising almost vertically from the ocean, the Table Mountain chain offers stark shapes and a skyline that any city of skyscrapers would envy. Then a remarkably blue ocean stretches well beyond the horizon. Nestled between ocean and mountain is the city, calmly blending into its natural surroundings and offering a world class tourist experience. You'll be met at Cape Town International Airport and transferred to your hotel. Proudly located on its own private quay, the hotel is perfectly situated for exploring the city and enjoying serenity. It's at the center of the Victoria & Alfred Waterfront, Cape Town's most exclusive area. Gaze out onto the Atlantic Ocean. From here there is a real sense of being on the edge of the world. In fact, set sail from here and the next direct stop would be Antarctica or South America. All the hotel's newly redecorated rooms have breathtaking views. Either of Table Mountain, the ocean, or the harbor. This is truly a hotel for the discerning traveler, each evening there is wine tasting in the cellar, as well as a history and wine presentation tour."

        "title": "Cape Town – Diverse Wonders",
        "description": "With four days in Cape Town you'll have plenty of opportunity to experience many of the city's unique attractions. History, nature, animals, beaches, mountain, culture, wine farms, museums, markets; Cape Town has one of the most diverse set of attractions on the planet. Included in your itinerary is luxury chauffeur transfers to anywhere within a 10km radius of the hotel from 7am to 11pm. Private transfers can easily be arranged to any of the attractions outside the city. All this lets you tailor every day to your own needs. But with so much on offer where do you start? It's a breathless and challenging two hour hike to the summit of Table Mountain. Fortunately, a revolving cable car also makes the journey, offering a spectacular 360º panorama of the city below. From the top of Table Mountain the whole South Western tip of Africa rolls out in front of your eyes. On one side the blue Atlantic Ocean continues into the distance. On the other, the Table Mountain chain extends and continues until the very tip of the continent. Down below, the city shimmers under the sun, buildings flanked by green forest and the curve of Table Bay. On many days a waterfall of cloud gradually descends over the mountain. This stunning sight is one of the highlights of Cape Town and often occurs in the late afternoon. However, it can quickly ruin the views from the summit. Once the cloud comes it won't disappear until the next day. That's why it's always good to visit the summit at the first chance the mountain is clear. Cape Town's mountain backdrop isn't just about the Table Mountain Summit. Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens offer easy hiking trails and restaurants with peerless views. The Durbenville wine farms lead visitors on a merry tour through exclusivity and winding green valleys. Peering over the ocean, Chapman's Peak Drive is one of the world's most spectacular roads. It clings to the mountain, an engineering marvel that twists and turns its way to the south-western tip of Africa. Viewpoints along the road showcase the peninsula's wonders. Gaze down on the pristine white sand of Noordhoek, admire cute fishing villages that sit in the mountain's shadow, and watch huge swathes of green wilderness unfurl as you reach the very tip of the continent. Driving the Chapman's Peak Drive sometimes feels like driving over the ocean. And it's this ocean that brings more of Cape Town's marvels. At Boulders Beach a huge colony of jackass penguins waddle uninhibitedly, casually jumping into the ocean or playing with their partners. They fill the beach, at times standing and squawking within touching distance of visitors. Arrive in the late afternoon to maximize your chances of paddling in the gentle waves with these incredible birds. Further along the coast, just two hours drive from Cape Town, is the world's best land whale watching spot. From May to November, huge numbers of Southern right and humpback whales migrate along the coast, stopping to nurse their young in the still waters. From the Hermanus cliffs it's possible to spot these 30 foot plus giants in sheltered coves barely 75 feet away away. Boat trips take people even closer. From the town's relaxed waterfront, a local cryer uses a kelp horn to alert people of any passing whales. Ocean also means beaches. Relax on Camps Bay Beach, the upmarket hangout of the city's beautiful residents. Or wander the endless stretches of sand north of the city, gazing back at the mountain skyline. The ocean also holds history. Ex-inmates give tours of Robben Island , telling stories and allowing people to feel just how hard life could be. Imagine a cell little bigger than a bed. Now imagine being incarcerated there for 18 years, receiving a visitor just once a year. Nelson Mandela spent 18 years on Robben Island and this poignant tour only increases your admiration for the man. Then see another side of the city's history by wandering the colorful streets of Bo Kaap, the former slave quarter where every house is painted a different bold shade of paint. Cape Town is shaped by its history and its residents. Each culture brings their own styles, diminutive fragments harmoniously coming together to create a unique atmosphere that's hard to find anywhere else on the continent. Fine dining restaurants combine the best of disparate cuisines, local markets showcase centuries old tradition, while the city center reveals influences from all over the continent. This is a city of diverse experiences and the relaxed vibe perforates through it all. Savor fresh barbecued seafood from a restaurant overlooking the bay, meet colorful traders with fascinating stories to tell, then enjoy a local glass of wine as the sunset paints a vibrant picture. With four days you've got an opportunity to sample all of Cape Town."

        "description": "Botswana is an endless expanse of wilderness. This is one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world and a lot of it is barely accessible by road. You'll be transferred to Cape Town International for your flight to Maun. You'll be met in Maun and assisted with your hopper flight to your camp. From this tiny plane the views are unforgettable. Thick swathes of vivid forest contrast with brown dusty desert, while the great waterways of the Okavango Delta meander and then expand into huge lakes. This is a world that few people inhabit and you'll be landing in a sweeping expanse of savannah. Just west of the heart of Chobe National Park, this is a wild area marked by its unpredictable wet and dry cycles. It's home to a full assortment of nature's great mammals, and offers one of the world's most sublime game viewing experiences. The unique combination of habitats attracts a diverse collection of wildlife and offers a variety of Botswana safari experiences. Let's start with the surrounding Gubatsa Hills, where ancient rock paintings tell a story of when early man first viewed wildlife in this area. Leopards sleep high in the trees, coming down to hunt any passing migrants. Klipspringer camouflage into the stone, nimbly clinging to tiny ridges and then agilely jumping between rocks. During the summer rains, great herds of zebra and wildebeest migrate to the fresh marshlands, raising the eyebrows of resident predators. Cape buffalo and elephants also arrive in their thousands, large herds marching onto the savanna. Black-backed jackal scurry around, while thousands of kudu and other antelope graze with a mindful ear. Lion prides dominate the eco-system, taking their pick from innumerable prey that feeds on the lush grass. Cheetahs are a spectacular spot, the speedy predator always finding a meal on the savannah. Hyenas roam for miles, looking for easy targets or leftover scraps, while African wild dogs hunt in intelligent packs. Savute is a pristine and untouched environment, where the animal interactions have not been affected or altered by man. Water dictates life in Savute. For many recent years the riverbeds were dry, and for many years before that they were swarming with swimming crocodiles. Now the water has returned and the stunning transformation of the landscape has attracted more and more wildlife to the Savuti Channel and the Zibadianja Lagoon. Located on an isolated part of the famous Savuti Channel, your camp offers front row seats for game viewing. Charming and intimate, this camp has five luxury walk-in tents with en-suite facilities. Polished wooden decking provides large balconies where the daily animal world plays out in front of your eyes. Raised off the ground on stilts, it's possible to gaze out from the tent onto the grasslands and spot playful elephants, lions, and unmistakable herds of buffalo. Luxurious and perfectly blending into the environment, this is 5* ecotourism at its best. A thatched dining area, bar, and plunge pool, are all available on site. Meals are usually served under the stars, with wine and beer included. Dotted around the camp are well positioned hides that offer incredible close-up wildlife viewing. These safe sanctuaries allow you to appreciate a world that is scarcely believable. Unlike other wilderness areas, this region offers numerous different ways to experience the wildlife on offer. Game drives take you onto the savanna in Land Rovers, bringing you unbelievably close to the wildlife residents. Lone bull elephants stare at the vehicle, while over 300 species of resident birds thrill you with their spectacular antics. Then a night drive reveals a different side to the environment. Aardvarks, servals and porcupines, come out under the cover of darkness, and your experienced guide knows just how to track them. Now saunter downstream, taking in the wilderness from a boat and spotting the wildlife lazing along the embankments. Finally, get even closer with a thrilling walking safari, guided by experienced animal trackers."

        "description": "The largest inland water system in the world completes your unique Southern Africa itinerary. The Okavango Delta is a meandering series of waterways that support an inimitable array of animal and plant life. Technically this area is semi-desert, and without the delta it would be dry Kalahari savannah. Rains fall in Angola's western highlands, flowing into Namibia before entering Botswana and spreading out over an immense area that is the Okavango Delta. This natural wonder is visible from space and has been chosen as one of the seven natural wonders of Africa. Animals descend on the Okavango, coming for the life-giving source of water that flows all year round. A diverse assortment of birds and plants have evolved to maximize the Delta's bounty, and great numbers of hippos and crocodiles thrive. Little Tubu camp offers a perfect opportunity to immerse yourself in an ecosystem that cannot be found anywhere else. Situated on Hunda Island, its isolated location is ideal for enjoying the diverse species that call Okavango home. An elevated dining area and pool deck stand in the shade of a riverine tree canopy, overlooking a seasonal riverbed which flows with the constant wanderings of a variety of game. With a maximum of six guests, Little Tubu offers an exclusive and intimate experience. Each traditional style en-suite tent has a private deck, ensuring the spectacular views of the Delta are maximized. This unique environment can be enjoyed in many different ways. Daytime and nighttime safari drives explore the acacia woodlands, each turn through the trees bringing a new delight. Elephants lurk around the corner, lion prides can be found in the clearings, while springbok, lechwe and kudu vigilantly drink from the water. Warthogs scurry across the ground, while zebra and Sable antelope adds their distinct colors to the cast of regularly spotted wildlife. At daytime the spots are easier, but under the thrilling blanket of darkness it's possible to get very close to the animals. During the winter season, usually from May to September, it's possible to explore the delta by boat or traditional wooden mokoro. Hippos bathe barely meters from the boat, Nile crocodiles cover the embankments, while every river turn reveals another animal tentatively taking a drink. After the savanna, the Okavango Delta offers an entirely different and equally inspiring wildlife experience."

As you fly over one of the world’s most extraordinary ecosystems, you will be able to see the expanding wetlands as you cross from Maun into the heart of the Delta. The water seeps into the Kalahari sand to create striking contrasts of clear blue lagoons and dry, dusty bush. This landscape has attracted abundant wildlife, and the animals and birds of the Delta can flourish uninterrupted in this world of plentiful water, fertile soils and, of course, that famous African sun. Whilst staying in this wilderness, you will experience unparalleled beauty and adventure. Wake up to the sound of lions roaring through the early morning mist, or hippo grunting contentedly amongst the reeds. Your camp is situated in a tranquil and remote location on its own island (aptly named “Paradise Island”). You will find yourself in a picturesque spot, where watery channels seep into the grassy plains and the large ears of elephants can be seen dotted around the palm islands, flapping gently to cool the grey giants hidden by the reeds. Climb aboard an open Land Rover and head off in search of leopard and lion; glide soundlessly through the channels by mokoro to spot kingfishers and herons and walk in the footsteps of giants on a guided walk. With a hat, camera and binoculars, you are ready to take on any adventure!

Your safari lodge has a unique and contemporary design, with star-decks and sunken lounges to allow you to absorb the starry Botswana skies with a gin and tonic in hand after a long day of gallivanting. This area is abundant with a huge variety of species, from the famous golden wild dogs, to handsome sable and roan antelope. Duba Plains is set about with vast, seasonally inundated floodplains, and it is here that the lion population has really come into its own. This area has become famous for interactions between the great buffalo herds and the resident lions that have adapted to the watery territory and hunt during the day, their strategies being centered around the manipulation of the buffalo across the grassy floodplains. At either camp, you can look forward to a range of adventures and expeditions in new terrains, on game drives or bush walks for a more peaceful and intimate experience in the bush. When water levels allow, you may leap aboard a motorboat or a mokoro and head into the lagoons and watery channels for a relaxed cruise or for some fishing.

The charm of the morning is in the cooler air when most animals, the nocturnal searchers and daytime hunters, wander through the brush; the night-dwellers ready to settle in, while the diurnals are ready to come alive. With the light of dawn you will venture out along the floodplains of the river, meandering through the woodlands, and finding the splendor of the landscape every step of the way. On your first game drive in Africa you will climb aboard an open-air vehicle and find the teak buildings of your lodge quickly fading behind the trees. The cold, early ambiance is speckled with light. Whether winding along the wetlands or sifting through the trees, the animals are apparent and abundant. You can see the pale, creamy fur from collections of impala through the trees in almost every direction. The adolescent males’ horns proudly point in long strides. They are able to leap up to 10 feet in the air when scared or defending themselves. You can hear a thumping in the distance combined with the tearing of wood. You come across a herd of elephants brushing against the trees and marking their pathway. The Kalahari elephants are the largest of any elephant population, while their tusks are shorter due to the brittleness of their ivory caused by a calcium deficiency in the soil. They break branches and eat the leaves and rip through smaller saplings. Your guide points out the matriarch and you spot a baby elephant following her lead, tearing where she tears, stepping where she steps. In the heat of the afternoon you can make your way back to the lodge or venture out onto the river to enjoy the cool edges of the water and the calm ripple beneath the sky."

You can hear the crackle of earth and a familiar tear of tree bark. Your guide has brought you to another elephant herd, but watching them from a distance while you are on foot is a completely unique and utterly romantic experience. You can see just how big they are. Their ears slowly flap to cool their bodies in the heat. They stomp their feet in elegant, calculated steps. Whether a lone bull or a collection of females and adolescents, the elephants’ presence is breathtaking as they meander away from the tree line and stomp through the knee-high water, splashing along as they turn away from the island."

With another day, you can venture out to witness the grandeur of nature in a variety of ways; your guide will lead the way. It is easy to be mesmerized by the surrounding marshlands, which range from green to gold depending on the season.

A roar flairs into the air, the power is palpable; a lion’s roar can be heard from around three miles away. Looking into the trees you can sometimes find lions looking out over the delta, away from the water and into the tall grass in search of prey. The remarkable display of the lion pride’s fortitude and imagination has these animals resilient within the changing wetlands of the region and displays for you an incredible side of the animal not often seen by visitors. Their golden fur glints in the sunlight as they laze in the afternoon heat letting the trees provide a shady respite. Lions are known to sleep approximately 20 hours per day but are quite opportunistic about their hunting despite this schedule, often letting the situation dictate their actions. In the stunning landscape, surrounded by the wonders of the wild you can only feel a relief and awe at the beauty of the lazing pride."

The island’s concentration of game has made the area renowned, where you can see warthogs scurrying through the bushes, large and hairy, but also skittish around others. Troops of baboons lumber along the tall grass, rambunctious and loud. You are walking through the majesty of the island as your guide points out the illustrious flora and fauna that you may have overlooked in a vehicle. The late morning continues to be cool as you follow your monitor, an expert in the regions biosphere, as he tracks elephants and giraffe within the vibrant brush. As you wander deeper into the island you hear the rustle of the leaves before you see the giraffe, somehow blending its checkered coat into the trees. It is a short enough distance away to see the sleepy eyelids and slow walk; the giraffe is most closely related to the camel. Its neck is long and elegant and you can just make out its long, slender, tongue wrapping around the branches and taking the leaves with it."

        "description": "The calls of the wild filter into your dreams as you listen to the nocturnal sounds of the floodplains, from grazing hippos wandering away from the water, to the hinted jovial calls of the hyena as they scour the night. Breakfast is lavish and ready, giving you another opportunity to enjoy the flavors of Africa within the privacy of your room or along the viewing deck of the restaurant. After your meal you will soar over the delta once more, waving goodbye to the illustrious waterways and coming to Savuti, where the Savuti River flows periodically throughout the year. Settle into your lodge located on the banks of the Stolen River where the channel lays home to a vivacious mixture of elephants and lions. Once within your charming chalet constructed of glass and timber, you will have another spectacular view of the surrounding scenery where zebra often graze along the nutritious grass that stretches along the riverbanks. It feels as though you have stepped into a private world where elegant seclusion is given to you at every turn, bringing the sensations of the landscape for your eyes only as you sip the crisp, chilled flavors of champagne and get comfortable in your new, colorful home."

        "description": "Once again you are charmed awake by the surrounding wildlife that calls through the dawn. More than just hyenas and birds today, you can also hear lions roaring and elephants trumpeting in the space where the early light makes the night recede. After another delightful breakfast you will traverse the Savuti, a region that was once a super-lake that covered northern Botswana. The marshland carries a mystical ambiance, where the land can flood or become arid no matter the local weather, a place where you can see the dried out acacia trees lining the landscape in iconic display. Along the plains you begin to hear what sounds like lively birds chirping; however, you don’t see any trees nearby. You search for flapping wings and silhouettes but find nothing. The grass begins to rustle and the chirping comes closer to the vehicle. It wasn’t birds at all but wild dogs, their jovial barks awkward to those used to the domesticated, deeper sounds of the canines back home. The wild dog is one of the most active and pack-centric animals in Africa, and is endangered with only about 6,000 remaining on the continent. They jump and yip over one another, their ears large and disk-like, giving them sensational hearing. They are known to be some of the most efficient hunters with a keen understanding of their prey, the pack, and when best to run away. A tremendous amount of zebra parade across the plain; they are a captivating display of black and white. The dogs disappear, the dust from the zebra dissipates, and you return to camp with the aromatic scent of your next meal beckoning to you."

The cackles of hyenas lurk through the tall grass before coming to a rest and packs of lions arise in search of a hunting opportunity. After breakfast, you will take another flight over the plains and arrive in Kasane, next door to the famous Chobe National Park. Find yourself at a lodge where the trickle of the infinity pool looks over the wide river in the short distance. If the world were flat you’d swear you would be able to see its corners just by sitting in the cool water of the lodge’s pool. With the largest single concentration of elephants within Africa, numbering around 30,000, you can almost see them marching through the vista that your room offers. In the afternoon, as the days heat begins to calm, you will venture out for your first game drive in Chobe. Along the floodplain you find Cape buffalo, known as one of the deadliest animals in Africa, and make the list of the Big Five: elephants, rhinoceros, lion, leopard, and Cape buffalo. They stand, sometimes in herds, but you can often find bulls on their own, especially along the fertile grasslands beside the water where the animals graze in the soft afternoon light as the sun begins to fade to remarkable reds and oranges."

You can hear the vibrant calls of the day from the zebra huddling along the shore. Climb aboard your open-air vehicle and venture out into the wilderness once again to experience the beauty of Chobe and the sensational wildlife that never ceases to impress. The zebra herds are captivating in their coloration and the way that they groom, always two of them nibbling another’s mane back to back in order to view the surroundings in defense of predators. When attacked or just while running along the plains, their black and white coats swirl into hypnotic colors, confusing the predators and allowing the zebras to escape unharmed. As the heat begins to loom over the landscape you find a lioness sitting within the shade of a distant tree. She twitches her ears and her eyes close and open, the heat making her sleepy, reposing alone in the lush greenery. The majesty of the lions and the wildlife can be seen in the way the lion’s coat continues to shimmer even in the shade, while you can hear warthogs grunting and running in the distance. When the evening stretches over the landscape you find the Milky Way twinkling down and lighting up the night sky."

You relax in the morning sun, rising when your body tells you that it’s okay to wake up to the scent of fabulously fresh brewed coffee and tea. After your refreshing breakfast you will venture over the Zambian border and come to one of the Seven Wonders of the Natural World, Victoria Falls. First seen by European eyes in the 19th century, the falls are around twice the size of Niagara allowing you to see the spouting mist from an incredible distance, almost resembling an erupting volcano. The local tribe once called it “The Smoke that Thunders.” The variety of the trails around the falls gives you ample panoramas of the waterway where the river plummets over the precipice creating a wave of mist to rise over the area. The falls stretch over a width of one and a half miles and the water tumbles to the pools nearly 300 feet below. There are endless rainbows that glisten in the hazy light and can be seen either from the close bridge or beside one of the trails that will take you below. At the mouth of the falls are two pools. The Devil’s Pool is within the swirl of waterfall and is only accessible in the dry season, while the Angel’s Pool sits just before the water tumbles over the cliff, giving you the most opulent view that anyone will ever have. The wonder of the falls is in its natural scale which also lends to its remarkable beauty. Whether you spend the remainder of the day experiencing Livingstone or returning to Chobe to enjoy the luxury of your surroundings, the splendor of the day is hard to match."

        "description": "Wake to a chorus of birdsong and emerge onto the deck to find a flutter of tropical birds. Red wings merge with green beaks and there's always an exotic winged sight around the camp. Grunts alert you to hippos wading across the channel, while echoed shouts suggest elephants are nearby. Relax, take your time, slowly allow your rhythm to slow down to Okavango levels. Nothing is rushed here and a great appeal of the safari is being able to fully disconnect from the rest of the world. A plunge pool overlooks the channel – a great place to watch the hippos – while your private verandah offers a wonderfully tropical panorama. While Xigera is perched on the edge of an island, the vegetation is thick and swampy, providing a hiding place for an assortment of wildlife. Rather than go by land, these two days are all about exploring by boat. Travel in a wooden mokoro (traditional canoe), the guide paddling along the channels that hug the western fringes of the Delta. The Okavango River spills from the west, and it's this area that offers the wildest green colors and most resplendent channels. Paddle slowly, past the hippos that quarrel. Watch them interact, size dictating dominance in the pod. Turn a corner and the huge grasses rescind, revealing an elephant herd bashing their rumps against palm trees. Seeds rain down from the trees and the pachyderms eagerly gobble them in mid-flight. Another turn and a very rare sitatunga fills your vision, grazing elegantly on the banks. With a mokoro safari, you're virtually silent, which helps to get you exceptionally close to wildlife. Motorboat safaris provide a greater range, enabling you to travel towards the most game-rich areas of Moremi Game Reserve in the Delta. It's not quite as charming, but then you turn a corner, and a tower of giraffe are juxtaposed with zebras' stripes. Or a lion pride lurks silently, glimpsed through the flickering of the grass. Xigera doesn't offer high densities of predators, but it provides a genuine water experience and an indelible introduction to this inspiring wilderness. A flexible program of motorboat and mokoro trips are offered, and the camp is a serene base to start taking it all in."

Hippos fighting on the banks, lionesses jumping after red lechwe, a buffalo herd barreling its way across the water, then turning around when it gets too deep. It takes half a day to arrive at your luxury accommodation and what an arrival there is! Three lion prides inhabit the camp's immediate surroundings, along with resident leopards and the prowling of a hyena pack. It's often possible to see the predators from your private tented suite. Raised on stilts above the ground, your luxurious suite provides a confluence of natural immersion and modern opulence. It's at one of Botswana's most exclusive and popular camps, where there are just nine suites offering wonderful views over the floodplain; expect big game sightings from your bed. After lunch at the camp, you head out on a game drive across Chief's Island, getting intimate with the exceptional abundance of predators that lurk nearby. Over these three days, there are multiple opportunities to see some of these breathtaking animals on a hunt."

        "description": "Chief's Island provides drama, the green enclave providing a bounty of food for almost all Africa's large mammals. Ungulates come here in their droves, supporting the myriad of predatory cats. On an early morning game drive, you see them in action. A vervet monkey hangs limply from a leopard's jaws, the spotted hunter taking to the trees for a morning meal. A racket of protest comes from neighboring trees, the rest of the troop voicing disapproval but unable to challenge the leopard. Lions crunch noisily on an impala carcass, tossing bones aside to reveal bloodstained teeth. Looping through the forest, you find nomadic hyenas, on the prowl for the weak and sick. They snarl, then turn, scampering away towards the squawking of a vulture flock. For big game safari, Chief's Island is one of the finest destinations in the whole of Africa. Game drives are the only realistic means of exploring, partly because of the sheer abundance of big cats. Elephants, hippos, giraffe, baboons, big antelopes like hartebeest; every turn seems to bring another giant. Black and white rhino might also be spotted; there's only a handful of these elusive mammals in Botswana, and they inhabit this area, although sightings remain rare. Chief's Island is the game-rich heart of the Okavango, and the island's northern tip is where life is most concentrated. Morning and afternoon game drives take you through the wilderness, with a focus on predatory scenes. During the middle of the day, you can slumber at the camp, watching the inevitable procession of life along the water. Dawn and dusk maximize opportunities to see fabled scenes. A female hyena calls in the last light of day, alerting the scattered pack to the remains of a zebra carcass. Lionesses slowly stalk the fertile plains, tracking a herd of red lechwe that skillfully avoid the predators' clutches. The same female leopard continues to lurk close to camp, hunting on the ground and in the trees. While most of the game drives head into the wider Chief's Island landscape, your camp also has its own small private concession. So encounters with its resident predators are enhanced by their exclusivity."

        "description": "Fly across the Delta in a small plane, casting your eyes on the complexities of the landscape. Lush blue channels sweep out in many directions, encircling lost islets and sandbanks. Forests hang over open floodplains while Chief's Island lingers like a sentinel, always maintaining its position in the Delta's heart. As you fly east, the water becomes less apparent; its tone muted as the Okavango cascades out into the raw Kalahari Desert. But it's still green and abundant, a landscape that holds many secrets and delights. From the airstrip, a short drive brings you to Footsteps Across the Delta, a mobile tented camp that caters for a maximum of nine guests. Unlike the other camps on this itinerary, there isn't a plunge pool or opulent fittings. Instead, the rustic camp provides a comfortable base that is completely enveloped by nature. You become a part of the bush, hidden beneath a woodland awning. And while it's a mobile camp, you still enjoy en-suite flushing toilets, hot showers, and a private bathtub for a tranquil evening beneath the stars. For these two days, the experience is focused on the tranquillity of the camp and thrill of walking safaris, with expert trackers taking you along the trails of the plains game. While lion and hyena occupy this area, local trackers follow the clues, and you step towards inspiring encounters with a great diversity of other life. Emerge from the trees and come face to face with a kudu herd. Stand just ten meters away from a tower of giraffe, then follow the tracker to find tsessebe and red lechwe, unique antelopes of captivating color. Move quietly, footsteps bringing astonishing proximity to large elephant bulls. Each walk lasts around three hours, and you're usually driven to a start point away from the camp, helping you explore a wide area during these two days. Next, you take a longer afternoon walk before two walking safaris. A good level of fitness is not required, just a sense of adventure. It's not a march through the bush. It's a slow journey that completes your connection with nature, focusing on the subtle sights rather than the predatory giants."

Watch elephant roam past from a private plunge pool, lounge on the deck as buffalo herds clash with lion prides, and admire a procession of life through the floor-to-ceiling windows that stretch across three sides of the suite. This is one of Botswana's most exclusive camps, an exceptional and exclusive base to complete the safari experience. Every day is personally tailored. It could be about relaxing and watching the world rumble by. Or it could be all about exploring. Your luxury camp's location enables the complete suite of safari activities; big game walks, motorboat and mokoro safaris through the channels, game drives across the grasslands and woodland, plus the bonus of nighttime drives. It's spooky after dark, the atmosphere enhanced by a layer of mystique. Wildebeest are galloping, and you hear their rumble. The guide flicks on the spotlight, and you spot the chasing cheetah. Impala and kudu graze tentatively and as the light swings around, you see a lion pride draped across the distant grass. Get closer. It is a private concession so you can travel off the trail and get as close as possible to the iconic sights. After the light aircraft flight, these three days enable you to create your own safari itinerary, selecting from the variety of activities. It's all done amongst a habitat that excels in both diversity and abundance. Packs of wild dog hunt on the plains, hyenas make dens close to the camp, elephants and giraffe are found in huge numbers. Pink pelicans and baby crocodiles fill the water while rare antelopes drink from the banks. Think of a dreamy African safari and there's a good chance Vumbura can deliver it, right up to a herd of impala grazing on the grass directly beneath your suite."

        "title": "Nxaragha Island – Tranquility in the Heart of the Delta",
        "description": "The Okavango floodplains provide a soothing sight after your flight to Botswana. Water extends in all directions, rippling away towards pods of hippos and the odd nomadic elephant. Your safari begins from the camp's wooden verandah as glimpses of Africa's giants occupy the view in every direction. Some animals come closer as a zebra skips past as a large herd of lechwe takes a drink. One of the Okavango's great highlights is the opportunity to spot wild game directly from your camp when you least expect it. It may be a giraffe walking past at dinnertime, or hippos emerging from the water as a buffalo herd comes just beneath your verandah. Especially for children, the safari feels like a constant surprise, which keeps them engaged and interested. Your international flight will land in Maun, where you will be met by a representative and transferred to a light aircraft. Throughout the safari, you will hop across the Okavango in small chartered planes which dramatically reduces your travel time. What may be 8 hours away by road and boat, is just a 20-minute flight between remote airstrips. Each aerial journey is part of the safari experience as the Okavango stretches out beneath the wingtips with elephant and giraffe spotted from the plane window. You will enjoy an excellent sense of scale, which serves to enhance the sense of intimacy when you touch down on Nxaragha Island."

        "description": "Meandering channels extend from Nxaragha Island, some lined with thick flourishing reeds with others dominated by large pods of hippos. You will set off in a traditional wooden canoe (known as a mokoro ), with a guide paddling you along the waterways to bring personal encounters. The hippos grunt, barging along the banks with your boat just ten meters away. One yawns and provides an inspiring sight of teeth and jaw. Another is young, a cute baby hippo that brings a chorus of admiration from your family. Like every activity on the safari, this mokoro canoe ride is private and runs to your rhythm. Choose to stay out for hours, exploring the maze of channels, or paddle back to the camp and watch the world unfold from the balcony. The safari program is customizable although there's a caveat at Camp Okavango in that there is no land. Camp Okavango is a purely water-based safari experience, with the mokoro rides complemented by motorboat safari. Heading across the lagoons, you will seek out the hideouts of leopards. At first, the camouflage is complete. Look closer, and there are spots found amongst the jackal berry branches with a predator draped across a tree before descending onto the island floor and coming to the shore. Lions lounge in the shade of palms, a couple of cubs providing the cuteness as a maned male showcases power. Life in the Okavango revolves around the water, and today's flexible boat safari reveals all those coming to drink."

        "description": "Nxaragha Island is the classic Okavango experience as the lagoons and lavish waterways are filled with nomadic herds and wandering giants. The Shinde Concession has a mixed habitat as riverine forest blurs into floodplains and water channels spread out towards both the open grasslands and the thick woodland. A private concession, the Shinde is accessible only to those staying at one of its camps. Within this concession, your family will have your own private piece of the wilderness, a stretch of land and water as wild as your imagination. Exclusivity is the attraction here, and your family will have use of a private six-bedded camp that's deep in the wilderness. Like the other camps on this itinerary, comforts like hot showers, proper toilets, and raised beds are provided, yet the spacious canvas tents do not interrupt your immersion in the wild. After your flight, you will be transferred from airstrip to camp in an open safari vehicle. Throughout the morning, your game drive adventure will offer an acclimatization with the bush as your guide will offer tips on how to spot and track both animals and birds in the wild. From your vehicle's safe vantage point, everyone will start to understand the tracks of elephants, the clues left by predators, and who is who of the antelopes. After lunch and some quiet time back at camp, the afternoon will introduce animal behavior and bushcraft. Skilled guides teach a harmony with the landscape and how to treat the wild with respect. The language of the African bush is everywhere, revealed through sights, sounds, and smells. On a game walk, your whole family will become aware of how the Okavango is talking, leaving little clues which can guide your safe adventure."

        "description": "The young explorers' program isn't just for the children. Rather than simply keeping your kids occupied, the emphasis is on the whole family exploring together. A bespoke program is designed based on your interests and mood to combine both land and water-based activities. An educational experience is at the heart of the program, one that intricately reveals the environment. Soon you will be inspecting spoor, recognizing shouts, following tracks, and leading your own bush adventure. In this private concession, the direction of every walk or drive is decided by you. Follow a jackal's call, track the circling vultures to find a carcass, follow the fresh dung to be surrounded by hundreds of lechwe. Can you follow the trail of a zebra herd that passed by at dawn? By moving slowly and silently, how close can you get to a giraffe? Your morning and afternoon activities are fully interactive, whether it's a bush walk, game drive, mokoro safari, or motorboat cruise. After lunch, the hottest part of the afternoon is a time of rest, and in the quiet, the guides will teach traditional bush survival skills to your children. Your kids will learn how to make fire by rubbing sticks, weave baskets from palm fronds, make bow and arrows from what's available in the bush, and create indigenous tribal jewelry from the natural surroundings. These are all skills developed over the millennia by local people, another aspect of their harmonious coexistence with the landscape. Canoe safaris are an excellent way to learn more about local skills such as how to spot and approach a rare sitatunga that is hiding under the water, where to find fresh and clean drinking water amongst the moss and reeds and how to stay in harmony with testosterone-fueled young hippos. On game drives, you will follow the tracks of the most revered animals. Can you get close to a pack of wild dogs, or uncover a cheetah, or discover why wildebeest and impala appear so skittish? Expert guides are on hand, so you are not alone on your self-guided journey. By practicing these new skills and following the guides' tips, your children can lead your family on a thrilling journey through the bush. Your camp accommodation will continue your immersion in the wilderness. There is no electricity, and all the food is cooked over the fire or in a bush oven. Modern gadgets quickly lose their battery power, and there is nothing manufactured interrupting the experience. At first, it can frustrate the children but spending three days deep in the bush can drastically change attitudes to certain things. Every family that has spent time here reflects on the many ways that Africa has that the rest of the world could learn from."

Moremi Game Reserve is where hyenas cluster and cheetahs emerge from the grass, where impala are chased across the river channels and buffalos clash with lionesses. After three days of the explorers' safari, your final two days are focused on exhilarating game drives and seeking out the most iconic of safari scenes. You will go in search of lions on the prowl with everyone holding their breath as the lionesses isolate a young zebra. You will seek leopards in their realm and watch them come down from the trees and elegantly wander past the vehicle. Rare wild dogs snarl while hyenas cast you curious glances as you journey across the islands. You will enjoy more of a classic big-game safari experience and the chance to watch the scenes unfold as if watching a documentary."

Electricity is available, and the family tents feature a balcony with river views and spacious en-suite bathrooms. This is a child-friendly camp, and the guides are trained to provide tailored activities for the entire family. Spend the day enjoying your families favorite safari activities. You could choose to take another mokoro to go past the herons and stalks as the lechwe look on. You may want to take another game drive to follow the yelp of the baboons to find a cheetah and her cub in the high grass. As always, there are little extras that keep everyone entertained. Perhaps a surprise visit by a zebra herd while you are eating breakfast, using a hide to get a closeup of a tsessebe, following elephant silhouettes across the horizon at sunset, or learning the moves of a tribal dance. It can be as relaxed or as adventurous as you'd like it to be, from a full-day game drive and picnic to a day lounging on the verandah watching the wildlife roll by."

        "description": "Whether it's your first and fiftieth time, there's always something special about flying into Africa. Perhaps it's the raw landscapes that roll beneath the wingtips. Maybe it's the vast space that surrounds the runway. Most likely it's the exquisite sense of touching down on a land untouched and unchanged. There's the immediate feeling that this is a destination unlike any you have seen before. Botswana and the Okavango excel with these first impressions, enhancing them with the raw scent of adventure. Your international flight lands in Maun, where you transfer onto a light aircraft bound for the Shinde Concession. This domestic flight maximizes the impression of nature's untouched bounty; touch down and it's common to find animals like elephants and buffalo within a few meters of the airstrip. The camp you will be staying at there is built into the trees, essentially a handful of tented chalets that feel like luxurious tree houses. It's a traditional camp with a variety of extras, like a swimming pool that's regularly visited by elephants. From a private shaded porch, you can gaze over the Okavango, filling your camera roll with shots of elephants, zebras, and giraffes. Check in, check out these views, then spend the afternoon on a leisurely game drive. It's an easy journey, looping through the concession for close encounters with the big game. As it's the first excursion, the focus is on going slow and starting the connection with nature. You'll return to the camp around sunset, where dinner is served beneath the Okavango stars."

        "description": "The Okavango feels still as morning breaks. Cruising along the waterways in a traditional wooden canoe ( mokoro ) couldn't be more serene. But then there's a strangled cry from the grass. The gondolier takes you closer, revealing a lion pride that's chomping into a breakfast impala. The drama continues up ahead, where rival male hippos are barging across the channel, pushing and grunting to the approval of the pod's females. Then the charm returns as you turn a corner, and a vast floodplain extends, half a dozen different antelope visible in a single vista. By traveling in a mokoro, you go slowly, gliding past the extremities of life in the Okavango, from mammals clashing to those that gently graze. Early afternoon is quiet time at the camp, a chance to relax in the tree house and listen to the elephants that trumpet from the trees. Then a late afternoon game drive continues yesterday's experience, focusing on encounters with the big cats. Move slowly and follow the clues, the faintest flicker in the grass the chance at spotting one of the great hunters. Stop and watch. Another flicker in the green. Move closer. Grass moves but still you don't see. Hornbills suddenly erupt in a chorus of shouts, further evidence that the predator lurks nearby. Their warning cry brings the leopard out, and your patience is rewarded, the clandestine hunter wandering slowly past the vehicle on her way back to the trees."

        "title": "Shinde Concession – Intimate Walking Safaris",
        "description": "A walking safari isn't a race. It's not a charge through the bush. Move slowly, leaving light footprints as you head deeper into the wilderness. Sounds dictate the direction of travel, distant clues indicating what moves where. Clues are everywhere, and the trackers introduce you to their importance. Some are obvious: fresh dung, prints in the sand, felled trees. Others are equally useful; a trail of fruit ripped from trees, branches eaten clean of their foliage, the consistency of each piece of dung. Indigenous tribes have been following these clues for thousands of years, dissecting each piece of the landscape to create a safe journey, and over the next five days, you'll learn to track animals like they do. On this first day, it's easy to be in awe of the local trackers, how they take one glance at the landscape and build an accurate picture of which animals reside where. Over these two days, you enjoy twice-daily game walks. Safari vehicles bring you to and from different parts of the concession, enabling each walk to explore a new part of the Okavango. Wander onto the floodplains and kudu are grazing. Walk slowly, quietly, a few more steps and you're just a few meters from these majestic antelope. Further along, you encounter zebra, a whole herd eying you with intrigue. Now sitatunga, small and beautiful antelope that bounce away. Impala approach you before skipping onwards. You're just another mammal, another piece of the Okavango landscape, a wandering creature in search of bounty. Accompanying the local tracker is an armed ranger, extra security in case anything comes too close. Because it's not just the ungulates that provide the wildlife experience. Trackers bring you towards elephants, and you watch from a safe distance, feeling the awe they impose on the landscape. Giraffes are equally inspiring, graceful sights that lope past barely 15 meters away. Understanding behavior is essential to encounters with the giants. For example, a 100-strong herd of female buffalo and their calves are relatively safe to be around; yet a bachelor herd has a testosterone level that shouldn't be challenged. In contrast, female elephants can be skittish when with their young, yet a giant old elephant bull could be the most tranquil animal you see in five days. All these walks are private and tailored to your energy levels and interests. Each is typically three to four hours, but this could be shorter or longer dependent on the mood. Accommodation is in a small tented camp, with your tent featuring an en-suite bathroom with hot showers and flushing toilet. The camp effortlessly blurs into nature, enhancing the sense of being alone in the heart of the Okavango. In the evenings, you sit on the camping chairs outside the camp, besides the crackling fire, filling your senses with the Delta's charms."

        "title": "Linyanti Concession – Charming Flight Into the Riverine Woodland",
        "description": "This morning starts with a flight across the Okavango, the flooded landscape spilling out to the west as you cruise north. As the Delta extends from the river in the west, it slowly spills onto the savannah and spillways of Linyanti Concession. In good years, the water flows all the way into this concession. In other years, the channels stay dry. This concession also borders Chobe National Park even further to the east, making Linyanti somewhat of a meeting place for mammals moving in both directions. The flight provides an excellent aerial overview of how these ecosystems are slowly blurring into each other. Touch down and a new walking safari starts, another private journey through a wild and untouched piece of Botswana. Sounds and smells guide the way, local trackers continue to teach lessons of bushcraft and animal behavior. More giants are encountered. Hold your breath as an elephant herd passes by, spot a big buffalo herd emerging from the trees, then follow the trail to the water, where dozens of hippos roll in the mud. A couple of them yawn, revealing phenomenal jaws before disappearing back into the water. Then a young hippo calf slowly walks from the channel and by sticking close to the trackers, it's a very safe sight. Your overnight camp is very similar to that in Shinde, comfortable yet elegant accommodation that continues the sense of not interrupting life in the bush."

        "description": "By now you'll be attuned to the clues of the bush. You'll recognize the dung, the indentations in the trees, the animals that are happy for you to approach. On these walking safaris, you'll continue to savor delightful encounters with the ungulates. Approach a zebra herd and read the emotion, two calves jumping at the sound of an approaching baboon troop. Wildebeest come past. They stop and glare, inspecting the unusual mammals (i.e. you). Then they're off, galloping into the distance with their comical antics. Next, you come across red lechwe, beautiful antelopes who regularly run from safari vehicles. By approaching on foot there is little sound, so you can really appreciate their majestic coats. It's not uncommon to even see lions or cheetah in the distance. Obviously, it's important to respect space and veer well clear. But like the antelopes, trackers understand when the predators are hungry, and when they rest with bulging bellies. Exhilarating and exclusive, the Botswanan landscape offers one of Africa's most compelling walking safari opportunities. You're not just tracking the myriad of ungulates. You're coming in contact with the kings of the land and the giants of their habitat. The program is flexible here, with a choice of twice-daily walks or longer full-day walks. In addition, game drives and mokoro safaris can provide a change of pace in the afternoon. Then it's evening, the fire illuminates the night, and the evocative soundtrack comes from the trees."

        "description": "The safari continues, game drives taking you deeper and deeper through an unseen land. Almost half of Botswana is a protected area, endless miles of untamed landscape that are barely accessible by vehicle. It's a bumpy journey when you switch to game drives, the rugged trails meaning travel is almost the same speed as the walking safari, which keeps you tuned in. Elephants surround the vehicle, baby calves fighting playfully as they pass. Hippos emerge from the water, and you watch as their bulky frames graze. Buffalos gallop together, and you follow their rumblings, approaching to find a pride of lions upsetting the herd. Clashes turn violent, and the safari vehicle provides a safe space to watch it all unfold, a lioness going beneath the relentless trampling of hooves. You drive into Chobe National Park where you spend two days at mobile tented camps. These camps move each day, guides picking a safe space to erect the tents and toilets. Each morning they're packed up, and the evidence of human presence is gone. After a predominantly walking itinerary, these two days of game drives will focus on animals that are difficult to intimately encounter on foot. Lion prides are plentiful here, and you find them in an array of modes. Leopards are equally abundant, but you must look closely as their spots are often concealed by the trees. Two animals don't require you to look. Elephants are everywhere, tens of thousands filling Chobe. And it's impossible to find a vista without the neck of a giraffe."

Expanding across the boundaries of Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe, Southern Africa's largest private game reserve is surrounded by unbroken miles of wilderness. The Mashatu is a remote desert and savannah, scorched and dusty throughout most of the year. Waterholes are dotted across the reserve, permanent places of bounty that brings wandering life from across the Kalahari region. Elephants, giraffe, lions, zebra herds, and whatever you are dreaming of, there's a strong probability that it lurks in this reserve. You will land first at O. R. Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg and then transfer onto a small charter flight that will take you into the untouched promise of your African safari. Touch down and the aerial expressions of scale will be replaced by impressions of intimacy. A luxurious camp overlooks the water, and it is here that your safari begins. Lounge on your verandah as a giraffe wanders along the horizon and then dine beneath the stars as elephant silhouettes come in to drink. Wake to the rustling sounds of zebra grazing just a few meters from your room. Effortlessly blending into nature, your luxury lodge regularly see wildlife frequent. It's not that unusual for big cats to be spotted from the sanctuary of your room. After a relaxed lunch, you will enjoy an introductory game drive for a chance to explore your first safari sights and take those first adoring photos of Botswana's great mammals."

When vultures swirl ahead, you are guided into the savannah to discover what's just fallen. The lodge provides an immersive safari program as you mix game drives with walking safaris and adventures on horseback. The focus is on flexibility to give you the chance to try it all and tailor your own itinerary of activities. Skilled bushmen guides take you through the savannah to piece together subtle clues as you are led into a realm of atmospheric sounds and smells. Distant calls ring out, and a jackal may poke up its head before disappearing into the grass. On a horse-riding safari, you will also become part of the landscape, just another animal amongst tens of thousands. Springbok will stop to inspect your mount, rather than running off. Zebra is intrigued, and experienced riders can get close to the black and white herds. When you gallop across the savannah, you will become the center of wildlife attention as the other ungulates are stirred into action.

Rusty reds merge into flowing yellows with the landscape occasionally interrupted by a dried-up river bed or zigzagging canyon. Looking down on the earth below, it is hard to imagine that anything could survive here yet wildlife thrives in this place of seeming desolation. A swathe of bushes and trees surround your camp to draw their water from underground to attract large numbers of springbok and oryx. Zebra and wildebeest herds roam past to pick from the bounty before continuing their nomadic journeys. Such an array of plains game attracts the predators, and the reverberating sound of lion roars are experienced on many evenings here. Your safari lodge remains one of few places to stay in the reserve that covers over 50,000 square kilometers. Such space and scale ensure that the safari experience is predominantly a private one; you could spend a whole day exploring and not see another vehicle. After landing, you can lounge by the pool and watch the ungulates skip across the horizon and then head out on a short afternoon game drive for an introduction to the area around your accomodation.

This is a landscape of clues and following them brings intimate safari encounters. Trace the leopard prints towards an area of bushland and find the cat in his hideout. Drive close to the gemsbok herd and discover an accompanying band of steenbok. Continue to another waterhole and there may be a pride of lions ruling the water, including two with flowing black manes, a distinctive specialty of the Kalahari. Over these two days, your safari itinerary is flexible although it's the full-day game drives that reveal the beauty of what is Africa's largest desert safari destination. Bushman trackers can also lead walking safaris, which are imbued with thrills as various animals are attracted to the camp's waterhole. The desert's lack of water means it can't support the same quantity of animals as the delta. However, the quality of the sightings is exceptional. Rare animals like black-backed jackals are just two meters from the safari vehicle. Lion chase gemsbok beneath the veil of sunrise. Zebra congregates in the hundreds, and there is emotion on every face. For awhile, one glance will suggest that there is little to see in the desert, but two full days reveal that no two angles are ever the same."

        "description": "The Sandibe Reserve shares an unfenced border with Moremi Game Reserve and offers a quintessential Delta experience. Water cascades in many directions, attracting the prolific birdlife along with the abundance of ungulates. You will fly from the Central Kalahari to Maun, and then connect with another light aircraft bound for the Sandibe Reserve. Your first Delta impressions will come from your suite, which is raised above the Santantadibe Channel. White-backed vultures circle above the lodge to indicate a bloodied carcass on the ground. Buffalo and elephant abound, and it is impossible to count all of the herds. Tsessebe and red lechwe skip past to provide new safari sights as you enter the realm of the Okavango Delta. You will enjoy an evening canoe safari (during high water months) which will reveal more of the local residents. During the dryer months, game drives can take you along the permanent channel to discover wildlife as they come to seek water."

        "description": "Gaze one way, and there is an iconic view of the Okavango Delta with its lush floodplains and flowing channels inhabited by large numbers of antelope. In the desert, it is easy to gaze out and see everything within a few miles. But the thick bushes and reeds of the delta make it hard to see beyond a few meters so the antelopes must be fast and nimble to avoid the predators. For where they are water and ungulates, there's often a profusion of predators waiting to pounce. The game viewing also changes in the Delta. In the desert, you followed clues over large areas while in the delta, you will travel slowly on the lookout for the animals as they hide in their haven. Turn a corner, and large lionesses are seen in the reeds with only their faces visible from a few meters away. As you're watching, a flock of spur-winged geese may flicker in your periphery. Refocus, and you will find the leopard as she descends from the tree and then drops into the grass that hides her from a herd of impala. Giraffe rise above the palm trees while elephants rove through thick stretches of mopane woodland, making each of the habitats a new safari photograph."

Just a handful of guests are permitted to enter this reserve so it is rare that you will encounter other vehicles or canoes on your adventures. The wilderness that surrounds your contemporary hotel is exquisite as viewed through the floor-to-ceiling windows. Situated in the north of the Okavango Delta, this reserve offers one of Botswana's most unashamedly luxurious experiences, with the rich local game complemented by a thrilling array of resident game. Sometimes it's even possible to see lions from the wooden verandahs. After eight days of safari, the opulence of your premier lodge is ideal if you're seeking to relax and reenergize. Lie back on the deck as four-legged characters rove across the marshland in front of the lodge. Elephants will pass in large herds as hippos will emerge from the water. You will fly here from Sandibe, and most visitors spend the first day lying back at the camp to watch the Okavango Delta unfold. Head out along the channels in a traditional wooden canoe ( mokoro ) to paddle alongside the large pods of hippos. A handful of males barges around while youngsters roll on the muddy banks, before three yawn in unison to provide the iconic photo. Motorboat safaris can leave from here and head into the nearby Moremi Game Reserve to provide a vivid impression of the Okavango Delta scale. Game drives traverse the muddy trails of the marshes and forest and bring encounters with the resident predators. Stay out after dark to listen to the spooky sounds and discover an unusual collection of nocturnal hunters. If the Okavango Delta is the flagship safari destination of Botswana, then this accommodation is its opulent gem as contemporary luxury meets the thrills of the wild."

Buffalos stand and stare, a lion pride slumbers, and every turn brings a new antelope species. But these aren't isolated sights. They're everywhere, and it's the interaction between wildlife that brings new delight. Kudu can be cute. But it's far more exciting when they're being trailed by three lionesses."

Varnished wood covers the floors and raises the tent above the plains. An en-suite bathroom provides dazzling views of the wildlife and the spacious bedroom has been expertly decorated with an old-world explorer's grandeur. Chairs and a dining table occupy a verandah above the waterhole and your personal butler can deliver cocktails, champagne, snacks, or mugs of fresh Italian coffee. It's the ultimate luxury in the bush, a private haven amidst the wild. Today's walking safari brings new definitions of romantic hand in hand strolls. You're slowly walking on the edges of the forest and there is an elephant. There's another, a big bull male rampaging through with his tusks. Hartebeest and eland are scattered around the surrounding plains and monkeys swing through the trees. This is lion country but a walking safari isn't just for spotting predators. Your skilled guide picks a route that circumnavigates the cats and brings intimate encounters with the vivid delights of the Okavango. Return to camp and the hippos are putting on an afternoon show. Snouts rise from the water, chubby legs maraud into the shallows, and three males seem to be chasing a frisky female. They grunt, shout, charge, and throw their great hulks of flesh around.

They surround the camp, wade through the rivers, jostle at waterholes, and blend into the landscape as if they're moving trees. You take photos of the first 100. But they keep coming; babies almost tripping over their trunks, giant herds of tusks, boisterous bums uprooting trees, and silhouettes dancing along the horizon.

That means that when a leopard is spotted stalking a springbok herd, there isn't going to be a dozen other safari trucks spoiling the moment. And there won't be anything on two legs interrupting your view of the waterhole. It would be easy to spend all day here, admiring the plethora of life taking a drink just meters from your hut. Wave hello to your four legged neighbors then, when you're ready, a guide waits to take you on evocative game drives. Giraffe feed on the fringes of the forest, bushy buffalo herds slumber and grunt, kudu and hartebeest stand proud, while the smaller antelopes tentatively feed on blossoming grasslands. It goes without saying that elephants are literally everywhere. Even the tempestuous lions don't put them off. You spot a pride prowling, exploring the edges of the trees in search of a meal, their resonant eyes lingering long in the memory. View this landscape from a new angle this evening. A luxury private cruise takes you along the Chobe River; dinner for two is served as the sun begins its journey into ruby and flaming red. Hundreds of hippos cover the shore, sharing the water with elephants firing water jets. Honeymoons should always feature memorable meals. There are few more eternal sights than tucking into five courses with the sights of wild Africa sailing past."

A traditional wooden mokoro canoe is waiting to transport you down Chobe's narrow river channels, a dexterous oarsman keeping you clear of the wading hippos. Chobe looks different from the water. Everything must come down to the river to drink and this predictability can bring drama. The ungulates can hide for most of the day. But eventually they'll get thirsty. Predators lie in wait; Nile crocodiles, stealthy leopards, and exuberant lionesses who can clear three miles of river with two imprecise steps. After a morning mokoro safari the rest of the day is free. Either enjoy an afternoon game drive or soak up the charming tranquility from the lodge."

A deep rumbling hangs over the landscape, much like the sound of crashing waves dominating an exposed cliff. Locals call Victoria Falls the “smoke that thunders,” a linguistic ode to the mist that rises from the abyss and fills the Zambezi canyon. During some months the falls are only visible from certain spots because the “smoke” is too intense. For the finest angle you must travel by helicopter. Your pilot swoops low, offering indelible panoramas of the Zambezi River as it tumbles over the edge. The Victoria Falls are over a mile wide and cascade over 100 meters, thundering into a narrow gorge consumed by mist and water. Isolated cataracts and rocks stand in the canyon and river, adding further contrast to the aerials. The pilot hovers and lingers. Spend some time snapping the perfect honeymoon photos. Then put the camera down and enjoy the moment. Few experiences can offer such rich visual splendor."

A series of walkways and platforms take you to the bar area and the sunset dinners are a particular highlight here. This charming setting is your home for all three nights in Zambia.

Kruger National Park is one of Africa's oldest and largest, covering an area bigger than some US states. Ungulates gouge on the ever-flourishing grass and abundance of permanent water. And anywhere there is prey there is always a healthy collection of predators. Most safari destinations have lions and leopards. You just need to be lucky enough to see them. There's no need for good fortune in Kruger. The big cats are all around you. Kudu graze, giraffe tower above the trees, springbok appear with every turn, and beautiful game drives add further magic to the honeymoon bliss. Like elsewhere, you have a private guide and vehicle to explore the landscape. Elephants won't be a new sight, but you have to stop and smile when a baby swings his trunk and scares the warthogs away from a waterhole. While the individual sightings are always impressive, this dream safari honeymoon will begin to leave more complete impressions of beauty. Safari for three days and you'll see wild animals. But explore three diverse national parks and you begin to appreciate the whole. Kruger, just like Chobe and Okavango, is a complex ecosystem unaltered for thousands of years.

There are two seats together in the back and a passenger seat in the cockpit. You're the only two passengers so sit wherever you want. Scale and detail leave lingering impressions as you ascend above Botswana, the pilot cruising low over vast tracts of forest, desert, and waterways. You're high enough to revel in the vastness of the wilderness, yet close enough to pick out individual details. Elephant herds clump together, migrating antelopes dot the singed plains, and individual giraffe are easily spotted beside the river. Touch down in Chobe National Park and witness these scenes in close-up detail. A local safari guide takes you on a game drive through the forests, each turn revealing another elephant herd or giraffe tower. Local estimates for the elephant population vary between 60,000 and 120,000. Either way, it's easily the largest collection of wild elephants on the planet. Their calls resonate through the trees, their trunks spray water at waterholes, and the four-ton pachyderms virtually surround your camp. Tonight's accommodation is a taste of what's to come. Nature's soundtrack runs on through the night, a crackling fire keeps the big cats at a safe distance, and glorious panoramas extend from your king sized bed.

Trade out the wings for a traditional mokoro boat and tour the blue channels, a skilled gondolier bringing you remarkably close encounters to large pods of hippos. Today's camp is situated on Chief's Island, a remote haven inaccessible by land for most of the year. A private veranda is perched above the river. So sit back and watch the conveyor belt of thirsty mammals coming to drink. Some wait patiently, the smaller antelopes only approaching when all is clear.

Masts peer out above the dunes, whole wooden ships stand stranded in the red, and the Atlantic Ocean shimmers blue just to your right. Today's is the longest of all your flights and there will be a couple of stops en route before you camp beside the renowned dunes of Sossusvlei."

        "description": "Sossusvlei is hypnotic at sunrise, the layers of dunes slowly illuminated until they burn like orange flames beneath the sky. An early start provides staggering views; little but sand dunes and dazzling ocean fill your endless panoramas. Wide clay pans break the ridges, but then you settle back into row after row of snaking lines that rise and fall across the desert. Follow a ridge. It weaves and dips, rises and curls, eventually spitting out in the ocean. These vistas continue for almost two hours, the desert unveiled for just the two of you in the back of the Cessna. Today's destination is equally mesmeric. Everyone knows the Grand Canyon as the world's largest but did you know that Namibia's Fish River Canyon comes second on the list? A dramatic scar opens up the landscape, cutting rugged lines down to a parched riverbed and dominating the landscape for over 50 miles. You spot it from a distance and then the pilot skillfully cruises down and hovers just above the canyon. Helicopter rides in Nevada's Grand Canyon are idolized and popular, but there will be few other couples in the world that have flown above and through Fish River Canyon. Tonight's camp is situated near the canyon in a clearing of classic African bushland."

The driver cuts the engine, and you listen for clues, hoping to hear the rustling of the spotted hunter in the grass. But there’s nothing. The antelopes continue to graze, and you must wait for the leopard to reveal herself. Minutes tick by. Five. Ten. More. Then she suddenly pounces, the antelope shrieking in shock and then resigning itself to fate. Clamping powerful jaws around the neck of her prey, she kills with a swiftness that contrasts the wait. Then she’s off, dragging the carcass through the grass, past the safari vehicle then up a tree. Scenes like this are what make an African safari such a mind-boggling experience. They’re not encountered every day. But spend 11 days in Botswana, staying in the big-game concessions, and scenes like this are exclusive sights not witnessed by any other guests. At other times during the game drive, you move much quicker, passing thousands of animals as you loop around the concession; whenever something interesting is found, the driver takes you off the trail, so you have the best vantage point. There’s also an exclusive option for a nighttime game drive here. Moving very slowly while using a high-powered spotlight, you’re able to discover a world that only exists after dark. Rare mammals emerge, and there’s a wonderful tension that drifts through the air. Suddenly you’re surrounded, the vehicle standing on the floodplains as hundreds of animals graze nearby. And like always, exercise a little patience and something dramatic is only a few moments away."

Get picked up from the airstrip in a motorboat then follow the romantic waterways to your water camp, where your tented suite is complete with a private plunge pool, sunken bath, private butler, and a four-poster bed that’s larger than most hotel rooms. By now, you’ll have discovered that a tented camp can’t be compared with any traditional notions of camping. It’s indelibly tranquil here, and you’ll notice that there are fewer big mammals. There is less land, which means less food and a challenging journey across the water. But while the lions struggle, a number of Okavango specialists thrive. Thousands of lechwes are scattered across the shallows. Sitatungas almost disappear, leaving just their heads above the waterline. Roan antelopes impress with their strange black and white faces, while tsessebes move at a staggering speed.

As the Okavango floods, it will create isolated strips of lands and hidden paradises where animals either find bliss or find themselves marooned. A gondolier will paddle you past forests dominated by elephant trunks, onwards to grasslands where gazelle ears are alerted to a moving cheetah, and then beneath trees where monkeys swing. As you travel slowly and silently, it is as if you are in a movie backdrop as the wildlife world gracefully continues without interruption. A kudu herd drinks along the shore and then gallops off as a boisterous male hippo charges towards the river. Giraffe watches carefully as the gondolier passes, and a hyena may eye you with an air of suspicion. Mokoro safaris are the highlight of the Okavango, and your itinerary will allow for as many as you would like. Game drives can take you in further as the Vumbura Reserve spills into the Moremi Game Reserve with a patchwork of habitats in close proximity. Water brings life, and the Okavango offers a suite of landscapes with each a haven for a new collection of characters. In the woodland, you may see something move and then see the clear eyes as the leopard watches you intently while you have been searching for her. Move slightly, and her grace is fully revealed as the shimmering fur of her young comes into view. Predators are a real specialty of Vumbura, and the safari itinerary is often centered around intimate encounters with a focus on the dusk and dawn activities that maximize the chance of spotting them in hunting mode.

But it has been revamped recently and transformed into a private reserve that celebrates the authenticity of nature. There is something very beautiful about how the landscape has responded as an ancient riverbed long dormant through the reserve has started to flow with permanent water for the first time in many decades. Life flourishes as the migrant herds are feasting to allow larger groups of zebra, gazelle, elephants, buffalo and giraffe to expand. Young predators are thriving as they mark out territory as they prosper to form new pride. The long-distance ramblers are staying as hyenas and vultures pick up the leftovers from nature's new bounty. The Selinda is a landscape that few people know about, and even fewer have explored as a private concession that offers an exclusive look akin to going behind the scenes. Elephants are everywhere. The Selinda is part of a wider ecosystem where some 100,000 pachyderms roam. Giraffe is similarly plentiful, clustered in small towers and raising their colors above the green. On a walking safari, you may cross a herd of buffalo, 40-strong, which graze slowly as they explore a floodplain. River safaris wind past large hippo pods with disagreements settled by barging contests in the water. Back at the camp, trunks squirt water and hooves kick up spray as you gaze over the river. Vumbura often reflects the brutality of nature's rhythm and competition, but at Selinda, it feels as if all the animals are part of a celebration."

        "description": "Your camp is small and understated to blend into its environment as it celebrates sustainability and ecological living. Like always, the safari program is fully flexible with privately guided activities to take you through the reserve and the adjacent Chobe National Park. Walking safaris and horseback rides cross the plains, game drives reveal thousands upon thousands of elephants, while mokoro trips blend exotic birdlife with the indelible characters of the water. Safari is always unpredictable, and that fact is elevated here with a developing landscape that is full of surprise and treats for those who take their time. Move slowly, embrace it all, and complement the activities with an authentic wild bush experience at the camp. Nighttime drives are a particular specialty as two new predators have appeared in Selinda. Wild dogs now move in packs with over a dozen that rove together, and they communicate with intelligence that cannot be understood at first glance. Over your safari days on this itinerary, there is a strong probability that you will have seen a hunting scene with a dramatic explosion of power as jaws lock onto necks. These wild dogs hunt differently by exhausting their prey as they chase them far across the landscape. At nighttime, you may hear the yelps and follow the theater as the drama begin. Tiny aardwolves also appear to scuttle around in the moonlight as a spotlight guides your journey. Return to your camp after a nighttime drive, and the experience continues like it has every night in Botswana. An echoed soundtrack will flicker through the darkness as silhouettes grace the horizon, and there is no interruption to your sense of escapism."

        "description": "Here comes one, marching with pride through the woodlands of Kwando, and then another with tusks so long that they start to curl skyward. A third will enter from your periphery, and there may be a tense standoff as it is not three elephants, but three elephant herds as the size of the patriarchs dictate who should give way, even if it's the matriarchs that have selected the route. North of Selinda, Kwando Reserve stretches into the woodland of Chobe National Park and is part of the landscape shared by Africa's largest collection of elephants. On a game drive through the forest, you will not see other vehicles or tourists, but you could easily encounter over a thousand elephants. Kwando's woodland provides a new safari experience and is the focus for your first day on the reserve. Just two camps are found in this 2,300 square kilometer reserve, and both excel in providing a safari under canvas experience so you will have the necessary contemporary comforts and continue within the luxury band. A great procession of wildlife roams past the camp at all times of the day and night to bring with it a succession of evocative calls and a strong sense of being surrounded by the best of Botswana's wildlife. Like always, the safari program is flexible and private."

        "description": "Diverse habitats provide different safari encounters in Kwando. Two male giraffes collide in the riverine forest and swing their necks to determine dominance. Wild dogs rove across the open grasslands as a pack on the move. Tsessebe gallops from the pack's clutches, Africa's fastest antelope disappearing in a cloud of dust. A cheetah could chase them, but it doesn't, preferring to rest in the grass as you drive past in the safari vehicle. Game drives connect the habitats here, and a single drive can encounter over 20 different species from the array of monkeys in the woodland to the small antelopes feasting on the open grassland. Walking safaris are also possible and daily nighttime game drives are usually a fixture on the itinerary. Like always, the action is defined by water but this time, it is the Kwando River, where thick riverine forest provides an excellent place for a predatory ambush. Sometimes the experience is about parking the vehicle to gaze out and wait for the drama to unfold at the water. At other times, you will be on the move and follow the tracks to enjoy one of Botswana's greatest concentrations of predators. Then again, safari here may be about lounging outside of your tented suite to watch the wilderness unfold without another person or vehicle to interrupt your view. Instead, it will feel like Africa's epic landscapes have become your own personal adventure playgrounds."

        "description": "Beneath the canopy, you will go to follow sandy trails as you bump into the woodland. An elephant will block the trail, the large tusks forcing you to stop. Soon the rest of the herd will emerge as nearly 30 of them will slowly amble past, including two babies that swing their trunk with near comical curiosity. Inch a little further, and the scene will repeat itself with a big male hooting as the rest of the herd bulldozes their way through the trees. Giraffe is seen equally regularly with their heads above the high branches. As the sandy trail reaches the river, you will get your first glimpse of hippos, along with a buffalo herd chewing and chomping their way across the high grasses. Within an hour or so, some of the animals become so commonplace that you will not even point them out: elephants, giraffe, buffalo, zebra, lechwe, impala. As you continue, much more will continue to surprise, like tsessebe that skips out from the trees or a troop of baboons creating a riot of noise. After touching down in Maun, you will transfer to a chartered light aircraft and a flight over the Okavango. Beneath the wingtips, the landscapes will transform from desert to delta, and then to the thick awning of the Chobe woodland. Touch down, and you will already be deep in the wilderness. The game drive will take you further in to bring these inspiring first safari impressions as you travel to your lodge, nestled on the Chobe River. Resident buffalo and lion pride create dramatic scenes close to the lodge, while any number of animals could come down to the river for a drink. Over these first two days, you will combine game drives with cruises along the Chobe River. The latter will take you past hundreds of hippos, an even more evocative sight when you cruise at sunset, and they are seen emerging from the water. You will be staying in one of Botswana's original luxury lodges, a place of opulence that blends seamlessly with the natural environment. Accommodation later on the safari will be a bit more rustic, particularly in revealing how the wildlife roams freely amongst the camps. As a starting point, this lodge eases you into the wilds of Africa, with the salubrious fittings helping to soothe any aches from travel."

        "title": "Savute Channel – Mysterious Safari Landscape",
        "description": "Chobe National Park stretches south from the Chobe River, a vast stretch of woodland that's home to Africa's largest collection of elephants. Some conservationists believe there are 100,000 elephants found within the ecosystem and the evidence is everywhere. Great paths are cleared as the pachyderms barge and bump against trees, and large clumps of dung dot the river banks as echoed hoots dominate the evening lullaby. In the southwest corner of the Chobe is the Savute Channel, a permanent water source where the elephants are always meeting. It will feel as though you are deeper in the wilderness as the canopy closes in and the mystical sounds are constant throughout the day. Savute can sometimes be accessed by the four-wheel drive trails, although even these become impassable at points during the year and it's a full day of travel from the north of the national park. Instead, you will take the direct route, a 20-minute flight between remote airstrips, a sublime journey as you look down at the roaming elephant herds. Bachelor elephant herds meet in the waters beneath your accommodation, and the concentration of testosterone brings some haunting evening scenes. The river blurs into a marsh that cascades out onto fertile plains. Antelope are seen in much larger numbers, along with zebra and wildebeest that enjoy such fresh pastures. While the low grass is ideal for grazing, the high grass is inviting for predators. So when the grazers come to drink in the river, there are scenes of raw drama. Sometimes the clashes involve lions and buffalos, other times it's a leopard tearing apart an impala. Your game drives will focus on the predators, seeking to find them in hunting mode. However, like everywhere on this safari, the experience is not about seeing the animals as much as it is about surrounding yourself with the rhythms of pristine wilderness."

        "description": "Touch down after your next charter flight and the visuals will have changed. Your views extend for miles as the lush floodplains spill beyond the horizon. Palm islands rise sporadically as silhouetted elephant and giraffe grace the landscape, and in a single glance, you can spot half a dozen different antelope. You will be marooned on Nxaragha Island, surrounded by a year-round water wilderness, engrossed in the grunting hippos and skipping antelope. Tsessebe are on the move, grazing and jumping almost in the same movement as sitatunga hide beneath the water, just nostrils poking out from the lagoon as wildebeest gallop comically, the males rutting in shows of virility. There is almost no land here, just a few rising palms and the sandy banks of the island. Effortlessly blending into these lush surroundings is your safari camp, with tented suites rising on wooden platforms above the delta. Canvas walls ensure the sounds of the wilderness continue at all times, yet this is no traditional camping experience. Stand up in the spacious tents, sleep on beds raised on wooden platforms, and enjoy an en-suite bathroom with hot showers and flushing toilets. You will enjoy the complete immersion in the Okavango while still keeping necessary creature comforts. Safari is by water as the camp presents a quintessential Okavango experience. Travel in narrow wooden canoes ( mokoros ) with a local guide to paddling you down the channels lined by reeds and furtive antelopes. Hundreds of bird species grace the banks and the proximity to the hippo pods is unfathomable. Motorboat safaris allow you to explore large lagoons and hidden islands as zebra are aroused from slumber and monkeys yelp from the trees. Shinde is a private concession, and only guests staying in the concession can explore it so other visitors will not ruin your safari photos and animals are not surrounded by boats. Shinde and the fly-in style illustrate how Botswana is an unashamedly high-end safari destination as the country prefers to offer quality experiences to a few rather than attract large numbers of tourists."

        "description": "On safari in the Okavango, your flights are a major part of the safari experience as they give you a chance to appreciate the phenomenal scale of Botswana. Landscapes collide on these flights with the delta's rainbow of blues spilling out in the distance. Palm islands stand isolated while the patterns of migratory elephants can be understood. Giraffe and buffalo are also visible from the air, along with a mazy stretch of channels. These are short flights, but there is no other way as 20 minutes in the air bring you from one island to the next. You will land in the Xakanaxa area, a sanctuary of contrasting habitats in the heart of the delta. Open grasslands spill into riverine woodland and stretches of mopane forest. Such diversity makes it a welcoming place, and the surrounding area is home to both migratory herds and permanent four-legged residents. Now your Okavango Safari will continue on land and water as the mokoro and motorboat trips are combined with game drives, exquisite journeys across the trails of the islands. Buffalo march in the hundreds as giraffe lope in front of the vehicle, and high in the trees, you will find a leopard hiding out. As it is each day, your safari program is customizable, and you can create a personal program using the recommendation of the guides and trackers. Adding another exclusive angle is a walking safari, a chance to step across the fertile open plains and come side by side with zebra and lechwe herds. Move slowly and silently, keeping your distance until you can move closer as the animals realize you're not a threat. Shaded beneath ebony trees is your next camp, a haven of luxury that overlooks the lagoon. Natural wooden features give the impression that the camp is a seamless part of the landscape, although it hides some salubrious extras, including a swimming pool and elevated sundeck. New animals join the collection of sights, like packs of endangered wild dog and both spotted and brown hyenas seen together. Moremi Game Reserve is the big-game heart of the delta, and these two days of safari are all about the continual mammal sightings."

        "description": "Chobe and Okavango are places of abundance. There is plenty to eat and drink, which helps to maintain its large populations of animals. A scorched desert like the Makgadikgadi could not attract such numbers, but the safari encounters are equally enchanting. Everything must come to drink, so by staying close to water, you are continually admiring the animals. And in a place of scarcity, there is always tension. Springbok must approach the river even though they know lions are hiding nearby. Zebra always drinks on high alert, and every sound will startle them. A cheetah will snatch unsuccessfully at prey as hunger will cause the cat to accelerate too early. The Boteti River is often the only water to be found in the Makgadikgadi, so wildlife rarely strays more than half a day's travel from it. Zebra and other migratory herds congregate here, seeing out the dry season before the rains return. Resident lions and leopards must take advantage and fatten up. Your residence is an opulent camp that brings safari straight to your verandah. At the end of a fly-in safari adventure, this camp enables you to sit back and watch the drama unfold. Daytime and nighttime game drives wind along the river, while a boat safari can continue to unravel the theater of the desert. It is also possible to make excursions into the enormity of the Makgadikgadi Salt Pans, where you will not find wildlife, but you will be baffled by the landscape. As another option, visit Khumaga Village and gain an understanding of local life in the desert."

It has since evaporated into a series of mystical salt pans. Everywhere you look is white, the crusted salt topped by a shimmering mirage that blurs along the horizon. Baobabs punctuate the pans, as do nomadic elephants and colonies of meerkats. It’s as surreal a setting as any, and that’s before you spot the wildlife that comes to drink from the four waterholes outside your camp. You land in Maun and transfer onto a short local flight to Makgadikgadi, then onwards across the salt to your safari camp. It’s an escapist destination, where the silence penetrates and traditional lanterns illuminate the walkways. Evoking an old-world safari atmosphere, the camp has all the necessary comforts, including a beautiful deck overlooking the waterholes. Brown hyenas howl at night; aardwolves drink surreptitiously, and the water attracts an evocative collection of four-legged nomads.

In the light aircraft, you have supreme views, especially of the Kalahari Desert giving way to the relentless flooding of the Okavango River, dusty yellow replaced by strips of lush green and blue. Once you touch down, the Delta is as mystical and mysterious as the preconceptions. A leopard descends from a tree and disappears into the grass; buffalos clash horns on a floodplain; antelope hooves splash up flumes of water. The scale is replaced by the detail, and it’s hard to go a few moments without seeing another four-legged giant. Chief’s Island in Moremi Game Reserve is widely considered to have the densest concentration of wildlife in the Okavango. Chitabe Concession shares an unfenced border with Moremi on three sides and wildlife moves freely. But it’s exclusive to guests staying at one of the two camps, so the game drives come with an added exclusivity. Discover lion prides that battle with buffalo, follow hundreds of lechwes as they escape the clutches of a cheetah, and come to love the antics of wild hippo pods. Perched on an elevated island, Chitabe Lediba Camp is the perfect base for watching the show, with so much wildlife roaming straight past your tented chalet; the day’s flexible game drives provide a chance to get spine-tinglingly close to dreamy safari scenes."

Chitabe is a great place to see the big cats on the hunt, and by going off the trail, you might see jaws snapping through fur, or scavengers seeking to steal a kill. Like all your days in the Okavango and Chobe, the daily program has a high degree of flexibility.

Jao Concession provides a wonderfully diverse safari experience, incorporating the big game of Hunda Island with the permanent waters of the Delta. After the short flight west, you have the time to relax in your camouflaged treehouse. Spend the rest of the day creating a personal program of game drives and mokoro canoe safaris. From June to September, the plains are flooded, a watery expanse that glistens beneath the desert sun.

It’s not even the baby elephants that swing their trunks wildly when walking past. What’s most special is the intimacy of the experience. The elephants recognize your presence, and it’s as if they’re welcoming you in their own unique way. Sometimes they pass just ten meters from the camp, wandering by without a care in the world. And it’s not just one. It’s hundreds, thousands; the world’s largest elephant population inhabiting the forest where you are camping. While it sounds a little dangerous, mobile tented camps are very safe. Remembering the lessons from the San Bushmen, you’ll notice how traditional techniques are being used to keep the elephants from trampling the camp. Hidden amongst the trees, the tented camp moves every few days, giving every visitor a new wildlife experience. It’s surprising how much luxury there is, with spacious stand-up tents that feature an en-suite bathroom with hot water and a Western-style toilet. You’ll dine under the stars, spend the evenings around a roaring campfire, and enjoy one of Botswana’s most exhilarating safaris under canvas. Nature sings a lullaby, animals wander through the camp, and there’s never any interruption to the magic of the wilderness. After the flight from the Okavango, you’ll spend three nights under canvas in the Savute area of Chobe National Park. This woodland landscape is home to so many elephants and giraffes that you’ll stop counting after the first ten minutes (conservationists estimate the elephant population to be upwards of 100,000). Wild dogs move in packs while leopards lurk on the highest tree branches. Buffalo herds graze beside thousands of impala, joined by zebra, wildebeest, and a stunning cast of other antelopes. There are also plenty of lions, although the predators are a little harder to spot than in the Okavango, due to the density of the trees. During these three days, you combine game drives in the Savute area with the option of Chobe River cruises. It takes you to the heart of Botswana’s natural experience, with the activities exploring the scale of the park and the camp immersing you in its intimacy."

You enter Zambia and follow another famous river, the gushing waters of the Zambezi far faster than those of the Chobe. The river broadens, growling menacingly and then disappearing with an almighty roar. You’ve reached Victoria Falls, and the first impressions are always of the sound, of the stunning rumble created by the world’s most powerful waterhole. The Cascades can be higher and wider, but none are able to send as much water over the edge. To view the falls, you pass troops of baboons, taking a trail that leads across Knife-Edge Bridge to cataracts in the lower Zambezi. From here, the spectacle is intense, some 1,000 tons of water tumbling down into a narrow canyon, and then rising back up as clouds of spray every second. From April to July, it’s almost impossible to avoid being soaked by the spray, which is an indelible part of the Victoria Falls experience.

        "description": "Maun is the gateway town for a Botswana safari. The other is Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe. You will land here and quickly board another flight, which will be a light aircraft that can access the Okavango Delta islands. From the air, you can appreciate the scale of this great oasis, and how the channels and lagoons twist around palm-fringed islands and waterbuck-covered banks. The best water levels are usually around May. The rain falls in Angola from November to January, taking four months to meander into the Kalahari Desert. Water always brings life in the desert. Such an incredible bounty of water attracts life from over 1,000 kilometers away. An Okavango Delta safari is about the water and the land. Your first camp will be located on a small island that is accessed by speed boat from the larger island, which is where you landed. Here, you will be surrounded by water where you can gaze out across a landscape of azure blue and green. Hippos will wade close to the lodge, and elephants will splash past or use their trunks as snorkels. You will be cut off from the modern world, and it will be immensely peaceful to look out at wildlife from a private deck. This wetland part of the delta will be as perfect as your first stop in Botswana, and it will help you recover from your flight and settle into the animal kingdom."

        "description": "The Okavango Delta floods westwards and northwards, so it is the west and northwest where you experience a water-based safari. Towards the east and south more of your experience will be on land; however, this morning, you will explore in a traditional wooden canoe that is known as a mokoro. A gondolier will propel you down narrow waterways, accessing seasonal channels that very few people ever get to see. It will be a slow and silent exploration, so you do not frighten any of the wildlife. In your mokoro, you will drift past pods of hippos and gaze at everything that drinks from the banks. You will have the opportunity to see many animals like the spectacular antelope, Beisa Oryx, or a herd of buffalo or elephant. If you are really fortunate, then you may witness a pride of lions. In the afternoon, you will try a motorboat safari, which is the substitute for a game drive on land without roads. On a motorboat, you can be noisy, so it is not possible to get quite as close to the banks. Still, wildlife will not be scared off as it would be from a vehicle. It will remain at the riverbank to drink, so you will literally be looking up at elephant trunks. Motorboats allow you to cross a relatively large area, so you can get a good feel for the size of the Delta, notably the many islands and secrets that it hides. Trackers and other guides will radio wildlife locations to you, helping you cruise through the bounty of this oasis."

        "description": "You will travel by motorboat across the Okavango, which is a safari transfer to Chief’s Island and Moremi Game Reserve. This is the heart of the Delta, and it supports a staggering abundance of life all year around. Your camp will be perched on the waterfront, providing a dreamy view of hippos and wandering wildlife. Behind the camp will lie a lush island interior, which is made up of open floodplains, inaccessible marshes, and thick woodland. This is what you will explore on a game drive. Crossing the plains, you will be able to see the antelope graze as the Okavango home to a superb variety of species, including some that you may struggle to see elsewhere like red lechwe, nyala, and sitatunga. These water-adapted animals escape to water to evade predators, yet they must graze as well. Surrounding the marshes is a savanna, which is a perfect place for predators to hide. Lions lounge here in the shade of giant trees and leopards will appear on branches, lazing away hours with their alert eyes. On this island, these predators can survive in small territories. Game drivers search for these predators, and you can often get exceptionally close. Sometimes, you will even be able to witness them prowling or chomping into a fresh carcass. On game walks, you cannot go in search of such dangerous animals. Instead, trackers will lead you across the open plains and through areas that are favored by grazing antelopes. It will be exhilarating on foot as red lechwe look up to watch you pass where buffalo and zebra roam just meters away. These land-based activities can also be complemented by mokoro and motorboat rides with the daily program often being dictated by what is going on in the local area. For example, a tracker may radio in the sighting of a fresh carcass on a riverbank, so you will start the day in a boat, or you may track a pack of hyena in a game drive after the guide learns that they are hunting an injured sitatunga."

Trees will appear along muddy channels, which is suggestive of how this landscape will soon morph into thick woodland. Nestled between the Okavango and Chobe are some of Africa’s ultimate safari destinations, which are exclusive, private concessions on natural migratory routes. Only a handful of guests can visit Selinda Game Reserve at any one time, and these patrons must be staying at a camp on the reserve. It means this safari is very private and uninterrupted by other vehicles or people. Such few visitors traverse this landscape, keeping it quiet and more attractive to wildlife. Now in Selinda, your exploration is restricted to land. Game drives will make up most of the day, and game walks are often possible but depend on whether dangerous animals are near the camp. Added to these, you will also enjoy nighttime game drives. It can be spooky and surreal after dark with only a spotlight to illuminate the animals. You will stop regularly, and the driver will stop the engine so you can listen to the land and animals. Huffing and puffing can be heard as an elephant blows his trumpet-like trunk. Then, the light turns on, and everything is much closer than you could have ever pictured."

Selinda is also home to a large population of wild dogs, which are remarkable animals that den in the woodland and chase their quarry over great distances. By now, you will know that animals are not seen in isolation. It is not just a wild dog, but a landscape that is populated by predator and prey. You will not only encounter lions, but you will also appreciate how these other animals graze so tentatively in their presence. Most of the drives will take place around the Selinda Spillway, which is a waterway that attracts large congregations of life. Ungulates drink in the safety of numbers, but almost every evening something dramatic will occur along the spillway."

        "description": "You will continue your journey north, this time traveling on a muddy trail. After six days on your safari, you will have grown used to seeing hippos and elephants. In Chobe, their abundance will be magnified. It is not a huge stretch of the imagination to think of two elephants or even two elephant herds, but try to imagine hundreds and even thousands of elephants. Almost every turn you make, there will be another pachyderm. Babies will run past, swinging their trunks, and lone bulls will crash new paths through the trees. Giraffes are also seen in large numbers in addition to hippos. Nowhere in the world has as many elephants as Chobe, and from June to September, it is estimated that over 100,000 of them are in the park at one time. Such thick woodland makes it more challenging to spot predators and some of the smaller animals. The experience in Chobe will be all about the giants. They will sound like an orchestra after dark with different horn and trumpet sounds that originate from their trunks. Your camp will be thrillingly deep within the woodland, and its location will rotate every few days, helping you stay far enough away from the giants. After the waterways and plains, you will also enjoy a different safari atmosphere. Woodlands are mystical and secretive, so you must explore with your nose and ears. Often, you can get extremely close as wildlife does not usually see you coming. However, sometimes you must retreat because this is elephant country, and the four-legged giants rule the trails."

Your lodge will be located along the Zambezi River, which is close enough to hear the thunderous rumble of the falls. Check-in and the afternoon will be at your leisure with complimentary transfers to the falls available should you wish. Most of Victoria Falls is on the Zimbabwean side, and you will get soaked by the spray of the waterfall, which is visible almost every month of the year.

        "description": "Spilling out across the Kalahari, the Okavango Delta is an oasis of life in the desert, attracting nomadic animals from thousands of miles around. Great floodplains ripple with life, from bathing hippos to elephants splashing around and zebra herds prancing through the shallows. The scale can be unfathomable. And it's this scale that initially inspires as you arrive for your safari. After your international flight touches down in Botswana, you will fly from Maun to your camp by helicopter, a 20-minute journey across flooded expanses, marooned herds and thousands of islands. Soon after you take off, the Delta will be all you see as its lush colors contrast with the desert yellow that surrounds Maun. You will arrive at your camp and spend your afternoon on an orientation ride. There are around 60 horses in the stable, and the guides have an intimate knowledge of their behavior which will ensure that you are matched with a suitable ride. All are sensible, forward-moving horses, used to the wild open spaces and the random encounters with wildlife. On your 2-hour ride around the local area, you will enjoy your first safari sights, notably the zebra and lechwe which huddle in large numbers. The odd elephant will grace the scene, but the main focus of the day will be getting comfortable with your horse and getting used to the conditions. Like each day on this horseback safari, you will not be following the horse trails; rather you will be making your own routes across the Delta."

        "description": "As the sun begins to rise, you will be cantering across the floodplains, riding with the zebra and following the hundreds of red lechwe to their fresh grazing pastures. Wade into the lush green bits of land that lead you between islands as some are thick with forest and the horses' hooves will surprise the reedbuck out from their cover. In the open spaces, you will join the mass herds, and by moving confidently, it is easy to ride within ten meters of the zebra and lechwe. Elephants rumble about the trees and are nomadic wanderers that still look huge when you are on horseback. Hippos are also easily spotted, filling the lagoons with their riotous grunts and noise. After leaving at dawn, you will return to camp in the late morning, where your lunch will be followed by a siesta. Later in the afternoon, as the heat of the day begins to fade, you will enjoy a game drive in the areas south of the camp. Trackers locate lions expertly, understanding their realms and where they like to find shade. Often you will see a pride in full repose, languidly rocking away an afternoon as their cubs annoy their parents with their flailing paws. Leopard also hides around here, although they are not as easy to spot in the dense woodland. Your vehicle will stop and your guide will point, but you will follow the finger to see nothing. But eventually, a tail will flick, and the leopard's camouflage is betrayed. You will be surprised to realize that she was much closer than you had imagined. Your vehicle will stop at the water for sunset drinks as the hippos emerge to graze, and then you will continue by spotlight with a nighttime drive that will reveal the animated scenes on the plains. A candlelit dinner will then complete your first full day on safari."

Sometimes the channels bring you to deep lagoons, where the horses wade in, and you are almost swimming across the Okavango. Keep riding as you move at a fast canter to cover large swathes of land that are completely inaccessible by vehicle. Sometimes you will follow elephant trails through the dense forest, using their pathways of destruction and passing clusters of the pachyderms along the way. There are resident breeding herds around here, and the baby elephants will be a safari highlight, especially when they give you and your horse an inquisitive look. As you reach Baobab Island, the lattice of animal tracks will extend to crisscross in every direction, hinting of the abundance of life attracted to this area. Wildebeest are spotted at increasing frequency, many of them galloping with an almost comical ebullience. So many tracks also bring surprises here and there as often a new animal is found when you emerge from the woodland; impala, warthog, springbok, sable antelope, perhaps the hooting of a baboon troop. After six hours in the saddle, you will return for lunch and a siesta before your afternoon is spent drifting along the waters in a makoro ."

At the height of the flooding, the guide will pick your route very carefully, trying to keep the water beneath the horse’s knees. But most of the time, you can just pick your space to canter and gallop across a blanket of lush green and ankle-high water. Thousands of ungulates graze here, the openness enabling the sentinels to spot nearby predators easily. It is the high grass that is dangerous, both for zebra and a horse. Your guides have decades of Okavango riding experience, and they will expertly tailor your route, drawing on ancient knowledge to ensure your safety. For tens of thousands of years, tribes have lived alongside the elephants and lions of the Okavango, and some of their simple techniques make exciting safari adventures like these possible.

Seeing an elephant or giraffe from a vehicle is special, but seeing one tower high above you is something else entirely. Much like riding on horseback, a game walk is evocative and exhilarating, bringing intimate encounters with those on the plains. Tsessebe skips past, following the sitatunga on a journey to the water. Springbok litter the plains and you will regularly spot the distinctive horns of kudu. Then there are the birds, as hundreds of different species beat their colorful wings around the trees. Relax at your camp through the afternoon and savor the setting. The ensuite tents are raised on wooden platforms above the Delta, providing imperious vistas across the landscape that you have been exploring. The interiors are more like a hotel than a camp and are very comfortable, while still providing a safari under canvas experience. Your afternoon and evening ride will take you through the Matsibe River system, where elephants and baboons munch on mokolwane palms and buffalos chomp on the tsaro palms.

Hippos continually wallow in the lagoons, and it is easy to lose count of how many you see each day. It is likely to be a five or six hour morning ride today with a return for a leisurely lunch and a few hours of downtime at your camp. A hippo's grunt will arouse you from your siesta and your afternoon will be spent on a mokoro as a guide paddles you down the channels and through the reeds. After the rugged adventure your horse brings, a mokoro trip is all about the calm serenity as you just sit back and watch the world unfold from your canoe.

This is one of Botswana’s flagship camps, and there’s grandeur to everything, especially in the density of wildlife seen in the vicinity. You’re now in the Jao Concession, which blends a land and water-based Okavango safari. Mokoro and motorboat safaris are added to your flexible program, choices that help you discover new collections of wildlife. As always, everything is tailored to your interests. So if you’re in the mood for it, just lie back and watch it all from your private deck."

        "description": "Spend the day on safari, exploring Okavango’s lagoons and the green plains of Hunda Island. Jao Concession is an all year round destination, although the experience changes with the seasons. From June to September, you’re gazing out over water, while throughout the other months, the plains become fields of mud and grasslands. Either way, this is where you’ll get to see a near-complete cast of Africa’s great mammals, including a great opportunity to see the cats out on a hunt. For something different this evening, head up the stairs to a private star bed beneath the stars. The immersion in nature is very special, every sound and smell floating up to the four-poster mosquito-net-bound bed that’s located on the roof of your suite. It’s a celebration of safari’s grandeur and exclusivity, a chance to fall asleep beneath the Milky Way as a herd of elephants are crossing the plains below."

        "description": "Of all the Okavango’s activities, it’s a mokoro that best reflects the tranquility of the landscape. This traditional dugout canoe moves softly and silently, with a gondolier paddling you gently along reed-fringed channels. Hundreds of zebras drink from the banks; hippo pods fill the waterways, and every so often you encounter an elephant or lion taking a sip from the shore. You can drift away in this serene vessel and let the safari come to you. Along with the famous animals, this area has a fantastic collection of birds, along with gigantic herds of red lechwes, cute little antelopes that always appears to be in a playful mood. A motorboat safari takes you across larger distances and is a great way to see a wider part of the Okavango Delta. It’s always your choice as every day is fully customized."

        "description": "Botswana dazzles from the air, so much so that the Okavango Delta is clearly visible from space. By flying over the landscapes, you get to appreciate just how remote and untouched the country is. You lose your eyes in the vibrancy of nature, admiring how the colors swirl as if painted by brushes of oil. First, you fly back to Maun, the Okavango delivering captivating swathes of blue and green. These fade away gradually, replaced by the dusty ochre of the Kalahari Desert. Change planes in Maun and discover the enormity of the Kalahari, how it continues uninterrupted for endless miles, and then suddenly transforms into a mirage of salt pans. This is the Makgadikgadi, an area that’s bigger than most countries and one that doesn’t have a single road. Leroo La Tau stands in the west of the pans, perched above the Boteti River. It’s the only permanent water source for hundreds of square miles, attracting thousands of animals as the scarcity of the winter’s dry season takes hold. Among them are the 50,000 or so zebras and wildebeests that arrive every June, after making an epic migration across the pans. While this landscape doesn’t offer the Okavango’s intense concentration of big game, there’s a wonderful charm to discovering how the river brings life to the heart of the dusty desert and deserted salt pans. Like always, sit back on your deck and watch the show, including the myriad of colorful birds that flutter above the herds. The afternoon and evening are at your leisure, and the inclusive activities include a game drive or a cruise along the river."

Few places feel as remote as one of the world’s largest salt pans. The only access is on set trails, which lead you on a full-day trip from Leroo La Tau. Stop for lunch beneath baobab trees that randomly punctuate the pans, drive across the endless mirage of white, and spot the odd meerkat colony poking their heads above the ground. It’s a journey that showcases the enormity of the Kalahari and the evocative mystique of an untouched world. Photos can only show what it looks like; visiting the Nxai Pan is more about how it feels, how the silence permeates everything and the sense of being alone in the wild is practically absolute."

Zebras skip in the shallows; an elephant bathes itself using its trunk to spray water, and wildebeests splash about with a wonderful enthusiasm. Return to the lodge, and there are many languid hours to enjoy, simply relaxing on the deck and gazing out across wild Africa. In the afternoon, you have the choice of going on a game drive or visiting a local village. Or you can sit back and enjoy your final afternoon in the remote Kalahari."

After landing in Cape Town, you will immediately sense that this is a unique continent where Mother Nature has her hand in everything. You will be staying at a boutique lodge that is located just beneath the mountain and just above the heart of the city. From here, you only need to look up to feel sheer grandeur of the mountain.

        "description": "From Cape Town to the Sabi Sands, and from Table Mountain to the Sabi River, a different kind of nature will take over. Zebras will splash around as they drink, and acacia trees will lie above the water. Kudu and springbok will also be at the river, drinking during the hottest part of the day. The safari will have already started, yet you will be sitting around a pool, sipping on drinks. That will be the style in the Sabi Sands where there is a contemporary luxury in the bush. While you will be going on game drives, the animal experience always continues for 24 hours a day. There are three game drives a day: early morning, late afternoon, and after dark in the evening. These reflect when the animals are most active. Game drives do not need to travel far. They tend to stick close to the Sabi River, which is a permanent water source that snakes through Greater Kruger National Park. There are no fences, and the reserve is a jigsaw piece of the larger Great Limpopo Transfrontier Conservation Area, which is a protected wilderness area that is spread across three countries and some 100,000 square kilometers. Wildlife will move freely around the Sabi River, and you never need to travel far in order to see it. As dawn breaks, the tracker may see a lioness on the move. Up ahead, you can see the zebra, and the guide will position you beyond them, so you do not interrupt the hunt. Monkeys will howl from above as the zebra become increasingly alert. If one runs, the others will follow. There is no telling whether they run into an ambush or not as every game drive is different. Sometimes, you will encounter these dramatic scenes, perhaps even lions feasting on a carcass, and at other times you will find more charm than drama. Leopards are a particular highlight of this reserve and can be wonderfully followed on a nighttime game drive. The area supports great numbers of elephants and rhinos as well, along with buffalo herds that are sometimes 60 or 70 strong. The famous Big Five are just the start. The Sabi Sands supports over 100 large mammal species, helping to provide a diverse overview of African wildlife in its natural habitat. Think wildebeest, springbok, kudu, eland, giraffe, hippo, baboon, peculiar antelope, and small nocturnal predators. Most poignantly, these three days on your safari will reveal how the species interact with each other, highlighting behavior in a way that is only possible in the wild like watching a baby elephant chase a warthog from the river."

The camp will be perched on an island of palms trees and surrounded by the seasonal waterways of a desert oasis. Water is essential, especially in the desert, and animals migrate here from thousands of kilometers away just to get a sip. If you gaze out, you will be able to see their enthusiasm. Animals will skip in the water, and elephants will splash with their trunks. Even the hippos will not appear to be bad-tempered. In such a lush, watery oasis, you will quickly experience how seasonal change attracts life in wild Africa."

        "description": "Hippos will grunt, and their calls will sound a lot like burps. Elephants are more harmonic, which sound much like a chorus of horns and trumpets. Lion calls echo in a sonorous and surreal way as they stretch across the landscape. There will be more immediate sounds as well: red lechwe wading, exotic birds above your suite, and oryx nibbling around the reeds. Smells will also entice, slowly impressing the life that surrounds you. You will explore in a mokoro canoe, and the safari will continue to be a multi-sensory experience. These traditional canoes are constructed from a single tree trunk. A gondolier will push you down narrow channels, taking you silently alongside everything around the banks. With a mokoro you can get incredibly close to the wildlife, often being able to look up at the four-legged giants. A motorboat is the equivalent of a safari vehicle here as traveling by water is the easiest way to get around. You will travel slowly, going around islands, across lagoons, and through the heart of the Delta. In a water world, you never know what animals have been marooned somewhere. Buffalo and elephants will swim across while hippos dip their heads under the water. Game drives and game walks will also be a part of your safari program with the exact itinerary being planned on a day to day basis. Your camp is to the west of the Delta, which is the area that floods first and has water all year around. This side of the Okavango is recommended for a multi-destination safari, as it proves to be a massive contrast from Sabi Sands and Linyanti. Hippos will become your neighbors, elephants will wander past your camp each evening, and wildlife will thrive in this bountiful space. By using all your senses, you will pick up on more of the details, learning what different animals do at different times of the day, and appreciating the daily battles between and within species."

        "title": "Linyanti Reserve – Drama and Charm in an Atmospheric Safari Wilderness",
        "description": "The short flight to Linyanti will be spectacular, providing a scenic impression of how the Okavango Delta spills eastwards. You will cruise above snake-shaped channels, islets, and floodplains, spotting elephants and giraffes that are on the move. Landing in Linyanti, you will immediately grasp a mix of habitats. There will be water here along with open plains and thick swathes of forest. To the north is Chobe, which is a woodland that is home to the world’s largest elephant population. To the south, you will have the Okavango Delta, which is a seasonal wildlife haven. Linyanti is on the migratory path between them, and it is a reserve that has been made even more special during the last few years. For decades, the Savuti Channel was dry, but now it runs strong and clear, making the reserve a popular place for year-round residents. Massive herds of buffalo will graze on the open plains, joined by zebra, wildebeest, oryx, and, clusters of more bashful antelope. Giraffes poke their heads above the trees, and you will quickly lose count of the elephants with herds roaming past at all hours of the day. Most of all, this is a place for predators. Deep in the trees, you will find a leopard that is draped along an acacia branch, and around the savannah fringes, you will discover lion prides that are learning how small their territories. Across the savanna, you will see something move as figures move their heads in and out of the grass. You may be lucky and witness a pack of wild dogs that are out on their afternoon hunt. They move with tact at first but quickly pick up the chase. In comparison, the big cats must get really close in order to pounce. Working as a pack, the dogs chase their prey, trying to isolate a target. Once isolated, the animals run and run as the wild dogs work their prey to exertion. This wildlife drama will be complemented by daily charm. Not every sighting will be thrilling and exciting. Soon, you will find that many animals are so numerous that they begin to blur into the landscape. After nine days on your safari, it will be hard to picture a land that is not populated by hippos and elephants. Walking safaris will bring a new impression. Now, you will be sharing the land with these giants, looking up and across at them. You will be just another mammal, and the herds will look at you inquisitively and unsure of what to make of such two-legged visitors. Walking safaris can be incorporated into your safari program along with nighttime drives as well."

Hidden high in the trees are leopards, the spotted cats that are easy to miss if you travel too fast. As you explore the woodland, the profusion of elephants is remarkable as thousands upon thousands barge a path through the thick trees. They are joined by giraffe, who lope away in a few long strides when a lion pride enters beneath the canopy. The Linyanti a land of the giants and the hunters and the juxtaposition of ecosystems providing ample food for the largest and most ravenous of Botswana. Woodland blurs into grassland savannah, which often disappears and becomes classic delta scenery when the Okavango is flooding. Exquisite and exclusive, Linyanti is a private concession and can only be visited by those staying at one of the luxury camps within the concession. There are strict rules about encountering the wildlife, so there will never be more than three vehicles that approach any animal. Often there will only be yours, even when it's the sight of a lion pride tearing into a zebra carcass. Game drives are about the discovery of a full range of habitats to find the predators while walking safaris take you onto the savannah and into the realm of the grazers, where it's possible to approach to just a few meters from large herds. Nighttime game drives continue the adventure as the silence of the wilderness is pierced only by harrowing calls. Listen, get closer, turn on the spotlight and the culmination of a hunt is taking place just a few meters from the vehicle. As with most days on this safari itinerary, the daily program is flexible, and you'll be able to choose between different activities."

From June to November, the Okavango is flooded to form nature's greatest oasis. But certain channels and waterways flow all year, which helps to maintain a rich diversity and profusion of wildlife. Kanana Reserve is centered on some of these permanent channels, with its lush flood meadows transforming when the Delta's waters rise. Check into your next marvelous camp and admire the scene from your wooden verandah as nothing artificial will break the spell of the natural wilderness. A resident hippo pod bathing in the river will be a permanent fixture for these next three days. It will not be long before you see one open its humongous jaw. Various antelope will skip past to drink from the channel before returning to the fresh meadows. Above your head are the branches of jackal berry and sausage trees, where an array of monkey species provide regular entertainment. Check into the camp and enjoy an afternoon of exploration.

You have the Okavango Delta at your fingertips, a whole playground of opportunity with hardly another visitor in sight. Much like Linyanti, Kanana also showcases a variety of habitats that brings a variety of wildlife. These two days are made up of both land and water activities that unravel the subtleties of the Okavango Delta. Create your own itinerary, with morning and afternoon excursions punctuated by a few relaxed hours at the camp. Safari never stops of course, as even when it's midday, and you are reading a book on the verandah, there is likely to be hippos or elephants dominating the panorama. Barefooted, indigenous guides take you onto the savannah. Walk slowly as a buffalo herd is up ahead before you stop, take some photos, and then analyze the herd's reaction. They seem unthreatened, so walk ten meters closer. With many of the animals, you can follow this pattern as the guides can bring you into a thrilling proximity. On game drives, you can't be silent, but by traversing large areas of the reserve, you can encounter all of its residents. Guides know where the resident cheetahs like to hide, or where to find pride of lions. Sometimes the experience involves stopping the vehicle and waiting. Elephants will roam past from multiple directions, the giraffe will curiously say hello, and half a dozen antelope species may quickly scamper past. These land safaris are complimented by motorboat journeys and mokoro safaris, where you explore in traditional canoes."

        "description": "Exploring the Okavango is not possible by road, so light aircraft hop above the wilderness to touch down at remote airstrips that sometimes have to be cleared of giant mammals to allow for landing. Motorboats cruise along the water to piece together the distinctive areas of an oasis that is clearly visible from space. For your final three nights, your safari is in Moremi Game Reserve, the game-rich heart of the Okavango Delta. Choose to arrive by flight or boat (both options offer a safari experience), and then settle into the next camp, set on a lush island that's surrounded by water throughout the year. Moremi provides the quintessence of the Delta, where water abounds, exotic birds flutter past, and it's hard to go a few minutes without hearing the hippos. After checking in, you will spend an afternoon on a mokoro safari. These traditional wooden canoes have been the local means of transportation for generations, a serene and silent way of moving through the flooded landscape. A guide paddles you down narrow channels, where there's barely ten meters of water between the lush reeds on either side. It's thick, and the visibility is low but with the mokoro's speed, you can follow all of the clues. Perhaps you will see a pair of eyes in the grass, that of a hyena hiding amidst the green. Or maybe a trampled route that leads to a herd of elephants. Paddle along the banks, and you will encounter everything that comes to drink from the channels including the kudu, springbok, oryx, impala, zebra, giraffe, baboons, and more, all seen from water level barely five meters away. Turn another corner in the mokoro , and there will be a herd of tsessebe, small antelope that gallop away quickly because a lion pride wants to drink from the same spot. The adventures on land also continue and you will enjoy game drives across Chief's Island, the lavish green center of the Okavango Delta. Surrounded by water all year around, the island has a remarkable density of life, including four of the Big Five and the roving herds of pachyderms. Walking safaris can be limited here (due to the abundance of predators), but you will still have the opportunity to explore certain areas safely on foot. Then there's the camp safari as you watch hippos while sitting on your bed or glance up from a book to see a giraffe tower wandering past. Or you may wake up to a herd of red lechwe grazing directly beneath your luxury-tented suite. Moremi offers the complete Okavango wilderness experience and three days lets you explore it all at a relaxed speed."

        "description": "Out on the floodplains a battle is starting. A lion pride stands over a kudu carcass, the youngsters getting their fill after the alpha male has retired. But a pack of hyenas are looking for scraps, and they cheekily test the boundaries by grabbing at the impala’s limbs. Will the lions resist and finish the impala? Or will full stomachs neutralize their ability to fight off scavengers? These are the daily dramas of Chief’s Island, an abundant piece of the Okavango that arguably has more big cats than anywhere in Southern Africa. Water brings migratory herds, everything from one ton buffalo to baby impala. Lying in wait are lion prides and solitary leopards, rare wild dogs and a collection of cheetahs. Your place in the wilderness throws you straight into the raw end of African safari and you’re immediately surrounded by the interaction between predator and prey. Such excitement calls for an accompanying dose of tranquility and that is your camp's most impressive drawcard. The rugged natural world is serenely counteracted by the camp’s ability to offer the ultimate luxury and privacy. Even as you retire onto a huge double bed, the silhouettes of mammals can be spotted on the horizon. There are no schedules here. Each day can be carefully planned, but it can also be immediately changed to suit the mood. Again, it's your private safari, so the balance between relaxation and excitement is up to you. Game drives take you out into the lions’ kingdom. Lionesses are out on the prowl, while majestic maned males slowly approach the safari truck. Skillful guides know the favorite leopard haunts, while a smorgasbord of antelopes tentatively graze on the grasslands. Extend the drive with a lazy picnic lunch in your favorite spot. Or cut it short and spend a long afternoon admiring everything from your balcony. Mokoros are dug-out wooden canoes and they take you deep into the action. Think of it as being something like Venice. A skilled boatman paddles you along the waterways in the traditional boat, pointing out the sights and allowing you to be surrounded by the local charms. Except the sights aren’t ancient buildings or cute bridges. The shallow channels teem with wildlife. Elephants migrate across them, hippos lounge in them, and springbok approach them to drink. A traditional mokoro trip gets you breathtakingly close and it’s often the highlight of a visit to Moremi."

Light aircraft flights are the perfect way to offer a new visual angle and minimize transfer time. You won't be stuck on a long drive between destinations. These tiny airstrips ensure that you fly directly from wilderness to wilderness. They also provide peace of mind. While you may be deep in animal territory, a plane is always available in case of any emergency. So while it might be hundreds of miles away, it takes less than an hour to reach modern civilization The almost 100,000 elephants of Northern Botswana spread over an area that stretches to Victoria Falls in the Northeast and Moremi in the Southwest. Central to their ongoing journeys are two famous elephant corridors in Linyanti Wildlife Reserve. Immense family herds wander through this area, their health indicated by the copious amount of enchanting babies. Bachelor groups and lone old males also travel along these channels, and at times it’s impossible to look up without seeing an elephant. Nestled between these two corridors, right in the thick of the action, is your sumptuous Duma Tau Camp, your home for the next three days."

        "description": "Your time in Linyanti is centered on elephants. In fact, they’re pretty difficult to escape. The wide-angled windows of your room offer unforgettable vistas onto the landscape, and elephants are wandering past at unfathomable rates. Some get spectacularly close and come to within meters of the camp. Don’t worry, guards skillfully ensure that nothing oversteps the unfenced boundary. It’s a charming experience. Lift your head from a book and a young male tusker is saying hello. Return from the en-suite bathroom and a small herd drinks beside your balcony. Trumpet calls accompany your elegant outdoor dining. And this is all without going on a game drive. So just imagine how close you’re going to get when you’re out in a vehicle. Like all camps and lodges, skilled guards ensure that nothing gets dangerously close. But it’s not just about nature’s largest land mammals. Permanent water and lush grazing ground attract a full cast of African wildlife. The big cats won’t need any introduction; however, getting intimate with a lion pride is an experience that never grows old. Thick forests are havens for leopards. Gaze into the trees and a swinging tail provides a clue. Look closely. Allow your eyes to adjust to the cat’s careful camouflage. Then smile as the leopard is slowly revealed. Again, a customized blend of safari activities allows you to explore different corners of the reserve. Game drives and mokoro trips are obvious choices, and they’re supplemented by thrilling walking safaris and nighttime drives. They provide a new angle, one that increases your admiration for the landscape. Trek with a trained guide and go in search of the reserve’s impressive bird collection; vivid flocks dominate treetops, rare owls hide amidst the ebony groves, and eagles effortlessly soar overhead. Drive out under the cover of moonlight and peer through the gloom. Silently stop on verdant grazing land and wait for the hippos or buffalo to come closer and closer. Then your guide’s spotlight illuminates bizarre nocturnal creatures, like endangered fox species and tiny antelopes. But it’s left to the elephants to provide a final hurrah, their stunning silhouettes marked against an evocative sunrise. There are so many here that some people have called for a controlled cull. Botswana would never agree to that. This is a country that invests heavily in ensuring the natural world stays exactly as it always has been. Part of their strategy for protecting the wildlife is their commitment to high-end tourism. While some countries aim for tourist numbers, Botswana focuses on quality. They would rather offer the ultimate experience to a handful of visitors than attract thousands of budget hunters. This approach has ensured that Botswana's tourism industry is arguably the most sophisticated and developed in the whole of Africa."

Upcoming males battle for the prime spots in the river, grunting and stamping to indicate supremacy. Yet it’s all in vein, as the huge alpha male charges into the water and everyone immediately falls into line. Much of your safari experience has been about allowing the wildlife to come to you. That changes today as you fly to Kasane and board a luxury boat cruise. Elephants and hippos are the main wildlife attractions and you’ll see hundreds of each. Yet there’s a wonderful tranquility to cruising down the Chobe River and watching everything along the riverbank. A delicious lunch is served on board and there are both outdoor and indoor decks to lounge upon. It goes without saying that you're exploring areas that are miles from any road or trail. So just sit back, relax, and admire Botswana's natural world. This is a shared river cruise but the boat is extremely spacious and there will only be a handful of other passengers. After disembarking you are transferred by land to Victoria Falls in Zambia. It takes less than one hour and your guide will assist with the immigration formalities.

Every second, 1,000 tons of water descend into the abyss, making Victoria Falls the most powerful waterfall on the planet. An effervescent layer of mist rises out of the canyon and a powerful roar echoes for miles. Before you've even set eyes on the falls you'll understand why the locals call it Mosi-oa-Tunya, literally translated as “the smoke that thunders.” Spend a morning wandering the gentle trails that run parallel to Victoria Falls. You'll get dozens of different angles from the viewing platforms and have plenty of time to soak up both the visual euphoria and relentless soundtrack. Transfer back to your lodge in the afternoon and go on a sunset river cruise down the Zambezi.

A whole pod may emerge from the water and then scatter across the banks, heading out for their nightly grazing. Elephants are also nearby, and you will see large herds turning into shadowy figures as the sun disappears from the sky. Sunset from the riverboat is a sublime introduction to Africa, and your safari has already started. Earlier in the day, you will have landed at Kasane Airport, where you will be greeted by a guide for your short journey over the border to Botswana and the Chobe River. Climb aboard, and you will spend an hour cruising downriver to get away from the lodges on the riverbank and into your own private piece of the river. With few other boats and very little manufactured noise, the region where you will spend the night is a prime place to encounter spectacular numbers of elephant and hippo, and they will look all the more impressive when you are also on the water with them."

Grazers love it here, and the sights will begin to come thick and fast, from zebra galloping along the shores to impala and oryx marching across the plains. Elephants and giraffe are so common that you will struggle to find a panorama without them in it. A hundred? A thousand? A few thousand? It becomes impossible to count how many you see in a day, but the numbers are certainly baffling. As this is your first full day, it is likely to be a relaxed one as you cruise and begin to feel the connection with the landscape around you. Land excursions are possible, and throughout this safari, you will be able to plan each day as it comes. Discuss the route with the captain, share your dreams and wishes with the guide, and savor an experience that's constantly being tailored to your preferences and the wildlife around you. Fancy a walk that tracks giraffe across the plains? Want to encounter buffalo herds or lion pride? A small boat can take you to the shore, and the adventure will unfold right in front of you.

Look the other, and the dense trees will make it hard to spot anything beyond the banks. So after a short sunrise cruise, you will disembark and take a game drive into the thick of the forest, following rutted trails that were first created by bulldozing elephants. Turn a corner, and a baby elephant will drag his trunk along the floor. Turn another, and 50 buffalo may be blocking the way. Some elephants tower above the vehicle, passing just meters away. Baboons often surround you, scurrying along the sandy floor as you curl through the trees. Expert guides scan the trees to seek out the stealthy leopards that lurk beneath the canopy. Lions bask in the grass, and raucous birds often alert everyone of their presence. Often mysterious and always enchanting, the Chobe woodland is one of Africa's great safari destinations and a perfect half-day excursion.

These two days are spent on Chief's Island in the heart of Moremi Game Reserve, where your camp will overlook the water with your days spent exploring the land. Lion sightings should be expected as the landscape's monarchs lounge on the open savannah. Cheetah hide in the grass and two days of game drives provide an excellent opportunity to see the elusive spotted hunter. Leopards are camouflaged in the trees, and your guide will point them out. Occasionally one descends, bounding down the trunk and setting off on a hunt. Habitats collide on Chief's Island, making it one of Africa's premier safari destinations. Regular favorites such as the elephant and the buffalo continue to be seen in large numbers. Often, there is an air of tension as the herds battle with the lions, who are also fighting away the hyenas. Unusual characters like the blue wildebeest and sable antelope provide an inspiring sight, and you could spend hours watching the interaction amongst herds. The game drives are private, so you will dictate their pace and direction. It is possible to take a picnic and spend all day exploring, a good way to get to the most remote areas of the island. Alternatively, early morning and late afternoon drives can be punctuated with blissful hours spent at the camp as the hippos yawn as you tuck into lunch."

Rain falls in the Angolan Highlands and then embarks on a journey into the desert, gushing down the Okavango Panhandle and then tumbling across the floodplains. The broad Panhandle is always high with water and can offer a year-round houseboat experience. The Delta originates in this region, and there is something very surreal about the landscape as the reed-fringed banks meet with clumps of woodland and the vast clearings are flooded for half the year. Visit from June to October, and the high water will provide countless route options for your 3-day Okavango houseboat safari. At other times of the year, the dwindling water elsewhere means the panhandle is rich with wildlife. After a short flight west, you will board your houseboat and spend the day cruising up the river. Serenely pass the hippos, watch kudu leaving prints in the mud, hear a large buffalo herd hissing in the distance, and get closer than ever by traversing the smaller channels. When the guides spot abundant wildlife and the waterway is too narrow for the houseboat, you can easily jump into the smaller tender and have a brief excursion. Over these three days, you will explore parts of the Okavango that receive very few visitors, so the experience is abounding with pleasant surprises. Usually, the captain will lay anchor by later afternoon, and you can watch the landscape transform from the upper deck. As always, a three-course dinner is served along with a choice of wine."

The Okavango is Africa's finest water bird watching destination, and your journeys by houseboat may bring over a hundred different species. Cruising along, you will explore the mazy channels in the smaller tender or soak up the sun from your upper deck. If you are into fishing, then there are 11 types of bream plus the famous fighting tigerfish to catch. And while it is tranquil on the houseboat, there is always that moment of drama when an elephant appears, a cheetah is spotted along the riverbank or a tower of giraffe hang over the surrounding trees. You will enjoy pure decadence on board as the houseboat provides a luxury home for these three days. Suites are spacious and well appointed, with floor-to-ceiling windows that ensure you have always got a view. The wide and shaded upper deck is the perfect place to spend the day, its elevated vantage point enabling you to take in the whole of the landscape in front of you. Your houseboat has a capacity for eight guests, but as this is a private charter, you will have it all to yourself. With a skilled team providing discreet service and a wide range of inclusive drinks, you just need to sit back and allow nature's theater to unfold."

        "description": "Your itinerary is flexible, so a full-day excursion to Tsodilo Hills is optional, although it is recommended as it showcases another side to Botswana. Tsodilo Hills are the spiritual heart of the San bushmen culture, an alluring place that they believe to be the site of Creation. Over 3,500 rock paintings are sketched across the hills with many of them over a millennia in age. Spirituality abounds, and there is something mystical that has everyone believing that something special happened here. As part of the excursion, you will stop at a small local community for a non-intrusive visit that will give you an insight into the lifestyle of this ancient nomadic people. Return to your houseboat for sunset, and another local nomad will keep you company as the elephant herds barge into the river and send up flumes of water with their trunks."

Take your breakfast on your deck and admire the sunrise scene for a final time, the water reflecting crimson tones as the ambiance of wild Africa floats on the breeze. Enjoy three more hours of cruising to access the nearest airstrip, where you will disembark your houseboat for your flight to Maun. At the airport, you will be met by a representative and assisted to your international departure."

        "description": "There's a dreamy preconception of the Okavango Delta as water abounds, lush colors intersect on the horizon, hippos are everywhere, and tiny islands are surrounded by the flooded plains. This dreamy image is the reality in the west of the Okavango Delta, the area that floods most comprehensively. You will be staying at a camp on one of these marooned islands, fully surrounded by the bounty of the oasis. Yours is a stylish tented safari camp raised on wooden platforms, with just eight suites that blend into nature. Each suite has its own private deck, and the design is wonderfully boutique, which complements the wandering hippos and the buffalos in the water below. Your international flights will land in Maun where a representative will help to transfer you to a small plane. The micro flight to Jao Concession provides a compelling view, and you will descend across the blue of the flood plains. For the Okavango, Hunda is a relatively large island, measuring around 250 square miles and allowing for land-based safari activities, although the program is likely to be dominated by the water-based safari adventures. The island's size also enables a diversity of wildlife with resident mammals joined by migratory arrivals. Touch down in the late afternoon, and you will have time for a sunset cruise to sip from your wine glass as hippos and elephants wade around the shallows."

        "description": "Your alarm call may come from the hippos as a pod of them returns to their daily wading space in the light of dawn. Elephants are hooting with their loud tones complementing the orchestral birdsong. Over a light breakfast, you will watch the sunrise paint the sky and then you will begin to explore, paddling gently in a mokoro . Venice has gondolas, and the Okavango has mokoros , traditionally vessels that rock gently as they silently explore the water. Head past the hippos as you watch a couple of them yawn, and then find a herd of impala drinking along a reed-fringed channel. Round a corner, and an elephant is crossing, walking across the bottom and using his trunk as a snorkel. Keep paddling, and a flurry of wildlife congregates, zebra and wildebeest taking turns to drink and keep guard. The great thing about the mokoro is that animals do not hear you coming, so you can get exceptionally close. Return to camp late morning and do as the wildlife does through the hottest part of the day: relax. Now is your time to rest on your shaded deck to feel the allure of the wild. Everything has its place, from the exotic birds that flutter past to the mopane woodland that provides food for a giraffe. Gazing out over the Okavango allows you to admire how everything is connected. Herds wander past, large animals grace the horizon, and random sounds alert you to what is going on in the trees around the camp. The middle part of the day is usually a quiet time on safari, but it is never that quiet as you will still be seeing animals and feeling the allure of nature. Around mid-afternoon, you will head out to explore on a motorboat. Your motorized boat will enable you to cover large stretches of the Delta, perhaps circumnavigating Hunda Island or crossing lush lagoons. Motorboat safari is most suited to finding the big herds and larger animals. When you get close, the engine is cut, and you will move more serenely as a 40-strong elephant herd drinks from a bank, four giraffes are playing in the water, buffalo roll in the mud, and there is a good chance of spotting a lion pride coming for an afternoon drink. Like the mokoro and the camp itself, your motorboat will provide a classic Delta experience. Game drives and walking safaris are also possible on Hunda Island, and your daily itinerary is completely flexible."

Take off from the narrow airstrip and soar across the lagoons, the plane flying low enough to glimpse the larger herds from the air. Your destination is a private concession on the edge of Moremi Game Reserve, in the heart of the Okavango. Moremi is where nature changes through the seasons, from the lush green of the floods from June to September, to the scorched yellows when the Kalahari Desert tightens its grip on the landscape. Such changes help it attract an abundance of life, and Moremi is one of the best destinations in Africa for witnessing the big cats. After touching down, you will enjoy a unique experience with three orphaned elephants, walking with the trio around the surrounding plains. Habituated to human contact, these elephants were saved from a culling exercise and have lived here for years. You will get to see the world through the eyes of these elephants, following them through the trees to a bathing spot in the concession. Later in the day, you will take a game drive through the concession to trace the active hyena dens that are sprinkled around the camp. Over the next three days, you should encounter all of the famous hunters as you explore the landscape."

        "description": "You will wake to tension at dawn as four lionesses are on the prowl, hiding amongst the reeds as fearful herds come down for a drink. Still and silent, they wait patiently for their food, allowing the zebra to get comfortable in the water. Most graze in an area of low grass, but overconfidence can have fatal consequences. A young mare has ventured off towards the green shoots of the reeds, and you will watch as the lionesses pounce, their hour-long vigil followed by a few seconds of authoritative power. Black and white limbs are flying as the big male tucks in for his feast. The enchantment of the scene is not quickly over as you watch how the alpha male lion wards off his younger companions with growling menace. When the big cats are around, you could spend over an hour watching the same scene. While the Okavango offers a profusion of wildlife, the experience is defined by quality rather than quantity. Witnessing these intimate battles between predator and prey is something that you will never forget as you remember the showcase of power and beauty deep in the wild. Over these two days, your safari program will remain flexible. Mokoro safaris are a possibility, and most will go for at least one game drive per day, the rugged vehicle is able to bounce off the trail and bring a real insight into the lives of the big cats. Like your first camp, this one also has an exquisite view, a tranquil atmosphere, and a luxury that you will find hard to comprehend when you consider where you are. Most importantly, small camps like this blend into their surroundings as they are not an interruption to the wilderness and are on the daily route of many wandering animals. Those with a keen eye will start to recognize the resident herds that pass by every day as some elephants even time their arrival, coming an hour after sundown or arriving to greet you at daybreak. As your camp is located in its own concession, these two days also provide opportunity for walking safaris and nighttime game drives."

With over 100 mammal species and a rich abundance of big cats, this is the country's flagship wildlife destination. Luxury safari has entertained visitors here for many decades, although the park's visitors have dwindled over the last ten years. Hwange is not an up and coming destination, rather the infrastructure is established, the luxury camps offer beautiful experiences, and the game viewing defies the imagination. You will be staying in Linkwasha Concession, a prolific area of the park. Snippets of woodland grace a plain that is predominantly open and expansive, making the game viewing extremely easy. You will soon be enjoying the enormous resident herds of buffalo and elephant, along with dozens of different mammals that roam across the plain. Tucked away in a grove of mopane trees, your camp offers a classic tented camp experience. The spacious suites have excellent bathrooms that could have come from a five-star hotel, and the expansive pine deck makes for fantastic daytime views over the waterhole. The nearby campfire area allows you to savor the wild long into the evening and buffalos and elephants really do have the right of way here, so expect to see them silhouetted at the waterhole below."

The majestic horns of a roan antelope, hyenas snapping feverishly, baby elephants tumbling in the mud, a lion pride snoozing in the sun. Springbok flit across the horizon and then a leopard emerges from the woodland. Follow the beautiful hunter, watching her drink from the waterhole and then disappear into the brittle grass. Her camouflage is absolute when looking from the ground, but the vehicle's elevated vantage point ensures that you can watch the elusive cat on her morning hunt. Dusk falls, and you will stay on the savannah. The guide cuts the engine and you are guided by sound as your vehicles spotlight will reveal the different animals on the plains. You will spot the leopard again, scampering through the grass with a limp antelope hanging from her jaws. Early morning is a great time for a guided walk as your senses are awoken by the splendor of nature. Traveling on foot is deliberately slow, and you will get to appreciate all of the subtle clues with all of the hints of life left on the savannah floor. By sticking close to your guide, it is possible to get close to a whole host of plains animals, such as zebra, roan antelope, and even herds of female buffalo. Game drives here can stay in the Linkwasha Concession, where you are permitted to leave the trail. They can also explore the enormity of Hwange National Park, and it is very rare that you will encounter another vehicle. As always, the daily program is fully flexible, and guides will inform you of the different options. Sometimes, a guide may recommend a morning game drive as he will be aware of intense lion activity in the vicinity."

Some of it returns as spray, cascading down and drenching everyone within seconds. On the Zimbabwean side, you will get both experiences with the visual beauty of the falls and their relentless power. You will still be able to hear the rumble from Victoria Falls Hotel, the country's oldest five-star residence.

Lion prides roam, elephants wander in search of water, antelope graze on brittle grass, and there isn't a building for thousands of square miles. It's an idyllic escape and an indelible jump into the animal kingdom. But how do you get there? After your international flight lands in Maun, central Botswana, a light aircraft takes you out into remote Kalahari, landing on a rarely used airstrip.

        "description": "When couples think of romantic escapes they're perhaps thinking of opening the curtains to white sand and palm trees. This morning's view is a little different. You've got a few wandering giraffe, a nomadic elephant herd, and a sprinkling of antelope inspecting the camp. There's no need to rise from the luxurious king sized bed to enjoy the action. With a mobile camp in the Kalahari you can just marvel at the animals coming to you. Your personal chef cooks up breakfast, dazzling panoramas extend in all directions, and the camp comes with some fabulous little touches. This might be camping, but it's camping Botswana style; think hot showers overlooking the elephants, thick lounge chairs with a view, and wooden flooring that raises the spacious tent above the landscape. A small and discreet team attends to your every need. So if you want to eat dinner beside a hippo pool then the table will be quickly arranged, complete with wine glasses and candles. This first stop sets the tone for the whole vacation. The exact location of the camp is dependent on the abundance of wildlife, distance to other visitors, and animal migratory patterns. It effortlessly blends into the landscape and attracts lots of curious attention from four-legged visitors. An ungulate herd might be scared of a lodge. The same herd will be intrigued by a small camp on the horizon. Safari starts from the camp and it continues into the night. Lions slumber in the dusty plains, ever searching for a shaded space to rest their heads. Drive alongside them and they hardly seem to move. But a half open eye suggests that a lion is never completely asleep. Cheetahs stand on protruding rocks, gazing out at the potential dinner menu. Red hartebeest gather and gallop, ever hoping for signs of flourishing grass to graze upon. The Kalahari is often barren and desolate, so the nomadic wildlife moves great distances in search of food. You could look out and see nothing, apart from the mesmeric red beauty of scorched plains. But you could also look out and see everything. Like everywhere on this vacation, the daily itinerary is completely flexible and dictated by the two of you. A complete range of safari activities are included and an expert guide will craft an adventure that suits your mood. That might be an epic six hour game drive across the Kalahari. Or it could be a one hour walk on the trail of giraffe. The guide's intimate knowledge of the environment helps satisfy demanding preferences. African safari is inherently unpredictable and that's epitomized by the Kalahari. Sometimes you may drive for 30 minutes and only admire singed plains. Then an elephant grabs your attention. Get closer and a whole kudu herd follows the pachyderm's footsteps. Keep approaching and there's a camouflaged leopard tracking the nomads. This is African safari at its most authentic, and probably, its most romantic."

And slowly they become sharp defined images, a patchwork of stripes emerging from the arid landscape. Almost everyone has heard of the great wildebeest migration. Botswana's zebra migration is Africa's second largest mass movement of animals. 30,000 sets of zebra hooves are kicking up dust as they maraud south in the early months of the year. Blue wildebeest join the search for fresh grazing land and a smorgasbord of predators provide chaperoning services. Your camp will be erected with a view of the migration and the location may only be decided a week or so before you arrive. This provides maximum flexibility for responding to the natural phenomenon. Nxai Pan gets the action during the early months, the herds multiplying in size as they maraud onwards. Makgadikgadi is better in March and April. By then, the zebra start to scatter before completing their migration at the Boteti River. As always, a range of inimitable safari experiences get you even closer. Walk out onto the plains and wait for the rush of a thousand zebra galloping past. Experienced horse riders can sit in the saddle and actually ride along the fringes of the herds. Or you could uncork the wine and soak up the surroundings of your private playground. It's not just about the zebra and their predators. These pans burst with the rare and inimitable. Meerkat mobs stick up their heads on crusted white salt pans. Aardwolves and bat-eared foxes emerge at sundown, and the endemic bird species provide both color and music. It's a very different world than the Kalahari. There are few permanent residents; this land is a stopover for a mass transient population in search of fresh pastures. And you'll be smack in the middle of their route."

Join your partner on the raised balcony for morning coffee, a baby elephant splashing in the nearby water and a herd of kudu trying to avoid the dangling trunk. Breakfast is served, poached eggs on toast as requested, and your guide explains all the possible options for today. You may wish to stay and watch the animal party developing beside your balcony. Or today might be a day for exploring. A traditional mokoro traverses the waterways, the skilled gondolier picking a careful route through raised snouts. Large hippo pods cover the blue channels; males bicker and push their way up the hierarchy, youngsters rampage into the water with comic maneuvers, and females aren't shy about leaving their scent. Crocodiles also patrol the water, occasionally snapping their jaws around the hind leg of something that splashed around a little too closely. Land safaris are equally hypnotic. Game drive through dense forests, weaving into eerie quietude and spot a pair of eyes in the branches. What is it? Even with binoculars the camouflage remains faithful. But then a tail flicks and a yawn reveals ferocious teeth. It's one of many leopards preparing to feast on the arriving migrating herds. Step, step, step, you traverse the forest edges on a walking safari. Giraffe are tall and elephants are huge. But that can only be truly appreciated when you're also standing at ground level. Quaint picnic spots offer lunch for two with a view and you return to camp to see a mischievous monkey hanging out on your chair. Don't worry, he's quick to move and you've nothing to be fearful of. Even when camping in the heart of lion country you're very safe. The locals have harmoniously lived with the Big Five for many, many centuries, so your guides know exactly how to pick up on animal behavior and clues. If there's evidence of exploratory leopards then the camp's location may be moved just a day before your arrival. A nighttime fire keeps the hyenas away. Other small tricks ensure your safety. So while this private escape is all about surrounding yourself with Botswana's wild nature, there isn't going to be any mishaps interrupting the romance."

Elephants will splash their trunks onto the water, antelope will drink happily, and you will immediately be surrounded by a conglomeration of animals. The Okavango always provides a dramatic safari introduction. You will transfer here by light aircraft from Maun, and it will be amazing how much wildlife you see just on the transfer to the camp. While safaris are considered adventurous vacations, they are also very relaxing. After a long flight to Botswana, there will be nothing better than lounging around the camp, watching wildlife at the river down below. By heading deep into the wilderness, you will not always need game drives or other safari activities. In the Okavango, you can safari from your camp.

        "title": "Moremi Game Reserve – Safari On Water and Land in Africa’s Oasis",
        "description": "Moremi Game Reserve is the game-rich heart of the Okavango Delta. Here, there is permanent water as well as Chief’s Island, which is the largest of all the Okavango islands. Resident wildlife is legendary, and it features four of the famous five, not including rhinos, along with large ungulate herds and many rare species such as the Sable antelope. This wildlife population is swelled by migratory arrivals from May to October and animals that follow the seasonal delta feast into Moremi. You will be staying on the northern tip of Chief’s Island, which is in an exclusive area with very few visitors. From here, you can fully explore both land and water. On a game drive, you will bump along sandy trails and lurch in and out of the mud. Elephants will block the way, and you must wait for them to pass. Giraffes will trek elegantly across floodplains. Deep in the grass, the guide will spot movement, so you drive closer. You will witness lions playfully rolling around with content stomachs. Later in the drive, you may see another pride. This time the lionesses will be prowling. Sticking close to the ground, they creep around the riverbanks in the stalk of prey. Baboons will shout out, betraying the lions, and alerting the zebra who quickly gallop off. Game drives can explore large tracts of Chief’s Island, and they are mostly about big and dangerous animals, which are the most sought-after species on a Botswana safari. It is very different in a mokoro canoe. A gondolier will guide you down narrow channels as lush hues dominate the scene. Reeds and high grass will provide hiding places, but if you look closely, you will be able to spot leopards that are hiding among the green. When these reeds clear, it is safer for animals to drink. You will travel past the open banks, looking up and across at gathering herds. Sometimes it will be buffalo, and at other times, giraffe or wildebeest. Hippos will dominate the channels, and the guide will skillfully steer around them. Mokoro canoes are the traditional means of getting around the Okavango, and as you travel in silence, they allow you to get very close to the wildlife. Motorboat safaris are like game drives on water. They cover large distances, traveling to different islands, and exploring where the rivers split. You will see zebra splashing in the shallows, and dazzling horns will distinguish the Sable antelope along the banks. Vultures and sea eagles will soar overhead, and red lechwe will be everywhere as large herds of them wade across the water. Sitatunga is usually a very difficult safari sighting, but they are another of the semi-aquatic species that thrive here and can be regularly encountered from a motorboat. During these two days, the program can be adapted to your interests, including all three of these activities. Even when you see the same animal species, it will be a very different experience depending on the activity, which is why the Okavango Delta is so unique."

        "title": "Kwando Concession – Intimate Connections in Northern Botswana",
        "description": "From the Okavango, you will fly north. Beneath you, there will be glimpses of arid plains, which are signs of the Kalahari Desert’s dry rule. Islands and waterways will slowly give way to floodplains and hints of woodland. Colors will change, and there will be nothing artificial down below with not a single road between the Okavango Delta and Kwando. Most of Southern Africa is wilderness, and Kwando is about as deep as you can get into this wilderness. Flying is the only way in from Chief’s Island, and you can sense exclusivity from the moment you land. At first, everything will seem silent, but your senses will be tuned to the wild, and tiny clues will alert you to wildlife. You may even have the pleasure of witnessing a herd of tsessebe, which will be a new species to add to your safari memories. Kwando is a private concession on a natural migratory route with elephants among those regularly traveling past the camps. Ecosystems blur together here, and floodplains attract the grazers, notably zebra, buffalo, and wildebeest. Waterways are populated by hippos and red lechwe, and swathes of woodland provide food for elephant and giraffe, including giant herds that arrive from Chobe. Out on a game drive, you will spot a Roan antelope with dramatic horns that point skywards and a black and white face that shimmers beneath the sun. Predators do extremely well here as the food menu is so diverse. Moving in large packs, these painted hunters cross the savanna. Kwando uses animal trackers who are local experts that radio in specific animal sightings. This means that you will not lose any time, and the guides can take you straight to the most impressive sightings. Trackers also know where wild dogs den, so encounters with these endangered predators are almost guaranteed. Another important aspect of the private concession is the opportunity to drive off the trail. This is essential for tracking predators, especially if they are on the move. So, when the wild dogs or lions move off into high grass, you will be able to follow the hunt and watch all the drama unfold."

        "description": "With two days in Kwando, the safari program will be flexible. Game drives mostly focus on the predators, which is something for which the concession is famous. Nighttime game drives will add to the excitement. You may stop in a clearing where the driver cuts the engine. It will be still and silent as your eyes adjust to grazers nearby. Suddenly, a troop of baboons starts shouting. Red lechwe panic and start galloping in all directions. The guide will turn a torch on now, and you will see the lions causing havoc as they hunt in the dark. Walking safaris can be just as thrilling as the game drives. Yes, this is a land that is populated by big cats and elephants, but it will be safe to walk on the open floodplains. Remember, guides have grown up here, and local tribes have always coexisted with potentially dangerous animals. They will lead the way, and nearby trackers will also radio in any signs of danger. With these walks, the focus will be on the ungulates and smaller animals. Just like in a mokoro, you are able to get close to these animals, and they will not see you as a threat and run away. So, one minute you will be walking, and the next minute you will realize that you are surrounded by zebra or wildebeest."

Elephants have bulldozed paths through the trees, and you will quickly lose count of these giants. During the dry season, there are around 100,000 elephants here, more than anywhere else in the world. Youngsters will march past with their trunks draggling along the ground, and adolescent males will lock their tusks in playful shows of power. Giraffes are impossible to miss here as they lean over the trees to eat from high branches, loping through gaps in the woodland. Hippos will also be a regular part of your journey, and you will see them out of the water, especially along the Chobe River. This landscape is dense and tangled with lots of undergrowth for animals to hide. It will be rare to encounter the predators. This will bring extreme close-up encounters with the giants. Often times, you will have to stop for ten minutes as herds cover the trail, blocking the way past. After a day of driving, you will rest at a lodge on the Chobe River, watching the raw, African sunset turn pachyderms into silhouetted figures."

You will have lunch and rest before an afternoon with the world’s largest continuous sheet of falling water. You will certainly hear it before you see it. A trail runs parallel to the falls on the Zimbabwean side. First, you will marvel at the chasm, watching rainbows spiral in the mist. Then, beneath the trees, you will see how the waterfall tumbles as great a surge of water that disappears into a narrow gorge. Much of the water returns as mist, raining down on the trail with the potential to drench you in seconds. At first, the trail is beneath rainforest, but when it opens out around the main falls, it will be impossible to stay dry. This is part of the experience, and there will be no questioning that Mosi-oa-Tunya is more appropriate than the English name."

Zebra, buffalo, impala, kudu and vast herds of red lechwe abound and whenever there are so many herbivores, there is usually a frenzy of predators. Lion pride will be easy to spot on your game drives, although they fight for the position of apex predator with the spotted hyena. Great cackles of them roam around, and they are efficient hunters, able to pinpoint a weaker member of a herd. In this private concession, you can go off the trail, and your driver will bring you up close to a leopard hanging in the tree. Watch for the packs of wild dog, another regular safari sight around your camp. Drama is enhanced at the water as all species must come to drink. In a traditional mokoro canoe, you will paddle down the channels for a serene journey past the abundant hippo pods. Some lagoons thrive with life as great herds of elephants trumpet their joy at a freshwater bath. Other lagoons are quiet, but then you may paddle down a hidden waterway and find one of the predators laying an ambush. As with all of your days on safari, your daily program is completely flexible and you will have a wide choice of activities. Local guides will discuss your options and use their intimate knowledge to seek out the safari scenes from your imagination. Another recommended activity is a motorboat journey for a chance to really explore the enormity of the Delta and catch a sight of the great herds."

Water cascades through between June and September bringing with it the migratory wanderers. Then there is the land, where the size of the herds defies the imagination. Buffalo congregate in the hundreds, perhaps thousands. But that does not stop the lions as a large pride harasses the buffalo for a dramatic theater that plays out on most evenings. Sometimes you will just sit back and watch it all from your verandah. After taking it all in, you will fly from Chief's Island to Duba Plains by wild aircraft, a journey that takes you over the central part of the Delta and really evokes the scale of its beauty. The diversified habitats allow for a range of activities. Game drives, walking safaris, and mokoro excursions are all available, and it is your safari so you can create a daily program that suits your preferences. You may prefer a full day out exploring, or perhaps some morning and afternoon activities with plenty of time to relax at the camp. Reminiscent of the old-world style of the 1920s, your camp accommodation ensures the perfect blend of luxury, service, and pure wilderness. Savored by wildlife connoisseurs and filmmakers, this is an intimate place to relax with each of the five suites having a private plunge pool alongside indoor and outdoor seating areas.

The zebra have certainly noticed the change in atmosphere, and you will not see any of them in your view, whereas yesterday, there were hundreds of them. This is the nature of the wild and of safari. Nothing is predictable, yet everything witnessed adds another layer to your impression of the wilderness. Duba Plains is the only camp operating within the concession, and there are only five suites, which means a maximum of ten visitors on these expressive plains. So few visitors will also maximize the quantity of wildlife as animals will naturally move away from areas of high traffic and noise. This is now your private playground, and you can explore however you choose.

        "description": "Zambia's flagship destination combines the big game with exquisite details. Vultures and jackals battle over discarded impala limbs, elephant tusks curl high above the vehicle, and spotted hyena are heard crackling in the dark. Even after many days of safari, you will still be taking in new sights. Among the South Luangwa specialists are the endemic Crawshay's zebra, Cookson's wildebeest, and Thornicroft giraffe. Vibrant markings set them out, and you will probably be enjoying them from your verandah. Each game drive will take you deep into the park and into a land that sees just a handful of daily visitors. Your time spent here will be a true savannah adventure as you bump and bound through the enormity of this pristine region. Complementing your day's thrills is your private villa at some of the most luxurious accommodations you could find. Grass and canvas walls ensure that you still get all of the wonderful sounds from the savannah and in South Luangwa, you can really explore from new angles. Nighttime drives are exhilarating as the darkened savannah is alive with leopards and unusual predators on the move. Walking safaris are exceptionally guided, and provide a whole different experience of South Luangwa. Your time spent here will be an exclusive experience that further enhances your harmony with nature, bringing you personal encounters with a range of wildlife."

South Luangwa provides the vast expressions of space and an expedition on the savannah, a place that really makes you feel alive. Lower Zambezi National Park is wonderfully tranquil, a destination for relaxed days along the water and tailored morning and afternoon activities. Your time spent on this riverside habitat is completely different from that of the Okavango. Here you will find duiker and bushbuck, along with monitor lizards and herds of the impressive eland. As you’ve seen, the African rivers tend to be packed with hippos, and the woodland is bulldozed down by the elephants, and you will see more of that in these regions as well. A light aircraft connects South Luangwa with Lower Zambezi, and you will touch down to the opulence of your next luxurious lodge"

Wildlife swims between the two, and you will watch the intrepid herds from your lodge, which is nestled perfectly on the banks of the river. Gaze out to admire the animals that roam around Mana Pools National Park and then turn around and head out in the vehicles to explore the Lower Zambezi National Park. There is never a dull moment in either, and the drama of buffalos clashing with lions will continue. Leopards lurk in the trees while the boat safaris bring many enchanting moments with the resident hippo pods. As always, the itinerary is dictated by you and shifted to your preferences and interests. Much like the Okavango, the birdlife is exceptional here and you will begin to pick out the subtle delights of the landscape. On a short safari, you will be focused on the biggest and most famous sights. But after two weeks, you will have become safari aficionados, admiring all of the wildlife that was easily missed at first glance. Kingfishers and cormorants share the panorama with elephants, while eagles swoop overhead as wildebeest march past your suite. You will have a delightful private verandah and a swimming pool that stands over the river, and there is a freestanding bath as you watch the hippos well into the early evening. Your accommodation is unashamedly decadent and the perfect place to bring two weeks of safari to a perfect conclusion."

How about the hidden escapism of Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens, where almost nobody will interrupt your walk through flowering orchids and exotic plants? Perhaps learning to surf or kite surf together at one of the city’s famous beaches? How about a poignant historical narrative with a boat trip to Robben Island, the place where Nelson Mandela was incarcerated for 18 years? Or perhaps a private yacht trip around Table Bay, taking in the endless natural charms from a unique ocean viewpoint? Another option is a day trip to Hermanus, probably the best place in the world to view whales from the land. Today is free for you to explore the city in a way that suits you and your style."

Every turn brings a new bay, a different vista, or an open stretch of white sand. Today’s private guided tour will take you along this famous road to Cape Point, the southwestern tip of Africa. Stop at countless viewpoints and photograph the remarkable scenery. Admire the huge jackass penguin colony at Boulders Beach, and time your arrival for a little swim with these indelible creatures. Explore hidden coves with nothing but pristine sand and the sounds of crashing waves. And stand together at the lighthouse on Cape Point, gazing out onto the ocean. If you set sail from here the next stop would be Antarctica. Just think about that. After your experience with the edge of the world, return to Cape Town via a different road and pass through quaint seaside towns en route.

        "title": "Moremi Game Reserve – The Start of Your Okavango Safari Adventure",
        "description": "The scale of Botswana defies the imagination. You’ll leave Cape Town on a scheduled morning flight to Maun, in the center of the country. Gaze out of the window as you cross hundreds of miles of copper-colored wilderness, the Kalahari Desert providing a hypnotic view that seems to go on and on. After landing in Maun you’ll be assisted onto a light aircraft that’s heading to Moremi Game Reserve. Suddenly the landscape has changed. Rich swathes of hippo-filled waters provide the new vistas as you fly into the heart of the Okavango Delta. Elephant herds can be spotted as the tiny plane swoops low, and the irrefutable flooding creeps along ancient channels. This mosaic of wetlands and tiny islands is going to be your base for the next seven days. Technically, all of Botswana is desert. The water that supplies the delta descends from the highlands of Angola. So the Okavango becomes a haven for wildlife. Hundreds of thousands migrate here for the abundant water, and each of your three bases is a favorite spot for a different cast of wild game. So how wild and remote is your adventure going to be? Well, it’s not uncommon for elephants to be patrolling the tiny airstrip, and as you approach Moremi the safari starts from the plane window. Settle into your luxury camp and head out on a game drive. In just a few hours you’ve left the city and been catapulted into a teeming world of lion prides, buffalo herds, and hippos wandering past your private verandah. First game drives are always packed with excitement. So allow yourself some delighted screams as Moremi’s abundant wildlife provides a thrillingly intimate experience."

        "description": "Wake in your luxury tent and listen to the sounds. Perhaps you’ll hear a hippo’s portentous snort or the rustling of an unidentified antelope in the trees. Listen again. Now there’s silence. Botswana benefits from space. You’re completely surrounded by wilderness, yet you’re nowhere near any of the other guests. And this isn’t camping in its strictest sense. You’ve got an en-suite Western bathroom with hot shower, thick wooden floors, and a huge king-sized bed. Open the zip and sit together on the private verandah. It was a herd of kudu that were making the noise outside. Or was it? Could the culprits have been the small elephant herd in the distance? These two days offer a myriad of private safari activities. Moremi is an ideal spot for safari first-timers, because it packs a variety of ecosystems into an easy to explore area. Take a wooden canoe down the verdant rivers, your guide effortlessly paddling past the hippo pods. Then hold each other tight as you game drive across the grasslands and spot your first lions. A large pride is sleeping beneath a tree but they’ve taken a keen interest…in you. Two lionesses approach the vehicle, gazing provocatively as you naturally take a step backwards. They can’t be more than two meters away and it seems they’re rather fond of something in the vehicle. Within a couple of moments, half the pride has left the tree and is approaching the truck. It seems they’re all quite keen on the shade beside the front wheel. You can customize your safari itinerary each day and combine a selection of activities. It’s very flexible, so there’s no need for dawn wake-up calls or too much exertion. Stop beside a popular elephant hang out, and enjoy a romantic picnic lunch as nature’s great mammals play before your eyes. Cruise across the picturesque floodplains and allow the Okavango waterways to provide a 360 degree panorama. You’re immersed in an untamed world and the safari continues into the evening and through the night. Enjoy a sumptuous candlelit dinner and watch the telltale silhouettes wander past in the distance. Lie in bed and keep listening to the sounds of the wild. Open your tent to the dreamy sight of a zebra herd. And be charmed by your own personal piece of the Okavango."

        "description": "The Okavango’s water isn’t just an attraction; it’s one of the world’s most effective conservation methods. Every year the delta almost triples in size and the floodplains become smothered in a liquid layer. This makes roads and settlements impossible, so secluded airstrips and light aircraft are practically the only ways to travel around. Depart from Moremi and touch-down in the exclusive Shinde Concession. This privately managed part of Okavango is able to play by a different set of rules. You’ll have two days to build a personalized itinerary that includes some of the world’s most unique safari experiences. Again, expect a luxury camp that offers unrivaled intimacy and space. And expect the wildlife world to unfold from your private verandah. This is lion country, but that doesn’t stop anyone from setting off on foot with an expert guide. Nervous footsteps take you into the forest and fresh animal prints reveal that elephants are nearby. Keep walking and marvel at the kudu and springbok that skip past just meters away. Don’t be scared, the concession’s excellent network of guides is constantly in contact. So if the big cats are prowling for a meal, your walking safari will head in a different direction. Everything seems so much bigger on foot; the herd of buffalo that block the trail, a graceful oryx that lurks in the trees, and a newly born elephant that weights more than you. Turn another corner and discover that you don’t even come up to a giraffe’s hip. Combine your walking safari with game drives and boat trips, each of them taking you into an abundant world of big cats. Leopards patrol the trees, yet it takes an excellent eye to spot them, even if they’re barely ten meters away. Lion prides and hyenas control the floodplains. Sometimes they’re sleepy and content, happy to wallow as you get close and take endless photos. Hungry cats offer a different experience. They gracefully prowl, slowly moving themselves into range. A hunt could take a whole afternoon, and it’s fascinating to watch it slowly unfurl. Yet it could happen in an instant. A lone impala strays too far from the herd and a flurry of dust disguises a last scream. It could also happen at night. Head off on a night-time safari and be guided by sounds. Stop. Listen. Something is just meters away. Your guide uses a single spotlight to illuminate the landscape. It’s buffalo, five of them chewing and staring with an almost fearful concentration. There’s a thrilling intimacy to being alone in the wilderness at night and there are few nocturnal worlds that offer as much magic."

        "description": "The Okavango Delta is one of Africa’s finest safari destinations for couples. Unlike other famous parks on the continent, you’ll find that the Okavango is blissfully devoid of other tourists. You’re not sharing a lion sighting with a dozen other safari trucks. Each luxury camp only caters to a small handful of guests. Then each destination in the Okavango is able to provide something new. Moremi provided the luxury safari introduction, Shinde offers different ways to explore, and the Khwai Concession is where you’ll spend two days on a more rustic mobile camping adventure. A light aircraft takes you from Shinde to Khwai, a private reserve that lies adjacent to the Okavango Delta. The Khwai River meanders through the landscape, and it’s one of the first permanent water sources that migrating herds come across as they maraud north. Crowding around the river are wildebeest, zebra, and Sable antelope, each of them drinking and splashing in the shallows. Lions briefly cause panic and everything disperses across the grassland, before they return later in the day for another sip. Giraffes and elephants cover the mopane forest, quickly demolishing the vegetation by uprooting trees and feeding off the canopy. Walking and night-time safaris compliment your game drives, and the vast floodplains make for exciting water adventures. A mobile camp doesn’t offer the same luxury as the two previous camps, although you’ll still have a raised comfortable bed, hot bucket outdoor showers, and a campfire to relax around. But many people might argue that this is how safari should be. The simplicity and mobility of the camp allows you to sleep in areas that very rarely see people. Wildlife doesn’t view you as a threat, so expect a succession of animals to approach and inspect the camp. You’re eating dinner and an elephant bull stands in the nearby trees. Then a hippo wanders past in the moonlight. Wake in the morning to find a kudu herd grazing beside your tent. Prints in the sand suggest a predator was also near. But was it a cheetah or leopard? On this mobile camping adventure, it’s just you, your partner, a skilled guide, and the untamed world of Botswana. Note that alternative accommodation options are available in Khwai Concession."

Mozambique’s Indian Ocean coastline is little more than white sand and palm trees, a 1500 mile expanse of idyllic beaches that can lull anyone into hibernation. Its centerpiece is the Bazaruto Archipelago, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that combines island wonders with pristine serenity. Fly from Maun to Johannesburg and connect to a Vilanculos bound flight. From here, a private helicopter ride takes you over to the exclusive Benguerra Island. Check in to your luxury beach villa and check out the azure waters that lap against the shore. Your front door opens onto white sand and, well, that’s about it other than a few palm trees. Savor the space and your own piece of island paradise, all the while keeping your eyes peeled for the sea turtles that quickly scurry along the shore. Whale sharks are regular visitors to these waters so the safari adventure has a few final treats to deliver. It’s easy to spend all your time doing nothing but enjoying the beach and your exclusive villa. This is lavish island living and it offers a utopian end to your vacation. However, the coastline’s bounty is easily explored. Take a romantic wooden dhow and cruise between the picture perfect sandbanks and endless tropical reefs. Step off the boat and wander across sand so fine that it squeaks underfoot. Enjoy a barbecue dinner on an uninhabited island and then cross the sand dunes to find lush blue lagoons. Every evening offers the same hypnotic scene. Gaze out onto the horizon, admire how the water gently reflects an evocative sunset, and watch a pod of dolphins slowly swim past."

Great rolling dunes and immense expanses of land with no other person in sight await you. There are dry valleys and seasonally inundated pans, as well as the larger salt pans of the Makgadikgadi Pan, but the only permanent river, the Okavango, is trapped in a delta in the northwest. Omuramba , ancient dry riverbeds, cross the Central Northern reaches of the Kalahari and provide standing pools of water during the rainy season. Despite its apparent aridity, the Kalahari supports a variety of flora. Acacia trees and other herbs and grasses are dotted about the sandy plains, and there are wondrous fruits such as the African horned cucumber, or jelly melon, which is endemic to the Kalahari. Your first evening will be spent around the campfire admiring the bright stars of the southern hemisphere and soaking in the majesty of your surroundings here in the desert."

Over the next few days you will explore two areas of a pristine wilderness in the Moremi Wildlife Reserve. The reserve comprises land that was selected for protection by the BaTawana community in 1962, and it was named after Chief Moremi. The area comprises a large expanse of the wetlands of the Okavango as well as a section known as the Mopane Tongue, and it is known for its beauty and diversity. There are sprawling floodplains, lagoons, fields of swaying papyrus, forests of mopane trees, clambering figs and knotted jackalberries, and the only thing more famous than the landscape is the abundance of wildlife. This luscious oasis has attracted herds of general game, along with the great predators that hunt them, and in this protected environment, where humans pose no risk to the animals, the wildlife are relaxed and unperturbed by the few lucky visitors who come armed only with their cameras. As you head out on morning and afternoon game drives in open 4x4 vehicles, keep your eyes peeled for some of the Okavango’s stars. There are red lechwe antelope to be found leaping across the watery channels, majestic herds of elephant making their unstoppable journeys from island to island with their infants trailing in their wake. You might see sleepy prides of lion that begin to stretch out and flex their muscles as they hungrily eye a nearby herd of impala, and a pack of wild dog sprinting through the undergrowth on a hunt for food. The combination of scenery and wildlife will leave you speechless. Back in camp you will be helping the team put together your home each night. Enjoy the camaraderie of the campsite by sitting around the fire, sharing stories and listening to the sounds of the bush."

After a long drink, the elephants will venture off to be replaced by another herd and then another. In Chobe, you do not even need to be on safari to see these giants. Giraffes will be just as conspicuous, and it can feel like you are continuously surrounded by the largest of these land mammals. Getting to Chobe does take time, and after landing in Maun, you will transfer to a safari flight where you will enjoy views over the Okavango Delta on your journey north.

Passing thousands of elephants, you will drive into the heart of the thick woodland where your camp can be found in a small clearing. Close your eyes and tune different senses into the landscape. Sounds will echo through, indicating proximity to a buffalo herd or grazing antelope. From Linyanti, which is the next destination, it will be essential to do your safari activities in the early morning and late afternoon while the animals are most active. Chobe is a little different as the pachyderms provide entertainment during all hours of the day. So, after a long flight, you will still have plenty of time to rest and refresh. Boat trips also provide downtime here. Cruising the Chobe River, you will pass great populations of elephants and hippos along with smaller antelope herds that drink tentatively. Just sit back on the boat’s outdoor deck and watch the show where you will experience the ease and tranquility of a water-based safari. You may spot lions here, but Chobe is not a destination for predators as the thick woodland and high grass makes them very difficult to spot. Instead, during these two days, you will have these giants as neighbors. Slowly, the supporting cast will reveal itself: zebra, wildebeest, buffalo, vervet and colobus monkeys, baboons, and antelope."

        "description": "By driving to Linyanti, you will experience how landscapes change. Woodland becomes punctured by swamps and open savannah, and lush rivers give way to muddy channels. The trails provide real adventure as they will prove to be slow and beautiful. Tracing a leisurely route, you will enter a block of private concessions that separate Chobe from Okavango. Wildlife moves freely between these two famous landscapes, using a channel that dissects Linyanti Reserve. After trekking this deep into the wild, you will notice the lack of other people and vehicles. These private concessions will be exclusive with access being restricted to those that are not actually staying in the concession. This means that you will experience no through traffic and a more peaceful environment for wildlife. Most of day four will be spent on a game drive into Linyanti with a nighttime game drive that will provide new encounters. Of course, you can not see very well when it is dark, but the smells will be evocative, and sounds will guide you onward. The driver will move slowly and stops regularly, cutting the engine so you can fully tune in to the wildlife around you. This time, the animals will come to you. So, stay still, silent, and a guide’s spotlight will spot out grazing herds. Then, you will turn a corner, and it will be impossible to predict what will be gazing up at you from the grass. Nighttime is also a good time to see cats on a hunt with leopards and lions prowling across the land. For days five and six, the safari program is flexible. Typically, you will be exploring in the early morning, late afternoon, and after dark. Photography hides provide secretive places to hang out, bringing dreamy close-ups with various animals. Elephants and giraffes still dominate, but you can feel how Linyanti is on a migratory route, especially when exploring around the Savuti Channel. Red lechwe will skip past in their hundreds, and beisa oryx will greet your eye. Buffalos will huff and puff throughout the evening, and zebra will gather in a blur of white and black stripes. All of this means food for the predators and Linyanti has one extra special highlight: wild dogs. Although increasingly endangered, these predators have a refuge in Linyanti. Guides know where multiple packs den, so it is easy to enjoy encounters. Trying to keep pace with the hunters, following a pack on a hunt will be magical. Here lies another advantage of safaris in private concession: you are permitted to travel off the trails. Going off-trail is essential for tracking the predators, both before and after a hunt. So, the guide will take you within a few meters of lions or close enough so you can spot leopard cubs that are high in a tree. Linyanti is one of Africa’s ultimate private concessions, and by going off the trails, it will be one of your most memorable animal encounters."

        "description": "Travel further south, and you will not be able to travel by land anymore. Water will take over as the Okavango Delta spills its bounty across the desert. Trails are washed away every year, so you must fly with dreamy views from the window as you transfer to the Moremi Game Reserve. Your camp will be located on the northern tip of Chief’s Island, which is the largest of all the Okavango islands. This central piece of the Delta offers food and water every month of the year, resulting in a remarkable wildlife density. The giants are here in vast numbers, and there are other mass populations as well, notably red lechwe and zebra. Year-round residents are joined by migratory arrivals, including herds that swim across channels to reach the island. From your camp, you can gaze out across the water. Wildlife hides in the surrounding trees. Nature sings a lullaby each evening, and there is nothing artificial here, and nothing to distort your connection to both the wilderness and wildlife. In Moremi, the safari will be adjusted to your preferences and interests. Game drives can be accompanied by short game walks, providing the trackers think it is safe enough. Motorboat and mokoro canoes will then bring a new angle. Over these two days, you will explore the land and waterways, piecing together both sides of the Okavango experience. By now, you will appreciate how each activity brings a different perspective. Game drives are a little noisy, so many animals will retreat from an approaching vehicle. This is not the case on walks or in a canoe as these activities often take you among herds, creating a 360-degree panorama of life. You will also appreciate how the safari always continues back at your camp. Each evening, you will sit around a fire, listening to the sounds, and watching animals drink from the river below."

Seasonal flooding makes the landscape even more iconic, forming a labyrinth of narrow channels. There are no roads, and there is hardly even any land, just a handful of small islands that are populated by grazers and monkeys. This is the classic Okavango Delta landscape and safari experience with all the activities taking place on or in the water. New animals like sitatunga will now begin to blur into the landscape, and hippos can be seen more regularly, but in smaller pods. Motorboat rides are the equivalent to game drives, covering relatively large areas while following locations that have been radioed by trackers. Mokoro canoes are how indigenous people travel. Constructed from a single tree, these canoes are pushed down the channels by gondoliers. They are incredibly silent and serene, drifting past lush reeds and beneath palm trees. Such peaceful travel does not have an impact on animals. Sometimes, you will be just five meters away from all kinds of animals. Sometimes a lioness will peer at you with one open eye as she lounges on the bank. With water as a barrier, a mokoro means real intimacy, especially as you have no idea what will be hiding around each bend in the delta."

The landscape will turn white as you touch down beside the pans. There was once a lake the size of Switzerland here, and today, there is no longer any water, just a mirage of shimmering salt. In such a barren place, it is difficult for animals to thrive, but you do not come here for wildlife, you come to Nxai Pan for silence and solitude. This incredibly peaceful experience will give you the opportunity to reflect on all the safari excursions that you have experienced so far. The camp peers across the plains and the mirage will seem endless. You can explore on an all-terrain vehicle, following a handful of paths that separate the pans. Occasionally, a lone elephant will wander past. Out in the salt, you will come across meerkats, poking their heads from the ground. Mostly, there will be nothing, and such a space will produce a unique state of mind. Space dominates at nighttime as well, and the desert stars extend above you as your campfire crackles. After ten days on your safari, it will always seem like a shame to return to the modern world. Staying on Nxai Pan will keep you firmly in the wilderness, ensuring that you have some alone time before returning home."

        "title": "Khwai Concession – Introductions to the Okavango Floodplains",
        "description": "The iconic Okavango impression is of flooded channels and marooned islands, of a landscape where hippos barge past elephants on the banks. It's this postcard image that you find at the Khwai Concession, one of the oldest gazetted areas within the Delta ecosystem. For over 30 years, your river lodge has provided a luxurious base within its local concession, with canvas chalets dotted amongst leadwood trees. Space is paramount here, with each chalet linked by a long wooden walkway above the floodplain. Delightful views come from your private verandah, an opulent en-suite bathroom is nothing like preconceptions of Africa, and the central area includes a lounge, bar, and stylish dining area. Today you land at Maun International Airport, where you're assisted in transferring to a light aircraft. Part of your camp's exclusivity is its inaccessibility. You cruise above the channels, taking in surreal expressions of nature. Even from the air, the Delta extends beyond the horizon in every direction. Land at your lodge in the late afternoon, where you enjoy a spa treatment on your verandah. As a masseuse alleviates any travel aches, you're getting introduced to the Okavango floodplains, gazing out at passing elephant herds and congregations of wild antelopes. The evening is at your leisure, with dinner beneath the stars in the main part of the camp."

        "title": "Khwai Concession – Game Drives Through the Okavango",
        "description": "After a light breakfast, you're out on a game drive in an open-sided vehicle. Buffalo graze beside the track, a mass of black staring you right back in the eye. Beneath a tree, you spot a lion pride, complete with playful cubs interrupting their mother's sleep. Drive along the riverbank and hippos are everywhere, some opening their jaws with an iconic yawn. Next, it's a zebra herd, cantering beneath trees where giraffes feed. A first game drive is packed with new impressions and today is all about trying to take them all in. You return to the lodge by late morning, enjoying a hearty brunch before a serene few hours resting. Then a second game drive leaves after afternoon tea, staying out until the last light of the day is fading away. These game drives will explore both Khwai Concession and the adjacent Moremi Game Reserve."

        "title": "Moremi Game Reserve – Luxury in the Wild Heart of the Okavango",
        "description": "Fly above the Delta, following the serpentine curves of the water. Channels wind past marooned sandbanks while large herds dot the landscape. It's a short flight to the northwestern edge of Chief's Island, where another of Botswana's flagship lodges awaits. Elevated wooden walkways lead you to a delightful suite, where comfy sofas are perfect for sitting back and watching the wildlife pass by. Plunge pools offer a unique place to view the big game and your suite is raised far off the ground, providing an extra layer of reassurance given the density of wild animals found nearby. Located on the Moremi Game Reserve, rather than its own concession, but the remarkable abundance of wildlife helps it maintain an exclusive feel: with so much to see, visitors are widely spread. This is one of the Okavango's most fertile stretches, and the game drives provide insatiable encounters with predators, especially lions. On an afternoon excursion, you approach a pride. The male yawns, then drifts to sleep with one eye open. Three lionesses elegantly wake up, wandering slowly to the safari vehicle before stretching out in the shade of the back wheel. At the channel, you see another pride drinking, the males' flowing manes gently reflected in the water. Then the iconic sight, lionesses lurking in the grass as they stalk a small herd of red sitatunga. Stop. Be patient. And watch the scene slowly unfold: lions stalking with menace, antelope grazing with trepidation, an explosion of dust as the hunt takes place and a young calf is separated from the herd. After the drama of the wild, your lodge provides an indelible base to bring the heartbeat down."

        "title": "Moremi Game Reserve – Immersed in the Wilderness",
        "description": "An opulent lodge-style accommodation offers a serene counterpoint to the wilderness. For example, this morning you head off at dawn, exploring when the Okavango is at its most vibrant. Hippos are out of the water, munching across the grasslands. Vervet monkeys are squawking, alerting everyone to a leopard that's hiding nearby. Very rare black rhinos might be seen, the bashful mammals grazing openly in the sunrise light. These sights are never standalone. Everything is interacting, creating a theater that's defined by drama. But return to the lodge and all is calm. Animals still flicker past, but the theater is one of elegance and tranquility. You get to rest and relax, savoring the escapism of the Okavango. Contemporary luxury ensures you have every possible comfort. And then a zebra herd grazes beneath your suite, a reminder that you are charmingly immersed in the wilderness. In the afternoon, you head out on a second game drive, which is followed by another relaxed dinner at the lodge."

        "title": "Vumbura Reserve – Crossing the Okavango By Boat",
        "description": "The Okavango Delta can be seen from space, its lush blue floodplains stretching far across the Kalahari Desert. Most of it is inaccessible. Sandbanks are isolated, leaving behind marooned herds. Palm islands are created, while wild palm plantations are slowly submerged. It's majestic when seen from the air; it's bafflingly complex when discovered from the water. Today, you travel by motorboat to the Duba Plains, crossing the water to the northern fringes of the Okavango. Zebra spray up water as they gallop on the banks, hippo pods fill the channels with their boisterous antics, and wandering nomads rise above the surrounding grasslands. You get a true sense of how big and expressive the Okavango really is. It's roughly a three-hour journey, but don't think of this as a transfer. Instead, it's a vivid Okavango motorboat safari. Your next property is located in the private Vumbura Reserve, amidst a landscape of floodplains, woodland, and tiny palm islands. A modern luxury tent lodge that evokes classic African safari styles of the 1920s, all is designed to blend with the surrounding trees, each tent has a private plunge pool, large wooden deck, and a covered sala (pavilion) for private dining. There are only five luxury tents, so an air of exclusivity and service is always maintained, especially when drinks are served as the sun disappears over the Okavango. You should arrive at lunchtime before the afternoon provides a game drive through the private reserve."

        "title": "Vumbura Reserve – Luxury Safari and Diverse Activities",
        "description": "Wildlife is everything in Vumbura. Lionesses hide away their cubs before hunting for buffalo. Impala and tsessebe elegantly grace the plains. Pink pelicans and red-billed hornbills provide additional color. The open plains are ideal for cheetah and wild dogs, relatively rare hunters that provide some of safari's most hypnotic sights. Spotted hyenas scurry past while leopards drape their spots across the woodland. Elephants, giraffe, crocodiles, kudu, wildebeest; Vumbura always impresses with its variety and density of wildlife. After six days on safari, coming here ensures that you're constantly enjoying fresh sights. This is complemented by the variety of activities. There are few restrictions in a private reserve, so you can create a personal program from the menu of excursions. Short game walks are accompanied by armed trackers, getting you thrillingly close to the plains' antelopes. Silently explore in a mokoro , a traditional wooden canoe that's paddled along the channels. Or continue yesterday's experience with a motorboat safari. Or you can stay out into the evening on a nighttime game drive, admiring nocturnal animals that emerge from their dens. At this camp, you get to try it all, each activity offering a new atmosphere and experience in the same landscape."

        "title": "Selinda Concession – Exclusivity and Opulence in the Selinda Reserve",
        "description": "After the flight, you take an afternoon game drive through the concession, aquatinting yourself with a new landscape, one that's dominated by giants. Elephant and giraffe are everywhere while lions continue to provide their daily charm. Towards the late afternoon, you cruise ona private pontoon, a relaxed sunset boat journey that brings intimacy with hippos, elephants, and a wide variety of birdlife. A bateleur eagle swoops overhead while guineafowl roost in jackalberry trees. This sunset boat cruise is available on each of your days in Selinda and the camp only has eight guests, so the activities always have an air of exclusivity.

        "title": "Selinda Concession – Game Drives and Game Walks",
        "description": "The Selinda Concession is at a crossroads, connecting the diverse realms of the Okavango and Chobe. After eight days on safari, you already know a lot about the Delta, about how the water brings diverse life to the Kalahari Desert. To the south and west of Selinda lies the Okavango Delta, while to the north and east is Chobe National Park, a thick woodland ecosystem that's a favorite of the pachyderms. Chobe is home to Africa's largest elephant population, along with vast numbers of other forest dwellers. Connecting these two ecosystems is the Magwegqana Spillway, a sunken landscape of savannah, sporadic islands, and diverse vegetation. It's a natural migration route, while also a bountiful home for a wide number of species. And it's the heart of the Selinda Concession. So even after nine or ten days of safari, you'll keep seeing new sights. Just like in Vumbura, the private concession enables you to create a flexible itinerary, with private game walks and drives in the day and night. Epic predator-prey encounters play out, particularly between lion prides and buffalo. The lions attack but the herd responds, charging in unison, their rumbling hooves scaring off the hunters. Resident leopards provide daily delight while two wild dog packs chase down large herds of zebra. Elephant calves are everywhere, swinging their trunks as they surround the safari vehicle with charm. Sometimes it's hard to keep track, with so many giants in a relatively compact area. Safari here also provides a contrast to your other Okavango stops as you can head deep into vast woodland. The thrills increase as the visibility decreases. Sounds echo through the trees and then you turn a corner to find their origin: a 50-strong elephant herd bashing their rumps against the trunks, trying to dislodge the fruit."

In the middle of the morning, you'll be transferred to the Selinda airstrip for a flight across the Okavango to Maun, where a representative assists in transferring you to your international departure."
