        "description": "Volcanic Hike + Champagne Snorkel – featuring hiking along Segment 1 of the Waitukubuli National Trail. This easy hike is through one of the more volcanic areas rich in island heritage, and once well known for large scale sugarcane, citrus and cocoa production - today overgrown and wild, and going past fruit trees and village life, provides spectacular views, and beach time/local spa experience with cold drinks. Your day begins with a site seeing drive along the south-west coast to the southern community of Soufriere, where you begin our walk up the valley along an old estate road providing some insight into conditions in times of estate operations. Throughout, fruit and other trees dwarf the access. The route alternates between the old rocky road, narrow farm trails, and the main roadway eventually emerging at the mountain community of Gallion, where you stop for a photo opportunity from our view point perched above the south-western coastline. Our hike continues for another half hour – all downhill and along the old winding and stony access trail that connects Gallion to the Soufriere-Scotts Head highway. There we re-board our tour bus and continue onto Champagne beach for your shore snorkel adventure. There you will see that Dominica is as beautiful underwater as it is above ground. Much like swimming in a glass of champagne and through a stream of bubbles that rises from a submerged volcanic vent in the sea floor, you will explore this very unique landform. See juvenile and adult fish as well as colorful sponge and coral growths. Picnic lunch ends the day’s adventure."

        "description": "Wet and Rugged Dominica - to experience the Wild Roseau Valley (with combinations of Middleham Fall, the Fresh Water Lake, and Titou Gorge) Today’s outing will take you to the Morne Trois Pitons National Park UNESCO accredited World Heritage Site, and is the perfect introduction to our island geography and our picturesque landscapes and exotic flora and fauna. Our outdoor adventure begins at the Middleham Waterfall Visitor Facility, from where we begin our one- hour long trek to the waterfall. The trek is along a well-manicured trail through thick primary rainforest that runs along the Segment route 4 of the Waitukubuli National Trail. The terrain is undulating and rises and dips with the topography of the land, and will challenge even avid walkers in a few sections. From the visitor center the worn trail rises and winds through the dense forest over streams before emerging at the Middleham Falls. The Middleham waterfall is the tallest on island and towers to approximately 200 feet high. It has a deep basin that allows the adventurous to enjoy a well-earned cooling swim. Once back at the Visitor Facility we continue to the community of Laudat and to the Fresh Water Lake. This lake sits in the backdrop of the greenery and mist and in the crispness of the clean mountain breeze. At this serene and tranquil location there is time to explore and enjoy the surroundings and to have a closer view of the lake, and the hot springs that cascade just off the main roadway closer to the Boeri Lake Trail entrance. Picnic lunch breaks the routine of the day. Next we head for the Titou Gorge for our second swim of the day - a challenging up stream one through a narrow channel that eventually opens up into a cascade almost 75 meters later. Translated literally to mean little throat, this adventure occurs up a crevasse through an opening in the rock, and is guaranteed to provide an adrenalin rush. Guests will be required to wear a life vest for this swim."

        "description": "Expedition to the Boiling Lake The world’s largest boiling lake is actually a flooded fumarole, a crack through which gases escape from the molten lava below, rather than a volcanic crater. The natural basin of the Boiling Lake collects the rainfall from the surrounding hills and from two small streams which empty into the lake. The water seeps through the porous bottom to the hot lava below where it is trapped and heated to boiling point. The lake is approximately 60 meters from end to end. The trek to the lake is through lush forest, over sharp ridges, and encounters volcanic rivers, streams and boiling mud. The streams vary in colour from normal clear water to milky blue, black, white, yellow and orange. Steam and sulphur fumes increase the closer you get. The trail itself is around eight miles. It is a three-hour walk each way, and that amount of time should be allowed for. On our return there is the option to stop at the Titou Gorge for a swimming exploration up this frigid island-treasure. (The decision to explore the Titou Gorge will be subject to the weather as well as the condition of the hikers). Little Throat is the literal translation for Titou Gorge - a narrow ravine carved into the rocks by the river. This breath-taking upstream swim through this cave-like setting lit by rays of sunlight streaking through the forest is absolutely astounding and refreshing! At the top of the gorge is a small waterfall. This exploration is done with the use of life vests."

A 30 minute site seeing drive will lead past farm lands and stretches of verdant fields to the deeply rural community of Delices and to the trail head of the Victoria Falls, located at Zion Valley. Probably the most impressive falls on the island, the trail begins at La Riviere Blanche (the White River), and crosses the river and gorge many times. As it heads further up-stream visitors have to scramble and climb over large boulders before eventually reaching the base of the waterfall, where an invigorating swim awaits. Once done, it is back downstream with a stop at the Rastafarian homestead of Moses James for picnic lunch and great conversation. Next, we continue onto the village of La Plaine for our adventure to the Sari Sari falls. The Sari Sari Waterfall is one of Dominica's more famous falls, and the 40- minute fun adventure is through open cultivated land and secondary forests, and along thin ledges with multiple river crossings and clambering over huge rocks. The cooling dip in this treasure is just as exciting as the up-river adventure"

        "description": "Hiking the Waitukubuli National Trail Today we will explore the Waitukubuli National Trail and walk from Colihaut Heights to Ros Castle along an old estate road that leads us through forest and fertile farmland. In the early years of the 19th century, French coffee planters owned this area, and much of the once heavy forest green canopy is recovering from the impact of Hurricane Maria which ravaged the area in 2017. Our route takes us past the trail head of Morne Diablotin, Dominica’s highest mountain. Beyond this the trail maneuvers with slow and winding decent through an agricultural belt once known for citrus and coffee. The track is still surrounded by citrus orchards, alongside banana and plantain. The estate trail deteriorates into a narrow footpath that winds down through thick dry forest. Along the way we will hear the Amazona Parrots the Jaco and Sisserou screeching and calling from the trees. In places the descent is steep and tree roots cross the trail, and ropes are available to help walkers in navigating the trail. At Ros Castle our walk ends with an opportunity for a cooling swim in the powerful Picard River. There we enjoy packed lunches. Next we walk out along the old estate road to the main Picard Highway. Free time at the beach ends the day."

        "description": "Rural Culture and Heritage Today will provide an opportunity to explore and enjoy an important route that was used by the indigenous people the Kalinago, to connect the northern and southern sections along the east coast. Our transfer we take us out of Roseau up through the central mountain range and then down to the Atlantic east coast where we continue south and through an area that many consider to be the most beautiful part of Dominica. From the hotel our first stop will be the Emerald Pool. An attractive area of rainforest with a river, small waterfall and excellent bathing pool that appears bright green in the tree-filtered sunlight, the Emerald Pool is a must-enjoy for visitors to Dominica, and we strongly encourage you to plan to for a cooling dip in this island treasure. From here we continue due east first to the village of Castle Bruce, and then south along the coast, and through a part of Dominica that is deeply rural, rich in culture and tradition, and not normally exposed to visitors and tourism. We will be sure to have eaten cassava, or arrowroot, and today we will visit a cassava processing plant to see how the tuber makes its way from the ground to our plates. With luck we may also have the chance to visit a local bay oil distillery (if in operation) to see the leaves of the aromatic bay trees being distilled to make oil. At Petite Soufriere the last village along the roadway, we begin our hike along the coast to the Rosalie Estate along an old estate trail, once used by the Kalinago Indians and still used by farmers today.

This side of the island has traditionally been agricultural and is deeply rooted in culture. We depart the hotel mid-morning for the site seeing drive that will take us deeper into the south east. We will drive through areas that have been traditionally cultivated in bananas – today much have been overgrown as shifting fortunes and global economics impart hardship and misfortune on small scale agriculture in the rural landscapes. We will veer of the main highway and venture into some of the local villages and possibly engage the locals in conversation along the way. The highlight of our day will be our visit to Zion Valley located in the community of Delices. Named by the Rastafarian community who live in the area, this small homestead can be considered off the grid, and sits on the banks of the White River and the Jack River. Here there are options for private swimming time either in the White River or Jack River. With luck we may get to meet Moses the family patriarch, who is a very colorful character, and has much to share about his life experiences, his homestead, Rastafarianism, and local flora of the area. Picnic lunch will be served at the riverside. Once done, we start our return journey to our hotel."

Your first stop will be the Cabrits National Park and you visit Fort Shirley ruins - an18th century garrison which once housed 600 soldiers and which provides important examples of British defense systems. This large stone fort has its own history and the site provides for walking along the old forest trails and enjoying excellent panoramic viewing of Prince Rupert Bay and surroundings.

For bird watchers or nature-lovers this boat-trip is perfect. Colorful blooms, crabs, fish, birds, and iguanas punctuate the tranquil journey. This peaceful ride is guaranteed to rejuvenate your senses and relax you! The tour has 2 main highlights – a stop at the local bar at the top of the river for a refreshing drink, and a visit to the House of Calypso, the Old Witch from the Pirates of the Caribbean 2 Movie. The house is still along the banks of the river where parts of the movie were filmed more than 10 years ago. From here you re-board your bus and veer deeper into the north east, and into the foothills of Morne Aux Diables. At the Cold Soufriere we will see cold bubbling sulphur pools – the only of its kind in the entire world. Very distinct and spectacular landforms, these natural wonders add further mystery to the story of Waitukubuli, and further explain why Dominica is indeed the Nature Island of the Caribbean. Within this mountain crater setting there will be free time for relaxation and picnic lunch. We continue on our journey along the lonely and winding northern link road meandering through the communities of Penville and Vieille Case with opportunities for viewing rural communities and the impact of how time and western influences have impacted the local village architecture. Our final feature of the day’s adventure will be a visit to a local flower farm which showcases blooms and varieties of colorful plants and flowers. Meet the owners of this botanical garden and hear their stories, and learn how they have been able to make their passion and love, their livelihood."
