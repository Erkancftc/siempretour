Afternoon visit Karnak Temple This morning, we embark on a journey to the West Bank of Luxor, a realm steeped in ancient history and shrouded in the mystique of pharaohs and their eternal resting places.

We'll venture into several of these tombs, marvelling at the vibrant hieroglyphs and intricate paintings that adorn their walls. These ancient chambers continue to reveal their secrets to archaeologists, making the Valley of the Kings one of the most significant archaeological sites in the world.

In the afternoon, we cross back to the East Bank to explore the sprawling complex of Karnak Temple. Dedicated to the Theban Triad of Amun, Mut, and Khonsu, Karnak is a masterpiece of ancient Egyptian architecture. We'll wander through its vast courtyards, admire its towering columns, and decipher the intricate carvings that adorn its walls.
