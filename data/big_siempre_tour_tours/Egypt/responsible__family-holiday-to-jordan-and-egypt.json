  "generalInfo": "Egypt and Jordan are home to some of the most incredible sites anywhere in the world, a treasure trove of ancient cities, dramatic temples and vast tombs. Who can fail to be awed by the majesty of the Pyramids, the looming columns of Karnak Temple and the carved facades of Petra?<br/><br/>There is also a remarkable variety of scenery ranging from the lush fields that line the banks of the Nile to the huge sandstone outcrops of Wadi Rum and the stunning mountains of the Dana Nature Reserve. Explore these fields on the back of a sturdy donkey as it slowly plods its way towards the Valley of the Kings or from the deck of a felucca as you glide along the Nile; admire the rocky majesty of Wadi Rum from the back of a (burping grumpy) camel as it ambles through the desert; be awed by the mountains of Dana as you follow quiet paths on a hike through the nature reserve. <br/><br/>Jordan and Egypt are also home to some of the most friendly people in the Middle East and you will be welcomed with open arms throughout your stay. Combine this with delicious food, pretty much guaranteed sunshine for most of the year, and very competitive prices, and you could just have your perfect family holiday!",
