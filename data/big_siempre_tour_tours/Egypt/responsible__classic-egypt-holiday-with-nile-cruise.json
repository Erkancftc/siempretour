  "generalInfo": "Our fully escorted trip takes you from Cairo to Aswan and Luxor, visiting some of the most iconic landmarks along the Nile while also including experiences that give you an insight into modern-day Egypt. <br/><br/>In Cairo you’ll spend most of your time outside the city centre, staying in a hotel that’s convenient both for admiring the Great Pyramids of Giza and the Sphinx, plus the Egyptian Museum. Home to many of the most spectacular antiquities ever found, the museum now holds virtually the entire collection of the treasures found in Tutankhamun’s tomb.<br/><br/>After a free morning to explore the capital at your leisure (or return to see more of the Egyptian Museum), you’ll board the overnight train to Aswan. Many choose to make this journey by plane, but the train is a comfortable and convenient way to travel, arriving in time for you to spend a morning at the Philae Temple. This evening, a cultural highlight, as you are welcomed into the home of a local family that your tour operator has known for many years, to share a Nubian meal and learn about each other’s lives.<br/><br/>On the next day, board a luxurious small ship as you embark on a cruise to Luxor. The ship’s superb amenities include a swimming pool and restaurant – both ideal for taking in views along the Nile. Optional activities along the way include riding a camel to the ancient St Simeon’s Monastery out in the desert, or a short sailing in a traditional felucca. But for many travellers, the pleasure in cruising the Nile is simply watching Egyptian life go by along the banks of the river.<br/><br/>On the third afternoon ,you arrive in Luxor where you may like to take in the famous Sound and Light Show at Karnak Temple in the evening. But it is the final day, as you enter the Valley of the Kings, that will really take your breath away. Visit no fewer than three tombs to learn how Egyptian pharaohs lived, died and were buried, and what they took with them into the next life.",

      "title": "Join trip Cairo",
      "description": ": Our tour starts today in Cairo, Egypt's bustling capital sitting on the banks of the River Nile. This sprawling metropolis is a jumble of modern buildings, ancient landmarks and maze-like streets, offering the best Pharaonic, Coptic and Islamic sites in Egypt. There are no activities planned today, so you're free to arrive in Cairo at any time. If you'd like an airport transfer today, you'll need to arrive into Cairo International Airport (CAI), which is a 30 to 45-minute drive to the hotel. At 6pm, our tour leader will meet you in the hotel reception for a welcome meeting. If you want to, there'll be the chance to go out for dinner afterwards. If you arrive later, our tour leader will catch you up at a later point. If your flight arrives earlier in the day, perhaps you might like to catch your first glimpse of the mighty Nile River, visit the capital's medieval market at Khan el Khalili or cross the river to take a walk down the Nile promenade. Egyptians are warm and welcoming to visitors, so you're sure to get an authentic experience wherever you wander."

      "title": "In Cairo; visit the Pyramids, Sphinx and the spectacular new Grand Egyptian Museum",
      "description": ": This morning, we'll make our way to Giza, where we'll see the pyramids and sphinx; among the most impressive man-made spectacles in the world. We'll explore the pyramid complex, which includes the sphinx, a crouching lion with a human head carved from solid rock and the splendid Granite Temple, with a local guide. We'll then head to the spectacular new Egyptian Museum in Giza; a repository of over 100,000 items encompassing all aspects of ancient Egyptian life, including ornate jewellery, caskets and towering granite statues and mummified remains. At the time of writing there are twelve galleries open, inlcuding the remarkable golden treasures of Tutankhamun. The Grand Egyptian Museum is a wonderful destination in itself, its sheer size and beautiful architectural design has deservedly drawn acclaim worldwide. After our tour there is time to have lunch in one of the many restaurants in the museum. Returning to our hotel in the city centre, there will be time to take a stroll to visit the capital's medieval market at Khan el Khalili, have a dip in the pool or relax on the rooftop terrace overlooking the Nile."

      "title": "Free day in Cairo to explore, overnight train to Aswan",
      "description": ": This morning there is the opportunity to visit Saqqara, the impressive steppe pyramid/necropolis of Zozer (Djoser), the earliest of the pyramids of Egypt. In the afternoon, you can take a trip to Islamic Cairo to visit the illustrious Citadel, one of Saladin's many strongholds during the Crusades. There will also be the chance to enter one or more of the medieval mosques of Cairo, where there is a requirement to dress modestly with looser fitting clothing that covers the arms and legs. Shorts or sleeveless shirts are not permitted. Please see the Budgeting & packing section for more details. This evening, we'll depart for Aswan on an overnight train. We use the best available sleeper compartments, with two berth cabins, each containing a bench seat which converts into bunk beds. Whilst the service is designated as first class, the standard is not comparable with European first-class train travel. Dinner and breakfast are delivered by the carriage steward directly to you but it's also worth purchasing some snacks before you board."

      "title": "In Aswan; tour of the Philae Temple and optional Nubian village dinner",
      "description": ": Aswan is Egypt's most southerly city, traditionally regarded as the frontier post of Upper Egypt. Sited on the east bank, it stands just below the First Cataract and is the meeting point of Arab culture with Nubia and black Africa. Today, we'll explore Aswan and the surrounding area. Our early arrival allows us time to take an excursion to the Philae Temple marooned on a picturesque island, having been relocated when the original site was flooded following the completion of the Aswan dam. The temple is adorned with beautifully carved pylons containing some of Egypt's finest carvings. We'll travel to the island and back on a small motorboat. Returning to our hotel around lunchtime, the afternoon is free to relax, use the hotel pool located on the banks of the Nile or undertake some independent sightseeing. The Nubian bazaar a short walk away from our hotel in the centre of Aswan is well worth a visit, the bazaar contains many unusual stalls including perfume shops and a papyrus institute. It's also possible to take an optional tour of the Aswan High Dam completed in 1970 and the unfinished obelisk. This evening there will be the opportunity to take a motorboat journey to a traditional Nubian village for a home-cooked dinner with a local family."

      "title": "Optional excursion to Abu Simbel, Board cruise boat",
      "description": ": Today you might like to take a very early morning trip by bus to the fabulous rock-hewn temple of Abu Simbel. Cut into the rock face, this enormous structure was raised 61 metres/200 feet to save it from floods created by the Aswan High Dam. The 20-metre/65-foot high statues represent Ramses II, known as the great builder. We'll have two hours to explore the famous site before returning to Aswan and boarding our river cruise boat, home for the next three nights. Nile Riverboat cruise On board our cruise, you'll be travelling in style. Typically accommodating around 130 guests, accommodation is in comfortable twin or double en suite cabins with large panoramic windows offering views of life carrying on along the Nile River. The cabins are well appointed with a TV, fridge, air conditioning and WiFi (at an extra cost). The interior also features several large communal areas; the lounge and bar is a great place to socialise with other passengers. There's also a large restaurant, a reading area and several shops on board. There'll be evening entertainment one night of our cruise, plus the top deck has a large seating area with a swimming pool where you can relax with views over the Nile. We'll board just in time for lunch, and then the afternoon is free for you to relax onboard. Alternatively, you could explore Aswan's busy market or perhaps have afternoon tea at the Old Cataract Hotel (dress code applies) where Agatha Christie wrote her novel Death on the Nile. This evening's meal is served back onboard."

      "title": "Cruise down the Nile River towards Kom Ombo Temple",
      "description": ": After breakfast, there is an optional trip on a traditional felucca boat to sail around the Aswan islands including a visit to the Botanical Gardens. We'll return in time for our cruise to begin and start sailing, heading north (downstream) towards Kom Ombo where we'll disembark. Situated on the banks of the river, this temple is particularly unique because it's dedicated to two gods; Haroeris and Sobek, the crocodile god. It's thought that this part of the Nile used to have a large crocodile population, hence the dedication to Sobek. This evening, we'll continue upstream to Edfu city where we'll stay overnight."

      "title": "Continue to cruise up the Nile towards Luxor",
      "description": ": Continuing our cruise towards Luxor today, we'll have a scheduled two-hour stop at the Temple of Edfu after breakfast. The only mode of transport to get from the dock to Edfu Temple (a journey of just over 1 kilometre/0.7 miles) is by locally owned and controlled horse-drawn caleshes. Unfortunately, we've received feedback that the condition and treatment of these horses fall well below the standards set out in our Animal Protection Policy and efforts to support improvements have been unsuccessful. With this in mind, we encourage you to opt out of visiting Edfu Temple so as not to endorse these poor welfare standards. If you wish to visit the temple, please speak to your tour leader who can arrange this for you. After our stop, we'll set sail once again for Luxor, arriving in the late afternoon. The evening is free so you can wander around the souks and busy streets before dinner. Later this evening, there is the opportunity to experience the sound and light show at Karnak Temple, an incredible display where Karnak and the story of Egypt comes alive, alternatively, it's possible to visit the Luxor Museum or the Luxor Mummification Museum which is open until 9pm."

      "title": "Cruise ends in Luxor, visit Karnak Temple",
      "description": ": This morning, we'll disembark for the final time and drop our bags at the hotel before visiting the Temple of Amun at Karnak, the labour of numerous pharaohs. Built around 2000 BC, this vast temple was still in progress during Cleopatra's reign during the 1st century BC. After a busy few days, this afternoon is free for you to relax. It's possible to visit the Luxor Museum and the Luxor Mummification Museum if you didn't visit yesterday, both are within walking distance from our hotel. Today, we'll also have the chance to see Luxor from above with an optional hot air balloon ride over Luxor, the Valley of the Kings and the Temples of Antiquities on the West Bank. If you'd like to opt in, pick up will be from your boat between 0430 and 0500. Please see the Budgeting and packing section for more details."

      "title": "Explore the West Bank, Habu temple and Valley of the Kings",
      "description": ": Arguably Egypt's most well-known site, this morning we'll have an early start to visit the world-famous Valley of the Kings, most famous for being the burial site of Tutankhamun, discovered in 1922 by British Egyptology Howard Carter, along with another 62 royal tombs. Our visit includes entrance to three of the tombs which will be decided on the day, as many are periodically closed for resting and renovation to protect them. After the three, there will be an option to pay a supplement to visit Tutankhamun's tomb. Our next stop is the Temple of Hatshepsut. Pharaoh Hatshepsut is believed to be the most successful reigning female power of Egypt, no mean feat during Ancient Egyptian times, and was buried alongside her male counterparts in the Valley of the Kings. Historians throughout modern history offer contrasting information about her reign but walking into the shadow of Hatshepsut's immense temple, which is built into the limestone rock face on Luxor's West Bank, is a key symbol of her achievements. The structure is unexpectedly modern by design and was once linked directly with Karnak Temple on the East Bank. Continuing our exploration of the West Bank, we'll visit the striking Habu temple, one of the less visited sites on the West Bank and very much underrated. The temple complex is dominated by the highly decorated and well-preserved funeral temple of Ramses III depicting scenes of conquests and famous battles. The complex also houses the Temple of Amun, built by Hatshepsut and Tuthmosis III. With the backdrop of the village in the foreground and the Theban hills behind it's a fitting end to our morning of visiting some of Egypt's best-preserved ancient sites. We'll enjoy a home-cooked lunch at a local family home on the West Bank today, where we'll sample traditional dishes such as okra stew, koshari made with rice, lentils, pasta and chickpeas and tagen, a rich and tasty tomato-based dish, all served with freshly baked bread. We'll arrive back at our hotel mid-afternoon with time to relax, take a dip in the hotel pool or enjoy a stroll to the lively markets in Luxor."
