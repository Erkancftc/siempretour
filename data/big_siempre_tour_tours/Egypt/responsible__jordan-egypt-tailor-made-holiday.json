  "generalInfo": "Petra and the Great Pyramids of Giza are two of the most famous sights in the world; one, a remarkable city, hidden in the mountains, accessible down a narrow canyon, and beautifully carved from the rock; the other, the only remaining wonder of the ancient world.<br/><br/>Petra is a vast site, with the protected archaeological park covering over 200 square kilometres. Therefore the single day at the site you get on many tours is simply not enough.<br/><br/>These are two of the most important and impressive sights the region has to offer, and the route connecting them also allows you to experience many of the other sights that do not have the same high profile but are equally deserving of attention. In Jordan, you get to see Jerash – a fantastically preserved Classical city, regarded by some as impressive as Petra. You also get to see the work of the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature (RSCN), who are preserving the landscapes, wildlife and old traditions and crafts of the country.<br/><br/>In Egypt, you visit the Egyptian museum, a treasure house of Egyptian history, and will explore Coptic Cairo. The Copts, a Christian church, form a sizable minority in Egypt, and their language is a direct descendant of Ancient Egyptian – so if you are lucky enough to hear a service, you will be hearing hieroglyphics out loud.",
