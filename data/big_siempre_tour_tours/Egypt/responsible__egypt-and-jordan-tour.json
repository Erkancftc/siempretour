      "description": "Visits to Valley of the Kings, Temple of Hatchepsut, Workers Village, Colossi of Memnon. Afternoon visit Karnak Temple This morning, we embark on a journey to the West Bank of Luxor, a realm steeped in ancient history and shrouded in the mystique of pharaohs and their eternal resting places. Our exploration begins with a visit to the Valley of the Kings, a vast necropolis where generations of pharaohs were laid to rest in elaborately decorated tombs. We'll venture into several of these tombs, marvelling at the vibrant hieroglyphs and intricate paintings that adorn their walls. These ancient chambers continue to reveal their secrets to archaeologists, making the Valley of the Kings one of the most significant archaeological sites in the world.

We'll explore the remains of this ancient community, gaining insights into the lives of the workers and their families. Next, we'll be captivated by the Temple of Queen Hatshepsut, a unique mortuary temple built into the cliffs. Its elegant colonnades and terraces offer stunning views of the surrounding landscape. And no visit to the West Bank would be complete without encountering the Colossi of Memnon, two colossal statues that have stood guard over the Theban necropolis for millennia. In the afternoon, we cross back to the East Bank to explore the sprawling complex of Karnak Temple. Dedicated to the Theban Triad of Amun, Mut, and Khonsu, Karnak is a masterpiece of ancient Egyptian architecture. We'll wander through its vast courtyards, admire its towering columns, and decipher the intricate carvings that adorn its walls. Our guide will unravel the temple's complex history, revealing its secrets and explaining its significance as a religious and cultural centre for over 2,000 years. For those seeking an unforgettable experience, an optional hot air balloon flight over the West Bank is available this morning. Imagine soaring above the Valley of the Kings, the temples, and the Nile as the sun rises, painting the landscape in golden hues. It's a truly magical way to witness the grandeur of Luxor from a unique perspective (expect an early start to catch the sunrise). Later this evening we transfer to the station for the overnight sleeper train back to Cairo (approx. 9 hours). OVERNIGHT"

      "description": "Reverse-route mountain hike to Petra via Little Petra Today is all about exploring the Nabatean site of Petra. It was once the ancient capital of the Nabataean commercial empire until the Romans finally took over in 106AD. For a long period of time, Petra was forgotten - except by the local Bedouins - before it was rediscovered in 1812 by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt. Petra can be found at the edge of the Wadi Aruba desert, where canyon walls and towering hills make it virtually impossible to reach, except via a narrow cleft in the rock, known as the Siq. There are very few free-standing buildings in Petra, as the Nabateans chose to carve their dwellings into the multi coloured sandstone cliffs. Petra has become one of Jordan's main tourist attractions and the Jordanian Government is well aware of this. The tourism infrastructure in the adjoining village of Wadi Musa is booming, though, thankfully, once you enter through the Siq, the site is protected, there aren't that many touts or souvenir sellers, and all the building feels miles away. We have most of the day available today to explore this ancient city, though as an added bonus, we'll be exploring Petra via the back-route which starts at Little Petra. Before embarking on our hike into Petra, we'll explore the small but equally interesting site of Little Petra, or Siq al-Barid. From here we'll take a short jeep ride to the start of the mountail trail which links Little Petra to the Monastery and main site of Petra. The back-route into Petra makes for an interesting and much less crowded way of visiting, and what's more, you'll be rewarded with incredible mountain views towards the Holy Land. Whilst hiking the back-route you'll still have the opportunity to see all of the same monuments visited on the normal route, with the addition of Little Petra and the Monastery. The route starts with the ascent of a number of rock hewn steps and paths which straddle the mountain edge. After reaching a plateau, there is an opportunity to stop for refreshments at a small cafe from where you'll have some fantastic photo opportunities. From here the path continues until you'll have a glimpse of 'Ad-Deir' (or the Monastery) where you can have a well deserved rest before descending down into the main site of Petra. Once in Petra the valley opens out, and you'll see tombs carved into the rock on both sides. You'll get a glimpse of the ruined Roman amphitheatre and colonnaded streets. As we continue through the ancient city of Petra, we'll eventually reach The Khazneh (Treasury) which is probably the most familiar monument of Petra. Whilst the back-route hike into Petra isn't particularly difficult, as a number of ascents/descents and a significant number of steps are required, this route is only suitable for those who have no issue in hiking in this type of terrain for a minimum of 2-3 hours as far as the Monastery and then a further few hours walking on sandy terrain, whilst exploring the main site of Petra. For those with less mobility or who are worried about the distance, horse carriages are available for around 20JD (USD 28) for an agreed period of time (only available within the main site of Petra, not on the hiking route). We do not recommend riding the horses that are available. OVERNIGHT"

      "description": "Dead Sea road to Wadi Mujib - Siq Trail Hike. Dead Sea 'swim' After enjoying breakfast in Petra, we'll head north along the Dead Sea road to Wadi Mujib, where we'll hike along the exciting Siq Trail. Along the way we'll be rewarded with great views of the Salt Flats at the southern end of the Dead Sea. As we continue along the shores of the Dead Sea we eventually reach the visitor centre of Wadi Mujib. You'll have time to have lunch here (not included) before entering the water and embarking on the hike. Descending down into the gorge we enter the Wadi Mujib Nature Reserve where between months of April and October (see note below for periods outside of this) it's possible to take an exciting hike through the shallow waters that fill the gorge. Along the way you'll climb up small waterfalls where steps have being installed to make it easier, until eventually you'll reach the end of the gorge where you can relax beneath a large waterfall. The entire hike generally takes 2 to 3 hours roundtrip. We highly recommend bringing along a dry-bag (so your camera or mobile phone don't get wet) and water shoes. It is possible to hire a dry bag at the visitors centre for around US$7.00 and purchase water shoes for US$7.00). Note"

From Madaba, we'll make our way to Mount Nebo, the place where the prophet Moses looked across the Promised Land and is also his burial place. On a clear day, which is most of the time, you get great views towards Jericho and beyond from here. Our final visit of the day is to the ancient city of Jerash - known for being one of the largest and well-preserved Greco-Roman cities outside of Europe. Once we arrive in Jerash, we'll visit the Forum, explore its Roman colonnaded streets, the Nymphaeum and the Temple of Artemis - built on one of the highest points in the city. We end our day with a return drive to Amman, where we'll spend our final night in Jordan. OVERNIGHT"
