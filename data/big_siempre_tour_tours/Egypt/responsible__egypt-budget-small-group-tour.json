      "description": "Arrive in Aswan and visit Philae Temple. Nubian Village experience After our night onboard the sleeper train, we arrive in Aswan, a city steeped in ancient Nubian history. The Nubian people have inhabited this region for millennia, their culture intertwined with the Nile. We'll be spending the night immersed in this vibrant culture, staying in a Nubian style hotel within a Nubian village. Get ready to be charmed by the brightly painted houses, adorned with symbolic patterns and vibrant colours, and explore the bustling local markets where you can find handcrafted souvenirs and spices. Before heading to the Nubian villages, we'll embark on a boat trip to the breathtaking Philae Temple. Dedicated to the goddess Isis, this temple complex was once threatened by the rising waters of Lake Nasser. Thankfully, it was carefully dismantled and relocated to its current island location, preserving its beauty for generations to come. Following our visit to Philae Temple, we delve deeper into Nubian culture. We'll journey south of Aswan to a traditional Nubian village, where we'll have the unique opportunity to experience the local way of life firsthand. We'll wander through the village, visit the homes of Nubian families, and learn about their customs and traditions. In the evening, we'll share a delicious home-cooked dinner with a Nubian family, savouring traditional dishes and enjoying their warm hospitality.

      "description": "Visits to Valley of the Kings, Temple of Hatchepsut, Workers Village, Colossi of Memnon. Afternoon visit Karnak Temple This morning, we embark on a journey to the West Bank of Luxor, a realm steeped in ancient history and shrouded in the mystique of pharaohs and their eternal resting places. Our exploration begins with a visit to the Valley of the Kings, a vast necropolis where generations of pharaohs were laid to rest in elaborately decorated tombs. We'll venture into several of these tombs, marvelling at the vibrant hieroglyphs and intricate paintings that adorn their walls. These ancient chambers continue to reveal their secrets to archaeologists, making the Valley of the Kings one of the most significant archaeological sites in the world. Our West Bank adventure continues with a visit to Deir el-Medina, a fascinating village that was once home to the skilled artisans who constructed and decorated the royal tombs. We'll explore the remains of this ancient community, gaining insights into the lives of the workers and their families. Next, we'll be captivated by the Temple of Queen Hatshepsut, a unique mortuary temple built into the cliffs. Its elegant colonnades and terraces offer stunning views of the surrounding landscape. And no visit to the West Bank would be complete without encountering the Colossi of Memnon, two colossal statues that have stood guard over the Theban necropolis for millennia. In the afternoon, we cross back to the East Bank to explore the sprawling complex of Karnak Temple. Dedicated to the Theban Triad of Amun, Mut, and Khonsu, Karnak is a masterpiece of ancient Egyptian architecture. We'll wander through its vast courtyards, admire its towering columns, and decipher the intricate carvings that adorn its walls. Our guide will unravel the temple's complex history, revealing its secrets and explaining its significance as a religious and cultural centre for over 2,000 years. For those seeking an unforgettable experience, an optional hot air balloon flight over the West Bank is available this morning. Imagine soaring above the Valley of the Kings, the temples, and the Nile as the sun rises, painting the landscape in golden hues. It's a truly magical way to witness the grandeur of Luxor from a unique perspective (expect an early start to catch the sunrise). Later this evening we transfer to the station for the overnight sleeper train back to Cairo (approx. 9 hours). OVERNIGHT"
