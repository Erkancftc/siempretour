  "generalInfo": "The perfect introduction to Egypt, this tour covers Cairo and the Nile Valley between Aswan and Luxor, starting with the amazing Pyramids and Sphinx at Giza. From Cairo we take the overnight seater train to Aswan, where we'll take a boat trip to the beautiful island temple of Philae and have the option to visit the huge temples built by Ramses II at Abu Simbel. We'll spend the night in Aswan in an authentic Nubian village. The next highlight of the tour is a relaxing overnight cruise down the Nile on a traditional felucca sailboat.

      "description": "Cairo, Pyramids & Sphinx at Giza. Included Koshary Lunch. Overnight train to Aswan We start our exploration of Egypt with the iconic three great pyramids at Giza, on the outskirts of Cairo. Probably the most recognizable ancient buildings in the world, these three pyramids were built pyramids were built by the Pharaohs Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure around 2500 years BC. Our Egyptologist guide will start your introduction into Egyptian history here with information on how and why pyramids were built and how they fit into the whole ancient Pharaonic story. You’ll have the chance to climb down inside one of these pyramids if you wish (and if you’re not claustrophobic!). Our next visit is the majestic Sphinx, which nestles nearby, and was uncovered completely only in the 1920s. After your awe-inspiring visit to the Sphinx, we'll take a well-deserved break to refuel with an included Koshary lunch. Koshary is a beloved Egyptian staple, a hearty and flavorful dish that perfectly embodies the country's culinary heritage. Koshary consists of a bed of fluffy rice and lentils, topped with perfectly cooked macaroni and chickpeas, all brought together with a tangy tomato sauce and a sprinkle of crispy fried onions. It's a symphony of textures and tastes that will leave you feeling satisfied and ready for the next adventure! After lunch you'll have some free time to visit the Egyptian Museum of antiquities, home to the treasures of ancient Egypt. This evening we will board the overnight VIP seater train from Cairo to Aswan. For those preferring more comfort, there is the option of upgrading to the sleeper train where you will have a private cabin onboard with airline style meals included. OVERNIGHT"

Philae Temple & Nubian village After our night onboard the overnight train, we arrive in Aswan where we spend the night in a Nubian village staying in a Nubian style hotel.

Many descendants of the Nubian people still live around Aswan and during our stay we’ll see their colourful houses. This morning we’ll take a boat trip to visit one of Egypt’s most beautifully situated temples which was also reclaimed from the rising waters of Lake Nasser. This is the Temple of Philae, which was dedicated to Isis.

      "description": "To Luxor via Edfu. Optional Luxor temple at night We spend some time onboard the Felucca this morning whilst enjoying breakfast with the crew, before we bid them a reluctant goodbye in Aswan and drive north to Luxor, making a stop along the way to visit Edfu Temple. Luxor is the jewel in Egypt’s crown with the largest concentrations of ancient ruins in the Nile Valley, if not the world. These are split across both banks of the Nile, with the City of the Dead on the West Bank with many mortuary temples and tombs cut into the rocky mountains, and with the Temples of Luxor and Karnak and their connecting Avenue of Sphinxes the highlights on the East Bank. Later this evening there is an optional tour available to Luxor Temple which is right in the middle of town and beautifully lit up at night. You'll can also head into town to explore some of Luxor's popular outdoor cafes, perhaps enjoying a few games of backgammon and trying a shisha pipe with the locals. We spend the night at a comfortable 4-star hotel with a pool on the banks of the Nile. OVERNIGHT"
