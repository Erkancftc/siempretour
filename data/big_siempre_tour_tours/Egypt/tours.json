    "generalInfo": "This special 9-day Egypt tour takes in Cairo, Aswan and Luxor, and is timed to coincide with the Sun Festival that takes place in the temples at Abu Simbel twice a year. Egypt is home to a huge variety of ancient monuments from the Pharaonic era. One of the most important, most interesting and most impressive is the temple to Ramses II at Abu Simbel. Ramses II was one of the great Pharaohs, and built temples all over Egypt. The temples in Abu Simbel are particularly interesting because they were constructed, not from blocks and columns, but by cutting and tunnelling into a rock cliff-face. The main entrance tunnel features 4 statues at its end, and incredible care was taken when the temple was built so that twice a year, on the dates of Ramses ascension to the throne, and on his birthday, the rising sun shines right in through the tunnel and lights up just 3 of the statues, leaving the fourth, dedicated to Ptah, the god of Darkness, in shadow. When the Aswan Dam was built and Lake Nasser was flooded, the temples were below the planned water line and a huge project took place to carefully dismantle the temples and rebuild them higher up, out of danger from the rising waters. The allignment of the tunnel was maintained so that to this day the rising sun shines in on the 22nd October and 22nd February each year. Our tour starts in Cairo with a visit to the Great Pyramids and the Sphinx before heading to Aswan where we visit the island temple of Philae and the Aswan Dam. The next morning our Egyptologist tour guide escorts us as we set off very early to get to Abu Simbel in plenty of time for the sunrise. It will be busy, but it is generally well organised so that everyone has the chance to go inside and see the statues in the morning sunlight. After this special experience we return to Aswan and board a traditional Nile felucca for a relaxing cruise down the river on your way towards Luxor in the Nile Valley. Support is provided en-route from our facilities boat with on board toilet, showers and massage deck. An alternative upgrade to an extra night in the hotel in Aswan is available if you prefer. After our night on the felucca we drive on north to Luxor, stopping to see the temple at Edfu en-route. Once in Luxor you will visit the huge temple complex at Karnak, explore the tombs of the Valley of the Kings and Queen Hatchepsut temple, and also have some free time to walk through the markets and relax by the hotel pool before we head back to Cairo. If you'd like to add some time by the Red Sea to this trip, then please contact us for details as extensions are easily arranged from Luxor to Hurghada, and then back to Cairo from there",

The river here is at its most scenic in Egypt, and is dotted with islands and felucca sailing boats. Aswan itself is an intriguing mixture of African and Middle Eastern cultures, and lies in part of the ancient region of Nubia. Many Nubian people still live here and work on the river, and we'll visit a Nubian village away from the main town where we'll walk through narrow alleyways seeing colourfully painted houses, friendly people, wandering animals and enjoy a traditional local lunch. We continue our day with an afternoon tour to the Temple of Philae. This beautiful island temple is dedicated to Isis and was saved from the rising waters of Lake Nasser. It can only be reached by a scenic boat ride. The evening is free at leisure to explore Aswan's various markets and to walk up and down the Corniche on the banks of the Nile. There's also an option to ride a camel across the sands on the far banks of the Nile to St. Simeon's monastery. Those who have chosen to visit Abu Simbel tomorrow should aim for an early night tonight ready for a very early start in the morning. | OVERNIGHT"

These amazing temples built by Ramses II are one of Egypt's main highlights and attractions. We arrive at the temples in plenty of time for some historical explanations by our Egyptologist guide, before going inside the temple while the sun is rising to see how 3 out of the 4 statues at the end of the tunnel are lit up, leaving Ptah, the god of Darkness in shadow. It can be very busy at Abu Simbel on this day so be prepared for a bit of a procession straight in and out to see the statues. After returning to Aswan, we board a traditional felucca sailboat this afternoon for a great day sailing down the Nile. Drifting down the Nile on a felucca is one of Egypt's most enjoyable experiences, and you'll see local rural Egyptian life pass you by. Our Nubian crew will handle the boat and provide entertainment to you on the way, as well as preparing all your meals. Our fully equipped facilities boat will drop by from time to time during the day and moor up with us at night. Our boat has a western toilet and showers on board as well as a modern, hygienic kitchen where the crew will prepare and cook a tasty evening meal. You sleep on the deck of the boat tonight and we provide mattresses, blankets and mosquito nets as required. You can also choose to upgrade your Nile felucca cruise to stay in the hotel in Aswan instead of on board the boat. All other touring remains the same. | OVERNIGHT"

Luxor is built on and around the ancient site of Thebes, and has the greatest concentration of ancient ruins in the Nile Valley, if not the world. To the west, across the Nile, lies the City of the Dead, with its mortuary temples and rock carved tombs, and to the east stand the Temples of Luxor and Karnak. After lunch we'll visit the massive temple complex of Karnak , once the religious heart of Thebes and Upper Egypt. It was linked to the town of Luxor by a long sphinx lined avenue, and the temple itself was linked to the Nile via a canal along which sailed the sacred boats of the god Amun. The entrance is via a smaller sphinx-lined avenue, built by Ramesses II, after which you enter the temple proper through the enormous pylon entrance. Inside the large Courtyard are three temples dedicated to the gods Amun, Khous and Mut. The much photographed Hypostyle Hall has an impressive 134 towering columns, each is carved with scenes of gods and pharaohs, and hieroglyphic inscriptions cover the walls. In the evening we'll take a walking tour of the smaller Luxor Temple, which is in the centre of town and is colourfully lit up by night. | OVERNIGHT"

The rest of the day is then free to relax in your 5-star hotel by the Nile, or head out into Luxor to explore independently. You could do some shopping or browsing in the market, take a felucca trip to nearby Banana island or visit the mummification museum. Additional ancient Egyptian sightseeing is also available if you'd like to learn more about Egyptian history. The Workers Village, Valley of the Queens and Rammesseum on the west bank of the Nile are all worth a visit.

        "description": "Visit the Pyramids, Sphinx & Saqqara After breakfast we have a brief pre-tour briefing before we take you on a tour of Gisa and Saqqara. Gisa was built around 4600 years ago as a necropolis (cemetery) for the pharaoh Khufu (Cheops). The successor of Sneferu, Khufu was known as a tyrant and in his arrogance decided to have built a tomb that was bigger and better than all others. Standing 500 feet high and 750 feet at its base the Pyramid of Khufu is an awesome man-made structure constructed of giant blocks of stone covered in a hard limestone casing. The casing has, over the years, been stripped away to leave exposed the inner block structure. Together with the smaller pyramids of Khafre (Chephern) and Menkaure (Mycerinus), the majestic sight of these enormous structures rising out of the desert is a breathtaking spectacle. Here you have the chance to climb inside one of the pyramids (there are a limited number of tickets available, so we cannot guarantee this). You have another guided tour around the sphinx and some free time to walk around and take photos. From here we take you to Saqqara, which lies 25km to the south of Cairo. Djeser's (Zoser's) Step Pyramid (built 4700 years ago) dominates the skyline and is believed to have been the ancient Egyptians' first attempt at Pyramid building. The entire 7km stretch of desert at Saqqara is a treasure trove of pyramids, temples and tombs, which we will have plenty of time to explore, while we learn about the history of pyramid building in Egypt. | OVERNIGHT"

Founded in 969 AD by Gohar, a Fatimid army leader, El Kahera (Cairo) soon became the capital of Egypt. Subsequent additions like the El Azhar mosque, the Islamic University, and defensive walls and a citadel, built by Saladin in 1179, have helped Cairo remain Egypt's principal city. The 16-year reign of Ismail (1830-1895) ushered in a new period of expansion and modernisation in Cairo. Areas like Heliopolis, Dokki and Roda were added, while gardens, Opera houses, large hotels and wide, tree lined avenues were built. Further post revolutionary, urban expansion has left Cairo as one of the world's largest cities. Today it is a bustling metropolis of over 20 million people, a strange mix of modern and old, a unique blend of diverse cultures and a gateway to Egypt's past. Your tour includes a visit to the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM) (which houses a vast collection of artefacts from Egypt's past, including the famous King Tutunkhamun display), the Citadel (a collection of mosques and palaces, with a great view over the city), and the Khan al Khalili bazaar (a mazy market that offers a window to the past and a guaranteed souvenir).

The pharaoh Khufu who built the largest at Giza, was preceded by his father, the Pharoah Sneferu, who built 3 pyramids in his lifetime. It's been suggested that Khufu would have played in the shadows of the pyramids his father built. And the lessons learnt made for the impressive Gisa Pyramids. We tell you the story on our tours so that they become an incredible experience. And Watching The Century's Unfold Was the Sphinx. Sphinxes were often placed at the entrance of temples to guard their mysteries. Even the name was given to it 2000 years after the date of its construction (during Khafre’s rule) but Sellen Hassan, an Egyptologist wrote, that \"Taking all things into consideration, it seems that we must give the credit of erecting this, the world's most wonderful statue, to Khafre, but always with this reservation that there is not one single contemporary inscription which connects the Sphinx with Khafre\". The mystery continues. Saqqara (pm)- The Site of the First Stone Built Pyramid. Saqqara is where the first ever stone pyramid was built. It dates to the 27th Century BC (4,693 years old). The pyramid is known as the pyramid of Djoser (after the pharaoh of that name) or The Stepped Pyramid. Today, Saqqara is the most important archaeological site in all of Egypt. It was designed by Imhotep, the architect for Djoser. The Step Pyramid stands at a height of 204 feet (62 meters) with six stepped layers. And you will also go inside the pyramid. And additionally, we enter recently discovered tombs. Return to your hotel and overnight - the second of 3 nights at the Cairo Marriott (Nile River) 5 Star Hotel or equivalent.

It’s themes include the Dawn of Civilization, The Nile, Writing, State and Society, Material Culture, Beliefs and Thinking and the Gallery of Royal Mummies. For travellers to Egypt, it provides deep insight to the amazing society that the Egyptians built from prehistoric days to the present. Old Cairo includes the site of a Roman-era fortress, the Christian settlement of Coptic Cairo, and the Muslim-era settlements pre-dating the founding of Cairo proper in 969 AD. It is part of what is referred to as Historic Cairo, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Coptic Cairo is a part of Old Cairo which encompasses the Babylon Fortress, the Coptic Museum, the Hanging Church, and many other Coptic historical sites. It is believed in Christian tradition that the Holy Family visited this area and stayed at the site of Saints Sergius and Bacchus Church. Islamic Cairo, the Citadel and Alabaster Mosque. The Citadel of Cairo is a medieval Islamic-era fortification in Cairo built by Salah ad-Din. It was the seat of government in Egypt for nearly 700 years from the 13th century. Its location commands a strategic position overlooking the city. It was constructed from 1176–1183 and was among the most impressive military fortifications of its time. The Alabaster (Muhammad Ali) Mosque. Within the Citadel is The Muhammad Ali Mosque. The mosque with its twin minarets is the most visible mosque in Cairo and is an active place of worship for Muslims. The mosque was built between 1828 and 1848 and is situated on the highest point of the Citadel. The mosque was built by Muhammed Ali in memory of Tusun Pasha, his son, who died in 1816. However, it also represents Muhammad Ali's efforts to erase symbols of the previous rulers that he sought to replace. It is one of the most visited sites in Cairo. The Khan El Khalili Bazaar For Dinner. The market dates to the 14th century. Today, the Khan El-Khalili Bazaar continues to be a bustling, vibrant market that has been operating 24 hours a day for over 600 years.

        "description": "Alexandria The Former Capitol of Egypt Alexandria was founded by Alexander the Great in 332 BC and was the capital of Egypt for more than 300 years. After its foundation, Alexandria became the seat of the Ptolemaic Kingdom, and quickly grew to be one of the greatest cities of the Hellenistic world. Only Rome which gained control of Egypt in 30 BC, eclipsed Alexandria in size and wealth. Alexandria is the second largest city in Egypt, famous for its Greco-Roman remains and Mediterranean character. Bibliotheca Alexandrina. The Great Library of Alexandria was one of the largest and most significant libraries of the ancient world. Alexandria came to be regarded as the capital of knowledge and learning. Julius Caesar burned his ships during the Siege of Alexandria in 48 BC. Ancient writers said the fire spread and destroyed the library’s collections. Today the library has developed as a centre of excellence in the production and dissemination of knowledge, and a place for interaction between peoples and civilisations. Roman Amphitheatre. The Roman theatre was a very important discovery in 1960. It was proven that the theatre was built since the 4th A.D century and was used up until the 7th century passing by the Roman, byzantine and Islamic eras. The theatre used to host huge ceremonies and events with a capacity of 600 spectators. Sultan Qa?it Bey Citadel. Within a century of its founding, Alexandria’s splendours were renowned in the ancient world. The pride of ancient Alexandria harbour was the great lighthouse. One of the Seven Wonders of the World, the lighthouse is reputed to have been more than 350 feet (110 metres) high and was still standing in the 12th century. In 1477, however, Sultan Qa?it Bey used stones from the dilapidated structure to build a fort (named for him), which stands near or on the original site. Alexandria Catacombs and Mosques. A labyrinth of tunnels and vaults exists in Alexandria. These the catacombs are more than 360 miles long. This vast subterranean cemetery was created by ancient Romans nearly 2,000 years ago. In recent times, a catacomb containing thousands of human skeletons was unearthed. Now a team of specialists is on a mission to unlock the secrets of the skeletons. And as in all Egypt there are great mosques which represent the influence of Islam.

Gisa was built around 4600 years ago as a necropolis (cemetery) for the pharaoh Khufu (Cheops). The successor of Sneferu, Khufu was known as a tyrant and in his arrogance decided to have built a tomb that was bigger and better than all others. Standing 500 feet high and 750 feet at its base the Pyramid of Khufu is an awesome man-made structure constructed of giant blocks of stone covered in a hard limestone casing. The casing has, over the years, been stripped away to leave exposed the inner block structure. Together with the smaller pyramids of Khafre (Chephern) and Menkaure (Mycerinus), the majestic sight of these enormous structures rising out of the desert is a breathtaking spectacle. Here you have the chance to climb inside one of the pyramids (there are a limited number of tickets available, so we cannot guarantee this). You have another guided tour around the sphinx and some free time to walk around and take photos. From here we take you to Saqqara, which lies 25km to the south of Cairo. Djeser's (Zoser's) Step Pyramid (built 4700 years ago) dominates the skyline and is believed to have been the ancient Egyptians' first attempt at Pyramid building. The entire 7km stretch of desert at Saqqara is a treasure trove of pyramids, temples and tombs, which we will have plenty of time to explore, while we learn about the history of pyramid building in Egypt. After a full day a sightseeing we return to the luxurious hotel for a relaxing evening. | OVERNIGHT"

Founded in 969 AD by Gohar, a Fatimid army leader, El Kahera (Cairo) soon became the capital of Egypt. Subsequent additions like the El Azhar mosque, the Islamic University, and defensive walls and a citadel, built by Saladin in 1179, have helped Cairo remain Egypt's principal city. The 16-year reign of Ismail (1830-1895) ushered in a new period of expansion and modernisation in Cairo. Areas like Heliopolis, Dokki and Roda were added, while gardens, Opera houses, large hotels and wide, tree lined avenues were built. Further post revolutionary, urban expansion has left Cairo as one of the world's largest cities. Today it is a bustling metropolis of over 20 million people, a strange mix of modern and old, a unique blend of diverse cultures and a gateway to Egypt's past. Your tour includes a visit to the Egyptian Museum (which houses a vast collection of artefacts from Egypt's past, including the famous King Tutunkhamun display), the Citadel (a collection of mosques and palaces, with a great view over the city), and the Khan al Khalili bazaar (a mazy market that offers a window to the past and a guaranteed souvenir).

The Penguin Colony is one of only three mainland-based colonies in South Africa and for this reason, it is treasured. We overnight in Hermanus/Gansbaai and the next day there are several marine options such as Whale watching, Shark Cave Diving, and Dyer Island Nature Reserve. From here we will head for the most southern tip of Africa a Cape Agulhas- which is the dividing line between the warm Indian Ocean and the cooler Atlantic Ocean. The seas around Cape Agulhas are very treacherous and have caused numerous shipwrecks. To help reduce fatalities the Cape Agulhas Lighthouse was built in 1848 and is the 2nd oldest working lighthouse in South Africa. From August to December Southern Right and Humpback Whales may be spotted along the coast - as they feed in the nutrient-rich waters off the southern coast. From Cape Agulhas we pass through the Outeniqua Mountains to the Little Karoo - we will visit an Ostrich farm to learn more about the worlds largest bird. The Ostrich has been around for 8 million years and a feather was discovered in King Tutankhamun's tomb in Egypt. 97% of the world's population of Ostriches lives in the Karoo. We will also explore Cango Calcite Caves recognised as one of the world's finest networks of Calcite caves. The bizarre formations of Stalagmites and Stalactites represent over a million years of slow formation. We spend two days winding our way along South Africa's famous Garden Route where there is a wealth of things to see and do. We travel through the popular resort of Knysna, located on a tranquil lagoon that is protected from the sea by two enormous cliffs known as 'the heads'. We visit the Tsitsikamma Forest, where you will be able to hike along the coast and view the crashing waves at the mouth of the scenic Storms River, and maybe spot dolphins and whales in the ocean. Optional excursions in this region include mountain biking, black water tubing, and the mother of all bungee jumps at Bloakrans Bridge - the highest jump in the world at 216 metres. From the Garden Route, we head inland to Addo Elephant National Park which has recently been extended to include part of the coast and is now home to the BIG 7 - lion, rhino, elephant, leopard, buffalo, whale and shark! On our game drive, we hope to spot some of the many elephants that the park is famous for, which are the most southerly population in Africa.

Here we will see Lesotho's horsemen dressed in their blankets and gumboots trotting around the hillsides. We spend a couple of nights at Malealea Lodge, Lesotho's most famous countryside retreat tucked up high in the mountains. Here there are isolated waterfalls, cool rock pools ideal for swimming, and peaceful hikes in the surrounding hills. This is also a great place to try pony trekking one of the best ways to enjoy the scenery is atop a sure-footed Lesotho pony. We drive through the lowlands of Lesotho and visit Thabo Bosiu, Mt. Mooros with a local guide (time & weather permitting). This mountain stronghold was the home of Chief Moshoeshoe, the founder of the Basotho nation. We continue through Lesotho's tiny capital Maseru and re-enter South Africa. Royal Natal National Park on the edge of the Drakensburg Mountains has an impressive natural Amphitheatre of massive rock walls. The Tugela River plunges spectacularly over the edge of the Amphitheatre wall, dropping around 800m through a series of five falls. There is over 130km of walking trails around the park-many of which are easy, half-day strolls, through the beautiful countryside of grassland dotted with patches of yellowwood forest and proteas set against the stunning backdrop of the Amphitheatre. Heading north we pass through small towns and villages, through Afrikaaner heartland, making our way to South Africa's largest city Johannesburg. Built as a result of the gold rush, the city has grown into one of the wealthiest cities in the world.

Nearby is the Langata Giraffe Centre, where you can learn more about these gentle and majestic creatures - hopefully getting the chance to get up close to feed them. From Nairobi, we head north into one of Africa's greatest natural features, the East African Rift Valley. Stretching from the Dead Sea in Jordan down to Mozambique in Southern Africa, our first view is from the top of a steep escarpment. Overland trips through East Africa will allow you to experience some of the most dramatic scenery in the world, and the Rift Valley is a definite highlight. The valley floor seems to sweep on forever and is dotted with volcanic peaks, shimmering lakes and countless springs. Our journey takes us into the heart of the Rift Valley to Lake Naivasha. We camp near the lakeshore where Hippos sometimes feed at night! Here you can walk to Elsamere, the house of Joy Adamson - of Elsa the Lion and Born Free fame, and enjoy a film of her life - and cream teas! You can also hire mountain bikes and cycle or walk through Hells Gate National Park - the only game reserve in Kenya in which you are permitted to do so. Or for a less active but equally enjoyable game viewing experience - visit the Crater Lake Game Sanctuary. Both offer excellent scenery & opportunities to spot hyrax, abundant bird & plant life along with several types of gazelle, impala and eland.

As we travel through Uganda, we'll pass through several small towns and villages; Mpigi, where you will see roadside stalls manufacturing and selling traditional musical instruments Kyazanga, where we can buy fresh rotisserie and roasted meat and vegetables, as well as roasted plantain bananas. We will also be able to make a photo stop where our route crosses the Equator. Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park and Mgahinga Gorilla National Park are home to several families of Highland Mountain Gorillas. Getting up close to these amazing creatures is truly a once in a lifetime experience and one of the highlights of the trip. You have the opportunity to trek to see the Gorillas in Uganda (bookable as an Add on). It is estimated that only around 700 of these gentle giants remain. This mountainous area on the borders of Rwanda, Uganda and Zaire (now renamed the Democratic Republic of Congo) is their only natural habitat and they are periodically threatened by poachers and political instability in the area. One permit allows you to spend about 50 to 60 minutes with one of the gorilla families. Trekking to find them in groups of 8 people can take anywhere from half an hour to 5 hours. The organisations and well-trained guides that continually monitor and protect the families are conscientious and responsible. We will base ourselves in the village of Kabale which will allow you to trek the Mountain Gorillas and visit the beautiful Lake Bunyonyi. (Due to the popularity of Trekking to the Mountain Gorillas and the limited availability of obtaining Trekking Permits, we may do the Gorilla trek in Rwanda in Volcanos National Park, which may come at an additional cost - you will be advised in advance). Passing over the mountain ranges we cross the border into Rwanda. The small, friendly town of Musanze is home to Musanze caves and several hiking trails, take a village tour throughout the area where you can see first-hand production of local Banana beer. There will also be an opportunity to visit the genocide memorial in Kigali, which is a moving and humbling experience. We then return to Uganda and make our way towards Kampala and camp near Jinja - Uganda's adventure playground. Here, on the edge of Lake Victoria, the Nile begins its 6700km journey to the sea. We spend the next few days downstream from the source of the Nile. This is a spectacular area and a superb place to go whitewater rafting or kayaking. You can also organise quad biking, horse riding or a visit to a local education project."

For such a poor country with so many recent problems - Sudanese people are often too willing to invite you for a meal or a cup of 'Sudanese whisky' - better known as tea! Khartoum is our next stop and it has a fantastic setting on the confluence of the Blue and White Niles. Our stay here is on the banks of the Nile at the quirky but interesting Blue Nile Sailing Club. It houses one of General Kitchener's old Gunboats, a relic from the British military campaign against the Mahdi over a century ago. For such a large city, Khartoum feels quite laid back. Here you can visit the Hamed al-Nil Tomb or take a trip to the daily camel market or viewing the confluence of the two Niles are also interesting ways to pass the time. The ancient Pyramids at Meroe lie to the north of the capital Khartoum. Our drive across the Nubian Desert will see us either hugging the banks of the Nile as it snakes its way north or possibly experiencing the vast open desert plains which are dissected by the main train line from Khartoum - making this our only real point of reference. Whether passing through sleepy Nubian villages, resting in tea rooms, pottering around the local souqs or experiencing total isolation in the middle of the desert - a unique experience awaits you along with this not so travelled route to Wadi Halfa."

Home to many of the most spectacular antiquities ever found, the museum now holds virtually the entire collection of the treasures found in Tutankhamun’s tomb.<br/><br/>After a free morning to explore the capital at your leisure (or return to see more of the Egyptian Museum), you’ll board the overnight train to Aswan. Many choose to make this journey by plane, but the train is a comfortable and convenient way to travel, arriving in time for you to spend a morning at the Philae Temple.

The ship’s superb amenities include a swimming pool and restaurant – both ideal for taking in views along the Nile. Optional activities along the way include riding a camel to the ancient St Simeon’s Monastery out in the desert, or a short sailing in a traditional felucca. But for many travellers, the pleasure in cruising the Nile is simply watching Egyptian life go by along the banks of the river.<br/><br/>On the third afternoon ,you arrive in Luxor where you may like to take in the famous Sound and Light Show at Karnak Temple in the evening. But it is the final day, as you enter the Valley of the Kings, that will really take your breath away. Visit no fewer than three tombs to learn how Egyptian pharaohs lived, died and were buried, and what they took with them into the next life.",

Our visit includes entrance to three of the tombs which will be decided on the day, as many are periodically closed for resting and renovation to protect them. After the three, there will be an option to pay a supplement to visit Tutankhamun's tomb. Our next stop is the Temple of Hatshepsut. Pharaoh Hatshepsut is believed to be the most successful reigning female power of Egypt, no mean feat during Ancient Egyptian times, and was buried alongside her male counterparts in the Valley of the Kings. Historians throughout modern history offer contrasting information about her reign but walking into the shadow of Hatshepsut's immense temple, which is built into the limestone rock face on Luxor's West Bank, is a key symbol of her achievements. The structure is unexpectedly modern by design and was once linked directly with Karnak Temple on the East Bank. Continuing our exploration of the West Bank, we'll visit the striking Habu temple, one of the less visited sites on the West Bank and very much underrated. The temple complex is dominated by the highly decorated and well-preserved funeral temple of Ramses III depicting scenes of conquests and famous battles. The complex also houses the Temple of Amun, built by Hatshepsut and Tuthmosis III. With the backdrop of the village in the foreground and the Theban hills behind it's a fitting end to our morning of visiting some of Egypt's best-preserved ancient sites. We'll enjoy a home-cooked lunch at a local family home on the West Bank today, where we'll sample traditional dishes such as okra stew, koshari made with rice, lentils, pasta and chickpeas and tagen, a rich and tasty tomato-based dish, all served with freshly baked bread.

Afternoon visit Karnak Temple This morning, we embark on a journey to the West Bank of Luxor, a realm steeped in ancient history and shrouded in the mystique of pharaohs and their eternal resting places. Our exploration begins with a visit to the Valley of the Kings, a vast necropolis where generations of pharaohs were laid to rest in elaborately decorated tombs. We'll venture into several of these tombs, marvelling at the vibrant hieroglyphs and intricate paintings that adorn their walls. These ancient chambers continue to reveal their secrets to archaeologists, making the Valley of the Kings one of the most significant archaeological sites in the world. Our West Bank adventure continues with a visit to Deir el-Medina, a fascinating village that was once home to the skilled artisans who constructed and decorated the royal tombs. We'll explore the remains of this ancient community, gaining insights into the lives of the workers and their families. Next, we'll be captivated by the Temple of Queen Hatshepsut, a unique mortuary temple built into the cliffs. Its elegant colonnades and terraces offer stunning views of the surrounding landscape. And no visit to the West Bank would be complete without encountering the Colossi of Memnon, two colossal statues that have stood guard over the Theban necropolis for millennia. In the afternoon, we cross back to the East Bank to explore the sprawling complex of Karnak Temple. Dedicated to the Theban Triad of Amun, Mut, and Khonsu, Karnak is a masterpiece of ancient Egyptian architecture. We'll wander through its vast courtyards, admire its towering columns, and decipher the intricate carvings that adorn its walls. Our guide will unravel the temple's complex history, revealing its secrets and explaining its significance as a religious and cultural centre for over 2,000 years. For those seeking an unforgettable experience, an optional hot air balloon flight over the West Bank is available this morning. Imagine soaring above the Valley of the Kings, the temples, and the Nile as the sun rises, painting the landscape in golden hues. It's a truly magical way to witness the grandeur of Luxor from a unique perspective (expect an early start to catch the sunrise). Later this evening we transfer to the station for the overnight sleeper train back to Cairo (approx. 9 hours). OVERNIGHT"

        "description": "Reverse-route mountain hike to Petra via Little Petra Today is all about exploring the Nabatean site of Petra. It was once the ancient capital of the Nabataean commercial empire until the Romans finally took over in 106AD. For a long period of time, Petra was forgotten - except by the local Bedouins - before it was rediscovered in 1812 by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt. Petra can be found at the edge of the Wadi Aruba desert, where canyon walls and towering hills make it virtually impossible to reach, except via a narrow cleft in the rock, known as the Siq. There are very few free-standing buildings in Petra, as the Nabateans chose to carve their dwellings into the multi coloured sandstone cliffs. Petra has become one of Jordan's main tourist attractions and the Jordanian Government is well aware of this. The tourism infrastructure in the adjoining village of Wadi Musa is booming, though, thankfully, once you enter through the Siq, the site is protected, there aren't that many touts or souvenir sellers, and all the building feels miles away. We have most of the day available today to explore this ancient city, though as an added bonus, we'll be exploring Petra via the back-route which starts at Little Petra. Before embarking on our hike into Petra, we'll explore the small but equally interesting site of Little Petra, or Siq al-Barid. From here we'll take a short jeep ride to the start of the mountail trail which links Little Petra to the Monastery and main site of Petra. The back-route into Petra makes for an interesting and much less crowded way of visiting, and what's more, you'll be rewarded with incredible mountain views towards the Holy Land. Whilst hiking the back-route you'll still have the opportunity to see all of the same monuments visited on the normal route, with the addition of Little Petra and the Monastery. The route starts with the ascent of a number of rock hewn steps and paths which straddle the mountain edge. After reaching a plateau, there is an opportunity to stop for refreshments at a small cafe from where you'll have some fantastic photo opportunities. From here the path continues until you'll have a glimpse of 'Ad-Deir' (or the Monastery) where you can have a well deserved rest before descending down into the main site of Petra. Once in Petra the valley opens out, and you'll see tombs carved into the rock on both sides. You'll get a glimpse of the ruined Roman amphitheatre and colonnaded streets. As we continue through the ancient city of Petra, we'll eventually reach The Khazneh (Treasury) which is probably the most familiar monument of Petra. Whilst the back-route hike into Petra isn't particularly difficult, as a number of ascents/descents and a significant number of steps are required, this route is only suitable for those who have no issue in hiking in this type of terrain for a minimum of 2-3 hours as far as the Monastery and then a further few hours walking on sandy terrain, whilst exploring the main site of Petra. For those with less mobility or who are worried about the distance, horse carriages are available for around 20JD (USD 28) for an agreed period of time (only available within the main site of Petra, not on the hiking route). We do not recommend riding the horses that are available. OVERNIGHT"

Dead Sea 'swim' After enjoying breakfast in Petra, we'll head north along the Dead Sea road to Wadi Mujib, where we'll hike along the exciting Siq Trail. Along the way we'll be rewarded with great views of the Salt Flats at the southern end of the Dead Sea. As we continue along the shores of the Dead Sea we eventually reach the visitor centre of Wadi Mujib. You'll have time to have lunch here (not included) before entering the water and embarking on the hike. Descending down into the gorge we enter the Wadi Mujib Nature Reserve where between months of April and October (see note below for periods outside of this) it's possible to take an exciting hike through the shallow waters that fill the gorge. Along the way you'll climb up small waterfalls where steps have being installed to make it easier, until eventually you'll reach the end of the gorge where you can relax beneath a large waterfall. The entire hike generally takes 2 to 3 hours roundtrip. We highly recommend bringing along a dry-bag (so your camera or mobile phone don't get wet) and water shoes. It is possible to hire a dry bag at the visitors centre for around US$7.00 and purchase water shoes for US$7.00). Note"

Our exploration begins with a visit to the Valley of the Kings, a vast necropolis where generations of pharaohs were laid to rest in elaborately decorated tombs. We'll venture into several of these tombs, marvelling at the vibrant hieroglyphs and intricate paintings that adorn their walls. These ancient chambers continue to reveal their secrets to archaeologists, making the Valley of the Kings one of the most significant archaeological sites in the world. Our West Bank adventure continues with a visit to Deir el-Medina, a fascinating village that was once home to the skilled artisans who constructed and decorated the royal tombs. We'll explore the remains of this ancient community, gaining insights into the lives of the workers and their families. Next, we'll be captivated by the Temple of Queen Hatshepsut, a unique mortuary temple built into the cliffs. Its elegant colonnades and terraces offer stunning views of the surrounding landscape. And no visit to the West Bank would be complete without encountering the Colossi of Memnon, two colossal statues that have stood guard over the Theban necropolis for millennia. In the afternoon, we cross back to the East Bank to explore the sprawling complex of Karnak Temple. Dedicated to the Theban Triad of Amun, Mut, and Khonsu, Karnak is a masterpiece of ancient Egyptian architecture. We'll wander through its vast courtyards, admire its towering columns, and decipher the intricate carvings that adorn its walls. Our guide will unravel the temple's complex history, revealing its secrets and explaining its significance as a religious and cultural centre for over 2,000 years. For those seeking an unforgettable experience, an optional hot air balloon flight over the West Bank is available this morning. Imagine soaring above the Valley of the Kings, the temples, and the Nile as the sun rises, painting the landscape in golden hues. It's a truly magical way to witness the grandeur of Luxor from a unique perspective (expect an early start to catch the sunrise). Later this evening we transfer to the station for the overnight sleeper train back to Cairo (approx. 9 hours). OVERNIGHT"

Our purpose is driven by wanting to give you amazing experiences and that’s our focus for the next 12 days.  And we will be showcasing an evolution that occurred within Egypt which helps to explain the journey its been on.<br/><br/>Egypt embodies much more than its pharaonic past.  As great and impactful as the pharaonic history of Egypt has been, there are also the tides of achievement in Islamic and Christian faith, architectural and engineering brilliance and the sciences.   The pharaonic period set the gold standard in many disciplines.  <br/><br/>And many ancient societies tried to extract the Egyptians secrets when they sought Egypt in their imperial advances.  But they ultimately failed.  Those other societies that later came to conquer Egypt asked the same questions that we ask today.   That is, “how did you do this?”<br/><br/>The achievements of the ancient Egyptians became an integral part of Egyptians way of life.  And one must remember that when the development of the grand pyramids of Giza was undertaken, there were only between 2  to 3 million Egyptians.   The wheel hadn’t even been invented.  Egyptians lives and legacies have shaped not only Egypt’s future but that of many societies.  We will be showcasing touchstones of the past and how Egyptians today are in a new period of renaissance.<br/><br/>Our focus, on this private journey, is to weave the connections between each day; to link the events, people and places into a compelling narrative.   A narrative which will keep you asking questions and which, in all likelihood, will have you coming back to Egypt in the years ahead.  It’s the evolutionary tone of Egyptian society and its ability to respond which makes it one of the most unique societies on earth.<br/><br/>The Essential 5 Star Aspects of this Itinerary Are<br/>•\t5 Star Accommodation Egypt<br/>•\t5 Star Luxury Class for your Nile Cruise<br/><br/>Concierge Service<br/>•\tYour concierge will meet you as you disembark your flight or in the <br/>Customs Halls.<br/>•\tYou will be ushered with priority through Customs and Immigration – no waiting in long queues.<br/>•\tAll transfers will be accompanied by our staff in air-conditioned comfort.<br/><br/>An App Which Keeps You in Contact with Love Ones<br/>•\tWe can provide a personal Travel App for your phone, laptop or tablet that lets you keep in direct contact with your friends and family and gives you updates about any changes to your flights.

The Pyramids of Giza, the ultimate act of devotion Today we start with perhaps the greatest monuments to Egyptian faith, ingenuity and achievement of any civilisation – the pyramids of Giza. The pharaohs Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure were the builders of the Giza Pyramids which have stood for over 4500 years. They are a testament to ancient Egyptians’ engineering skills and also to their grandfather, Sneferu . Sneferu had built 3 pyramids in his lifetime and without him, the Giza Pyramids would not have been built. But many mysteries remain. Similarly, the Sphinx has many mysteries as there are no inscriptions which identify the builder and its purpose. It’s an amazing edifice which we know little about. And then we visit Memphis which was once the capital of ancient Egypt and also the burial ground of the earliest rulers of Egypt. Few of the physical structures remain but the Ramses 11 statues remains at the site. Saqqara – The Saqqara area is the most researched archaeological site in Egypt with recent excavations uncovering new tombs previously unknown. The Stepped Pyramid was the first stone building in all of history and the tallest construction in the world up until the mid 19th century. Beneath it are 4 miles of tunnels and over 400 chambers.

        "description": "Excellence Via Mistakes. The Bent Pyramid – Mistake or Genius? The Bent Pyramid was the name given to Sneferu’s second pyramid building attempt. It became referred to as an architectural mistake. But was it? Cracks started to appear which likely led to reducing the inclination from 53 to 43 degrees. Regardless it was the first attempt to build a smooth sided pyramid. The Red or Perfect Pyramid….or Was It? The third pyramid of Sneferu is referred to as the Red Pyramid and is located close to the Bent Pyramid in Dahshur. It is also the pyramid with the lowest slope, so it reached only 105 meters in height. It has been described as the perfect pyramid but was it as grand as Snefru had wanted. Had Sneferu finally got the design right? Discovering the Roadmap to Eternity. Unas was a pharaoh, the ninth and last ruler of the Fifth Dynasty of Egypt during the Old Kingdom. Unas reigned for 15 to 30 years in the mid-24th century BC (circa 2345–2315 BC), Unas’s pyramid became the subject of investigation in the 1880’s. The hieroglyphics found on the walls of the pharaohs burial chamber corridor, antechamber and passageway was an astonishing ‘find’. On the walls and surrounding the sarcophagus of Unas was the spiritual roadmap for the pharaoh’s ascension to the afterlife. They are referred to as the Pyramid Texts which gave direction to the deceased pharaoh as to to ascend as a god. And as new pyramids and tombs were discovered, the unifying factor for the burial chambers and tombs that was the roadmap to eternal life. It was, perhaps, in the top 3 discoveries about ancient Egypt. The Serapeum and Burial Cults? Serapeum was a burial place of the Apis, sacred bulls, that were incarnations of Ptah. It was believed that the bulls became immortal after death as Osiris-Apis. Apis was a god originally associated with fertility, and later connected with the god Ptah. As the cult gained importance, underground galleries were dug that connected burial chambers. Many other animals were mummified and buried around Saqqara. Sometimes this was as beloved pets, sometimes as food offerings to the deceased, but primarily for religious purposes and dedicated to specific gods. Other animal cemeteries at Saqqara include cats, dogs, jackals, ibis and baboons. Transfer and overnight –The third night at the Cairo Marriott (Nile River) 5 Star Hotel or equivalent.

        "description": "Old Cairo. A UNESCO World Heritage Site. Old Cairo is a historic area in Cairo, which includes the Christian settlement of Coptic Cairo, and the Muslim-era settlements pre-dating the founding of Cairo proper in 969 AD. It is part of what is referred to as Historic Cairo. In 1979, UNESCO designated Old Cairo, as a World Heritage Site, calling it “one of the world’s oldest Islamic cities, with famous mosques, madrasas, hammams and fountains”. The name “Islamic” Cairo refers not to a demographic reference but to the city’s history and heritage since its establishment in the early period of Islam around the 7th century AD. This enclave has one of the largest and densest concentrations of historic architecture in the Islamic world. Coptic Cairo and Christianity. This experience will probably amaze you. That Moses was found in the reeds, at a site that you will visit today, or that Mary, Joseph and Jesus took refuge at the site, the Saints Sergius and Bacchus Church, make this a very special experience. But these events are, by themselves, footnotes in an incredibly rich history of events and people. Welcome to Coptic Cairo a part of Old Cairo. The area includes Coptic Cairo, a walled enclave on the site of the partly preserved Babylon Fortress with the ancient fortress’s walls, towers and its gate still visible. The area has a high concentration of historic Christian churches such as the Hanging Church, the Greek Orthodox Church of St. George, the Church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus, the Church of Santa Barbara, and other Christian buildings.

        "description": "Princes, Palaces and Revolution. The Khan El Khalili bazaar you visit as your first stop today was originally the site of the Za’afran tomb which had been the burial place of the Fatimid rulers of Egypt from 909-1171. Princes who once ruled Egypt. Not many people realise that this now bustling bazaar was the necropolis of the Fatimid rulers. Eventually the Fatimid rulers were overthrown and later the site was transformed in the early 14th century, when Emir Dajaharks Al-Khalili built his market complex on the site. Today, the Khan bazaar has been operating 24 hours a day for over 600 years. Located in the heart of Islamic Cairo, the bazaar is lined with shops, restaurants and cafes selling everything from spices to jewellery to souvenirs. And it is in this historic area where mosques, palaces and monuments of Cairo’s past dominate. And where the mosques are still active places of worship whilst palaces provide glimpses of a life of Egyptian rulers which are now in the past. And We Will Take Coffee at El-Fishawy Cafe And the link from the past to the present is exemplified by El-Fishawy café which has been operating since 1771. It has hosted many renowned figures like the French Military leader Napoléon Bonaparte, the famous German leader Rommel, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir in addition to Arab princes and Empress Eugenie who visited Egypt during Suez Canal inauguration in 1869. The Café also hosted former president Gamal Abdul Nasser. And as they did, this is where we will take coffee or tea (as the famous guests did). Manial Palace After the Muslim conquest of Egypt, parts of Egypt became provinces of successive Muslim dynasties e.g. the Mamluk Sultanate (1250–1517) which exerted its own influences on Egyptian society into the 19th century in particular. But in 1952 the Egyptian monarchy was abolished and the ruling elites (dominated by the Mamluk princes and families) were largely expelled in the revolution led by Abdul Nasser. This experience of the Manial Palace gives insight into the life of the monarchy and ruling classes of Egypt from the 1800’ to the 1900’s. A part of history into the lives of the ruling classes of Egypt at that time. Manial Palace was the former home of Prince Mohammad Ali Tewfik The fifth night at the Cairo Marriott (Nile River) 5 Star Hotel. Dinner included"

It presents the richness, brilliance and innovation of Egyptian society through the ages. It currently houses over 30 mummies from the late to the early kingdom. It’s themes include the Dawn of Civilization, The Nile, Writing, State and Society, Material Culture, Beliefs and Thinking and the Gallery of Royal Mummies. For travellers to Egypt, it provides deep insight to the amazing society that the Egyptians built from prehistoric days to the present. The Museum is in Al Fustat, an area at the heart of Egyptian history. The Museum houses 50,000 artefacts and also the ancient natural lake of Ain El-Sira. The Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM) The Egyptian government’s objective was to offer its citizens and visitors a place where they could see and learn everything about their Pharaonic civilization. Its foundation stone was laid by the former President Hosni Mubarak in 2002. It is part of a new master plan for the Giza Plateau, known as “Giza 2030”. And whilst it has taken years to fruition, the wait was certainly worth it. It is the largest archaeological museum devoted to a single civilisation in the world. Its outstanding design is awe inspiring with views of the neighbouring Giza Plateau (2 kilometres away) and pyramids ever present as you wander its enormous expanse. It occupies a site of over 50 hectares (123 acres). The Grand Egyptian Museum is one of the cornerstones to renew tourism. And yet it doesn’t sit alone. Not far away is another grand plan, that is New Cairo. And that’s not a meek plan either. But it continues the implementation of innovation, vision and commitment. And when you enter the Grand Egyptian Museum, you are connecting with a spirit which is part of Egyptian DNA. You will not be impressed by the museum, you will be awestruck! The realisation of grand plans do that. The sixth night at the Cairo Marriott (Nile River) 5 Star Hotel. Dinner at own cost. Specify the day(s) and details in the boxes then click Update"

        "description": "The Artistry of Egypt. The Museum of Islamic Art in Cairo is acknowledged as the largest museum specialising in Islamic Art in the world. Currently it houses over 100,000 artifacts covering all the different forms of Islamic Art from the various periods of Islamic history. Its collection is comprehensive in quantity and quality of its coverage. This has made it a beacon of Islamic art and civilization throughout its history. It also become the ‘go to’ organisation and library for researchers and historians. It attracts visitors from all walks of life, who are interested in delving into the intricacies of Islamic sciences and disciplines such as medicine, engineering and astronomy. Its collection includes metallic, glass and porcelain utensils, as well as jewellery, weapons, wood and ivory objects, textiles, carpets. The museum also has a large library that has a rich collection of specialized books and references covering a wide variety of topics like Islamic history, antiquities, art and architecture. Ramses Wissa Wassef Art Center Near the pyramids at Giza, the Wissa Wassef centre was founded in the early 1950s by the late architect Ramses Wissa Wassef as a weaving school. It has since evolved to comprise workshops and showrooms, a pottery and sculpture museum, houses and farm buildings, constructed entirely of mud brick. For Wissa Wassef, vaulted and domed mud brick structures represented something quintessentially Egyptian as these forms had been adopted in turn by Paranoiac, Coptic and Islamic civilisations. The choice of this traditional technology also reflected his desire to transmit the values of handicraft to succeeding generations in a rapidly industrialising country. The Ramses Wissa Wassef Art Center was the home of a unique experiment in tapestry weaving that has produced extraordinary works admired and collected by museums and galleries around the world. And is ceramic creations was also a passion that drove him in his life. The Adam Henein Museum Adam Henein was renowned as a sculptor since the 1950s and rose to fame for the inspiration his art drew from ancient Egypt. He was awarded the Luxor Studio Scholarship for Distinguished Artists in the West Bank and Qurna in 1954 and 1955 and led the restoration of the Great Sphinx of Giza from 1989 to 1998. After living in Paris, he returned to Egypt and started the International Sculpture Symposium in Aswan. He received many awards, including Egypt’s State Medal and the Mubarak Award. Henein’s art has been shown worldwide, from Alexandria to Rome, and displayed in world-class platforms like New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art. The main museum building consists of 3 floors, spread across the space of 700 meters, displaying an array of Adam’s work, featuring sculptures, drawings, paintings, prints, and even textiles. In addition to the main building, the museum’s garden is where Adam’s pieces blend in with nature. This open space is where the museum’s public audience get to sit down on the fresh grass and have a cup of coffee while having the chance to admire more of Adam’s artworks. Since Adam himself oversaw and supervised the process of establishing and equipping the museum, you walk around the space knowing that the artist himself chose every tiny detail around the museum.

Each offers a unique view of the 32 metre wide dome, which had been assembled on the ground and then lifted up. Drawings by Egyptian artists were painted on special fabrics which were then installed in place. The main chandelier (50 tonnes and the heaviest in the world) hangs mid-air under the dome, with lanterns offering a nostalgic aura within its Islamic star design.

Ships often have to queue to proceed through the locks, a great opportunity to check out the process from deck with a cool drink in hand, listening to the shouts of the many captains as they navigate their way through the various small boats of merchants selling their wares to a captive audience. On arrival in Luxor, join your leader for an orientation walk of the town. You have the option to visit Luxor Temple, which looks incredible, lit up at night.

One of the world's most celebrated temple complexes, Karnak is a house of the gods built over a period of some 200 years. Your guided tour of this vast temple of impressive pylons, obelisks and chapels will reveal its finest sections, such as the Avenue of Sphinxes and the Great Temple of Amun.

With your leader, explore this place, where the pharaohs of the New Kingdom (16th to 11th century BC) were secretly interred for all eternity, and where discoveries are still being made. Your group leader will explain the history and legends of these remarkable people, and the significance of the many paintings and hieroglyphics, still well preserved in the deepest tombs. You will visit three of the royal tombs, including Tutankhamun’s tomb where Tutankhamun is buried, then continue to the Temple of Queen Hatshepsut – a colonnaded building set against high cliffs that create a spectacular natural amphitheatre. The afternoon is yours to explore – perhaps you'd like to shop in the market or visit the world's first Mummification Museum where you can discover the secrets of pharaonic preservation."

Enjoy a tasty Koshary Lunch and visit the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM) Our Egyptian adventure begins at the Giza Plateau, home to the iconic Great Pyramids – arguably the most recognizable ancient structures in the world. These colossal monuments, built by the Pharaohs Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure around 2500 BC, have captivated travelers and scholars for centuries. Our expert Egyptologist guide will be your key to unlocking the secrets of these ancient wonders. They'll share fascinating insights into the construction techniques, the religious beliefs that inspired their creation, and the stories of the pharaohs who were laid to rest within these monumental tombs. You'll learn how these pyramids fit into the broader narrative of ancient Egyptian history and gain a deeper appreciation for the ingenuity and ambition of this remarkable civilization. For those who are feeling adventurous (and not claustrophobic!), you'll have the opportunity to venture inside one of the pyramids. Descend into the cool, dimly lit passageways and experience the unique atmosphere of these ancient chambers. It's a truly unforgettable experience that brings you face-to-face with the past.

This majestic guardian, nestled close to the pyramids, was only fully uncovered in the 1920s, adding to its mystique. Stand in awe of its imposing presence and contemplate the mysteries it holds. After our awe-inspiring visit to the Sphinx, we'll take a well-deserved break to refuel with a delicious Koshary lunch. This beloved Egyptian dish is a true culinary adventure, a hearty and flavorful combination of rice, lentils, macaroni, chickpeas, and a tangy tomato sauce, topped with crispy fried onions. It's a symphony of textures and tastes that perfectly embodies the country's rich culinary heritage and will leave you feeling satisfied and ready for the next adventure!

Overnight train to Aswan We start our exploration of Egypt with the iconic three great pyramids at Giza, on the outskirts of Cairo. Probably the most recognizable ancient buildings in the world, these three pyramids were built pyramids were built by the Pharaohs Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure around 2500 years BC. Our Egyptologist guide will start your introduction into Egyptian history here with information on how and why pyramids were built and how they fit into the whole ancient Pharaonic story. You’ll have the chance to climb down inside one of these pyramids if you wish (and if you’re not claustrophobic!). Our next visit is the majestic Sphinx, which nestles nearby, and was uncovered completely only in the 1920s. After your awe-inspiring visit to the Sphinx, we'll take a well-deserved break to refuel with an included Koshary lunch. Koshary is a beloved Egyptian staple, a hearty and flavorful dish that perfectly embodies the country's culinary heritage. Koshary consists of a bed of fluffy rice and lentils, topped with perfectly cooked macaroni and chickpeas, all brought together with a tangy tomato sauce and a sprinkle of crispy fried onions. It's a symphony of textures and tastes that will leave you feeling satisfied and ready for the next adventure! After lunch you'll have some free time to visit the Egyptian Museum of antiquities, home to the treasures of ancient Egypt. This evening we will board the overnight VIP seater train from Cairo to Aswan. For those preferring more comfort, there is the option of upgrading to the sleeper train where you will have a private cabin onboard with airline style meals included. OVERNIGHT"

The entire complex was carefully dismantled and relocated to its current location following the construction of the Aswan High Dam, ensuring its preservation for generations to come. Speaking of the dam, we'll also pay a visit to the impressive Aswan High Dam, a monumental feat of engineering that harnessed the power of the Nile and created Lake Nasser, one of the world's largest man-made lakes.

        "description": ": Our tour starts today in Cairo, Egypt's bustling capital sitting on the banks of the River Nile. This sprawling metropolis is a jumble of modern buildings, ancient landmarks and maze-like streets, offering the best Pharaonic, Coptic and Islamic sites in Egypt. For those arriving on time, our tour leader plans to meet you in the hotel reception at 6pm for a welcome meeting and for those that wish, there is the chance to go out for dinner. There are no other activities planned today, so you're free to arrive in Cairo at any time. If you'd like an airport transfer today, you'll need to arrive into Cairo International Airport (CAI), which is around a 40-minute drive from our centrally located hotel. Should you miss the welcome meeting, our tour leader will inform you of any essential information as soon as you catch up. If your flight arrives earlier in the day, you might like to catch your first glimpse of the mighty Nile River, visit the capital's medieval market at Khan el Khalili or we can arrange a half-day Islamic Cairo tour, all within easy reach of our base in Cairo. Alternatively, our hotel has a swimming pool so you may just like to relax after your flight."

        "description": ": Cairo is situated mainly on the east bank of the Nile. This morning, we'll take a short drive to Giza, to visit one of the seven ancient wonders of the world, the Pyramids, among the most impressive man-made spectacles in the world. Here, you can opt to venture inside one of the main pyramids or take in the Solar Boat Museum, designed to transport the Pharaoh's soul to the afterlife. The complex includes the Sphinx, a crouching lion with a human head carved from solid rock and the splendid Granite Temple. In the afternoon, we'll move on to the new Grand Egyptian Museum, which (amongst its 100,000 artefacts) houses the extraordinary treasures of Tutankhamun, complete with his Golden Mask. The scale of the exhibit is incredible and it's mind-boggling to comprehend they were all discovered in his tomb at the Valley of the Kings. Later this afternoon, we'll transfer to the station to catch the overnight sleeper train to Aswan. The individual compartments contain a bench seat which converts into bunk beds. The carriage steward sets this up and provides bed linen, blankets and pillows. Each cabin is lockable and has a night light and cupboard with a small sink, shelf, mirror, towel and power socket, plus there is a tabletop that folds into the wall. Dinner and breakfast are delivered directly to you by the carriage steward. Two Western-style toilets are located at the end of each carriage and there is a communal lounge carriage with a bar serving soft drinks. Some cabins have interconnecting doors so families have access to each other."

Located on the east bank, just below the First Cataract, it's the meeting point of Arab culture with Nubia and Black Africa. Our early arrival allows us time to take an excursion to the Philae Temple marooned on a picturesque island, having been relocated when the original site was flooded following completion of the Aswan dam. The temple is adorned with beautifully carved pylons containing some of Egypt's finest carvings. We travel to the island and back on a small motorboat. Returning to our hotel around lunch time, the afternoon is free to relax and enjoy the swimming pool which lies almost directly on the banks of the Nile offering great views of boats and local life. Alternatively, you may wish to explore the vibrant local bazaar just a short walk away. Packed full of exotic spices, leather goods and richly decorated crafts it's an ideal place to spend a couple of hours."

        "description": ": This morning, there is the option to drive through the desert to the fabulous rock-hewn temple of Abu Simbel, a major highlight for many who visit Aswan. Cut into the rock face, this enormous structure was raised 61 metres/200 feet to save it from being flooded by the artificial lake that was created by the building of the Aswan High Dam. The 20-metre/65-foot high statues represent Ramses II, known as the Great Builder and one of the most powerful Pharaohs of the New Kingdom. For those choosing this option, we'll need to leave very early, around 4.30am, returning to Aswan around 13.30pm. On returning to Aswan, we'll board our feluccas straight from the hotel and set sail downstream, travelling through the timeless landscape of the Nile Valley, in the time-honoured fashion of the ancient Egyptians themselves. As we sail, we'll see the intensive cultivation of the Nile Valley and at intermittent points, there are small villages that depend upon the river for their livelihood. Tonight, we'll stay at a traditional Nubian homestay, with a sandy courtyard in the middle where the family gathers for meals, and bedrooms to the side. We'll use a mixture of rooms, where possible with families being accommodated in their rooms although smaller houses have communal rooms. If you wish to, you can lend a hand in the kitchen to help cook dinner, or maybe kick around a football in the courtyard with the kids. There are few better ways to understand a country and its people than with a local homestay, and you'll have the chance tonight to experience local living."

There is ample time to sit back and enjoy the easy pace watching rural life in front of you. At night, we tie up to the riverbank and listen to Nubian songs and drums around the campfire. Traditional felucca additional information: A felucca is a traditional sailboat used in Egypt, the primary mode of transport on the mighty Nile River and unchanged over the centuries. Feluccas rely entirely on the breeze to make their way up the Nile, typically the breeze picks up during the day and tails off at night, making for a relaxing and tranquil way to travel as we watch life unfold along the riverbanks. Sleeping arrangements are on deck, please note sleeping bags are not provided, you can either bring your own or hire locally via our local agent. During the summer months, a sleeping bag may not be needed but you might consider bringing a sleeping bag liner."

        "description": ": Arguably Egypt's most well-known site, this morning we rise early to visit the world famous Valley of the Kings, most well known as the burial site of Tutankhamun discovered in 1922 by British Egyptology Howard Carter, along with another 62 royal tombs. Our visit includes entrance to three of the tombs which will be decided on the day, as many are periodically closed for resting and renovation to protect them. After the three, there will be an option to pay a supplement to visit Tutankhamun's tomb. Our next stop is the Temple of Hatshepsut. Pharaoh Hatshepsut is believed to be the most successful reigning female power of Egypt, no mean feat during Ancient Egyptian times, and was buried alongside her male counterparts in the Valley of the Kings. Historians throughout modern history offer contrasting information about her reign but walking into the shadow of Hatshepsut's immense temple, which is built into the limestone rock face on Luxor's West Bank, is a key symbol of her achievements. The structure is unexpectedly modern by design and was once linked directly with Karnak Temple on the East Bank. Continuing our exploration of the west bank, we visit the striking Habu temple, one of the less visited sites on the west bank and very much underrated. The temple complex is dominated by the highly decorated and well-preserved funeral temple of Ramses III depicting scenes of conquests and famous battles. The complex also houses the Temple of Amun, built by Hatshepsut and Tuthmosis III. With the backdrop of the village in the foreground and the Theban hills behind its fitting end to our morning of visiting some of Egypt's best preserved ancient sites. A home cooked lunch is included today at a local family's house on the west bank. Sample traditional dishes such as okra stew, koshari made with rice, lentils, pasta and chickpeas and tagen, a rich tasty tomato based dish, all served with delicious freshly baked bread. After lunch we head back to our hotel, with time to relax for the rest of the afternoon to take a dip in the hotel pool or take a stroll to the lively markets in Luxor."

Pick up will be from your hotel between 0430 and 0500. See the budgeting section for more details. We check out of our hotel and drive to the stunning Temple of Karnak in Luxor. Dating from around 2000 BC, the scale and grandeur of Karnak is amazing. It covers an area the size of 10 European cathedrals and the 134 pillars of its Hypostyle Hall are a wonder to behold. After our guided tour around the complex we will have additional time to explore the halls and ornate carvings. After our visit here we depart the Nile Valley and head east to the shores of the Red Sea. Crossing the barren mountains of the Eastern Desert we drive to the town of Hurghada, where we will enjoy the delights of a marine wonderland in stark contrast to the desert scenery that surrounds it. There is time to relax and enjoy the dazzling waters immediately outside our hotel. The journey time today is approximately four hours. Our four star hotel in Hurghada is located twenty minutes to the south of the main town, with direct access to its own private beach. In contrast with the Nile region, Hurghada is more of a mainstream tourism destination with larger hotel chains. Whilst the town lacks some of the character found in other destinations covered on our trip, there are excellent facilities on offer, including a choice of two swimming pools and three in house restaurants, including a seafood restaurant."

The ticket usually allows entry into what are regarded as the most impressive tombs, but a visit to the tombs of Ramses VI and Tutankhamun (both extra tickets, payable locally) are recommended. Visits to tombs are now strictly controlled to halt further deterioration of wall paintings – each tomb is periodically closed for several weeks.

The experience is enriched by a guided tour of the renowned Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM), home to Tutankhamun’s treasures, and a taste of local culture with a traditional Koshary lunch. The journey bookends with a return to the capital to explore the historic backstreets of Old Cairo and the vibrant Khan-el-Khalili bazaar, offering a perfect opportunity to soak up the atmosphere and hunt for souvenirs. Leaving the bustle of Cairo behind, the tour flies south to Aswan for a stay in a traditional Nubian Village, offering a unique glimpse into local life.

        "description": "Explore Ancient Jerash and Amman, Street Food Experience & evening visit to the Wild Jordan Centre We begin our day travelling north from Amman to the nearby city of Jerash, home to one of the largest and best-preserved examples of Roman architecture outside of Italy. Often called the 'Jewel of the North', Jerash reveals an unbroken history of human settlement stretching back over 6,500 years. Hidden beneath sand for centuries, extensive excavations and restorations over the last 70 years have uncovered a remarkable example of the grand, formal Roman provincial urbanism typical throughout the Middle East. Upon returning to Amman in the afternoon, we explore Jordan's capital, famously known as the 'white city' due to its abundance of white limestone buildings. Amman's history spans millennia, with archaeological work uncovering remains from the Neolithic period through the Hellenistic, late Roman, and Arab Islamic eras. Our tour includes the Citadel, the historic site of the Temple of Hercules, the Umayyad Palace, and the Byzantine Church. We will also visit the impressive 6,000-seat Roman Theatre, dating back to when the city was known as Philadelphia. Following our exploration of the historical sites, we delve into the vibrant atmosphere of Downtown Amman with a street food tasting experience. You'll have the chance to sample local delicacies, which typically include sweet Kunefa, refreshing Sugar Cane Juice, and savoury Falafel, though specific offerings may vary based on availability during our visit. Afterwards, there will be time to return to the hotel to refresh before our evening activity. To conclude our day, we'll enjoy an evening visit to the Wild Jordan Centre. This unique establishment is not only a fantastic spot to relax but also plays a crucial role in supporting Jordan's natural heritage and local communities. It serves as a hub for the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature's ecotourism and handicraft projects, promoting sustainability by generating income for rural communities living in and around Jordan's nature reserves and aiding conservation efforts. For those who would prefer a more relaxed evening, you are welcome to remain at the hotel instead. OVERNIGHT"

Optional Petra by Night or Cookery Class We leave Amman behind us today as we drive along the scenic King's Highway towards Petra. The drive itself is beautiful, crossing deep wadis, passing through olive groves, and navigating remote rural villages, offering you a unique insight into the daily lives of the local people. Our first stop will be at Madaba, where we visit the Greek Orthodox Church of St. George, famed for its remarkable 6th-century Byzantine mosaic map depicting the Holy Land and other biblical sites. Next, we'll venture up Mount Nebo, a significant viewpoint offering breathtaking panoramic views over the Jordan Valley towards the Holy Land. We'll hit the road once more, this time crossing the stunning Wadi al-Mujib gorge. The route winds through olive groves before climbing over the deep canyon until we reach Shobak Castle. Perched dramatically on a mountainside, Shobak is another impressive example of the Crusader castles built during the early 12th century to guard the vital trade routes between Egypt and Damascus. Upon arrival in Petra, we'll check into our hotel. This evening offers two optional activities for you to choose from. You could opt for a magical first glimpse of Petra with the atmospheric Petra by Candlelight experience, walking through the Siq canyon to see the iconic Treasury illuminated solely by hundreds of candles. Alternatively, food enthusiasts might enjoy participating in a hands-on cooking class at the renowned Petra Kitchen, learning the secrets of preparing traditional Jordanian dishes.

        "description": "Full day exploration of Petra, camping underneath the stars in Wadi Rum Today is all about exploring the Nabataean site of Petra. It was once the ancient capital of the Nabataean commercial empire until the Romans finally took over in 106 AD. For a long period, Petra was forgotten – except by the local Bedouins – before it was rediscovered in 1812 by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt. Petra is found at the edge of the Wadi Araba desert, where canyon walls and towering hills make it virtually inaccessible, except via a narrow cleft in the rock known as the Siq. There are very few free-standing buildings in Petra, as the Nabataeans chose to carve their dwellings into the multicoloured sandstone cliffs. Petra has become one of Jordan's main tourist attractions. We have most of the day available today to explore this ancient city (a 2-3 hour guided tour, then free time to explore independently). We start by making our way through the Siq, which rises to 200 metres above us and narrows to just 2 metres wide in certain sections. Keep an eye out for the ancient Nabataean water channel still visible on one wall, and remnants of the terracotta pipes that brought water into the city are also present. We'll turn a corner and suddenly – one of the most familiar sights of Petra will be in front of you – The Khazneh (Treasury) comes into view. Our guide will explain how this, and the other buildings here, are mainly elaborate facades carved into the rock from the top down, and also discuss the spiritual significance of the building style. From the Treasury, the valley opens out, and you'll see tombs carved into the rock on both sides. You'll get a glimpse of the ruined Roman amphitheatre and colonnaded streets. During your free time, you can walk up a steep and narrow winding gorge to the towering 'Monastery' – which is 50 metres high and 45 metres wide, providing breathtaking views of the Wadi Araba desert and the Jordan Valley. Another climb takes you to the High Place of Sacrifice and the Lion Fountain. All in all, this is a full and tiring, but hugely rewarding, day touring one of the world's most famous ancient sites. Walking distances today are an absolute minimum of 3km through the Siq to the Treasury and back, plus distance to see a few tombs; 8km to take the trail on as far as the main basin; plus an additional few km to the Monastery and back (over 800 steps up and down). For those with less mobility or who are worried about the distance golf buggies are available for around 25 USD per person one way 40 USD per person round trip to take you on the 1.2km journey through the Siq to the Treasury and back again at an agreed time. Horse carriages are also available but we recommend against using these due to animal welfare reasons. Later in the afternoon, we leave Petra and drive into the spectacular desert scenery of Wadi Rum. Whilst staying in Wadi Rum, several optional activities are available to enhance your desert experience, such as taking a traditional camel ride through the sand dunes, soaring above the landscape on a hot air balloon flight (typically at dawn, weather permitting), or enjoying an adventurous desert quad biking excursion. Upon arrival at our camp, friendly Bedouin hosts will greet us at our comfortable site, nestled beneath towering rocks and cliffs. We spend the evening relaxing at the camp and enjoying a delicious traditional Jordanian meal. As night falls and the stars emerge, there is also an option to join a captivating astronomy experience, taking advantage of Wadi Rum's exceptionally clear desert skies and unique vantage point to observe stars, constellations, and planets in incredible detail.

Keep an eye out for the copper-coloured rocky 'jebels', which mesmerised T.E. Lawrence during his visits to the desert during the Arab Revolt and were later famed in the movie Lawrence of Arabia. We'll take a jeep safari through the stunning desert landscape, seeing more of the sheer cliffs and bizarre, weathered rock formations. We say goodbye to Wadi Rum later in the morning and head north towards the Dead Sea, one of the planet's most spectacular natural and spiritual landscapes. Not only is it the lowest point on Earth, at approximately 400 metres below sea level, but it's also filled with dramatic, natural wonders. The Dead Sea is fed by numerous rivers, including the River Jordan. Once the waters reach the Dead Sea, they are land-locked with no outlet, so they evaporate under the intense desert sun. This process leaves behind a dense, rich cocktail of salts and minerals, renowned worldwide and supplying the cosmetics, agriculture, and medicine industries with some of their finest raw products. The Dead Sea is flanked by mountains to the east and the rolling hills towards Jerusalem to the west, giving it an almost otherworldly beauty. Although sparsely populated and serenely quiet now, the area is believed by some to have been home to five Biblical cities"

    "generalInfo": "For those that have always dreamt of exploring the historic treasures of Jordan and Egypt, but always found the cost prohibitive, now comes this exceptional tour designed for those with much to see but a smaller budget. You’ll visit many of the key landmarks across both countries, with optional activities available too, and come away with enough memories to last two lifetimes.<br/>You’ll begin in Jordan, with time to settle in mingled with exploration of key sites including the 6000-seat Roman theatre, still in use today, and the ancient hilltop ruins of Jerash outside Amman, its temples, baths, fountains and theatres only recently unearthed from the desert sands.<br/><br/>Naturally, this tour includes a day at Jordan’s most celebrated historic attraction – Petra. Reached over the scenic King’s Highway, Petra is best-known for the dramatic Treasury hewn into the rock, but you’ll also enjoy the experience of squeezing through the vast rock walls of the Siq to enter this ancient city. Leaving Petra after a fascinating tour, you’ll enter the Wadi Rum, which once inspired T.E. Lawrence, for a fun jeep safari and a swim in the Dead Sea, as well as a night in a traditional Bedouin camp.<br/><br/>Flying to Cairo, the pace doesn’t let up, as you tour the Egyptian Museum with a professional Egyptologist, before exploring the incredible Pyramids of Giza and the Sphinx just outside the capital. Afterwards, you’ll be driven down to Aswan via the Temple of Philae, where you will board a charming felucca sailboat for a relaxed cruise along the Nile. Over the next few days, alternating between nights aboard the boat with its basic facilities and hotels, you’ll pause to visit sites including the temples of Luxor and Karnak, Kom Ombo and the Valley of the Kings. As you travel, you can enhance your experience with optional activities such as a daytrip to Abu Simbel and a Nubian village, or a fantastic hot air balloon flight over Luxor.<br/><br/>Finish in Cairo, with a cultural show and the option to take a wander around the lively Khan-el-Khalili bazaar.<br/><br/>Note: This price does not include the flight from Amman to Cairo, as you can often purchase this more cost effectively as part of your main flight ticket. The operator will however be happy to arrange any international flights on request.<br/>",

        "description": "Explore Ancient Jerash and Amman, Street Food Experience & evening visit to the Wild Jordan Centre We begin our day travelling north from Amman to the nearby city of Jerash, home to one of the largest and best-preserved examples of Roman architecture outside of Italy. Often called the 'Jewel of the North', Jerash reveals an unbroken history of human settlement stretching back over 6,500 years. Hidden beneath sand for centuries, extensive excavations and restorations over the last 70 years have uncovered a remarkable example of the grand, formal Roman provincial urbanism typical throughout the Middle East. Upon returning to Amman in the afternoon, we explore Jordan's capital, famously known as the 'white city' due to its abundance of white limestone buildings. Amman's history spans millennia, with archaeological work uncovering remains from the Neolithic period through the Hellenistic, late Roman, and Arab Islamic eras. Our tour includes the Citadel, the historic site of the Temple of Hercules, the Umayyad Palace, and the Byzantine Church. We will also visit the impressive 6,000-seat Roman Theatre, dating back to when the city was known as Philadelphia. Following our exploration of the historical sites, we delve into the vibrant atmosphere of Downtown Amman with a street food tasting experience. You'll have the chance to sample local delicacies, which typically include sweet Kunefa, refreshing Sugar Cane Juice, and savoury Falafel, though specific offerings may vary based on availability during our visit. Afterwards, there will be time to return to the hotel to refresh before our evening activity. To conclude our day, we'll enjoy an evening visit to the Wild Jordan Centre. This unique establishment is not only a fantastic spot to relax but also plays a crucial role in supporting Jordan's natural heritage and local communities. It serves as a hub for the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature's ecotourism and handicraft projects, promoting sustainability by generating income for rural communities living in and around Jordan's nature reserves and aiding conservation efforts. For those who would prefer a more relaxed evening, you are welcome to remain at the hotel instead. OVERNIGHT"

        "description": "Kings Highway to Petra with stops in Madaba, Mount Nebo & Shobak Castle. Optional Petra by Night or Cookery Class We leave Amman behind us today as we drive along the scenic King's Highway towards Petra. The drive itself is beautiful, crossing deep wadis, passing through olive groves, and navigating remote rural villages, offering you a unique insight into the daily lives of the local people. Our first stop will be at Madaba, where we visit the Greek Orthodox Church of St. George, famed for its remarkable 6th-century Byzantine mosaic map depicting the Holy Land and other biblical sites. Next, we'll venture up Mount Nebo, a significant viewpoint offering breathtaking panoramic views over the Jordan Valley towards the Holy Land. We'll hit the road once more, this time crossing the stunning Wadi al-Mujib gorge. The route winds through olive groves before climbing over the deep canyon until we reach Shobak Castle. Perched dramatically on a mountainside, Shobak is another impressive example of the Crusader castles built during the early 12th century to guard the vital trade routes between Egypt and Damascus. Upon arrival in Petra, we'll check into our hotel. This evening offers two optional activities for you to choose from. You could opt for a magical first glimpse of Petra with the atmospheric Petra by Candlelight experience, walking through the Siq canyon to see the iconic Treasury illuminated solely by hundreds of candles. Alternatively, food enthusiasts might enjoy participating in a hands-on cooking class at the renowned Petra Kitchen, learning the secrets of preparing traditional Jordanian dishes. Please note that pre-booking is essential for the Petra Kitchen experience as it is very popular and spaces are limited. OVERNIGHT"

        "description": "Full day exploration of Petra, camping underneath the stars in Wadi Rum Today is all about exploring the Nabataean site of Petra. It was once the ancient capital of the Nabataean commercial empire until the Romans finally took over in 106 AD. For a long period, Petra was forgotten – except by the local Bedouins – before it was rediscovered in 1812 by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt. Petra is found at the edge of the Wadi Araba desert, where canyon walls and towering hills make it virtually inaccessible, except via a narrow cleft in the rock known as the Siq. There are very few free-standing buildings in Petra, as the Nabataeans chose to carve their dwellings into the multicoloured sandstone cliffs. Petra has become one of Jordan's main tourist attractions. We have most of the day available today to explore this ancient city (a 2-3 hour guided tour, then free time to explore independently). We start by making our way through the Siq, which rises to 200 metres above us and narrows to just 2 metres wide in certain sections. Keep an eye out for the ancient Nabataean water channel still visible on one wall, and remnants of the terracotta pipes that brought water into the city are also present. We'll turn a corner and suddenly – one of the most familiar sights of Petra will be in front of you – The Khazneh (Treasury) comes into view. Our guide will explain how this, and the other buildings here, are mainly elaborate facades carved into the rock from the top down, and also discuss the spiritual significance of the building style. From the Treasury, the valley opens out, and you'll see tombs carved into the rock on both sides. You'll get a glimpse of the ruined Roman amphitheatre and colonnaded streets. During your free time, you can walk up a steep and narrow winding gorge to the towering 'Monastery' – which is 50 metres high and 45 metres wide, providing breathtaking views of the Wadi Araba desert and the Jordan Valley. Another climb takes you to the High Place of Sacrifice and the Lion Fountain. All in all, this is a full and tiring, but hugely rewarding, day touring one of the world's most famous ancient sites. Walking distances today are an absolute minimum of 3km through the Siq to the Treasury and back, plus distance to see a few tombs; 8km to take the trail on as far as the main basin; plus an additional few km to the Monastery and back (over 800 steps up and down). For those with less mobility or who are worried about the distance golf buggies are available for around 25 USD per person one way 40 USD per person round trip to take you on the 1.2km journey through the Siq to the Treasury and back again at an agreed time. Horse carriages are also available but we recommend against using these due to animal welfare reasons. Later in the afternoon, we leave Petra and drive into the spectacular desert scenery of Wadi Rum. Whilst staying in Wadi Rum, several optional activities are available to enhance your desert experience, such as taking a traditional camel ride through the sand dunes, soaring above the landscape on a hot air balloon flight (typically at dawn, weather permitting), or enjoying an adventurous desert quad biking excursion. Upon arrival at our camp, friendly Bedouin hosts will greet us at our comfortable site, nestled beneath towering rocks and cliffs. We spend the evening relaxing at the camp and enjoying a delicious traditional Jordanian meal. As night falls and the stars emerge, there is also an option to join a captivating astronomy experience, taking advantage of Wadi Rum's exceptionally clear desert skies and unique vantage point to observe stars, constellations, and planets in incredible detail.

        "description": "Wadi Rum Jeep Safari and overnight stay at the Dead Sea (optional excursion to Wadi Mujib) We start the day early, exploring the beautiful desert and mountain scenery of Wadi Rum. Keep an eye out for the copper-coloured rocky 'jebels', which mesmerised T.E. Lawrence during his visits to the desert during the Arab Revolt and were later famed in the movie Lawrence of Arabia. We'll take a jeep safari through the stunning desert landscape, seeing more of the sheer cliffs and bizarre, weathered rock formations. We say goodbye to Wadi Rum later in the morning and head north towards the Dead Sea, one of the planet's most spectacular natural and spiritual landscapes. Not only is it the lowest point on Earth, at approximately 400 metres below sea level, but it's also filled with dramatic, natural wonders. The Dead Sea is fed by numerous rivers, including the River Jordan. Once the waters reach the Dead Sea, they are land-locked with no outlet, so they evaporate under the intense desert sun. This process leaves behind a dense, rich cocktail of salts and minerals, renowned worldwide and supplying the cosmetics, agriculture, and medicine industries with some of their finest raw products. The Dead Sea is flanked by mountains to the east and the rolling hills towards Jerusalem to the west, giving it an almost otherworldly beauty. Although sparsely populated and serenely quiet now, the area is believed by some to have been home to five Biblical cities"

        "description": "Cairo, Pyramids & Sphinx at Giza. Included Koshary Lunch. Overnight train to Aswan We start our exploration of Egypt with the iconic three great pyramids at Giza, on the outskirts of Cairo. Probably the most recognizable ancient buildings in the world, these three pyramids were built pyramids were built by the Pharaohs Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure around 2500 years BC. Our Egyptologist guide will start your introduction into Egyptian history here with information on how and why pyramids were built and how they fit into the whole ancient Pharaonic story. You’ll have the chance to climb down inside one of these pyramids if you wish (and if you’re not claustrophobic!). Our next visit is the majestic Sphinx, which nestles nearby, and was uncovered completely only in the 1920s. After your awe-inspiring visit to the Sphinx, we'll take a well-deserved break to refuel with an included Koshary lunch. Koshary is a beloved Egyptian staple, a hearty and flavorful dish that perfectly embodies the country's culinary heritage. Koshary consists of a bed of fluffy rice and lentils, topped with perfectly cooked macaroni and chickpeas, all brought together with a tangy tomato sauce and a sprinkle of crispy fried onions. It's a symphony of textures and tastes that will leave you feeling satisfied and ready for the next adventure! After lunch you'll have some free time to visit the Egyptian Museum of antiquities, home to the treasures of ancient Egypt. This evening we will board the overnight VIP seater train from Cairo to Aswan. For those preferring more comfort, there is the option of upgrading to the sleeper train where you will have a private cabin onboard with airline style meals included. OVERNIGHT"

Many descendants of the Nubian people still live around Aswan and during our stay we’ll see their colourful houses. This morning we’ll take a boat trip to visit one of Egypt’s most beautifully situated temples which was also reclaimed from the rising waters of Lake Nasser. This is the Temple of Philae, which was dedicated to Isis. After visiting Philae Temple, we'll head south of Aswan to visit one of the Nubian Villages where we'll have the opportunity to experience the local way of life and visit the local homes of the Nubian people and even spend the night in a Nubian style hotel.

Luxor is the jewel in Egypt’s crown with the largest concentrations of ancient ruins in the Nile Valley, if not the world. These are split across both banks of the Nile, with the City of the Dead on the West Bank with many mortuary temples and tombs cut into the rocky mountains, and with the Temples of Luxor and Karnak and their connecting Avenue of Sphinxes the highlights on the East Bank. Later this evening there is an optional tour available to Luxor Temple which is right in the middle of town and beautifully lit up at night.

In Jordan, you get to see Jerash – a fantastically preserved Classical city, regarded by some as impressive as Petra. You also get to see the work of the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature (RSCN), who are preserving the landscapes, wildlife and old traditions and crafts of the country.<br/><br/>In Egypt, you visit the Egyptian museum, a treasure house of Egyptian history, and will explore Coptic Cairo. The Copts, a Christian church, form a sizable minority in Egypt, and their language is a direct descendant of Ancient Egyptian – so if you are lucky enough to hear a service, you will be hearing hieroglyphics out loud.",

Our visit includes entrance to three of the tombs, which will be decided on the day, as many are periodically closed for resting and renovation to protect them. After the three, there will be an option to pay a supplement to visit Tutankhamun's tomb. Our next stop is the Temple of Hatshepsut. Pharaoh Hatshepsut is believed to be the most successful reigning female power of Egypt, no mean feat during Ancient Egyptian times, and was buried alongside her male counterparts in the Valley of the Kings. Historians throughout modern history offer contrasting information about her reign, but walking into the shadow of Hatshepsut's immense temple, which is built into the limestone rock face on Luxor's West Bank, is a key symbol of her achievements. The structure is unexpectedly modern by design and was once linked directly with Karnak Temple on the East Bank. Continuing our exploration of the West Bank, we'll visit the striking Habu temple, one of the less-visited sites on the West Bank and very much underrated. The temple complex is dominated by the highly decorated and well-preserved funeral temple of Ramses III, depicting scenes of conquests and famous battles. The complex also houses the Temple of Amun, built by Hatshepsut and Tuthmosis III. With the backdrop of the village in the foreground and the Theban hills behind it's a fitting end to our morning of visiting some of Egypt's best-preserved ancient sites. We'll enjoy a home-cooked lunch at a local family home on the West Bank today, where we'll sample traditional dishes such as okra stew, koshari made with rice, lentils, pasta and chickpeas and tagen, a rich and tasty tomato-based dish, all served with freshly baked bread. We'll arrive back at our hotel mid-afternoon with time to relax, take a dip in the hotel pool or enjoy a stroll to the lively markets in Luxor."

A discreet hillside entrance takes us underground; a series of corridors and ante-chambers leading to the burial chamber and sarcophagus. The walls are covered in brightly painted images and hieroglyphs – a map of the afterlife to ensure the king’s safe passage. One ticket allows us to see three tombs. The ticket usually allows entry into what are regarded as the most impressive tombs, but if you have time, a visit to the tomb of Ramses VI is also highly recommended. Visits to tombs are now strictly controlled to halt further deterioration of wall paintings – each tomb is periodically closed for several weeks. Entry to Tutankhamun’s tomb costs approximately US$12, payable locally. In terms of size and decoration, it is not as impressive as many of the other tombs but is historically very interesting. Next, we visit Hatshepsut Temple and Colossi of Memnon.

The sunsets over the Nile are stunning and travelling from Luxor to Aswan, enjoying the beauty of the verdant landscape, make this journey special.

        "description": "Today, there is the choice to have a full day in Aswan or an optional visit to Abu Simbel. Aswan is a laid-back town that reflects the character of its largely Nubian inhabitants, known for being friendly and hospitable. By virtue of its position on the old caravan route, it has always been a trading centre and we thoroughly recommend a visit to the packed bazaar today where merchants display a wealth of exotic spices, carpets, leather goods and countless other wares. Today there’s also the option of flying to the magnificent temples of Abu Simbel, 186mi (300km) to the south through the Nubian Desert. Built by Ramses II, the two temples are certainly some of the most spectacular in Egypt. Originally on the banks of the Nile, the temples were raised to a new site above the lake in the late 1960s, as the waters from the new Lake Nasser rose behind the Aswan High Dam. The four great seated statues of Ramses II stare east towards the rising sun. You are picked up from the boat early in the morning with a breakfast box and arrive back to Aswan in the afternoon. Later in the day, we enjoy a sunset sail on a felucca, a traditional wooden sailing boat. Feluccas have been a fixture on the Nile for centuries and are used in the protected waters of the Red Sea and eastern Mediterranean. The deck is strewn with soft, colourful cushions and rugs and equipped with a canopy offering shade. We spend our last evening on board the MS Movenpick Royal Lily or Royal Lotus.

During this excursion, we also visit Aswan High Dam, and you have the option of visiting the Unfinished Obelisk (paid for locally). You can also add an optional excursion to Animalia Nubian Village and enjoy a farewell dinner before returning to the hotel. The Aswan hotel has a perfect location.

Including, of course, the Great Pyramids of Giza where over a hundred of these Ancient Egyptian constructions are a powerful sight to behold. <br/><br/>After taking an internal flight to Luxor, we take time to visit the stunning Valley of the Kings, a labyrinth of underground tombs including King Tutankhamun’s burial chamber. Crossing back over the Nile’s east bank we explore Luxor Temple and the Karnak Temple complex, before boarding the luxury cruise boat. This boat is an extremely comfortable way to spend the next four nights, as we journey on to more architectural greats, including Kom Ombo and Edfu Ptomelaic temples. These were dedicated to Sobek the crocodile god, which you still see symbols of everywhere along the Nile, particularly in Nubian homes.  Another highlight of this holiday is a trip on board a traditional Nile felucca sailing boat, sailing with a small group and travelling in and out of some of the river’s islands and communities. <br/><br/>There are several optional extras on this trip, including a trip to Aswan Dam and also Abu Simbel in the south, a collection of temples that were rescued from flooding by UNESCO when the Aswan Dam and Lake Nasser were built in the 1960’s when they were relocated to this stunning site. <br/><br/>",

        "description": "Leave the boat very early (to ensure we are back for the commencement of the cruise) and take a 30 to 40-minute bus ride to the west bank of the Nile. Here, we visit the Valley of the Kings, which contains the once-hidden tombs of more than 60 pharaohs. A discreet entrance in the hillside takes us underground, a series of corridors and antechambers leading to burial chambers and sarcophagi. The walls are covered in brightly painted images and hieroglyphs – a map of the afterlife to ensure the king’s safe passage. One ticket allows us to see three tombs, usually into what are regarded as the most impressive tombs. However, if there is time, we recommend a visit to the tombs of Ramses VI and Tutankhamun – these require extra tickets, which can be bought locally. Visits to tombs are now strictly controlled to halt further deterioration of wall paintings – each tomb is periodically closed for several weeks. On crowded days, make sure to have a quick visit to each of the included tombs if you want to add extra tombs as your leader will give a fixed meeting time in order to return to the cruise boat before it sails. After, we visit the nearby Hatshepsut Temple, an architectural masterpiece of the ancient world. Built at the foot of sheer rock cliffs, it is a staggering sight, with a trio of terraces and neat arrangement of pillars. We then visit the Colossi of Memnon, two giant seated representations of the Pharaoh Amenhotep II. On return to our cruise boat, we begin our voyage along the Nile, travelling upstream and, hopefully, enjoying a sunset to remember.

    "generalInfo": "This atmospheric Nile felucca cruise starts in the ancient city of Aswan. With room for just seven passengers aboard this comfortable traditional sailing vessel, private felucca cruises on the Nile are perfect for couples, families and other small groups. If your group is larger than seven it's no problem - another felucca can be chartered so that the two boats can sail in flotilla.<br/><br/>Your trip includes all  meals and guiding, as well as entrance fees for temples and ancient sites that contribute towards their preservation. At night, you'll bed down under the stars in the felucca's spacious and cosy sleeping area. An unforgettable experience.<br/><br/>You can adapt the cruise to be as short as two days, or as long as a week. The four-day trip begins in Aswan, with the suggestion of finishing in Edfu. Longer trips can finish in Esna. You will be  transfered to Luxor or back to Aswan at the end of your voyage. <br/><br/>The highlights of this trip are many, but surely include a stop at the great quarries of Gebel el-Silsilah, from where the sandstone for many of Egypt's most renowned temples, including Luxor, Kom Ombo and Karnak, was excavated. You'll also visit Kom Ombo, uniquely dedicated to two gods: Sobek, lord of the crocodiles, and Horus, god of war and the sky, and the beautifully preserved Temple of Horus at Edfu. At every stop, the friendly and knowledgeable crew aims to visit outside of the busiest hours, reducing the strain on the sites and ensuring you have a more enjoyable tour. Another highlight is definitely the delicious Egyptian meals which an onboard cook prepares freshly for you - grilled meats, soups, legumes and fruits all feature.<br/><br/>Besides the obvious environmental benefits of zero-carbon travel on the Nile, one of the great pleasures of travelling sedately on a sail-powered felucca cruise is watching the scenery slowly change. Riverside and island views offer perspectives of Egypt totally different to those of the cities. You're travelling with a company dedicated to respecting Egypt's environment and people, so you can be sure that the local crew receives a fair income. <br/><br/>This is a tailor made trip, so you can extend your stay on land before or after the cruise, such as with a few days in Luxor.<br/><br/>Nile felucca cruises are the finest way to explore this mythic body of water, and perfect for aficionados of 'slow travel'.",

Built during the Ptolemaic period, the complex is dominated by the Temple of Hathor, dedicated to the Egyptian goddess of love and motherhood and built by the later rulers of Egypt to legitimise their claim over the pharaonic crown. The temple’s famous zodiac map, which dates back to the 1st century BC and now resides in the Louvre, was a victim of Napoleonic treasure hunters in the early years of the 19th century. Returning to Luxor we will visit the Luxor Museum in the afternoon. Notably better laid out than the Cairo Museum this forms a great introduction to the fascinating culture we’ll experience on this trip. We’ll end the day at the magnificent Luxor Temple, an awesome testament to the power and wealth of the ancient pharaohs."

This morning we'll visit a small island where we'll wander through local farmland and meet the villagers. Our journey then takes us towards the ancient sandstone quarries of El Silsila, where the great stones that were used to build the temples at Edfu, Thebes and Karnak were cut. One of the principal sites for the worship of the river God Hapi, this region also marked the boundary between Egypt and what was then the ancient kingdom of Nubia. Local tradition has it that a giant chain was strung across the river here to stop the Nubian ships sailing further down the Nile into Egypt. We will also visit the rock-cut temple of the pharaoh Horemheb, the last ruler of the 18th Dynasty, a man whose humble beginnings saw him rise to lead the armies of Tutankhamen before ascending to the throne of Egypt itself. This afternoon we will then visit the box makers in Faris, and learn about the importance of their work to local trade and the supply chain going south along the river."

    "generalInfo": "This tour brings you an entire history and experience of how the pyramids’ design and structure changed and developed through the efforts of one Pharoah who built 3 of those pyramids. <br/><br/>By any analysis, the Pharoah Sneferu would have to be considered one of the most outstanding figures in the history of Egypt and the world. His intellect, design, planning skills, and innovations are on a level unequalled in history.<br/>Building three pyramids during his life (the 4th Dynasty 2,600 BC) would place him on a scale of achievement that few have ever attained. The pyramids that he created, at Meidum and Dahshur which ultimately led to the construction of the Giza pyramids of Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure resulted in a legacy lasting 4,500 years. And yet, not many realise that it was the skills and leadership of Sneferu and the knowledge that he acquired which led him to achieve his vision and to enshrine his legacy.<br/><br/>But building the pyramids was not just the product of his organizational skills. His purpose, passion, and drive in undertaking such enormous tasks reflected his ultimate belief in a life beyond his mortality. In seeking perfection for his pyramids, in the way they captured and reflected light, in their compass positions and alignment with the stars of Orion, it was believed would help him transcend from earth to the Gods. <br/><br/>The constellation Orion had been associated by ancient Egyptians with Osiris, the god of rebirth and it was this alignment between his pyramids and the Gods that Sneferu sought to achieve.<br/><br/>This experience you are about to embark on is one of the most fascinating adventures you will ever undertake. You will walk in the footsteps of this most amazing Egyptian man and leader. The tour “In the Footsteps of a Pharaoh” will take you to places that most travellers to Egypt rarely venture. And in doing so, you will walk in the footsteps of a man whose legacy drew you to Egypt in the first place.",

Written and photographed by David Doubilet, he had to compress a journey of 1,400 miles into a few pages. When we first read it, we were mesmerised and dreamed of being able to dive the entire Red Sea – a dream that we have since been able to realise in April 2022. What was supposed to be a one off exploratory dive expedition has now become an annual fixture.  We try and dive less visited wrecks and reefs, mixed in with some classic world class Red Sea dive site. Emphasis is placed on avoiding crowds and wherever possible, being alone. <br/><br/>Guided by the legendary wreck finder and tech diver of the Red Sea, Faisal Khalaf, and escorted by Farhat and Francisca Jah this trip is open to recreational divers and Deeper Tech divers alike. RSE is an old  fashioned  proper  diving  company where the dive guides recognise   prior experience. They will help and guide when needed, and allow experienced divers to dive in buddy teams.<br/><br/>We board the MV Nouran in Hurghada and then steam gently to Carless Reef or similar.  Here we do our check dives and dive the stunning wall. Then we head south to the Brothers Islands to dive the Numidia and the Aida. The tip of Small brother is boiling pot of fish. After an overnight sail we arrive on Daedalus. Steaming south from Daedalus, we will enter our own little world After a day of diving we steam further south to Rocky Island, the southernmost Island in Egypt. Here we will spend 2 -3 days before crossing over to St Johns Reef. After three daysm here we make lazy progress north to Ras Tirombi and Erg Somaya; eventually ending in El Gouna Marina. <br/><br/>This route is operated by no other Red Sea Sea Dive Boat. <br/>It is a truly relaxing itinerary with time to dive and really explore.<br/><br/>The Tech divers amongst us will be guided by Faisal, perhaps no other person alive knows the deep section of the Red Sea as well as he does. Depending upon your qualification, you could dive the SS Maiden at 100m/300ft. While we the recreational divers dive between the surface and 140ft. (40M) Usually around 80ft.",

These colossal monuments, built by the Pharaohs Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure around 2500 BC, have captivated travelers and scholars for centuries. Our expert Egyptologist guide will be your key to unlocking the secrets of these ancient wonders. They'll share fascinating insights into the construction techniques, the religious beliefs that inspired their creation, and the stories of the pharaohs who were laid to rest within these monumental tombs. You'll learn how these pyramids fit into the broader narrative of ancient Egyptian history and gain a deeper appreciation for the ingenuity and ambition of this remarkable civilization. For those who are feeling adventurous (and not claustrophobic!), you'll have the opportunity to venture inside one of the pyramids. Descend into the cool, dimly lit passageways and experience the unique atmosphere of these ancient chambers. It's a truly unforgettable experience that brings you face-to-face with the past. Next, we'll encounter the enigmatic Sphinx, a mythical creature with the body of a lion and the head of a human. This majestic guardian, nestled close to the pyramids, was only fully uncovered in the 1920s, adding to its mystique. Stand in awe of its imposing presence and contemplate the mysteries it holds. After our awe-inspiring visit to the Sphinx, we'll take a well-deserved break to refuel with a delicious Koshary lunch. This beloved Egyptian dish is a true culinary adventure, a hearty and flavorful combination of rice, lentils, macaroni, chickpeas, and a tangy tomato sauce, topped with crispy fried onions. It's a symphony of textures and tastes that perfectly embodies the country's rich culinary heritage and will leave you feeling satisfied and ready for the next adventure! Our exploration continues with a visit to the Grand Egyptian Museum of Antiquities (GEM), a treasure trove of artifacts that spans millennia. Here, you'll encounter the golden treasures of Tutankhamun, marvel at the intricate sarcophagi of pharaohs, and come face-to-face with the art and artifacts that bring ancient Egypt to life.

Other full day options further afield include a visit to the colonial city of Alexandria on the Mediterranean, or a trip into the desert outside Cairo to see the World Heritage Site of the Valley of the Whales at Wadi Rayan (you’ll miss the bazaar walk if you take these full day options). In the late afternoon we take a guided walk through the back streets and bazaars in Old Cairo. We'll walk through the huge Bab al-Futuh gateway and explore streets dedicated to metalwork, spices, pottery, fabric, jewelery and anything else you can imagine as we gradually enter the more touristy Khan-el-Khalili bazaar. We'll have time for a break to try some mint tea and a shisha pipe and this is a great final opportunity to pick up some souvenirs of your time in Egypt. | OVERNIGHT"

Afternoon visit Karnak Temple This morning, we embark on a journey to the West Bank of Luxor, a realm steeped in ancient history and shrouded in the mystique of pharaohs and their eternal resting places. Our exploration begins with a visit to the Valley of the Kings, a vast necropolis where generations of pharaohs were laid to rest in elaborately decorated tombs. We'll venture into several of these tombs, marvelling at the vibrant hieroglyphs and intricate paintings that adorn their walls. These ancient chambers continue to reveal their secrets to archaeologists, making the Valley of the Kings one of the most significant archaeological sites in the world.

We'll explore the remains of this ancient community, gaining insights into the lives of the workers and their families. Next, we'll be captivated by the Temple of Queen Hatshepsut, a unique mortuary temple built into the cliffs. Its elegant colonnades and terraces offer stunning views of the surrounding landscape. And no visit to the West Bank would be complete without encountering the Colossi of Memnon, two colossal statues that have stood guard over the Theban necropolis for millennia. In the afternoon, we cross back to the East Bank to explore the sprawling complex of Karnak Temple. Dedicated to the Theban Triad of Amun, Mut, and Khonsu, Karnak is a masterpiece of ancient Egyptian architecture. We'll wander through its vast courtyards, admire its towering columns, and decipher the intricate carvings that adorn its walls. Our guide will unravel the temple's complex history, revealing its secrets and explaining its significance as a religious and cultural centre for over 2,000 years.

Here in the offshore reef, we offer the opportunity to meet and swim with dolphins in Egypt all year round, and to have the amazing experience of snorkelling on the surface while the curious cetaceans swim below.<br/>This Swim with Wild Dolphin holiday in Egypt includes 7 nights spent at our ecovillage all-inclusive resort,  with day trips to see the dolphins in the Red Sea. <br/><br/>3 day trips to a remote coral reef and swim with dolphins in the Red Sea experiencing their behaviour at different times of the day and spending plenty of time with them.<br/><br/>Your holiday will also include a day snorkelling with turtles and dugong in a nearby bay.<br/><br/>The reef is a marine park and guests need to follow a strict code of conduct when entering the water with the dolphins.<br/><br/>Lunch is provided for each day trip. You’ll also have a friendly, local guide who has been with us for 15 years. He has a special dolphin “sense” and always seem to know when they will be close! Yours days on the boat also offer plenty of time to relax on the loungers and snorkel in the coral reefs.<br/><br/>Your accommodation and fully catered meals will be at the Eco-Village Resort, ideally located right by on the shore with a beautiful beach. You can relax on the beach, watch the sunset from the Bedouin tent bar or snorkel and swim in the colourful reefs. <br/><br/>As well as taking boat trips out to meet the dolphins, you can ride a camel through the desert, explore ancient Egyptian sites at Luxor, learn to scuba dive or head out shopping in the souks.<br/><br/>To suit your budget, we offer a range of accommodation options and full board with varied, buffet-style meals. You can book this trip on any dates, at any time of year – spring and autumn are the most popular seasons so book well in advance at these times.<br/><br/>Within the marine park reserve that we visit, there is a large pod of spinner dolphins – you can expect to swim with these. Bottlenose and common dolphins also live in this part of the reef, as do colourful reef fish and other marine life. We never initiate contact; our policy is to let the dolphins approach us on their own terms. In our years of experience in Egypt, we have found that the dolphins are playful and generally enjoy human contact; they love surfing the bow wave when the boat is moving, and meeting the swimmers when we are in the water. We tend to enjoy frequent meetings – these are beautiful and memorable experiences.<br/><br/>With its shallow beaches and warm, calm seas, this swimming with dolphins in Egypt holiday is ideal for families. The resort is also surrounded by a “house reef” full of colourful marine life – ideal for snorkelling during your free time. <br/>",

Depending on your group’s vibe tonight, you might like to have a little beach party under the starry night sky. Tonight, fall asleep to the gentle rocking of the boat, the warm breeze on your cheeks and the blanket of constellations above (there are no walls on a felucca, so your view will be totally undisturbed!)."

        "description": "The Valley of the Kings is ancient Egypt at its magnificent best. So much detail is elaborately painted underground, carved in hieroglyphics, and etched onto vibrant wall murals. This is the City of the Dead, where you will find the tombs of the imagination and the wonders of an ancient world. Start in Tutankhamen and Ramses V (to avoid the mid-morning crowds), and then explore an underworld that comes alive with your guide’s narration. Translate the symbols and hieroglyphs of Medinat Habu, the temple of Ramses III, and gasp at the Colossi of Memnon. This is one of the world’s finest historical sites, a museum frozen in time, a story that is much greater than its individual temples and tombs. Rather than rush around, your guide will ensure that you can appreciate all of the details. You will disembark your boat in the morning and spend the night at a hotel, rather than sticking to the luxury cruise itinerary."

        "description": "Luxor’s East Bank is equally ambient, a sphinx-lined avenue that leads to large courtyards, towering columns, and majestic temples. Each of the famous sights on this side of the Nile can be eerily quiet for 23 hours a day, and then be transformed by tour groups from the cruise ships that march from sight to sight. Avoiding the crush is easy, and your guide will make sure that the true beauty of these monuments can be discovered. Scenes of gods and pharaohs dance along columns, inscriptions wind around the walls, and statues tell of legends forgotten by history. Today you will visit all of the iconic sights of this epic open-air museum, such as the Hypostyle Hall, Temple of Luxor, and Temple of Karnak. You will watch these phantasmal monuments turn back the clock into the era of their construction."

Perhaps no city in the world has a history like this one, founded by Alexander the Great and elaborated by the design of Cleopatra. Many of the icons have since crumbled, like the Pharos Lighthouse and Great Library. However, this resurgent city remains full of cultural landmarks. Using these well-known sites as a starting point, your guide will slowly build a picture of ancient and modern Alexandria, from labyrinthine catacombs to a 2,200-year-old cemetery, then the Citadel of Qaitbay to the modern library that is giving voice to Egypt’s youth. Along the way, you will stop to sip coffee in old-world cafes, meander through decadent Mediterranean architecture, and celebrate the ghosts of the past. Alexandria has too much to take in a single day, even a week. But you will quickly be enveloped by its atmosphere and archive to ancient knowledge."

There is no rush to return to Cairo, and Alexandria always compels you to linger for an extra hour. After lunch, you will drive back to Cairo and have time to stop in a couple of bazaars before transferring to a hotel close to the airport. You will have use of the room for the day and can freshen up before departing from Egypt."

The Great Pyramids of Giza will rise before you, three towering peaks complemented by scatterings of weather-worn stone blocks. You will immediately know that you are in the presence of greatness. The pyramids are the iconic images of Egypt and you will admire them within an hour of touching down at Cairo International. A guide will greet you at the airport and assist with the visa formalities before you transfer to a luxurious Giza hotel. The views will be legendary from the rooftop terrace and the pyramids will slowly change color around sunset. Then, you will plod across the desert on a camel, traveling in the style of the past to appreciate the scale of the ancient wonder of the world.

You will wander past the Great Sphinx of Giza with your Egyptologist guide and walk through a landscape that the guide has grown up with, the stories narrated on the breeze as the pyramids loom larger and larger. At this early hour they will cast a fabulous shadow, with each side a slightly different hue. You will wander through the evocative entranceway and descend into a pyramid’s heart, probably the best way to understand the engineering. Then return to the desert and notice how you will have escaped the mass of tour buses. After this morning in Giza, you will have lunch with the guide at a traditional restaurant in order to acquaint yourself with the food as well as the customs. Then, you will have a short transfer to the airport and a flight south to the old desert town of Aswan. Draped around the River Nile, Aswan blends the old-world atmosphere of the camel caravans with Middle Eastern architectural beauty, as well as a slow pace that immediately makes everyone feel relaxed. This has always been an oasis that provided a haven for solo travelers. As you sit at one of the al fresco cafe terraces, it will not be long before you make friends. You will have a new guide here and the evening will be all about settling into the rhythm of Aswan, an old city on the Nile that is always loved by solo travelers."

A trader shouts about the price of nuts as greetings and laughter softly echoing around the old city walls. You will enjoy a delicious, traditional breakfast on the roof and meet with your guide to plan the day. There are more than a dozen attractions that can be visited and the beauty of traveling alone is that the agenda is created to suit your mood. You can admire the scale of Aswan High Dam, a modern piece of Egyptian engineering or wander into a temple that holds the secrets of Aswan’s past. Then, take a stroll through the old marketplace and feel the atmosphere of the camel caravans before you explore the crumbled remains of mazy streets that just about hang on above the Nile. Of course, a true Aswan day will also involve a fair few stops to drink sweet tea or bitter coffee. Later in the afternoon you will travel on the River Nile in a time-honored felucca. Powered by the wind, these traditional wooden vessels continue the theme of traveling back in time. Sail to lush islands in the Nile and cruise along banks etched with local life as you admire the forests of palm trees, and savor a feeling of escapism. You will be accompanied by a guide and the felucca captain will steer the boat in any direction you desire. Then, you will enjoy a relaxed evening in Aswan as you accompany your guide to a great local restaurant."

        "description": "Of all Ancient Egypt’s monuments, few ignite the imagination like the temples of Abu Simbel. Ramesses II sits on his thrown and four 20-meter statues guard each temple’s entrance in the very south of Egypt. As you approach the temples, you will notice the fascinating details. Ramesses sits on a throne of his enemies, sculpted figures of Libyans and Hittites, which will tower over you. As you enter beneath the curious stone eyes and the walls that are lined with faded engravings your guide will point out images of a great war-field battle, Ramesses paying homage to the gods, chariots crashing and soldiers falling. Then you will explore further in the temple where the statues of Ramesses and Amun sit in the gloom – remarkably, the temples are aligned so that the sun will illuminate the two statues twice every year, corresponding with Ramesses’ coronation and birthday. Next, you will visit the smaller of the two temples. However, the smaller temple certainly is not small as it was gloriously created with the same attention to detail as the larger temple. Then, you will fly back to Aswan in the early afternoon and the rest of the day will be at your leisure. This is a great city for a solo traveler as the locals will warmly welcome you with open arms. Spend the afternoon exploring off the beaten track destinations in this unique environment where the mix of the Sahara Desert and River Nile will give you plenty of inspiring space for reflection."

You will travel in an air-conditioned carriage to Luxor where you will be greeted by your insider guide. A sensational open-air museum will be at your fingertips. You will follow the storyline by starting on the eastern bank, where the sun rises. It is here that the greatest temples of Ancient Egypt were constructed and many signs of old Thebes can be found. You will wander past the sculpted sphinxes, add your footsteps to a walkway polished smooth, and raise your head towards the sky as you approach the temple entrances. While many visit the temples of Luxor and Karnak for two hours, it is highly recommended to spend most of the day, especially since an insider Egyptologist will accompany you. As you wander through the temple, you will notice hieroglyphs that narrate godly tales along the walls, forests of pillars that rise high above your head, and scorched murals that paint unusual scenes as a spellbinding silence fills many of the rooms. While the tour groups rush around the postcard sights, you will thoroughly explore the vast temple complexes defined by an attention to detail. With the local guide, you will take quiet corridors to hidden chambers, and small archways towards elements of the complex yet to be fully dug out from the earth. Then, take your time on Luxor’s East Bank as you will never stop uncovering something new from the past."

        "description": "The next morning will be another early start that is well worth it. As the sun peeks over the desert horizon you will rise in a hot air balloon, floating across the Sahara at sunrise in an almost complete silence. Other than the occasional blast on the balloon’s jets, you will drift on a blanket of the utmost tranquility as you gaze down upon a landscape that changes color with the rising sun. It’s another of Egypt’s iconic experiences, a chance to absorb the soporific beauty of a landscape that has never been tamed. When you touch down it will still be fairly early in the morning, so you enjoy breakfast at a local cafe with your guide while you plan out a day on the West Bank of Luxor. Ancient Egyptians believed that a setting sun symbolized the end of a life, so they buried their pharaohs and monarchs in tombs facing toward the west hidden in the mountains. Most hidings places did not evade looters, apart from Tutankhamen’s burial site, which was hidden beneath another tomb. You will set off beneath the stark valley walls and wander into the secrets of the past as each tomb holds the key to another period of Egyptian history. Your double entrance ticket will grant you access to a total of six tombs, a good number to explore the diversity on display. Afterward, you will descend into the Tomb of Horemheb to admire the scenes that elegantly line the walls. Then, explore Tutankhamen’s tomb – it’s the most famous but not the most impressive – before you will visit two tombs that hardly see any daily visitors. The pharaohs of this world cover a history that is more than twice the age of the United States. Egypt is a legendary destination and one of the true wonders of the ancient world with its evocative sarcophagi, murals of plaster on limestone, and stories that defy what the mind can contemplate. As you return to Luxor on this relaxed tour, you will stop at the Valley of the Queens, where Hatshepsut Temple is just another of the fabulous sites you will experience today."

As the midday sun beats down you will appreciate the cooling comfort of the Egyptian Museum, where more than 120,000 artifacts line the corridors and galleries. Without a guide it is impossible to know where to start, or how to interpret the intricate statues and godly depictions. You will travel to the museum from the airport, accompanied by a Cairo expert who will expertly guide you to the most enchanting exhibits. You can easily spend between two hours and half a day discovering the best of the museum. After all the artifacts you will enjoy a leisurely lunch at a local eatery in the Khan el-Khalili bazaar. From here you can wander at random where the old part of Cairo offer an insight into a forgotten piece of Egyptian history. Bells ring at sixth-century churches and narrow alleys paint a portrait of a pre-medieval era as the call to prayer rings out and you admire the exquisite calligraphy on the side of a mosque. Your exploration through Cairo is an experience for all the senses, a journey along lanes that presents a living history. When you are ready, you will be transferred to a modern luxury hotel on the River Nile for your final night in Egypt."

Columns rise into the blue desert sky, dozens of them standing in photogenic harmony. Crumbling outer walls help to reveal the temples’ age while reconstructed statues showcase their former glory. Regardless of how many photos you have seen, nothing will quite prepare you for entering these gigantic complexes. The guide will keep you clear of the tour groups, and you will be able to hear your footsteps echo, the soporific sounds will bounce of the walls and their faded calligraphy. At first, you will explore at leisure and enjoy the feeling of getting lost amongst these icons. Then your guide will take over and reveal the intimate details that are so much more expressive than the historical facts. Stories are told in symbols at the Hypostyle Hall, excavated sphinxes date back 3,000 years, and the enormity of it all can be baffling. You will spend a full day exploring, including a visit to Luxor Museum, before a peaceful evening at your hotel."

Abydos and Dendera are amongst the oldest of all Egypt’s sites, and they receive just a handful of daily visitors. Wander up the steps of the Osiris Temple, and then explore the hieroglyphs that grace its interior. Stand alone in Dendera Temple, and you will sense the atmosphere of ancient times. These cities have not been reconstructed, and the redolent state of ruin provides a poignant insight into their age. Paintings have faded, sculptures have broken, and cities are yet to be fully excavated. All of this will make you feel like an archaeologist that has stumbled across the forgotten ruins in the desert."

While this restoration has led to a certain sanitization of the sights, it is still the best way to understand the tombs and temples at the time they were built. Descend into the mysterious atmosphere of King Tutankhamen’s Tomb and admire the glistening treasures of King Ramesses VI’s Tomb. Explore monuments that would influence the world, and gasp at the size of the valley, all before the main tour groups arrive. There is almost too much to take in here, and the entrance ticket can get you inside six different tombs. Rather than follow a set trail, your Egyptologist guide will tailor the discovery to your mood and interests. Looping back towards the Nile, you can stop at the majestic Stepped Temple of Queen Hatshepsut, then the Colossi statues of Memnon, along with some of Luxor’s lesser-seen sights. Then it will be time to depart as the five-star river boat casts off upriver towards Aswan. Watch life along the riverbank, settle into the opulence of the cruise, and enjoy your first tranquil night docked on the Nile."

Keeping the itinerary relaxed, you will fly to and from Abu Simbel on a day trip from Aswan. Touch down to a temple structure that is packed with detail; golden hairpieces on pharaoh statues, books written around spiraling columns, 3,000-year-old eyes that always seem to be staring at you no matter where you stand. While it is one of Egypt’s most famous sights, the inaccessibility helps Abu Simbel retain a sense of abandonment. After being virtually alone at the temples, you will fly back to Aswan and spend a night a historic property that imbues all the charm and grace of the early 20th century."

Your hotel, which overlooks them, will offer an inspiring view from the window of your suite and a completely uninterrupted vista from the rooftop terrace. Their size will immediately compel you as their color changes when the sunset reflections bounce across the desert. When you land in Cairo, you will be greeted at the airport by your guide, who will assists you through customs and the relatively short transfer to the five-star boutique hotel in Giza. You will savor the view as you settle into the wonders of Egypt’s ancient history. Dinner will be served on the rooftop, just as the daily light show plays out on the pyramids."

The pyramids loom larger and larger, sentinels of history that rise from the desert floor. It does not matter how many photos or postcards you may have seen, little can prepare you for the scale of these monuments, the only ancient wonder of the world still standing. With your hotel’s exquisite location, you will visit the Great Pyramids when the site first opens, ahead of the tour bus crowds. While the pyramids are remarkable from the outside, as you descend into the heart of the structure you will discover that they are elegiac on the inside. Your first morning in Egypt will continue with a visit to the equally poignant Solar Boat Museum. In the afternoon, you will return to the hotel for lunch and relaxation as you allow the heat of the day to pass. Then, you will travel out to the very first of the pyramids, Saqqara, which offers an insight into the iconic architecture that changed the world. The smoothed steps fully illustrate the age of Saqqara Pyramids as they have been weathered by 4700 years of desert wind. You will find the remains of Ancient Memphis nearby, another enduring piece of history that feels as if it is alive. Upon your return to Giza, the guide will recommend a restaurant for the evening, either the upmarket restaurant in one of the nearby hotels or a more local and traditional affair."

        "description": "The next day, dust gathers on some of the artifacts at the Egyptian Museum of Antiquities as trinkets pile up in rooms. Thousands upon thousands of objects cover the shelves of the museum including masks, coins, statues, carved stone and gems recovered from the tombs. As you stroll through the exhibits, 7000 years of history will come alive in the grand halls and the storyline will be expertly narrated to you by your Egyptologist guide. When you wander into the Royal Mummies Room you will listen to the tales of 11 kings and queens, including the story of the great Ramses II. Over the following few days you will travel in the footsteps of the pharaohs as your morning at this museum will create an introduction to their lives and deaths. Then, you will enjoy lunch nearby before you wander through a more recent history. The churches in Coptic Cairo only date to the sixth century, while the Fortress of Babylon is a mere 2600 years of age. Their relics still shimmer as faded frescos line the walls and icons are carved into the facades. The sounds of the churches and fortress remain true to their origins as a church bell clatters while footsteps echo as they drift through narrow lanes and a trader shouts about the price of oranges. Along will you go as you wander through this living history to the 14th-century Khan el-Khalili bazaar, an old watering stop for caravans that continues to be the largest bazaar in the Middle East. While it is also a good place for shopping, you can also explore the labyrinth purely for the ambiance. To complete this day in old Cairo you will follow the euphonic sound of the Islamic call to prayer that ascends to the medieval Citadel and a breathtaking mosque that can be visited by none-Muslims."

        "title": "Luxor – Exploring the Fabled Temples of the East Bank",
        "description": "Today you will discover the two contrasting storylines of ancient Thebes, which are told through the vast ruins that are scattered in and around Luxor. In ancient Egyptian culture, the sun represented life. Since it rises in the east, the temples dedicated to the gods were constructed on the East Bank. Egyptians also believed that a setting sun indicated the end of life, so the West Bank was where burials took place and the tombs were built. You will fly to Luxor and begin your journey with the life, on the East Bank where the fabulous temples of Luxor and Karnak offer you an immersion into the dramatic scale of Thebes. These two temples require that you explore them slowly. While their size can be overwhelming at first, if you take your time then all of the details will start to shine through. Along your exploration, a forest of giant pillars will rise high above you in the Hypostyle Hall, then you will notice sculpted sphinxes that line an ancient avenue, and abundant carvings pay homage to the gods, while your guide deciphers the spiraling hieroglyphics. After an afternoon of privately-guided exploration in these two temples, you will be transferred to a luxury vessel that sits on the River Nile. Your elegant suite will have large windows for uninterrupted views over the water. A swimming pool will await you on the upper deck, along with tables for leisurely lunchtime dining. You can spend the evening relaxing and indulging as you enjoy the first of four nights on board. A River Nile cruise is a classic Egyptian experience as travelers and locals have been elegantly cruising along the river since Antony and Cleopatra did so almost 2000 years ago. Since then, new vessels have been constructed and it is now possible to find a boutique approach to cruising."

As you ascend through the sky, the sun pierces the horizon and slithers of gold and orange light cast a surreal glow. It will be silent up here, apart from the occasional blast of the jets that interrupt the still Saharan air. Once you touch down, you will spend the rest of the morning immersed in Ancient Egypt where the magical tombs of the pharaohs whisper the secrets of the past. You will enter six of the tombs to admire how the murals are laden over the limestone while hieroglyphics line the sarcophagi. While Tutankhamen’s tomb is the most famous, it is the rulers you have never heard of that have the most impressive underground realms. Once you return to the boat for lunch, you will set off along the Nile as you watch the desert roll by from the rooftop deck. Old Nubian villages occasionally mark the banks and the colors merge towards the horizon as a peace settles over you. Snacks and drinks will be served as you travel north toward the lock of Esna, where you will spend the night enveloped by desert wonders and river charm. You can spend the night on the roof to admire an incredible sky of stars."

Edfu is dedicated to the horse god while Kom Ombo honors the crocodile god, with mummified crocodiles found close to the entrance. The temples come with mysterious stories, which will be superbly narrated by your guides as you explore in small groups. In between the temples you will savor the tranquility of the cruise. On this classic itinerary, the cruise will provide a few very quiet days in between some detailed historical exploration.

You will admire the lush swathes of green that start to rise on the banks and sit outside as you cruise into the seductive oasis town of Aswan. A Saharan outpost for the camel caravans, Aswan has been welcoming visitors for centuries. You will find an old nomadic atmosphere in the marketplace, where traders meet at cafes and there is always time for another glass of tea. Today you will discover the iconic sights of Aswan, from the 20th-century High Dam to a temple built three millennia earlier. As you spend a final night on board, soak up the entertainment and notice the clusters of palm trees that rise on the banks."

Take your time. Wander through a market that is probably the most hassle-free for foreigners in the whole of Egypt. Stop for a glass of tea and watch the people coming to trade, with camels sometimes waiting patiently for their owners to return. Savor this old city throughout the morning, a great place to explore without a map or without a guide. The afternoon is equally quiet, traveling around the Nile islands on a wooden felucca cruise, stopping at the lush gardens that can sometimes make Aswan feel nothing like the desert."

        "title": "Cairo – The Legendary Abu Simbel",
        "description": "Your guide will begin this morning with a fascinating tale. He will explain to you that sunlight enters the temples of Abu Simbel only two days of the year. The shards of illumination travel along a long corridor to cast a glow on the statues of Ramesses II and Amun on February 21st and October 21st, which corresponds with the birthday and coronation day of Ramesses. The ancient Egyptians incorporated their advanced knowledge of the solstice and their firm belief in the afterlife into their remarkable engineering feats. For example, at Abu Simbel, the light shines along the corridor but the statue of Ptah, the god of the underworld, remains in perpetual darkness. The two great temples of Abu Simbel stand in the far south of Egypt, guarded by giant sculptures of Ramesses II. Their eyes will follow you into a corridor that dances with decoration. You will notice how godly scenes play out, a victory over the Hittites is presented in elaborate detail, and the sheer size of these temples is mesmerizing. After you spend three hours discovering the detail you will fly to Cairo via Aswan, where your five-star hotel on the Nile is very different to your first stay in the capital. In Giza you will have enjoyed boutique old-world luxury. For this final night you will get a taste of modern Egypt, with a decadent suite that provides views over the city lights."

Then, you will wander around Dahshour, a pyramid that appears to be bent and crumbling into dust. Admire how the sun reflects off the Red Pyramid, another curious structure that marks the transition between Saqqara and Giza. You will stop for lunch with your Egyptologist guide and contemplate these near 5000-year-old structures before you wander through Giza in the afternoon. Now the experience is defined by scale, as there is an enormity to the ancient wonder of the world that will take your breath away, with steps that tower over a line of waiting camels. Descend into one of the pyramids and embrace the scents of yesteryear, before you marvel at the funerary boat of King Cheops.

While Karnak Temple is bafflingly large, Luxor Temple is majestic in its details with an inherent grace that emanates from the walls and stone sculptures. As you travel between the two, you will notice the movement of time. Christian frescos juxtapose with ancient hieroglyphics, a mosque has been built on temple remains, and the stone road has been polished smooth by 3000 years of footsteps.

The experience will be even more supernatural as you will view it from the air, with the Valley of the Kings down below. Your hot air balloon flight will be more than worth an early start and you will drift across the desert hues, before you for a second breakfast and a memory card packed full of photos. Luxor’s East Bank is where the sun rises and the temples represent life. Sunset indicated the end of life so Luxor’s West Bank was the burial place for kings and pharaohs. It is still relatively early as you set off through the valley, where exquisite tombs are carved into desert rock. While most were plundered, the tombs remain exceptionally and evocatively decorated. Faded murals cover the walls while iconic scenes are depicted on the ceilings, and colors shine in the gloom. You will explore six tombs, including those of Ramses VI and Tutankhamen. As you stand in the burial chambers of the past the atmosphere will be unflinching, as if ghosts are whispering to you from the walls and silent messages are hanging in the air. After a morning in the valley you will travel to the Valley of the Queens and the Colossi of Memnon, before you board your cruise ship setting sail up the river. Your private balcony and elegant suite provide views to 5,000 years of history along the banks of the Nile River. The charming staff onboard the ship offer friendly attention and the onboard Egyptologist answers any questions arising from the remarkable history.

The concrete-colored room allows the artifacts to stand out, documenting a history of riches connected to the Kingdom of Kush, Philae Temple, and Abu Simbel."

        "description": "In the morning, the colorful bazaar in Aswan returns to life. The marketplace encompasses seven blocks running parallel to the river. Nuts and dates stacked in woven baskets stand beside radiant spices. Vibrant garments drape over the stalls and display racks alongside textured carpets. Fragrant hibiscus flowers offer a soothing scent to the air. After breakfast, you disembark the elegant river cruiser and make your way to the Aswan airport for your brief flight south to Abu Simbel, home to the awe-inspiring eponymous temple. Your flight lands at Abu Simbel Airport, where your private transfer awaits your arrival. The grand structure proves more impressive when considering that the temple was moved 213 feet onto a plateau to protect the artifact from the floodplains caused by the Aswan Dam. Colossal stone statues grace the façade and provide eternal fascination for those visiting the edifice, offering eternal life to the memory of Pharaoh Ramses II in whose likeness the statues were created. A frieze along the front terrace portrays people paying homage to the king amongst inscriptions of falcons and smaller statues of Ramses. The colossi guard the temple entrance, each sitting on thrones and reaching more than 65 feet tall. Royal cartouches rest between their breast, upper arms, and legs. The turquoise water edging the temple ripples against the shoreline. You enter into the Inner Temple to find the nearly 60-foot long Hypostyle Hall, which is divided into three aisles. A fabulous collection of Osiris icons stands more than 32 feet tall. The air in the hall is much cooler than the desert breeze blowing along the outer walls of the temple. Your guide points to the ceiling to show you a painting depicting flying vultures with the lateral aisles adorned with stars. The mural reliefs depict the campaign against the Hittites during the Battle of Kadesh located on the northern wall. After exploring the depths of Abu Simbel, you make your way to the airport for your return flight to Cairo."

        "description": "The splendors and bustle of Cairo have become familiar. The city encompasses 175 square miles over a series of suburbs and river islands. The antique figure of the Al-Azhar Mosque dates back to the 10th century AD with a harmonious architecture blending the various historical styles spanning a millennium. Three minarets were erected between the 14th and 16th centuries, and continue to announce the call to prayer throughout the day. Your guide meets you at the hotel and escorts you through the lively streets to reach the Egyptian Museum, which houses more than 100,000 artifacts within nearly 162,00 square feet of space. When entering the museum, it feels as though you begin a journey through time, stepping beneath the pinkish dome of the palace framing Tahrir Square. Within each gallery, you find an object bursting out from within its display case, beckoning for you to notice. The treasures in the Tutankhamen Galleries represent the artifacts discovered within the tomb of the Boy King uncovered in the 1920s. The tomb contained the largest intact riches assembled. The gallery in Room 45 imitates how the tomb was laid out, with a poster outside the room illustrating an outline where each artifact was located and once found. The pharaoh’s death mask is on display in Room 3, representing the remarkable artistry of the 18th Dynasty. The mask is possibly the best-known object taken from the tomb and representing Ancient Egypt. It reaches a length of 21 inches and was fashioned from gold to weigh more than 22 pounds. The elegant face represents the sublime image of the pharaoh topped with a head-cloth, decorated with the royal insignia of a cobra and vulture. You continue through the historical streets of Cairo to visit the 14th-century Mosque and Madrasa of Sultan Hassan before passing through the Old City walls to explore the famous souk."

The aromas of cardamom, ginger, and turmeric linger at the edge of your memory before the aroma of mint tea fills the dining room at breakfast. Your private transfer greets you at the hotel and leads you away from the shimmering waters of the Nile River heading south to Memphis, the ancient capital of the Old Kingdom, between 3,100 BC and 2,258 BC. The oases of the Nile Delta reaches away from the riverbanks until the golden sands of the desert sweep into the view in the west. King Menes founded the ancient city after unifying Upper and Lower Egypt under a single banner, dedicating the city as the cultural center of Ptah. Ruins of the once great city remain, with a statue of Ramses II measuring 40 feet in length. The statue once adorned the grand temple dedicated to Ptah. An alabaster Sphinx captures your eye as it rests 13 feet tall and 24 feet long. You continue to the town of Sakkara to view the necropolis filled with hundreds of ancient tombs. The pharaohs found their final resting place in the pyramids while the royal subjects took to the smaller tombs in the area, found within the shadows of the remaining geometric structures. The desert air fills with the aroma of heated earth and fertile soil drifting from the riverbanks. Your guide leads you to the Step Pyramid, which was erected in the 3rd Dynasty around 265 BC under the patronage of Imhotep. The structure contained a royal tomb set more than 90 feet underground, which could be reached by a vertical shaft. Blue tiles decorate the sporadic chambers, and Tura limestone adorns the exterior at heights up to 35 feet."

Napoleon’s troops left inscriptions on the ramparts, along with figures of animals and pharaohs decorating stones once situated along the ruins of Memphis. The flare and flash of the souk continue to call to you before your flight leaves today, reminding you of the glistening trinkets and flashing lanterns that merchants have used to entice passersby since the 14th century. Semi-precious stones glint against the labyrinthine walls near the elegant aromas of a perfume shop. Locals linger inside the historic doors of one of Egypt’s oldest coffeehouses, first established in the 1770s. The scent of Turkish coffee lingers beneath the subtle aroma of hibiscus juice. When you are ready, your private transfer meets you at the hotel. You enjoy a lingering look at the passing boats and captivating banks of the Nile River before transferring to Cairo International Airport for your flight home."

After a flight to Luxor, you will check into a hotel on the bank and wander the Avenue of Sphinx, before diving into the history of Luxor Temple. It’s believed that this was where kings were crowned and the grandeur is unfathomable. Even after so many centuries, the temple’s detail can suggest a time when pharaohs were carried in on thrones. You really do need a whole afternoon to get the full history here."

Tutankhamen’s tomb is not the most impressive here. Instead, delve into mural-lined chambers of Ramses and others, before exploring the Valley of the Nobles in the Theban Necropolis. The exploration will be split into two, so you can do more in the cooler hours of the day and rest when the sun gets high."

It’s actually a complex of temples and you will need from sunrise to mid-morning to appreciate its history. After lunch on the riverbank you will return to the West Bank this afternoon, first to marvel at the Colossi of Memnon.

You can feel the history stretching out beyond the sand, long before you disembark to explore the Temple of Horus. Better preserved than any temple along the Nile, it was buried under sand for almost 2000 years. Now it provides an eerie immersion in antiquity."

You’ll witness some mummified crocodiles before returning to the boat and cruising to Aswan.

Constructed by Ramses II, the two Abu Simbel temples were dismantled and lifted 60 meters up the cliff, when Aswan Dam threatened to submerge them. You can see where the rock was cut, but mostly you appreciate how this magnificent feat of workmanship is aligned with stars and the equinox.

It’s a capital that’s soft and gentle, one that has maintained its old-world traditions into the 21st century. Chatter emanates from roadside cafes, an old amphitheater is hidden amongst the suburbs, and you’ll find that the locals stick true to classic concepts of good hospitality. On your first afternoon, you’ll realize that there are still capital cities where strangers greet each other on the streets and saying hello is part of the norm. Today you’ll be greeted at the airport and transferred to your five-star accommodations at the Grand Hyatt Amman, where you can quickly feel part of the style and culture of this fascinating country. The sensational ambiance of the Grand Hyatt Amman derives from the collection of award-winning chefs, wellness experts, and dedicated staff ensuring your first-class hospitality experience.

The columns rise majestically, standing on a hill that overlooks a valley of olive groves. Huge pieces are strewn across the ground, from rugged bricks to slabs that once made up the Temple of Hercules. Visit similar ruins in Greece or Turkey, and you’ll struggle to move for other tourists. Yet Jerash almost feels isolated, deserted and untouched since the Roman Empire evaporated. The ancient city dates back to the 1st century BC and flourished until the mid-8th century AD. The outline of the hippodrome contains traces of its former glory where chariot races attracted up to 15,000 spectators. The graceful ruins of the Temple of Zeus adorn the hilltop blending a fabulous view over the city’s remains with strong boulders embodying importance of the once significant structure. Jerash just one of the stops on your half-day tour from Amman, just one of the remarkable monuments that are scattered across Jordan."

Mount Nebo is a place of pilgrimage with remarkable views over the Dead Sea; Christian mosaics illuminate the walls in Madaba, where a Byzantine church maintains the oldest map of Palestine in existence. Kerak Castle evokes stories of the crusaders as the largest fortress in Jordan with fountains dating back to the 2nd century AD. Then the valley opens up, and suddenly you’re looking down on the sandstone city of Petra. It’s a five-hour drive from Amman to Petra, but there are many stops en route, with the guide aiming to get you a sunset glimpse of the old city before your private tours over the next two days. Over the day, you’re likely to realize that one of the country’s greatest highlights is its humility. Rather than shout and overly advertise its attractions (other than Petra), Jordan likes to leave a lot for visitors to discover first hand."

Sprinkles of dust puff up as you get closer and the rock becomes marked with intricate swirls of orange and maroon. It feels like you’re immersed in nature, lost in the marvel of the desert. But then the canyon opens from nowhere, and you’re staring at a whole city carved into the sandstone. Remarkable tombs and temples grace the rock faces, with columns and sculpted sphinxes etched high onto mountains. Walk for another five minutes, and you learn that these first temples are just the start, just one suburb of an ancient city that stretches for many miles across the desert. Petra has far too much to see for a single day. Much like a modern capital city, you need to journey out to its disparate suburbs and distinctive areas. A local guide will discuss the options for this vacation, as the exact routes will depend on your energy levels and how far you’d like to walk. You might also want to split the days up, seeing different areas at sunrise and sunset, leaving a few relaxed hours at the hotel when the sun is high in the sky. As well as the famous temples, Petra is packed with caves, the homes of local people for many centuries. Over these two days, you’ll meet a family that occupies one of these caves, sharing a glass of tea and experience time-honored hospitality. The Treasury will cause you to fall in love with Petra through the iron-laden sandstone originally erected to serve as a tomb for King Aretas III. The pillars glisten with golden orange light between nine and 11am."

In the morning, you’ll transfer back to Amman Airport for the flight to Cairo, where the afternoon can travel in many directions.

With every footstep, they loom larger, rising over 130 meters into the blissful blue sky. Your guide knows the best photographic angles, and you stay ahead of the crowds, climbing inside one of the temples and getting a sense of how the ancient wonder of the world was crafted. From Giza, you head to Saqqara and ride out to the first ever Egyptian pyramid on the back of a camel. It’s a remarkable sight, crumbling slowly yet still as classically shaped as it was more than 3,500 years ago.

You’ll be glad to have a guide, as these precious artifacts are difficult to piece together amongst the seeming disarray of the museum. The Egyptologist leads you through the most remarkable of what’s on offer then takes you into Coptic Cairo and medieval Cairo, historic suburbs that have retained their atmosphere of old-world Christianity and Islam. Comparing the two provides a sublime journey through architecture styles and atmospheres, from charming 6th-century churches to calligraphy draped across markets and lanes. Most of the suburbs are pedestrianized, a maze of lanes that twist through the stories of history, and then suddenly open out onto squares of alfresco terraces filled with the invigorating scent of brewing coffee."

        "description": "Ancient Egypt baffles the imagination. Stand before the columns of Karnak Temple, watching how they cast distant shadows, wondering how such engineering existed 3,500 years ago. Wander along the Avenue of Sphinx and try to comprehend the size of the facade. Gaze up at the decoration at Luxor Temple and bask in its glory. Take your time, soaking up the atmosphere and grandeur, without even trying to understand. Then allow your guide to take over. Returning through the two temples, along the avenue that connects them, the expert Egyptologist starts to fill in the gaps. After absorbing the ambiance, you begin to learn the how and the why, the what and the when. This then continues at the Luxor Museum, where a stunning collection of artifacts boasts of the opulence of ancient Thebes. It’s a full day of exploring on the East Bank, and the pace is leisurely, for these are wonders to be appreciated, not rushed."

Traditional villages still line the banks, seemingly unchanged since the time of the pharaohs. You stop at Egypt’s second-largest temple, the Cult Temple of Horus, dating back to the Ptolemaic era. Honoring the falcon god, it stands elegantly amongst the soft colors of the desert, its columns still standing strong after 2,200 years. Then keep cruising, docking beside an island on the Nile, where the evening is as relaxed as any along the Red Sea."

By honoring him, the Egyptians believed they would be safe from the deadly attacks of Nile crocodiles. Sobek himself was a stealthy soul, transforming himself into a crocodile as a means of escaping an attack. The guide narrates the story in much detail as you visit Kom Ombo Temple, where the two symmetrical sides play out the myth. One side is dedicated to the sun god, a descendant of Horus, the other to Sobek. Egypt is full of fabulous monuments that can be glimpsed in photos. But only by walking beneath the columns and inspecting the carved facades can you begin to evoke the time of the ancient Egyptians and the legends that accompany the time."

The Great Pyramid of Giza rises just 700 meters from your five-star hotel, and you’re immediately inspired by its scale. By mid-morning the site will already be busy, so today’s tour will take you in a different direction. An Egyptologist leads you around the Egyptian Museum of Antiquities, stopping to inspect the priceless treasures of the Mummy Room and the archaeological finds that paint a story through Ancient Egypt’s different dynasties. This museum is baffling without a guide. With an insider’s knowledge, it’s one of the best in the world. But Egypt isn’t just about the ancient past and the rest of the day will lead you through the centuries that make up Cairo today. Wander through the alleyways of Coptic Cairo and its old stone churches. Follow the architectural design of Al Moez Street, where Islamic treasures date to a forgotten medieval era. Move into the 21st century by visiting Tahrir Square, the famous site of protest and demonstration. This is a chance to openly discuss contemporary Cairo, a city that’s bouncing back with verve. After an atmospheric dinner in Khan Khalili bazaar, you then have the rare opportunity to visit Bayt Al-Suhaymi after dark, which is normally closed in the evening."

Rising majestically and defying their age, the pyramids are the undisputed highlight of any visit to Egypt. You have the perfect view from the balcony of the five-star Le Meridien Hotel as it faces with an uninterrupted view towards the Great Pyramids of Giza. You will be greeted at the airport for transfer to your hotel, where you will enjoy a welcome drink with your guide. The pyramids are also the starting point for the stories of the first and main god of ancient Egypt, Amun-Ra. On hieroglyphs inside the pyramids, it is Amun-Ra described as the primeval creator and the ultimate symbol of a creative force other than man. The evening is at your leisure, and the views make it worth relaxing at the hotel. There is a beautiful heated outdoor pool with glimpses of the tips of the pyramids, along with a good restaurant for dining on the rooftop. Rooms are spacious and Western in style, befitting the five-star status of the establishment.

        "description": "While the sites of Ancient Egypt are magnificent, it is the quality of the guiding that really brings them to life. Expert Egyptologists provide a window onto the old and the new kingdoms, and you will begin with the stories of Amun Ra. Over the next few days, you will see how he was depicted as a ram during the Old Kingdom, a symbol of fertility and thus creation. By the New Kingdom, he becomes a pharaoh with a red and a blue crown. These stories are elaborated as you wander past the Great Sphinx of Giza, the guardian to the Great Pyramids. Dust rises subtly as you cross the open desert to the pyramids, which loom larger and larger as you approach. Get up close, and you witness how the pyramids are slowly crumbling, withered by the desert winds. Time seems to stand still when you gaze up at the monuments, a sense that you are standing beneath the cradle of Western civilization. You can enter one of the temples (this is rotated for preservation purposes), perhaps the best means of grasping the enormity of these structures. Visit the Solar Boat, a replica but an excellent showcase of what existed inside the pyramids before looters. Continuing the private tour through ancient Memphis you admire the first building ever to be entirely constructed from stone, Saqqara Pyramid, and while it is crumbling visibly, it is very impressive in its revelation of ingenuity. Around mid-afternoon, you can return to the hotel located just a few minutes from the sites of Memphis. There is then some time to relax before a sunset desert adventure, your choice of riding a camel or horse across the Sahara towards the Giza Pyramids, past the Great Sphinx of Giza. Sunset panoramas are spectacular, the camels back-dropped by these great monuments. Continue on the horse or camel at dusk and dine in a traditional Bedouin restaurant, enjoying the food of the desert tribe’s residents, including lots of fragrantly sweet tea."

There will be an opportunity to spend a couple of hours meeting with the Nubian people to learn more about their history and culture before you board your Nile Cruise. You will not start cruising on it today, but you will travel traditionally in a felucca sailboat on a journey that celebrates the natural splendor of the area. Circle the gardens of Kitchener Island and stop at the Agha Khan Mausoleum on the western bank before watching the river reflect golden colors as the sun starts to set over the desert."

Partially in fragments yet rising to a staggering height, this 2,700-year-old temple had to be reconstructed after rising waters threatened to submerge it. The stories of the gods sound surreal, but when you explore these monuments, they come to life, the carvings and columns breathing life into a history that existed before a written language as we know it. Osiris lost a battle with the bad god Seth, and his body was torn into pieces to be scattered all across the desert. It was the Goddess of Magic that revived him and their son Horus finally defeated Seth. The details take time to unravel, and much of it ties into the temples you are exploring. With this narrative, the Temple of Philae is not merely a magnificent archaeological site, but an immersive imprint into the world of the ancient Egyptians. As the Movenpick Royal Lily sets sail in the afternoon, you will visit Kom Ombo Temple, where tens of mummified crocodiles are an indication that this is a dedication to Sobek, the crocodile god. Egyptians would be buried with these crocodiles as protection, and the temple’s inscriptions show a deep reverence for this Nile carnivore"

Edfu is an inspiring stop on a relaxed morning of cruising, the Sahara and the Nile looking resplendent from your deluxe cabin. While the focus of this tour means plenty of detailed historical exploration, the Nile cruise offers two days of tranquility, time to unwind and completely relax. The tips of the temples of Karnak and Luxor guide you into Luxor, the city of kings and queens in the desert. Take lunch on board before a private tour on the eastern bank, bypassing most of the crowds to focus on a lesser-known story found in the world’s greatest open-air museum, Goddess Mut. A vulture carrying the crowns of royalty, Mut was the New Kingdom wife of the great Amun-Ra. In an astonishing landscape where there is so much history to take in, a dedicated focus like her is a good way to make sense of it all.

Descend into the legendary tombs of Ramesses II and Ramesses IV and feel the sense of history as you step foot in the tomb of Tutankhamen further below the ground, and uncover the secrets as the guide translates inscriptions and hieroglyphs on the walls. A jackal serves multiple purposes in this ancient world; invoking him brought protection from desert scavengers, and like many stories from this tour, you find there is a method to the mummification and mythologized beliefs. Stop for lunch and a coffee to recharge, as there is a staggering number of sites to see on the West Bank of Luxor. Carved into the rock, rising over the desert like a phantom from history, the Queen Hatshepsut Temple regularly lays claim to being visitors’ greatest memory from Egypt. Her temple is so different from the others, built over three levels, an ode to both Queen Hatshepsut and Goddess Hathor of motherhood and love.

Some of the treasures have been rescued, and they are proudly presented in the sprawling Egyptian Museum of Antiquities. At first, it appears to be a chaotic collection, but that is simply because there is so much to display. Of all the museums in Egypt, perhaps in the world, this is the one that most requires a guide, for making sense of so much valuable history is not easy when you first step foot into the museum. You will fly from Luxor to Cairo and be greeted by the same Egyptologist guide from your first two days in the country. Spend the day at the museum, including the famous treasures from King Tutankhamen’s tomb. With so many trinkets, some of them coated in dust, others hiding beneath cloth or down random corridors, a focus on God Aton helps tie everything together. After a relaxed visit to the museum, transfer to the Fairmont Cairo on the River Nile, a very Western styled five-star hotel with a swimming pool perched high above the famous river. Complete your Egyptian experience with an evening in Khan Khalili. The opulent Ottoman “House of Suhaymi” (Beit El Seheimy) is closed during the evening, but the guide gets you access, into a house of elegantly carved wood and Arabic patterns. When crowded with tourists, it is hard to appreciate the details, which is why your guide likes to arrange this special access. Dine nearby later in the evening, a traditional Egyptian dinner served in a neighborhood that delights in its portrayal of old Cairo, not Ancient Egypt."

Lounge in your private pool or drift off in your own gardens, watching the Red Sea glisten through a rainbow of blue colors. You don’t need shoes to walk down to the resort’s private beach, nor do you need to think about time. This is Egypt’s iconic coastal escape, an exotic piece of bliss where you can drift off to the sea breeze. Staying at this high-end accommodation gives you access to all the facilities of its neighboring resort, including multiple restaurants and bars, a salubrious spa, gym facilities and various pools. Your villa is tucked away, and there’s an enveloping silence throughout day and night. However, you are just a few hundred meters from the center of Sharm El Sheikh and its range of restaurants and shops. Activities take place above and below the water, from rock climbing and camel rides on the Sinai Peninsula to excellent snorkeling and scuba diving. After seven days of Egypt’s historical highlights, this is the classic way to complete the country’s allure."

        "description": "Beirut is no longer the bombed out city from an old civil war that you might imagine. Rather, the city is now cultivated beautifully with lanes that are lined with flagship designer stores as luxury sports cars whizz past the redeveloped shells of buildings once marked by mortar shells, and al fresco terraces with fantastic aromas that demonstrate why the city has long been known as the Paris of the East. Down at the waterfront, there is the scent of opulence as welcoming aromas drift out from upmarket restaurants and meet the salty sea breeze. Middle Eastern culture is alive in all its tradition through cuisine, atmosphere, and design, yet it has been brought into the present. This is a city that does not look back, and it is in the evening when it all truly comes alive with squares and terraces packed with chatter and laughter. Arrive in Beirut in the morning, and you will be transferred to your hotel and then introduced to the city with a tour of its historical sights. A pathway through what remains also gives you a good feel for what has been built recently, starting at the Ottoman Grand Serail and then moving to admire the Roman and Phoenician statues that line the National Museum. Churches and mosques line renovated streets, a merging of the past and the present for an insight into history that stretches from empires to crusaders to the freedom of today. Enjoy the first of your several evenings here as you stay at a five-star Relais & Chateaux property that is within walking distance of so much to explore and enjoy."

Sculpted figures are dedicated to the gods and Venus and Jupiter are among those revered here. You will be virtually alone to listen to the echo of your own footsteps on the massive slabs of marble. An eery atmosphere floats through the air as the temple has not undergone extensive reconstruction and the experience is all the better for it. After lunch, you will stop for some samples of Lebanese wines that are sweet on the palate, but surprisingly sensual. Move next to enter the 8th-century city walls of Anjar, where the historical baths and temples are surrounded by the shops of crafters and artisans. These shops are not tourist stores, but rather are local stores that indicate the harmony of history and modern life at Lebanon’s attractions. It will be a full-day trip from Beirut to the east of the country, culminating with a relaxed evening back in the city."

After a lovely wander, take a boat to a 13th-century fortress in the Mediterranean, a sea castle buffeted by the waves, and then continue your tour in the Queen of the Seas, the incredible necropolis of Tyre and a near-complete insight into the working of a traditional Roman city. The hippodrome is astounding as it is the largest on the planet, while the triumphal arch and aqueduct offer examples of how civilization thrived on this caravan route between Rome and Jerusalem. Day trips work best over these four days as Lebanon is compact and the tourist infrastructure has not fully formed outside Beirut, where luxury hotels and restaurants abound."

Like so much in Lebanon, this extraordinary sight is relatively unknown to the world, and you are likely the only foreign visitors around. Continue in the north of the country, viewpoints of Jonieh’s Bay followed by a walk through the oldest port in the world. 7,000 years after its founding and still going strong, Byblos is like the onion of Western civilization, layer after layer peeled back as you explore its history. Among the highlights are snippets of evidence from when the city provided the birthplace of the Roman alphabet. Return to Beirut to thoroughly enjoy your final evening in a very memorable city."

You will fly to Luxor via Cairo and spend the afternoon at these legendary sights with an avenue of stone sphinxes between them. Like the Roman monuments in Lebanon, these are two of the only Egyptian legacies that are fully surrounded by the modern city, the juxtaposition a sign that life has not stood still since the time of the pharaohs. It will have been a packed day, so the evening is extremely relaxed as you dine on the banks of the River Nile."

This iconic flight is followed by brunch, and an inspection of the details as an Egyptologist guide takes you into the tombs and temples. Inscriptions of godly scenes cover the walls as musty mummified smells flutter around with snippets of treasure flashing beneath ceilings of magnificent beauty. Tombs lie beneath tombs, most famously the one of King Tutankhamen. Nearby is the Mortuary Temple of Queen Hatshepsut, splendor carved into the rock face and is a monument to one of Ancient Egypt’s most loved rulers. Completing your tour are the two colossal statues of Memnon, a dictator sitting down and watching over his subjects; his eyes are particularly moving."

It will have been many days of touring the sights, so now there are two days of tranquility and reflection ahead with your private shaded balcony a place to sit and watch the Sahara Desert roll by. Your luxury River Nile cruise will serve as an interlude between the sightseeing and a chance to sit back and watch the golden colors of the wilderness flow past on your journey upriver to Aswan, and this short little break should ensure you’re fully energized for the final few days. But, this being Egypt, the historical immersion continues as you disembark to temples dotted along the banks, from one dedicated to the crocodile god to another with two sides, each an honor to one side of a battle between quarreling gods. One is Egyptian in style, another Greco-Roman, expertly preserved because sand dunes invaded its interior to keep out looters. The short daily excursions give time to stretch your legs as the leisurely cruising pace takes you past small oases and mud-brick villages in the desert. On the second day, you will dock close to Aswan for an evening of traditional entertainment."

You will have time to take in this amazing quarter of souks and narrow lanes as traders push carts through and exotic smells greet you around every turned corner. The region is alive with life thriving after close to 2,000 years. The treasures of the Egyptian Museum are just as intriguing, even if the experience is completely different, with finds from King Tut’s tomb and artifacts rescued from buried archaeological sites all across the country.

        "description": "Wake the next morning to be privately transferred to Cairo Airport for your short flight to Luxor and travel straight to Luxor Temple. Luxor baffles even the most worldly of travelers as seeing such ancient heritage stand in such a pristine state of conservation is hard to comprehend. Your mind will circle with questions on how these tombs and temples were built on such an immense scale? Palatial columns rise skyward and dwarf all of those who wander across the imposing temple floors. Sculpted figures guard entrances ten meters high, their eyes cast with indecipherable emotion. Footsteps will echo and bounce across the walls before evaporating into the desert sky. Your first glimpse will be forever memorable as the scale of the temple is experienced in all of its primitive glory. As you admire the hieroglyphs and soak up the murals, you will realize that this is just the start of your journey through Egypt’s dynasties. Like each day on this itinerary, every tour is private, and your Egyptologist guide will tailor the speed and information to your interests. There is almost too much to see around Luxor, and it will be easy to be overwhelmed by temple after temple, tomb after tomb. Your guide will individualize your discovery and focus your time on the most exquisite and interesting. You will continue down the old Avenue of Sphinxes to the temple complex of Karnak, and then the scale will multiply. The largest of all of Egypt’s temples, the scale can only be comprehended when you stand in the main temple courtyard. You can take your time and allow the silence to take over as impressions of stone imprint themselves. Your guide will unravel the details and over the course of the day, will answer those questions you had when you landed in Luxor earlier in the day. There will be time to visit the Luxor Museum should you wish, as you travel the banks of the River Nile."

The rulers of Ancient Egypt’s 18th dynasty were mummified and left in the Valley of the Kings and Valley of the Queens, where exquisite details adorn the walls and stories are told in strange images. You will visit four of the tombs, and your guide will explain the potential options. King Tutankhamen’s is usually seen as unmissable, predominantly for its fame. King Ramesses VI’s should also be seen for its beauty and size. Down in the musty tombs, you can inspect the walls of detail as your guide will point out what has been left behind after over 3,000 years. An ethereal atmosphere hangs in the air and will remind you that these were places of rest. There will be a beautiful moment as you ascend the steps and return to the tomb entrance and admire the endless vista over the desert. After a stop for lunch, you will be guided through the Valley of the Queens and take time in the Mortuary Temple of Queen Hatshepsut. Of all Egypt’s ancient monuments, perhaps none capture the era’s stylistic innovation as well as this one. Enjoy your time cruising away from Luxor in the evening."

Explore the interior of one of the temples, visit the famous viewpoints, gaze up at the protective Sphinx of Giza, and understand why photos simply do not do justice to these monuments. By mid to late morning, you will be back at Mena House Hotel for a hearty brunch and some relaxed hours spent on the roof. Your private afternoon tour will reveal the oldest of the pyramids, the crumbling and weathered stepped pyramids of Saqqara. While not as visually impressive, these pyramids are a great insight into the construction and design of the icons."

It will feel as though you are opening an ancient treasure chest to search through endless gems to find one that ultimately stands out. It can be very confusing, and it could take months to see it all, but with your private guide, you can sidestep straight to the most evocative treasures, including the sparkling wonders excavated from King Tutankhamen’s Tomb. The museum first opened in 1902 and houses approximately 120,000 artifacts. After lunch, you can spend the afternoon wandering through the cobbled streets of Coptic Cairo, where churches date to the 5th century AD. The vibrant markets are ideal places to purchase souvenirs while aromas of anise, coriander, and black pepper drift through the narrow lanes."

You will be greeted at the airport, and it will be a three-hour drive out to Petra, with a couple of potential stops on route dependent on your mood. Relax at the five-star Movenpick Petra and let the heat of the afternoon slip away before you enter the mesmeric sandstone city. The hotel combines the beauty and flair of natural stone, intricate handcrafted wood, and Middle Eastern fabrics for a collection of sensational textures accentuating the ambiance around one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. The Arabic-style courtyard provides a soothing window into the past and a selection of the luxurious rooms offer enchanting views over the Great Rift Valley. The comforts of the modern rooms contrast the antique ambiance of the ancient city located across the street from the hotel. Late afternoon will cast a seductive glow onto the rock as swirls of rustic red and radiant orange bounce back off of the canyon walls. Tomorrow you will explore the different buildings to admire their contrasts, but today’s sunset will be about admiring the city from a raised vantage point and watching the subtle changes as dusk takes hold. Your private guide will lead you towards the famous entrance of Petra for the evening tour. You will descend slowly as the canyon narrows, and you approach Petra’s ancient, hidden entrance. Take a few more steps, and a whole world will open as buildings are carved into red cliffs and sculptures dominate the sandstone. With candlelight as your guide, you will make out the city avenues as they wind around the cliffs and lead to majestic layers of rock. Silence reigns, and you will hear every footstep. Hold your light out and reveal a new set of detail, which then disappears as you walk on. Exploring Petra at candlelight has an almost transcendent element, one that slowly evokes the atmosphere of this city’s distant origins."

This sandstone city is not merely a cluster of photogenic buildings, but a sprawling expanse of caves, tombs, Roman pillars, polished granite and sculpted icons. After breakfast, your private guide will explain the potential route options. You can only get around the city by foot, or by donkey. The area close to Petra’s narrow canyon entrance has the most famous sights but starting from the opposite side will reveal the city’s most impressive temple. The walk could be less than an hour, uncovering a few exceptional icons or you could also spend a whole day and only see half the city, such is its enormity and vivid detail. Take as long as you like because, like all good cities, the real beauty comes when you head off the beaten track. From Petra, you will be transferred to the Dead Sea, a two-hour journey that will culminate in the peaceful views overlooking the Dead Sea."

It was here that the kings and queens were buried, a series of tombs scattered across the valley. Tutankhamen’s is buried beneath another, Ramses VI’s has been spectacularly reconstructed, and the intricacy of the design is remarkable. Ceilings are inscribed with scenes from the gods, rooms are guarded by the fierce eyes of stone jackals, and musty smells are found in the corners of these ancient remains. You will enter half a dozen of the tombs in the Valley of the Kings and then wander across the desert and up the stone staircase to the Queen Hatshepsut Temple. Spread across three tiers, this is the most visually striking of the temples with so many columns carved into the rock face. Hatshepsut goes down in history as the most loved of the rulers, a stark contrast to the reign of Pharaoh Amenhotep, a dictator who left his legacy through two giant statues of himself. His Colossi of Memnon is the final stop on the morning’s tour, another epic illustration of Ancient Egypt’s size.

Sometimes it appears that the landscape does not ever change with just hour after hour of the same sand and water. But watch closely, and nothing is ever the same here, the wind bringing minute changes, the sun causing hues to contrast and rugged mountain peaks suddenly piercing the horizon. You can feel the tradition everywhere on the dahabeya. Crafted from wood, it has two main sails, fluttering at opposing ends of the vessel. There are only five cabins and two suites, the small boutique nature of the cruise more in keeping with the early Nile journeys of Cleopatra and Marc Antony. Ascend to the upper deck and four-posted day beds await, with white drapes to provide shade from the sun. Drinks are served to your day bed, a whole assortment of soft and alcoholic options available. Meals are usually served up here as well, the views of the desert particularly impressive as the sun dips from the sky. Move down to your suite, and there is everything you need for a whole day of cruising. Electronic climate control helps negate the desert heat, and the balcony is shaded for most of the day. Room service is included, and the bathroom is far more contemporary than the original dahabeya sailboats. From the 1920s to 1940s, this was a vessel commanded by aristocrats and royals. Elegant and enchanting, it provided leisurely journeys up and down the Nile, not dissimilar to those made by Ancient Egypt’s kings and queens. Cleopatra would have traveled on something similar, albeit with a team of rowers assisting the sails. For four whole days, you will travel up the Nile between Aswan and Luxor, a journey that would usually take two days with a motor. The desert rewards slow travel and romance is the reward for taking your time. There are mesmerizing stops along the way that will engage all of your senses. Disembark at the Temple of Horus, the second largest of all those in Egypt, and a cult temple dedicated to the falcon god. A couple of days later, spend two hours at Kom Ombo Temple as the sun god and crocodile god wage a war on its opposing sides. The dahabeya’s slower speed gives you the opportunity to explore these iconic sights without them being packed with visitors from larger cruise ships. These short excursions punctuate a journey that has no time constraints so you can remove your watch, forget about any idea of a fixed schedule, and allow the desert to impart its soft charms."

        "description": "As the sunrise paints the backdrop, you will sail into Aswan and likely join a number of other traditional sailboats also on the Nile. Cruise past lush island gardens and enter the city as great swathes of palm trees rise on both banks. While the journey has ended, you still have one final night on the boat to watch the Nile turn golden in the afternoon’s fading light. Before that, disembark to explore the myth of the Goddess of Magic, her story etched into the walls of the Temple of Philae. Duck into the traditional souks as vibrant colors merge with the atmospheric shouts of traders. Admire the enormity of Aswan High Dam, an engineering feat from a more modern era and then return to the boat for a final night to soak up the serenity of the river."

Like the dahabeya cruise, it will be the colors of nature that will first capture your imagination. Sapphire and turquoise on the water, red and yellows in the sand and cliffs, the whitewashed facade of the resort allow these hues to dominate. When Cleopatra and Marc Antony traveled to the coast, there was certainly nothing developed so their servants would set up luxury desert camps that provided privacy and bliss. Although the urban landscape has changed, the bucolic atmosphere feels the same as 2,000 years ago as your boutique resort offers a solitude that will allow romance to thrive. Check in to your resort and the next few days are at your leisure, the coastline providing the seductive setting."

This small-scale five-star resort maximizes privacy, and there are many shaded and sunny areas to lounge away the days, either on the beach or around one of the many pools. A selection of restaurants can be found on site, and you can also use all the facilities at a neighboring sister resort. There is also an excellent spa and the option for couple’s treatments in your suite. Your time here is completely at your leisure, a classic coastal getaway to complete a journey through the history of Egypt. Head out from the beach, and the snorkeling is exquisite, the Red Sea reefs alive with tropical colors. The whole area is famed for its diving, and an on-site scuba center provides two and three-dive boat excursions to more deeper waters. Continue the sailing with private cruises or take a kayak onto the waters. Adventures also travel inland, with hiking and rock climbing in the mountains of the desert, or visits to traditional Bedouin communities. But mostly these days are about a pristine coastline and each other’s company so you can just lie back and indulge."
