      "description": "Istup Waterfall/River Hiking/Hiking to Trnovacko Lake. Imagine canyoning without the ropes and you’ll get the idea behind river hiking! Splashing, swimming, jumping and bouldering our way along a refreshing natural river is one of those experiences that offers something for everyone, young or old! It’s worth bearing in mind that at the height of summer, the water levels can run low – in this case we would switch activities to a hike to the beautiful Trnovacko lake. Sutjeska National Park is the best-untouched nature can offer and Trnovacko lake is nested underneath the mountain of Maglic, which is Bosnia’s highest mountain peak, bordering Bosnia and Montenegro. Trnovacko lake is actually located in Montenegro, but is only accessible as a hiking trail from the Bosnian side! Once at the lake, you will be given free time to explore the lake, while your guides will take time to prepare lunch. During the hot summer months, the lake is perfect for swimming too. Overnight and dinner in Blagaj. Total hiking time: 5 hours. Car time: 1 hour each way for Istup, 2 hours each way for Trnovacko Lake."
