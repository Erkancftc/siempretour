  "generalInfo": "FROM CHILEAN WINERIES TO THE SAN RAFAEL GLACIER<br/>Join us for a trip to incredible Coastal Patagonia! This tour allows you to experience quality while exploring the beautiful outer islands of southern Chile. We will experience the best of what Chile has to offer in a mothership style sea kayaking tour: wine, wildlife and wilderness paired with sea kayaking in one of the most stunning places on earth, all from the comfort and convenience of our personal expedition ship.<br/><br/>The coast of Chile stretches for over 4300 kilometres, providing endless opportunities for kayakers. The region we have chosen for our tours is considered Northern Patagonia and is part of the Aysen Region. Most people think that the southernmost portion of Chile (Southern Patagonia) is the most rugged and wild, but think again. We will take you into difficult to access areas with stunning landscapes, abundant wildlife, hot springs and glaciers dropping into the sea, all while enjoying safety and service you have come to expect.<br/><br/>We’ve crafted this trip to take in most of the highlights that we’ve discovered over the past 8 years of traveling to the area, and feel that it is an excellent and in-depth introduction to the area. Some of the top selections include paddling in beautiful and pristine Traiguén and Goñi Islands finding traces of the original inhabitants of the area among small islands of the archipelago, viewing abundant wildlife, soaking in remote hot springs, basking in the immensity of the San Rafael Glacier and taking in a traditional asado (barbecue) at a remote estancia – all among the backdrop of volcanoes and mountains.<br/><br/>This trip is suitable for all ages and ability levels. Participate in our activities as much or as little as you want while experiencing some of the most remote parts of Patagonia.<br/><br/>Everything is included in the tour cost from the time you arrive in Santiago until the last day of the tour. All you need is a sense of adventure and possibly a camera to catch the incredible beauty of area so that your friends will believe you when you try to describe this wild and wonderful place to them upon your return home.<br/><br/>The tour starts in Santiago and enjoy one day of touring and wine tastings in Chile’s fantastic and plentiful wine producing regions. On our second day we travel to Patagonia via a short regional flight. We will then meet our floating home, the 57-foot motor vessel called the Noctiluca. From here the world is our oyster as we explore this incredible coast line.",

      "description": "One or both of your guides will meet you at the international airport Santiago, Chile, wearing their company t-shirts. The afternoon is yours to explore the neighbourhood and city. Depending on how you are feeling after checking into the hotel and freshening up, you may be interested in a walk through some of the local parks & around the general area. If you prefer, please enjoy a nap or a quiet afternoon at the hotel. That evening we will all meet at the hotel and head out for a welcome dinner at one of our favourite Chilean establishments. (Please note, expenses on this day, other than the airport pickup, hotel and dinner, are not included in the tour cost). Then it’s time for a good night’s sleep."

The journey through the Valley begins our encounter with some of the many different types of landscapes that we are about to experience over the rest of our journey. Here we will visit some boutique wineries as well as some of the well-known establishments for tastings and tours of their wine production. Of course there will be time for you to purchase a bottle or two to take home. We will return to the city in time for dinner at one of our favourite restaurants and will dine under the stars while enjoying the nightlife of the Chilean streets."

      "description": "Morning will come early, but the excitement of the journey to come will help with our wake-up call. After a continental breakfast, we will transfer to the Santiago airport for our flight to Balmaceda airport. A 3-hour flight later, we will arrive in Patagonia! We will then drive an hour through beautiful rolling hills and past waterfalls to meet our mothership, the beautiful Noctiluca. The “Noctiluca” is a 57-foot motor yacht named after the luminous plankton that abounds in Patagonian waters (what we would call bioluminescence). Once all settled aboard, the captain will give us a safety briefing and we will enjoy dinner while watching the sun sink behind the islands as we motor out of the Aisen Fjord and Paso Casma. That night we will anchor in beautiful Chiva Cove (apx 60 nautical miles covered by boat). THE KAYAK PATAGONIA ADVENTURE BEGINS Please note that while this Patagonian coastline is absolutely stunning, it can be quite exposed to wind in certain areas so we have to split our paddling with motoring in order to get to some of the remote places to paddle. Both the paddling portion and the motoring portion of this trip are weather dependent, so the following itinerary is simply a guideline, but will likely need to be flexible to work with nature."

      "description": "There are so many places to explore in this region it is hard to say exactly where to begin our paddling, but the many small islets of Isla Traiguén and its bird colonies are a likely starting point. Paddling in the area around Isla Goñi we’ll get a sense of a Patagonian landscape that is more often found even further south: low scrub vegetation with only a few trees near the shoreline, evidence of the harsh climate of the region. Here there are also signs of the original inhabitants of the islands, the Chonos people, in the form of shell middens (mounds of shell material deposited over many years from harvesting and consuming mussels and clams)."

Here we will gather ancient ice for a toast to the imposing icebergs of the lagoon. That afternoon we will take an excursion by zodiac to the beaches and streams near the glacier."

      "description": "Today we will explore the San Rafael Lagoon. We will have lunch near the glacier, surrounded by icebergs. We will carefully navigate our way by kayak through the icebergs to visit the region’s various beaches and islets. That evening we will anchor at Port Lepardo at the entrance of the lagoon. While we eat dinner we will listen for the tell-tale cracking sounds of the calving glacier in the distance."

      "description": "Today we motor to the estancia (ranch) owned by our Captain Robin Westcott. Estancia Quitralco is a private ranch which covers many square kilometers and offers us the chance to spend the afternoon exploring the river by kayak, fly fishing and/or trekking on the property. We will finish off our day with an authentic gaucho lamb asado (or BBQ). The taste of fresh lamb and vegetables slow-roasted over an open fire enjoyed under the vast Patagonian sky is second to none. This meal of course will be accompanied by a great selection of Chilean wine and beer and vegetables picked fresh from the garden on-site. Is this heaven on earth?"

      "description": "Departing from Quitralco we will set sail for nearby hot springs. Discovered by our Captain’s family decades ago, this secluded and private location offers some luxurious soaking while taking in a fabulous view down the fiord. We will spend the remainder of the day navigating through small channels, ideal for dolphins and encounters with other wildlife. That night we spend anchored in Puerto Lynch."

The scenery here will not disappoint. After exploring these beautiful islands we will motor to our final anchorage of the trip. Dinner on board will once again leave our taste buds truly satisfied and our bellies full. Really, could life get any better?"

We will get an early start to ensure we arrive back to Puerto Aisen in time to transfer back to the Balmaceda Airport in time to catch a flight back to Santiago that evening. If you are pressed for time, it may be possible to catch an international flight this evening (check with the office for details). The rest of the group will enjoy one last farewell dinner together in Santiago. Hotel this last night is included in the tour cost."

You are welcome to explore the city on your own, perhaps heading to a local market for some souvenir shopping before flights that evening. Most international flights leave late in the day. We will arrange pickups and ensure you get to the airport safely."
