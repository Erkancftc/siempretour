    "generalInfo": "Stretching out under some of the clearest skies on earth, the Atacama desert offers a photographic playground like few others. On this photo tour, you’ll travel into the heart of this wilderness, where salt flats ripple into distant volcanoes, geyser fields steam in the dawn, and flamingos trace pastel-coloured lagoons. <br/><br/>Your base will be the desert town of San Pedro de Atacama, a remote outpost framed by eldritch rock formations, luminous skies and quiet evenings that invite reflection. Each day we’ll chase the desert’s differing moods: the just-sunlit folds of Valle de la Luna, the high-altitude lakes reflecting snow-capped peaks, the geyser fields at sunrise, and salt-crust flats under towering skies.<br/><br/>What’s more, this is a trip that pairs the grand scale of landscape with unexpected detail: vicuñas grazing beneath volcanoes, horned coots by tranquil lakes, and herds of guanaco silhouetted in changing light. You’ll be supported every step of the way,  in a small group, with a photographic guide who knows how to unlock the region’s visual potential.",

We also discover the “green lung” of Santiago, the Metropolitan Park on the “Cerro San Cristóbal”, a hill in the middle of the city with a huge white statue of the Virgin Mary crowning its summit. In the afternoon we travel to the beautiful Maipo Valley south of Santiago and visit Viña Santa Rita. We’ll join a tour through the winery which will introduce you to Chilean viticulture.

The village is noteworthy for its peculiar rough-stonework architecture, and the inhabitants still live by age-old methods of planting terraced fields with corn, wheat and potatoes. After, we continue for about another 19mi (30km), climbing an additional 3,281ft (1,000m) in altitude to reach the highland lagoons of Miscanti (14,270ft/4,350m) and Miñiques (13,450ft/4,100m). The two volcanoes of the same name are visible in the background (almost 19,686ft/6,000m high). The twin lagoons are a deep blue, each framed by a white salt crust, which creates a memorable contrast to the yellow highland grass all around. It is completely silent here. Even the duck species that breed here, the foxes, and the grazing vicuñas (a type of camelid), respect the majestic silence. We then visit the Salar de Atacama. A salt lake of huge proportions (1,158 sqmi/3,000sqkm), it is covered by a thick layer of snow-white salt crystals, caused by the evaporation of the lake water. The largest lithium deposits in the world are found here, but the salt pan is also home to several flamingo species, including the Andean, Chilean and James, which feed on the micro-organisms in the saline lagoons. Look out for these beautiful birds and other species in their natural habitat at Chaxa Lagoon, which is part of the Reserva Nacional de los Flamencos. After the excursion, we return to San Pedro. Please note, the order of the itinerary may change today. Accommodation: Hotel Don Raul (or similar)"

The first rays reflect an array of colours as they mix with boiling geyser jets to create strong contrasts of steam and light. Around midday, we return to San Pedro for some free time. Returning along the same route, accompanied by the Andes and their volcanoes, we will make a short stop on the way at the Putana wetland, where we can observe different species of birds in front of the Colorado volcano.

    "generalInfo": "FROM CHILEAN WINERIES TO THE SAN RAFAEL GLACIER<br/>Join us for a trip to incredible Coastal Patagonia! This tour allows you to experience quality while exploring the beautiful outer islands of southern Chile. We will experience the best of what Chile has to offer in a mothership style sea kayaking tour: wine, wildlife and wilderness paired with sea kayaking in one of the most stunning places on earth, all from the comfort and convenience of our personal expedition ship.<br/><br/>The coast of Chile stretches for over 4300 kilometres, providing endless opportunities for kayakers. The region we have chosen for our tours is considered Northern Patagonia and is part of the Aysen Region. Most people think that the southernmost portion of Chile (Southern Patagonia) is the most rugged and wild, but think again. We will take you into difficult to access areas with stunning landscapes, abundant wildlife, hot springs and glaciers dropping into the sea, all while enjoying safety and service you have come to expect.<br/><br/>We’ve crafted this trip to take in most of the highlights that we’ve discovered over the past 8 years of traveling to the area, and feel that it is an excellent and in-depth introduction to the area. Some of the top selections include paddling in beautiful and pristine Traiguén and Goñi Islands finding traces of the original inhabitants of the area among small islands of the archipelago, viewing abundant wildlife, soaking in remote hot springs, basking in the immensity of the San Rafael Glacier and taking in a traditional asado (barbecue) at a remote estancia – all among the backdrop of volcanoes and mountains.<br/><br/>This trip is suitable for all ages and ability levels. Participate in our activities as much or as little as you want while experiencing some of the most remote parts of Patagonia.<br/><br/>Everything is included in the tour cost from the time you arrive in Santiago until the last day of the tour. All you need is a sense of adventure and possibly a camera to catch the incredible beauty of area so that your friends will believe you when you try to describe this wild and wonderful place to them upon your return home.<br/><br/>The tour starts in Santiago and enjoy one day of touring and wine tastings in Chile’s fantastic and plentiful wine producing regions. On our second day we travel to Patagonia via a short regional flight. We will then meet our floating home, the 57-foot motor vessel called the Noctiluca. From here the world is our oyster as we explore this incredible coast line.",

        "description": "Safety talk, white water rafting (B,L,D) Awaken on the banks of the Fu and enjoy your first morning in camp. You can take an early morning hike in the valley, or for those who choose to sleep in, rise later with the warmth of the sun and have breakfast around 9am. A pre-breakfast yoga class is available on our customized yoga platform with river views or in the indoor Yoga Loft if the weather is inclement. Mornings tend to be crisp and dewy so prepare to dress warmly - a fleece is perfect. Today is a river day. We will launch our rafts from basecamp after a thorough safety briefing. In a safe ‘eddy’, a short distance downstream, we’ll do a set of practice rescue drills. This allows the crew in each raft to hone their skills and prepare to raft as a team. We use a cataraft combined with ace safety-kayakers as part of our safety net. Each raft is captained by a highly trained and intuitive river guide, who guides the boat from a stern-mounted oar frame. Guiding with oars does not detract from the paddling experience. The advantage to the oar frame is greater control in pointing the bow straight through bus size holes and 15-foot high “haystack” wave trains. High siding is also an actively used paddle command. This style is consistent with any high volume, strong-current river where rapids graded 4 to 5-plus rage on. This is the Futaleufu! The first section that we raft, from camp down to Puente Futaleufu (the Futaleufu Bridge), is only 10km, but offers more rapids per 1,000m than anywhere else on the river. It is the perfect warm up run and it is non-stop fun. The rapids of note are El Cojin (The Cushion), and Mundaca, a local family’s name. At take-out, we meet our vehicles for a 20-minute ride back to camp. Those who would prefer a lower body workout to complement their paddling are welcome to run back or ride one of our mountain bikes from take-out to camp. When we get to camp, you can choose to go fly-fishing, try out a kayak, practice yoga, nap in a hammock, enjoy the sauna, have a massage, go for a hike, or soak in the hot tub. Taking a hot shower, either indoors or under the big sky, feels very luxurious while camping in the remote wilderness of northern Patagonia Of course, for the hardy, the river provides a cold bath and refreshing swim. As the sun sinks behind the mountains, enjoy a game of chess or cards at the sunset bar. Every late afternoon is Happy Hour with an open bar stocked with beer, wine, soda, and fresh juice. Then, we gather together in the open-air kitchen/dining area, the Galpon, for a candlelight sit-down dinner featuring fresh produce, grown right in our own garden, and freshly baked breads. After dinner, enjoy the campfire and the stars before retiring to your cozy tent on your private platform. The sound of the river will lull you to sleep and send you off dreaming of the next day of adventure in Chile."

Our aim is to settle into a river rhythm that will be utilized in order to successfully raft the next few sections the Fu. After Yoga and breakfast, we launch our rafts from camp and have lunch on the river. After we pass the Puente Futaleufu (yesterday’s take-out), we immediately round the corner to meet a big stomping continuous cascade of waves known as Mas o Menos, translated, More or Less. This is a good stepping-stone towards our first true blue class V technical rapid, Casa de Piedra (House of Rock) which is right around the next corner. We get out of our rafts to scout this massive, boulder-choked rapid from the banks of the Fu. It is formed like a series of water wheels that channel all of their fury into a final churning pit with a dragon’s back highway through it; that is, if you hit it on line. After this rapid, we run the remaining class 3 and 4 rapids as our hearts resume beating at their normal rates. We drift into a nice long, calm section that offers perfect fishing from the rafts as well as a great place to get into some hard shell kayaks. The next three miles we have a floating happy hour and reach our take out spot just above Lago Yelcho. Upon return to camp, we continue to celebrate the day, enjoy the spa and get ready for another fabulous dinner prepared by our jovial crew and talented chef."

        "description": "Drive to Futaleufu, raft Inferno Canyon (B,L,D) We have an early breakfast in camp then travel 25 kilometres up the road to Rio Espolon to launch our rafts for the Inferno Canyon day. On the Rio Espolon we have a chance to warm up on this low volume river before it joins and helps form the mighty Futaleufu as it gets squeezed into the narrow Inferno canyon. This upper canyon requires aggressive class V paddling and is potentially the most intense section of white water on the river. Many other options exist for those who choose not to participate in Inferno Canyon. Five distinct rapids form a narrow sinuous river passage creating a wet surge and a full on adrenaline rush. The fourth rapid was until recently the smallest of the 5, but due to road building debris landing in the river, has now become nearly impassable at most water levels and requires a walk around and lining the rafts through it. As we come out of Exit, the last rapid, we enter into a long calm. The current remains swift and we cruise many miles downstream arriving at the mandatory portage around the fierce Zeta rapid. We have lunch on the rocks as the crew ghost boats the rafts through this treacherous rapid. After lunch, our first obstacle is Throne Room, a class V+ rapid for kayaks, a ghost boat rapid for rafts. By walking around this rapid, we get a great bird’s eye view of an almost ‘river wide’ hole that could destroy a raft. Back on board our rafts, we are dealt a Royal Flush; a continuous class IV corridor of rapids does not let up until we get to our take-out spot at the Rio Azul footbridge. The rafts are left for the night, tethered on shore. Early evening is spent in camp getting ready for the evening festivities. Blanca and her partner Umberto, locals from a nearby farm, prepare a very special treat for us. They prepare a delicious dinner called Curanto that is typical of the south of Chile and the island of Chiloe. We spend the evening by the bonfire on the beach singing and dancing the night away."

We call it the summit day as we aim to top our already great paddling days with the best day of white water in the world. After a nutritious breakfast, we head up river to the footbridge where we left the rafts yesterday. As our day on the river begins, the blue glacial run-off from the Rio Azul River merges into the Fu from the right. The views of the snow-capped mountain peaks and jagged ridges of the mountain Las Tres Monjas (translated, the three Nuns) are absolutely breathtaking. A six-kilometre stretch of warm-up rapids leads us to the longest and toughest rapid that we will raft, The Terminator. We scout and study our line, then we take the plunge and drop in. “Left turn, right turn, dig it in — hard forward!” are a few of the commands that might be heard. The next three miles are non-stop rapids. After an aerobic workout, we pump through the enormous haystack wave train known as the Himalayas. Just when we need it, a calm returns, we float gently into lunch, served at our base camp. After lunch, we return to the river to complete the last task for the day, tackling as much white water as possible. We raft the whole section of river from camp to below Casa de Piedra. At take-out, cold beers and tea are waiting. We make a triumphant return to camp to celebrate our days spent exploring Futaleufu valley and river. For the evening’s festivities, Rolando and Nelli will prepare a typical Chilean Asado — lamb roasted over a bed of coals, ensalada, potatoes and farm fresh bread. We toast the river and give thanks for our safe passage. Under a bright starry sky, we will spend our last night together as a group on the banks of the mighty Fu with the guides and crew."

During our stay here, we’ll be using the town of Puerto Varas as our base camp; located on the shores of Llanquihue Lake and with two volcanoes on the horizon, Puerto Varas is a unique microcosm of Germanic culture here in the Lakes District. In the 1800s, large numbers of Germans emigrated here, taking over native lands, and bringing their architecture, food, and traditions with them. Puerto Varas is home to some of the best-preserved examples of Germanic houses in the region. On this first day, after flying from Santiago to Puerto Montt, we’ll head to a nearby natural reserve for an easy hike to introduce you to the flora and fauna of southern Chile, guided by a professional naturalist. On the way, we’ll pass the scenic River Maulli´n before reaching the reserve, which protects some of the region’s threatened temperate rainforests as well as one of the last patches of native Alerce trees in the area. The temperate rainforests here are some of the most precious gems of the Lakes District, full of unique plants and animals that you can keep an eye out for during our walk. During the short hike, we’ll learn about and observe the rich diversity of mosses, lichens, fungi, climbing vines, ferns and trees with the use of magnifying glasses, as well as local birds and other wildlife.

        "description": "PUERTO NATALES – Half Day Tour: Kayaking in Eberhard Fjord – Today you’ll get to appreciate the rugged spectacle of Patagonia’s wild fjords from a wholly unique perspective: a kayak! We’ll head to the town of Puerto Prat, roughly a 30-minute drive from Puerto Natales, where we’ll be greeted by our hosts who operate the kayaking business. These kind people open their homes to us and tell us about their lives in remote Patagonia; their house dates from 1909 and several generations have lived there. We’ll then receive our gear, listen to the safety lecture, and then head out onto the waters! The exact route is subject to change due to weather and water conditions, but overall the excursion will navigate along the historic Eberhard Fjord, from Puerto Prat to Puerto Consuelo, passing by Kruger Island (Island of the Dead). In addition to spectacular landscapes, also be sure to keep your eyes peeled for local wildlife like birds. During the excursion, we’ll pause on a remote shore to take a 40-minute walk to visit some amazing viewpoints. We’ll then jump back into our kayaks and return to Puerto Prat to enjoy a tasty local meal consisting of fresh bread, homemade jams made from native berries (calafate, currant, raspberry, rhubarb or rosehip), butter, scrambled eggs, coffee, tea, and milk. After eating, we’ll head back to Puerto Natales for the night. ? Location: Eberhard Fjord, Puerto Prat, Puerto Natales. ? Level of difficulty: Medium ? Duration: Approx. 6 hours."

The rich minerals in the soil are absorbed by the vines at the foothills of the Andes Mountains, which stretch west towards the Pacific Ocean. The rural charm of the valley emanates from the farmhouses, gregarious locals, and preserved traditions. Lush trees grow on the foothills and the ubiquitous vines glow shades of emerald against the bright blue sky. The earthy aromas of the soil blend with the herbaceous quality of the trees. Carmenere, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, and Merlot grapes thrive in the summer heat and winter cold. You are used to crisp air nipping at your nose in December, but the summer sun washes over the Chilean valley, highlighting the gemlike glow of the vines and dirt paths separating the rows, resembling Napa or the Tuscan countryside. Visit a winery, which opened in the 1930s in the heart of the valley. Three generations have worked the land and brought the flavors of the vineyard to Chile and beyond the country’s borders. The vineyard spans more than 640 acres and offers guides who understand the methods of winemaking and winetasting. Wander through the trails of the vineyard and feel the plump, dusty edges of the grapes growing beneath the leaves. A horse carriage passes you on the trail. You taste a wine yet to have matured, with your guide drawing from the stainless steel vat. The tasting room emits an atmosphere of rustic charm. Your guide pours a sample of the Carmenere.

        "description": "In the morning, the herbaceous aroma of mate tea fills the dining room. After breakfast, you will leave behind the urban sprawl of Punta Arenas bound for the vast wilderness of Torres del Paine National Park. The scenic drive leading to the park fills with the verdant colors of the pampas and crop fields. Cattle graze on the open plains mirroring the past when herds of sheep fed on the abundant grass and natural herbs. Outside of Puerto Natales, you reach Milodon Cave. The natural cavern was discovered in the 1890s where the remains of a giant ground sloth reached more than 13 feet tall. The largest cave has a depth of 656 feet with a height of over 98 feet. A German merchant discovered the giant ground sloth with skin and bones intact. There were also human bones from the Paleo-Indian culture that inhabited the cave approximately 8,000 years ago. A replica of the animal stands at the mouth of the cave as it welcomes visitors to an important element of Chile’s Patagonian region. Look out over the landscape from the cave, which reveals the beauty of snowcapped mountains in the background and lush forestry in the foreground. You will arrive at Hotel Las Torres Patagonia, located inside Torres del Paine National Park. The superb location provides picturesque panoramas and private viewpoints to mountains, glaciers, lakes, and rivers.

After breakfast, you will start the day at Salto Grande, an impressive cascade of the Paine River. The glassy turquoise water splashes down 213 feet into the roiling river. The breeze carries the mist along the greenery lining the rocky banks. The falls connect the vast waters of Lake Nordenskjöld and Lake Pehoe. You continue along a steady outcrop that leads to views of Los Cuernos , or the Horns of Patagonia. The peaks create a silhouette of jagged, inspiring granite piercing the sky at 9,462 feet above sea level. Your guide offers insight into capturing the best photos of the remarkable peaks. He will teach you to use passing clouds or natural light for contrast and depth. The natural marvels of Torres del Paine continue when you reach the Condor Viewpoint. Marvel at the massive wingspan of the largest flying bird in South America, the Andean condor. They gracefully glide along the wind using air-pockets to suspend themselves in the sky with little effort due to their enormous wingspan reaching an average 10 feet wide.

The scenic drive features stunning views of the Paine Torres and the subtle shimmer of the granite of Los Cuernos in the sunlight. You will have a chance to practice some of the photography techniques you are learning along the way when you stop in a beech forest. Snapshots of the evergreen and deciduous leaves and the fruits and nuts of trees averaging 200 years old. The woodlands were gradually reforested around 10,000 years ago when the glaciers retreated. You arrive at the banks of Grey Lake and board a boat along the placid waters. The cool, crisp wind bites at your cheeks and carries the scent of ice in the air. The lake has a surface area of more than 12.5 square miles reaching a maximum depth of 1,640 feet born from Southern Patagonian Ice Field. As you near the edge of the glacier, icebergs bobble in the dark glowing water. South Andean deer often grace the woods near the lakeshores but the stunning, timid animal remains mostly elusive around groups of people. Grey Glacier flows southward into the lake and stops at its natural wall reaching over 98 feet tall. The entire glacier encompasses a total area of 100 square miles. The fantastical image recreates a storybook landscape easily photographed with sensational accuracy. When the boat travels close to the ice sheet, you will swear you can hear the ice cracking, ready to calve away from the wall and crash into the waiting water."

The trails call to you in the early morning so you set out in search of the puma, often referred to as the “King of Patagonia.” As you walk along the trail, you keep an eye open for the South American gray fox, guanaco, and armadillo. There are 118 separate species of Southern birds populating the national park including the Chilean Flicker and the Magellanic Woodpecker. You can easily hear the woodpecker before you spot it in the trees pecking against the bark in search of food. Their solid black body shines with white patches along the wings beneath a bright crimson crest along the head. You will follow tracking specialists on a private ranch and learn the important details for tracking a puma in the wilderness. The sun rises over the gorgeous landscape to reveal the lush greenery of the woodlands amid striking lens flares. The puma is most active in the morning and at night when the temperatures are cooler. The Andean puma remains elusive. It is the largest feline in the Americas growing to nearly six and a half feet long, not including its tail, and weighing up to 121 pounds. Their size generally fluctuates depending on their habitat’s climate so there is an increase in weight and length when they live in colder climates and higher altitudes. Male pumas live solitary, territorial lives covering thousands of acres. They are active climbers, short-distance sprinters, and possess a keen sense of smell, as well as night vision. You return to searching for the puma, after a rest in the afternoon, which will increase your chances of sighting one of the most mysterious animals in Patagonia."

You continue from the Chilean Camp up the moraine, an accumulation of dirt and rocks fallen from the glacier’s surface. The unstable slopes become a worthwhile obstacle when you reach the stable plateau in view of the Torres and Cuernos del Paine. The photogenic rock formations reach staggering heights at nearly 6,562 feet above sea level.
