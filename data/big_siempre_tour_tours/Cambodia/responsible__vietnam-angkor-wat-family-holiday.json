For those arriving on time, our tour leader plans to meet you in the hotel reception at 6pm for the welcome meeting and for those that wish, there is the chance to go out for dinner. There are no other activities planned today, so you're free to arrive in Hanoi at any time.

The pavements around here are filled with food sellers tempting you with steaming noodles, snacks and stir-fried delights, too."

      "description": ": This morning, we set off towards Danang. Our journey takes us past the five peaks of the Marble Mountains, originally believed to have been islands that were said to represent the five elements of water, wood, fire, gold and earth. On arrival in Danang, we'll board the morning flight to Ho Chi Minh City. Landing in Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon), we'll head out to explore District 3 by cyclo (cycle carriages with a seat at the front). We'll turn off the main thoroughfare and into the maze of narrow streets of this bustling district on foot. Our walk takes us past ramshackle shopfronts, through local markets selling anything from colourful fruit to bootleg DVDs, and past houses, churches and schools, all squeezed into the small buildings that line the narrow alleys. Finally, we'll stop at a local stall for a traditional Vietnamese coffee (brewed coffee served sweet with condensed milk) where we can also sample 'Banh Mi' - a Vietnamese take on the humble French baguette - freshly baked and packed with a combo of traditional and more exotic ingredients. Our walk winds up at the so-called 'secret weapons' bunker'. A small unassuming 'tube house' with a trap door in the floor that hides a basement stocked full of rifles, grenades and ammunition. The bunker played a key role in the TET Offensive of 1968, it was the base from which the Viet Cong's \"Team 5\" launched their assault, and its location was only revealed after the end of the war. We'll have some time to explore the house and bunker, filled with decommissioned weapons and photographs, news clippings and memorabilia from the wartime."

We'll cycle for around 10-12 kilometres/6-7 miles along the flat Cai Thai village path with views of the delta as we wind our way around its tributaries. The route is often shaded which is helpful to combat the humidity (the boat can pick up cyclists at various stopping points if required). Along the way, we'll visit Mrs Nani's home who will show us how to make rice paper in the traditional way and Mr and Mrs Chin's home who will treat us to refreshments that include her famous 'Banh Tieu' (traditional doughnut).
