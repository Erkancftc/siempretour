  "generalInfo": "Spend 10 days exploring the natural wonders and fascinating heritage of Cambodia, on this tailor made tour. This suggested itinerary combines unforgettable Angkor Wat, the largest religious monument of the ancient world and perhaps Cambodia’s most famous destination, with community tourism projects that don’t occupy such a prominent position on the tourist trail. There will be time for river cruising, bird watching, trekking and mountain biking, too, with one internal flight to help cover the ground and make sure this is a brilliantly rounded and exciting holiday.<br/><br/>The tour begins in Siem Reap, for exploring the Angkor Wat temple complex, before taking to the water for a cruise on Tonle Sap Lake and up the Sangker River to Prek Toal Bird Sanctuary, an important site for endangered large water birds, including species of ibis, stork and pelican. You will also visit colourful Chong Kneas floating village before taking a domestic flight to Phnom Penh.<br/><br/>After the sights and vibrancy of Phnom Penh head to the Cardamom Mountains and Koh Kong Province. Take a tour and enjoy homestay at Chi Phat Ecotourism Site, which protects the area’s natural and cultural resources and creates work and income opportunities for local people. Then enjoy some biking, trekking and birdwatching in the beautiful countryside, with three nights camping, before rounding off your tour back in Phnom Penh.<br/>",

      "description": "Siem Reap/Angkor temples. You will spend the whole day to the Temples of Angkor. You will start with the ancient city of Angkor Thom. Surrounded by walls with a height of 8m and length of 12km, the city was the last capital of the Khmer Empire. Five huge gates with huge stone faces provide access. Angkor Thom holds many important monuments including the Bayon Temple located in the exact centre, the Baphoun, Terrace of the Elephants and Terrace of the Leper King. Continue to Ta Prohm, a unique temple that has been left to nature with trees and vines growing amongst the structures. This is one of the most photogenic temples in the Angkor area and recently gained fame as the ‘Tomb Raider’ temple after featuring in the Angelina Jolie movie. Enjoy walking along the sandy paths and under huge banyan trees as you explore this 12th century temple. You will then visit Angkor Wat, the largest religious building in the world. Built by Suryavarman II in the early 12th century as a state temple and later mausoleum, Angkor Wat was originally a Hindu complex to honour Vishnu, the Hindu God. Late afternoon is just the right time for you to enjoy the wonderful sunset from the top of Pre Rup Temple. You will spend the night in Siem Reap."

      "description": "Siem Reap/Tonle Sap Floating village & Prek Toal Bird Sanctuary. Today you will start early for a magical day with an abundance of birds in a flooded forest wonderland. Tonle Sap is the largest natural lake in Southeast Asia, increasing in area by up to 3x annually as the floodwaters of the Mekong River cause the Tonle Sap river to flow backwards and fill the lake. Situated at the western end of the great lake is the largest waterbird colony in Southeast Asia. It is an astonishing site to visit. Prek Toal is globally important for eight species of bird; Spot- billed Pelican, Greater Adjutant, Lesser Adjutant, Milky Stork, Painted Stork, Black-headed Ibis, Oriental Darter and Grey-headed Fish-Eagle. Thousands of commoner waterbirds also breed here, and over 150 species have been recorded. The colony is at its busiest between December and April, but most species can be found throughout the year. Lunch will be served in a Prek Toal Village or there will be picnic lunch boxes. After boarding the boat back to Siem Reap in the late afternoon, you will cruise through the floating village in Chong Kneas before disembarking at the pier and being transferred to your hotel for overnight."
