  "generalInfo": "This two week tour of Cambodia is ideal for travellers wishing to become part of a small guided group. Taking in the significant highlights of Cambodia, including the awesome Angkor Wat, is as much a part of this holiday as the off the beaten track locations with adventures coming thick and fast all the way from Kampot River to Tonle Sap Lake and the mighty Mekong.<br/><br/>Plentiful rice paddies and pepper plantations pave the way to bike rides and authentic encounters with local people tending the land. Peace and quiet prevails away from the busier city streets with Kep Bay and Koh Kong within the foothills of the Cardamom Mountains providing pleasant places to pause before the bright lights of Battambang and street food stalls of Siem Reap.<br/><br/>Although the Killing Fields and Tuol Sleng museum in Phnom Penh provide painful reminders of the past they’re incredible important to visit on a tour of Cambodia. Doing your research and learning a little more before you travel is definitely required to get the most out of the experience as a whole.<br/><br/>From towering temples and royal palaces to handicraft villages and cycle rides through the Cambodian countryside, this is one small group tour in Southeast Asia that's guaranteed to keep responsible travellers coming back for more.<br/>",

      "description": "Our adventure begins in Cambodia's capital city, Phnom Penh. Around 6pm, say sousadei to your tour leader and fellow travellers, when we gather as a group for the first time to get to know each other and learn more about the adventures ahead. Your tour leader then ensures a big welcome by arranging a group dinner at a nearby restaurant. Want more time in Phnom Penh? Secure pre-tour hotel nights through your sales representative.

      "description": "Leaving Phnom Penh, we travel into rural Cambodia to Kampot, which sits on a picturesque river. On the way, we stop at the 11th-century Phnom Chisor mountain temple, which is set on a hill with a magnificent view. Upon arrival, we check into our centrally located hotel, our base for the next two nights, before boarding a local boat for a sunset trip on the Kampot River. The waterway runs through the town centre and can flow in both directions as it is closely connected to the sea. Accommodation: The Columns Hotel (or similar)"

      "description": "Today, we venture into the countryside to discover the highlights of the Kampot province including salt fields, rice fields, fruit and pepper plantations, and the Phnom Chhnork caves. Kampot is also one of the largest producers of durian fruit; the durian, once opened, has a smell so pungent it is illegal to take it indoors in some Southeast Asian countries. After exploring the countryside, we visit Kep ghost town. Once a popular seaside resort, Kep now houses old resort buildings marked with bullet holes from the Khmer Rouge period, a reminder of the not-so-distant past. It is regaining popularity with local tourists and you might like to join them in having lunch in the simple crab shacks that line the beach (the crab in Kampot pepper sauce is a must).

      "description": "This morning, we transfer back to the mainland by speed boat (45 minutes to one hour) and drive on to Phnom Penh (approximate transfer time: five to six hours) with a stop for lunch. Phnom Penh, on the banks of the Tonle Sap and the Mekong River, is home to 2.2m people. It's the capital city, but retains a laid-back, typically Cambodian feel where the pace is slower than one might expect. We set out on a sunset cyclo (bicycle rickshaw) lap of the town giving us a unique view of this bustling city and providing us with an easy orientation. Stopping to see street food served by the waterfront, we have the chance to try local specialities. We finish at a restaurant serving tasty Khmer cuisine. There are also many waterfront bars worth a visit; the Foreign Correspondents’ Club (FCC) overlooking the Tonle Sap river is recommended. Accommodation: Ohana Hotel (or similar)"

      "description": "This morning, we first visit Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum (also known as S21), which graphically displays the horrors of the four years when Pol Pot ordered the murder of between 2m and 3m Cambodians. It was originally a school but was used as a torture and interrogation centre between 1975 and 1979. It is a sobering but enlightening place to visit. After, we visit the Killing Fields of Choeung Ek, a football field-sized area surrounded by farmland, which contains mass graves for perhaps 20,000 Cambodians, many of whom were tortured before being killed. We complete our day with an afternoon visit to the Royal Palace complex, which has the Silver Pagoda inside, so named for the solid-silver tiles that make up the floor. Similar in style and scale to the Grand Palace in Bangkok, the Royal Palace has significantly fewer visitors and there is plenty of time to wander among the traditional buildings. There may also be time today to shop at either the impressive Central Market or the sprawling Russian Market, a souvenir hunter’s paradise. Accommodation: Ohana Hotel (or similar)"

      "description": "Our destination today is Battambang (pronounced Battambong). The second-largest city in Cambodia, it is centred around an attractive riverside hub with traces of French elegance, friendly Khmer people and well-preserved colonial architecture. There are also striking examples of art deco architecture: central market, the Victory swimming pool and the train station to name a few. En route to Battambang, we can stop at a pottery village, a silversmith village and a marble handicraft workshop for an insight into local handcrafts and industry. In the evening, we enjoy an orientation walk alongside the Sangke River and observe daily life of the local people. Accommodation: Classy Hotel (or similar)"

      "description": "Today, we cycle through countryside to explore the local rural life. Stopping at villages to see cottage industries, traditional scarf weaving and farming, there will be countless opportunities to interact with the villagers who may be surprised to see us travelling, as they do, on a bicycle. We reward our morning’s efforts with fruit and a refreshing coconut. The cycle is easy riding on flat terrain with lots of stops along the way. If you would like to opt out of the cycling and hop on a tuk-tuk instead, let the leader know at the beginning of the trip so alternative arrangements can be made.

      "description": "After breakfast, we head to the town of Siem Reap with stops at the local market at Pouk. Cambodian markets tend to be fragrant affairs – on offer here is Cambodian ‘cheese’; one of the strongest smelling cheeses around, perhaps because it is made entirely of fish. The local market is nonetheless a great insight into the daily life of the Cambodian people. We also make a brief stop at the Angkor Silk Farm for an introduction into the life of a silkworm and the production process of this fine textile. This afternoon, we walk past the Royal Gardens and along the Siem Reap River to the Old Market, helping us get our bearings in this small town. You may like to finish with a visit to the Artisans DÁngkor workshop – a not-for-profit organisation that provides vocational training for young people in traditional Cambodian arts.

      "description": "Our first full day of temple touring is by private bus so we can visit some of the outlying temples such as Banteay Srei. Known as the Women’s Citadel, this small temple complex with intricate carvings is devoted to Brahma. Particularly impressive are Banteay Kdei and Ta Prohm, still covered in jungle, similar to how it was when it first came to light. Described as being 'grander than anything of Greece or Rome' by French explorer Henri Mouhot, this World Heritage site stands alongside the Pyramids and Machu Picchu as one of the most spectacular archaeological sites in the world. Tonight is free to enjoy one of the many restaurants on the 'Bar Street' boulevard in central Siem Reap. You may also wish to marvel at the skills of the Phare Cambodian Circus troop or chose to watch traditional Apsara dancing. Accommodation: Baitong Heritage Hotel (or similar)"

      "description": "This morning, we get set up on mountain bikes for an easy but active ride around the Angkorian ruins that are closer to town. On the bicycle, we can avoid some of the crowds and get a unique perspective on this amazing site. If you want to rise early, you can arrange with your leader to take in Angkor at sunrise prior to the day’s cycling. We visit the incredible Angkor Wat, the many temples inside the Royal City of Angkor Thom, including the magnificent Bayon, which is comprised of 54 intricately carved towers in one single temple. The Bayon certainly left an impression on an early traveller in 1925 who stated 'we stand before it stunned. It is like nothing else in the land.' Angkor is a truly magical experience and a photographer's paradise, one of the real highlights of our trip. The ride will be approximately 15.5mi (25km) with plenty of opportunities for refreshment stops and to take photos. If you would like to opt out of cycling and instead cool down in the support vehicle, please let your leader know who can arrange the logistics of this and the rest of the group.
