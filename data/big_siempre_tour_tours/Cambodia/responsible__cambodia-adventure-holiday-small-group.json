      "title": "Bangkok.",
      "description": "Sa-wat-dee! Welcome to Bangkok. Your adventure begins with a welcome meeting at 6 pm, where you’ll meet your trip leader and fellow travellers. If you arrive early, you could take a riverboat to Chinatown and explore the crowded streets, uncover the magnificent Grand Palace and the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, wander down the tourist mecca of Khao San Road, or indulge in a Thai massage. There is plenty to keep you occupied in this exciting city. After your briefing, why not head out with the group to try some of Bangkok’s famed street food – pad thai anyone?"

      "title": "Siem Reap.",
      "description": "Take a flight from Bangkok to Siem Reap. The flight is unescorted, but your Thai leader will get you to the airport in Bangkok and your Cambodian leader will be ready to greet you on arrival in Siem Reap. When you arrive, enjoy a free evening to explore this small but bustling town. You may want to head to Pub Street to grab a bite to eat and sample the city’s nightlife. Or, maybe rest up in preparation for tomorrow’s visit to Angkor Wat."
    },
    {
      "dayNumber": 3,
      "title": "Siem Reap.",
      "description": "Today you'll visit the incredible Angkor complex with your guide. If you’re keen, this place is best seen at sunrise, so you can get up super early and head to the complex on your own before your included tour. With your group, you’ll hop on the Remork-moto (Cambodian Tuk-tuk) with an all-female crew from Drivers Srey, whose mission is to support local women with sustainable income to support their families – this will be your transport at Angkor Wat today. With a knowledgeable local guide, you’ll be able to make the most of your visit to the world-famous Angkor complex, built between the 9th and 13th centuries when the Khmer Empire was the pre-eminent influence in Southeast Asia. The ruins are scattered over some 160 square km – the biggest religious monument in the world! Thankfully, the central cluster of temples is close to Siem Reap, so you'll have plenty of time to fully appreciate the main archaeological sites, including Angkor Wat – the astounding main temple, Bayon – a marvel of many sculpted decorations and Ta Prohm – a series of smaller temples covered in tree roots and jungle. Your guide will add to your experience by bringing ancient history to life with their extensive knowledge of the site."

      "description": "Today, enjoy a free morning in Siem Reap (if Angkor is calling you back, maybe get up early and catch the sunrise) before travelling to Battambang – Cambodia's second-largest city. Battambang (pronounced Battambong) is a riverside town of French elegance, Khmer people and beautifully preserved architecture. The city is famous for its many statues of animals and divinities that decorate the streets and buildings. The city lacks the traffic of Phnom Penh and the visitor numbers of Siem Reap, so it’s a great place to get a real, authentic slice of Cambodia. When you arrive, follow your leader on an orientation walk to familiarise yourself with the town. Then, enjoy some free time. Tonight, maybe walk along the riverfront where locals indulge in yoga and folk dancing, and watch the sunset."

      "description": "There are lots of optional activities you can choose from today – just ask your trip leader will for advice. If you’re feeling active, maybe hop on a bike or take a tuk-tuk tour to the countryside to learn about rural life. Maybe take part in a cooking class and try your hand at some Khmer cuisine. Or, you might like to visit the hilltop Wat Banan temple, offering 360-degree panoramic views over the Sang Ke River."

      "title": "Chambok.",
      "description": "Travel by private vehicle into rural Cambodia this morning, to the region of Kampong Speu and the village of Chambok. A member of the Chambok community will take you on a village walk when you arrive – chat about the community’s history, lifestyle and local ecotourism projects and meet the families you’ll be spending the night with. In the evening, head to the community centre to enjoy a local Khmer dinner prepared by some community members. You'll also be treated to a traditional dance performance."

      "title": "Kampot.",
      "description": "Morning after breakfast, trek to stunning Chambok waterfall, if the weather's right before jumping on a private bus this morning and drive to Kampot – one of Cambodia's most attractive old towns. Renowned for its pepper, Kampot supplied most French restaurants with this vital spice for many years during colonial rule. Today, the region is well-known for its plantations of durian – a spiky, pungent fruit that you either love or hate (try one and decide for yourself). In your free time this afternoon, maybe stroll along the riverside and observe the French architecture, or have a cup of coffee on the veranda of one of the riverside restaurants and admire the view of the Bokor Mountain Range."

      "dayNumber": 8,
      "title": "Kampot.",
      "description": "Enjoy a free day in this chilled-out town. For a unique photo opportunity, head to the roundabout in the centre of the town, where a giant durian statue sits smack in the middle. Then, maybe browse for goodies at the covered market. The nearby countryside is also a delight to explore – among fields of Kampot pepper and rice there’s also a salt field and a limestone cave with a small seventh-century brick temple inside called Phnom Chhnork. Otherwise, why not have a relaxing day and enjoy one of the highly recommended traditional massages?"

      "dayNumber": 9,
      "title": "Phnom Penh.",
      "description": "Leave Kampot in your dust this morning and travel by local bus to the capital city of Phnom Penh. Cambodia's capital is set on a major junction of the Mekong and Tonle Sap rivers and boasts some fine examples of French-inspired architecture. Perhaps spend your free afternoon visiting the Royal Palace and Silver Pagoda. Wat Phnom, shrouded in myth, is equally worth a visit, as is the National Museum with its excellent Khmer collection. Cyclo tours around the city are a great alternative to walking and generally include the art deco Psar Thmei (Central Market), US Embassy, Wat Phnom, Mekong riverfront, Independence Monument and Royal Palace."

      "title": "Phnom Penh.",
      "description": "Today you’ll have the opportunity to learn more about Cambodia's tragic past on a guided tour of Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum (S21) and the Killing Fields of Choeung Ek – two sites that tell the story of the tragic legacy of the Khmer Rouge. After this, the afternoon is free for you to explore further. If you're looking to relax, the Seeing Hands massage parlours are some of the best in the city, and all visits support the staff who all have visual impairments. Their years of expertise may be just what you need today after a busy couple of days!"

      "description": "Travel by local bus from Phnom Penh to Ho Chi Minh City. Your leader will again assist you with border crossing procedures and you’ll stop for lunch. When you arrive, get out and discover Ho Chi Minh City's blend of old and new, east and west, and be sure to sample a baguette or some of the excellent coffee on offer – both markers of the city's strong French influence. Tonight, maybe hit one of the hole-in-a-wall bars and explore the nightlife. Ask your leader for the best restaurants and bars in the area to toast to a trip well-travelled."
