Visit the Banteay Srei Butterfly Centre, where we’ll learn all about the lifecycle of butterflies. The netted tropical enclosure here contains thousands of beautiful, free-flying butterflies and is the largest of its kind in Southeast Asia, and all revenue is re-invested to the local community to help alleviate poverty. The next stop on our tour is the Cambodian Landmine Museum which was established in 1997 by ex-child soldier Aki Ra. The museum aims to educate visitors on the importance of clearing landmines in Cambodia and also supports at-risk Khmer children. The truly stunning Banteay Srei Temple is next, which is home to some of the most exquisite stone carvings on earth. We’ll take a look around, learn a little about the temple and its history and, let’s be honest, pretend to be Indiana Jones for a few minutes. Since you're likely getting hungry at this point, we'll stop for a local Khmer lunch before heading to the next stop. On the way back, we’ll stop to meet the sugar palm community at Preah Dak Village, the biggest sugar palm producer in Siem Reap. Here you’ll get a chance to learn how this organic sugar is produced and hopefully you’ll get to taste one of their sweet treats too. Our last stops of the day will be at two more elaborate temples in the grand circle of Angkor. Then we'll finish off with a visit to Preah Khan Temple, one of the largest complexes at Angkor. Return to your hotel and you will have free time tonight."

This ecosystem was classified as a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 1997. Take a boat trip around the lake to see floating villages and get a taste for life ruled by monsoonal rains and water-based agriculture.

Why limit yourself to a few key sites at the majestic Angkor Wat when you explore on foot when you can get around by bike? And rather than limiting yourself to the cities, as entrancing as they are, you could hike in the beautiful countryside to picnic beside waterfalls, or in search of elusive river dolphins.<br/><br/>This small group activity tour of Cambodia takes you north from Phnom Penh, then west to Siem Reap over nine unforgettable days that are just packed with thrills. The itinerary is accompanied by a professional tour leader and local guides at certain points, but a lot of the time you are free to arrange your own sightseeing. In Phnom Penh of course a must-visit is the infamous Killing Fields, and the heart-rending Choeung Ek Memorial. In Siem Reap there is the opportunity to book yourself a Khmer cookery class, or take in the Cambodian Circus. <br/><br/>Between Cambodia’s two best-known cities there will be a stop in Skuon, where lunch is not for the fainthearted – fried tarantulas are the local delicacy. You’ll hike and cycle around peaceful villages, fruit orchards and rice fields. And spend a night on a picturesque Mekong island in a Khmer homestay, a great chance to try traditional foods, spot the rare Irrawaddy dolphins (if you’re very lucky), or just rest tired limbs in a cosy hammock.<br/><br/>Your passport may get a workout soon. This sociable, exciting tour of Cambodia - hiking, biking and kayaking, could well make you a believer in the joys of solo travel. <br/>",

The city lacks the traffic of Phnom Penh and the visitor numbers of Siem Reap, so it’s a great place to get a real, authentic slice of Cambodia. When you arrive, follow your leader on an orientation walk to familiarise yourself with the town. Then, enjoy some free time. Tonight, maybe walk along the riverfront where locals indulge in yoga and folk dancing, and watch the sunset."

After returning back to Siem Reap to escape the midday heat, spend some time at leisure. End the day with a tour to the temples of Angkor by remork (a Cambodian tuk tuk). First up: Ta Prohm. Built between the late-12th to early 13th centuries, Ta Prohm is unique in that it has been left largely overgrown by jungle trees and vines, with many parts of the temple crumbling to the ground. This makes the ‘Tomb Raider Temple’ one of the most picturesque and memorable of the Angkor temples. The visit will also include Banteay Kdei, a Buddhist monastery from the late 12th Century, and Srah Srang, also known as the ‘pool of ablutions’. Note: As Ta Prohm temple has become increasingly popular, there is an option to visit Preah Khan, a larger temple built by the same king in honour of his father (Ta Prohm was built for his mother). Less well known and therefore less frequently visited, Preah Khan is more grand in scale and yet provides a more intimate experience because of fewer visitors and it’s many collapsing and crumbling corridors. Note: Speak to the guide in the morning of the visit. Depending on the season there is a chance to visit a different temple to avoid the crowds as Ta Prohm is very crowded during peak periods. Overnight in Siem Reap."

This is a wonderful finale to our travels around both these countries, where it is hard to pick a favourite experience or place, because Cambodia and Vietnam are countries that inspire at every turn. And that is before we even start talking about the amazing food, of course. You won’t go hungry on this trip, for sure!<br/>",

        "description": "Today a full city tour introduces you to the sights of Phnom Penh, a city that lies near the confluence of the Mekong and Tonle Sap rivers. The private quarters of the Royal Palace are home to King Sihamoni and are closed to the public. You will, however, be able to visit the Silver Pagoda that lies in the palace complex, which is the most sacred temple in the country. Phnom Penh remains a living relic of the country’s past struggles and successes. Your included visits to the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum (S21) and the Killing Fields of Choeung Ek tell the story of the tragic legacy of the Khmer Rouge. Tuol Sleng is a former school that served as a Khmer Rouge torture centre, and it’s estimated that more than 20,000 people were held and tortured here. The Killing Fields of Choeung Ek are home to a stupa made up of some 8,000 human skulls, marking the site of the infamous location. This was the execution ground for the torture victims of Tuol Sleng, and standing in this peaceful setting, it's almost unthinkable to imagine that to date nearly 9000 corpses have been exhumed from the area. The visits are major parts of the experience here, but if you don't wish to visit them, please let your leader know. There is an optional visit to Wat Phnom, the temple that gave rise to the foundation of the city in the 15th century. After today's activities, you may wish to spend this evening relaxing in a cafe by the riverfront."

Arrive in the small but expanding town of Siem Reap, the gateway to Angkor and the most popular destination for travellers in all of Cambodia, perhaps even in South East Asia. You'll probably notice a change of pace here, so take a walk and enjoy the atmosphere. A visit to the old market is a must, even if you're not looking for souvenirs, wandering through the stalls and surrounding shops the silks, cottons, sarongs, silver and statues are a riot of colour and a feast for the eyes – and there will be one for your stomach too if you try some of the cheap, delicious street food! There's also a long tradition of shadow puppetry in the region, and if you're lucky you might catch a show at one of the local restaurants in the evening, perhaps while you're eating the specialty cuisine of Cambodia – amok, the name given to curry steam-cooked in banana leaves."

If you’re keen to see Angkor Wat at sunrise – the largest and most complete structure and the only temple with a west-facing entrance – your leader can organize an early visit for you before dawn (optional). Later in the morning, your group will tour the complex together. Of all the temples visited, Bayon is the centrepiece, with over 200 smiling carved faces and more than 50 gothic towers. You’ll also visit an ancient monastery, where you’ll meet a Buddhist monk to take part in a ritual that has survived for thousands of years. Sit on the floor as the monk chants and sprinkles holy water over you before tying a sacred thread around your wrist, ensuring protection and good luck for the rest of your journey. For lunch today, you'll visit the Spoons Restaurant and School where disadvantaged local youth learn skills that enable them to find gainful employment in the hospitality industry. After, head to Ta Prohm – a temple where nature has taken over, as large trees dominate the stone foundations. If you’re keen to see Angkor Wat in all its glory, you can also opt to end the day with a sunset view of the temples – just organize with your leader."

Truly one of the most spectacular sites in the world, this majestic temple brings hours of fascinating stories, historical insights and magical moments, as you explore on foot with your guide. From here you then visit an active temple, where you will experience the ceremony “Srouch Tec” (roughly translated as “pour water”). During the course of the ceremony you will meet a local monk, who will wash away your sins and any bad luck as he chants in ancient Pali; the perfect start to your Cambodian adventure. After enjoying some free time back at your hotel, this afternoon you’ll then visit the extraordinary Apopo’s Hero Rats visitor centre. Set up to help rid the country of landmines, you’ll see the rats at work and meet with a veteran de-miner who will provide an insight into the work of these incredible little creatures and the ultimate goal of Cambodia to be mine-free by 2025.

For many years elephants were used to carry tourists around the Angkor temples, but after much campaigning and pressure by animal rights groups and individuals, the local authorities recently made the decision to ban elephant riding completely. These elephants have now been moved to an area of lush forest just outside Siem Reap, where they are now protected and allowed to roam free in their natural environment. A visit to the Kulen Elephant Forest not only provides an insight into the amazing work being done here, but will allow you to spend some time observing the elephants at a distance. The support given to this initiative is vital, not only for the elephants’ wellbeing, but for the future success of other wildlife and environmental efforts in Cambodia.

    "generalInfo": "The country of Cambodia is synonymous with cheap travel, backpacking, excellent street food, Buddhist temples, stunning coastlines with white sand beaches and…well…just about everything other than wildlife. But that is unfair on a country that has populations of  Asiatic elephants, leopards, sun bears as well as a some of the world’s rarest primate species.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>Whilst on this particular trip we will split focus between some of the primates species, the rare freshwater Irrawaddy dolphin and of course the stunning cultural and historical sites of Angkor Wat, the largest religious temple in the world and of which some of the temples are being reclaimed by the forest in the most beautiful way. <br/><br/>We believe that by immersing ourselves into the cultures and histories of each country can one fully appreciate the natural environment and most importantly begin to understand what pressures the environment faces from the local people. It is only by understanding the needs and lifestyles of the local people that any sustainable conservation policy can be put in place.<br/><br/>Whilst exploring the forests and looking for all of these species and more you can rest assured that we will be exploring some of the least visited forests and national parks and seeing a range of wildlife that is unparalleled in other wildlife watching holidays.<br/><br/>We believe that this is a unique tour of Cambodia will give you a great overview of both the history, culture and stunning sites as well as understanding more about the wildlife and conservation issues impacting the animals and forests of South East Asia.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in cities and when travelling between national parks. There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available so if you wish to have a zoologist on your trip please contact us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through South East Asia and particularly the regions we visit. Your naturalist escort is an expert in mammals and their conservation and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. We will also employ a specific cultural guide for all sightseeing of temples and monuments.<br/><br/>The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, river safaris, spotlighting, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the park. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>This tour is recommended for the northern hemisphere spring, whilst the rainy and dry seasons vary through South East Asia this time of year (particularly March - early May) is a good time to visit these places without the rain being too bad.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.• Our local naturalist guides around each of the reserves, parks and wildlife watching areas we visit have a good relationship with the park officials and because of this we get a heads up when animals are sighted and this can guide us in where to focus and thus increasing our chances of seeing our targeted species.<br/>• All wildlife watching activities will be private for our group only, whether this is a guided walk, vehicle safari or boat cruise.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our wildlife watching holidays and safaris of South East Asia a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout South East Asia so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the Asiatic elephants, various gibbon species, Javan rhinos, orangutans and many more species. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of many South East Asian country at other times of year and focusing on other species from bird life, herpetology, diving and snorkelling and many other types of wildlife. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour visits various locations inside Cambodia; the entry point is Siem Reap and the departure point would be the capital Phnom Penh. On the trip you will visit some wildlife watching locations in central and northern Cambodia.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The wildlife watching on this trip is done by a variety of different methods, such as in a private vehicle, boat trips and guided walks. Most of the guided walks are done over flat terrain and so there is no specific need for a high fitness level but we require people to be used to walking for 1-2 hours and be used to walking in high temperatures and high humidity.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 15 Years Old",

        "description": "Siem Reap - Sightseeing After breakfast, you will be taken to the Mother of all temples, Angkor Wat. Believed to be the world’s largest religious building, this temple is the perfect fusion of symbolism and symmetry and a source of pride and strength to all Khmers. Built in the 12th century by King Suryavarman II, this is most famous temple at Angkor. We will begin by unraveling the mysteries of the bas-reliefs that tell of tales from Hindu mythology and of the glories of the Khmer empire. Stretching for almost one kilometre, these intricate carvings are a candidate for the world’s longest unbroken piece of art. Following in the footsteps of the devout and the destructive before us, we then continue to the upper levels of the inner sanctuary. The final steps to the upper terrace of Angkor are the steepest of all, as pilgrims of old were to stoop on their pilgrimage to encounter the Gods. Finally the pinnacle, the sacred heart of Angkor Wat, a blend of spirituality and symmetry so perfect that few moments will measure up. Also this morning, we continue to Ta Prohm temple, which has been abandoned to the elements, a reminder that while empires rise and fall, the riotous power of nature marches on, oblivious to the dramas of human history. Left as it was ‘discovered’ by French explorer Henri Mouhot in 1860, the tentacle-like tree roots here are slowly strangling the surviving stones, man first conquering nature to create, nature later conquering man to destroy. In the afternoon, we visit the immense walled city of Angkor Thom that was the masterpiece of King Jayavarman VII. Following the occupation of Angkor by the Chams from 1177 to 1181, the new king decided to build an impregnable fortress at the heart of his empire. The scale is simply staggering and we are immediately overwhelmed by the audacity of Jayavarman on arrival at the city’s gates. The causeway is lined by an intricate bridge depicting the Churning of the Ocean of Milk from Hindu mythology in which devas (gods) and asuras (devils) play tug of war with a naga (seven-headed serpent) to obtain the elixir of immortality. We begin our visit at the Terrace of the Leper King. This intricately carved platform was the royal crematorium and the statue that was originally thought to be the leper king is now believed to be Yama, the god of death. We continue along the Terrace of Elephants, originally used as a viewing gallery for the king to preside over parades, performances and traditional sports. At the southern end lies the Baphuon, once of the most beautiful temples at Angkor, dating from the reign of Uditayavarman in the 11th century. It has undergone a massive renovation by the French and is now once again open for viewing. Our climax is the enigmatic and enchanting temple of the Bayon. At the exact centre of Angkor Thom, this is an eccentric expression of the creative genius and inflated ego of Cambodia’s most celebrated king. Its 54 towers are each topped off with the four faces of Avalokiteshvara (Buddha of Compassion), which bear more than a passing resemblance to the king himself. These colossal heads stare down from every side, exuding power and control with a hint of compassion, just the mix required to keep a hold on such a vast empire. Before clambering upwards, we unravel the mysteries of the bas-reliefs, with their intricate scenes of ancient battles against the Chams and their snapshot of daily life during the Angkor period. After leaving the temples we will be taken back to the hotel and we can explore the town or just relax, the rest of the evening and night are free for your leisure. (breakfast is the only meal included today)."

Along the way we will stop at Beng Melea; a sprawling jungle temple that is still largely covered in vegetation as it is less visited by tourists than the main temple complex. We will spend some time exploring this adventurous temple before we stop for a local lunch. From here we then cross the Mekong River by a local ferry, which we share with local villagers. We then continue to Ban Lung, arriving in the province of Ratanakiri in the late afternoon. You will then have the rest of the day to relax until the gibbon trek evening briefing at 7pm. At the meeting we will run over the trek details for the next couple of days, this gibbon experience is run by the Gibbon Spotting Cambodia conservation project that are working hard to protect the Veun Sai-Siem Pang Conservation Area. This project started in 2010 when a new species of gibbon; the ‘northern buff-cheeked’ gibbon was discovered in the Veun Sai-Siem Pang Conservation Area. Working with researchers they habituated a gibbon family and now through eco-tourism this critically endangered species of gibbon is being used as a model species for similar projects in South East Asia. Money raised from bringing tourists here is fed back into the local community which helps in preventing the illegal logging and poaching that unfortunately takes place in the area. At the briefing this evening you will be told more about the project and then go to see the gibbons and other wildlife in the forest. So for tonight you can then enjoy your last night in civilization (well for a night anyway) before your adventure begins. (breakfast is the only meal included today)."

The journey is 35 km north to Kachon village (45 mins). In Kachon, a traditional boat will be waiting to take you the 12km (45 mins) downstream on the Sesan River to Veun Sai town. Along the way we will be able to observe some wildlife on the riverbank (mostly bird life) as well as the daily activities of the people who live along the river. In Veun Sai town we will take a bicycle for 30 minutes to the I Tub village, a Laotian community roughly halfway to the Veun Sai-Siem Pang Conservation Area station. Once in I Tub, we will take a short break for lunch and meet with a member of the Community-based Ecotourism Team. After lunch we continue to the station by bike along a forest path. There is a high possibility of seeing tracks and signs of some of the local wildlife that live here such as the claw marks of the sun bear on the tree trunks, the footprints of deer and other species as well as seeing some local bird species. We will cycle the majority of the way but in order to get a good look at our surroundings we will also walk in some parts. At around 3pm we will arrive at the gibbon research station where you will be introduced to the station chief, scientists, researchers, and your gibbon guide who will show you around the camp. You then have time to relax and make yourself comfortable before walking to the nearby savannah for a spot of bird watching; before sitting down to an early dinner at 6:45pm. At around 8pm we will head into the forest for a 1 hour night jungle walk, spotlighting is one of the best wildlife watching experiences and the only way to see several rare and elusive animals. The canopy is home to many nocturnal animals such as the pygmy slow loris (a small arboreal primate) and various species of civet as well as leopard cats and mouse-deer. We will then return to the accommodation and get some sleep before we go and search for the gibbons tomorrow morning. (breakfast is the only meal included today)."

As soon as dawn breaks the gibbons call to mark their territory and this is the best way of finding them. At 4am, whilst it is still dark we following a small trail to the protected gibbon area about 45 minutes away to make sure that we are there in time to hear their call. We then reach the edge of a grassy savannah and wait for the call of a certain gibbon family, currently the only group that accepts people in their presence. The different groups start to call (sing) at around sunrise with some calls carrying up to 2km. Once the habituated groups of gibbon’s starts to sing, the gibbon guide will try to locate them in the forest as fast as possible and he will guide us to the spot so we can watch them as they go about their morning activities in the tree canopy. In some cases they let you come very close – less than 15 meters – which provides an excellent opportunity to take pictures. This is a special time as the gibbons can travel quickly in the trees and leave in a split second, anytime they want. Once they do, it can be very difficult for us to find them again, however the group can often be followed for a couple of hours throughout the forest. After the gibbon spotting we head back to the station for brunch at about 10am. We then pack up and get ready to leave the forest. We will follow a different path through the jungle and head back to I Tub village. Again, some parts we will cycle some we will walk. On the way we visit a Chinese and Laos settlement and take a short walk around the village. It’s a nice idyllic village with friendly people and on certain days you will be able to witness traditional local weaving. We then continue back to Veun Sai town, cross the Sesan River by a small ferry, before stopping off for lunch at a restaurant that boasts a beautiful view of the river. Our journey has now come to an end and we are picked up by car and travel back to Ban Lung arriving at approximately 3pm. Once back at the hotel you will be free to have the rest of the day to rest and catch up on sleep from such an early start. Dinner can be taken at the hotel or a nearby restaurant but is not included.

Sitting on the banks of the Tonle Sap and Mekong rivers with wonderful crumbling colonial architecture, it’s a city spinning into the future.

The private quarters of the Royal Palace are home to King Sihamoni and are closed to the public. You will, however, be able to visit the Silver Pagoda that lies in the palace complex, which is the most sacred temple in the country. Then, visit the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum (S21) and the Killing Fields of Choeung Ek, which tell the story of the tragic legacy of the Khmer Rouge. Tuol Sleng is a former school that served as a Khmer Rouge torture centre, and it’s estimated that more than 20,000 people were held and tortured here. The Killing Fields of Choeung Ek are home to a stupa made up of some 8000 human skulls. This was the execution ground for the torture victims of Tuol Sleng, and standing in this peaceful setting, it's almost unthinkable to imagine that nearly 9000 corpses have been exhumed from the area. After, maybe visit Wat Phnom – the temple that gave rise to the foundation of the city in the 15th century."

Later in the morning, your group will tour the complex together. Of all the temples visited, Bayon is the centrepiece, with over 200 smiling carved faces and more than 50 gothic towers. You’ll also visit an ancient monastery, where you’ll meet a Buddhist monk to take part in a ritual that has survived for thousands of years. Sit on the floor as the monk chants and sprinkles holy water over you before tying a sacred thread around your wrist, ensuring protection and good luck for the rest of your journey. For lunch today, you'll visit the Spoons Restaurant and School where disadvantaged local youth learn skills that enable them to find gainful employment in the hospitality industry. After, head to Ta Prohm – a temple where nature has taken over, as large trees dominate the stone foundations. If you’re keen to see Angkor Wat in all its glory, you can also opt to end the day with a sunset view of the temples – just organize with your leader."

Here, we'll see the entire process - from shaping the clay on traditional wheels to firing and glazing. We then continue to Udong, Cambodia's former royal capital and an important historical site. Perched on a series of hills, Udong is dotted with ancient temples and stupas, many of which offer panoramic views of the surrounding countryside. As we explore the site, we'll see intricately carved stone monuments, Buddhist shrines, and the final resting places of kings from the pre-Angkorian era. The serene atmosphere, combined with the spiritual significance of the temples, makes Udong a fascinating stop that connects Cambodia's royal history with its cultural and religious traditions. After our visit, we continue to Phnom Penh, where history, French-colonial architecture, and the energy of modern urban life converge along the bustling riverfront.

        "description": ": This morning, we leave Phnom Penh and head west into Koh Kong province towards Chi Phat, a small village nestled in the southeastern corner of the Cardamom Mountains. Chi Phat is a model of sustainable eco-tourism, where the community has embraced initiatives to share the region's stunning natural beauty with visitors in a responsible way. Surrounded by dense rainforest, cascading waterfalls and pristine rivers, the area is a paradise for nature lovers and offers a genuine sense of being off the beaten path. The drive to the Cardamom Mountains takes approximately two and a half hours, after which we reach the village by traditional boat, gliding along calm waters while enjoying the serene sights and sounds of the surrounding jungle. Upon arrival, we settle into our accommodation with local families, staying in private bungalows that offer comfortable beds, ensuite bathrooms and charming rustic touches, giving a warm and authentic experience while supporting the community. After settling in, we enjoy lunch at the community centre, freshly prepared by the villagers. Weather permitting, we then head out to explore the surrounding area by local transport. Our drive takes us along quiet dirt roads through rural landscapes. Along the way, we discover hidden waterfalls and rapids, where, depending on the season, there may be the opportunity for a refreshing dip. The views are spectacular, with mountain peaks rising above verdant forests, rivers winding through the valley and the occasional friendly wave from local villagers. Suppose seasonal weather conditions do not allow for the drive on dirt roads. In that case, we will instead explore the village on foot and participate in a hands-on cooking class, learning to prepare traditional Cambodian dishes with guidance from the villagers. This immersive alternative highlights local culinary traditions and village life. In the late afternoon, we return to our bungalows to relax and soak in the peaceful surroundings before joining the group in the evening at the community center for dinner."

Please note that, during the low season, if the boat is not operating, we'll travel by ferry and train instead. Nestled between the Bokor Mountains and the Praek Tuek Chhu River, Kampot is a charming riverside town known for its French colonial architecture, relaxed atmosphere and lush natural surroundings. It's an easy place to explore, with cafés, local markets and riverside restaurants that reflect the town's laid-back charm. Kampot is also famous for its pepper plantations, which produce some of the finest pepper in the world. From the harbour, we transfer to our hotel, located just outside the town centre but easily and affordably reached by tuk-tuk. Later in the day, we take a walking tour through Kampot to admire its colonial buildings and learn about its history, finishing with a drink by the river. In the evening, there's an opportunity to join a sunset cruise along the Kampot River, travelling deeper into the jungle as the light fades.

    "generalInfo": "Cambodia and Vietnam are home to some incredible rare and enigmatic species and this trip is unique in combining these two countries and visiting some of the best wildlife watching locations in each. Some of the primates including gibbons as well as the birds and reptiles are so endangered that there are under 100 individuals left in the world.<br/>Alongside these very rare species we will also be watching out for more common species such as sambar deer, muntjacs, hornbills and macaques.<br/>As well as the wildlife watching locations on this trip we will also be visiting various cultural sites including the incredible Angkor Wat, the largest religious temple in the world and of which some of the temples are being reclaimed by the forest in the most beautiful way.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>This unique and fantastic adventure heads into some of the world’s richest forests in terms of biodiversity and a treasure trove of ancient and modern cultures that are so well known to the world, but are wonderful experience first-hand, Buddhism, Khmer temples, Saigon and deep fried crispy insects are all well known internationally but to be in rural Vietnam and tucking into local food or wandering the ancient temples of Angkor Wat has no substitute in foreign takeaways or travel programs.<br/><br/>This is a tour that visits two different countries, both of which may seem very similar on the surface but have distinct and fascinating histories, cultures, food and of course ecosystems. By exploring some hand selected parks and reserves in Cambodia and Vietnam we aim to showcase a huge amount of the wildlife that these countries have to offer and also immerse ourselves in the culture of these countries.<br/><br/>South East Asian wildlife is at a turning point in terms of its conservation; currently there are still huge tracts of forest intact, with connecting forest corridors linking vital protected areas and cross boundary forests; where many endangered species still have large enough populations to survive into the future. However this can only happen with the right level of protection and awareness from the local people and their respective governments, as well as international eco-tourism really taking off here. But South East Asia is also the part of the world that is seeing huge deforestation and the a proliferation in the illegal animal trade. The billions of US dollars in illegal logging and the animal trafficking trade is taking its toll, so now is the time for people (international tourists and locals) to appreciate what wonderful national parks there are here and also contribute to the local economies so that the locals begin to see that intact forests and living animals are worth more alive than exploited.<br/><br/>This tour has a great mix of wildlife watching and exploration of various forests and even freshwater dolphin watching, but we will also be spending time visiting one of the important religious sites in the world in the famous Angkor Wat. This ancient temple complex is amongst the most famous and well known ancient sites in the world and we will have a full day here to fully explore. The amount of temples and ancient sites in South East Asia is staggering and (just like the nature here) it is impossible to do it all justice in one trip, but we aim to showcase the most impressive areas and to highlight the unique differences between the two countries we will be visiting.<br/><br/>We want to make sure that you have a successful trip so we aim to prepare you in every possible way and as well as having some of the best local guides with decades of experience in wildlife watching in Cambodia &amp; Vietnam you will have your own local guide throughout the tour.<br/><br/>Some of the langurs, gibbons and douc-langurs are so endangered that there are only 50-100 left in the world. Some of these species are intensively studying and we have a very good chance of seeing them, some are not protected very well at all and so they will be harder to find, but we will endeavour to do our best at all locations or course. <br/><br/>Alongside the primates we will also be watching out for the larger species that inhabit these forests such as sambar deer, muntjacs and of course a whole host of rarer species such as sun bears, leopards, Indo-Chinese clouded leopards, binturongs and dozens of other species or mammals and the bird life is also incredibly varied with hundreds of species possible including a good number of hornbills with the magnificent great hornbill being the undisputed highlight.<br/><br/>Whilst exploring the forests and looking for all of these species and more you can rest assured that we will be exploring some of the least visited forests and national parks and seeing a range of wildlife that is unparalleled in other wildlife watching holidays.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in cities and when travelling between national parks. There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not available on every tour, so please inquire about availability if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through South East Asia and particularly the regions we visit. Your naturalist escort is an expert in mammals and their conservation and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. We will also employ a specific cultural guide for all sightseeing of temples and monuments.<br/><br/>The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, river safaris, spotlighting, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the park. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>This tour is recommended for the northern hemisphere spring, whilst the rainy and dry seasons vary through South East Asia this time of year (particularly March - early May) is a good time to visit these places without the rain being too bad.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• Our local naturalist guides around each of the reserves, parks and wildlife watching areas we visit have a good relationship with the park officials and because of this we get a heads up when animals are sighted and this can guide us in where to focus and thus increasing our chances of seeing our targeted species.<br/>• All wildlife watching activities will be private for our group only, whether this is a guided walk, vehicle safari or boat cruise.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our wildlife watching holidays and safaris of South East Asia a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout South East Asia so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the Asiatic elephants, various gibbon species, Javan rhinos, orangutans and many more species. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of many South East Asian country at other times of year and focusing on other species from bird life, herpetology, diving and snorkelling and many other types of wildlife. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour visits two different countries Cambodia and Vietnam; within these countries you will visit several different locations for culture such as Siem Reap and wildlife such as Ban Lung National Park, Cat Tien National Park, Bach Ma National Park, Phong Nha National Park and other areas for wildlife watching. You will be required to fly into Siem Reap, Cambodia and depart from Hanoi in Vietnam.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The wildlife watching on this trip is done by a variety of different methods, such as in a private vehicle, boat trips and guided walks. Most of the guided walks are done over flat terrain but there are hills within Bach Ma National Park. All in all there is no specific need for a high fitness level but we require people to be used to walking for 1-2 hours and be used to walking in high temperatures and high humidity.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 15 Years Old",

        "description": "Siem Reap - Sightseeing After breakfast this morning, we journey out to the Mother of all temples, Angkor Wat. Believed to be the world's largest religious building, this temple is the perfect fusion of symbolism and symmetry and a source of pride and strength to all Khmers. Built in the 12th century by King Suryavarman II, this is most famous temple at Angkor. We begin by unravelling the mysteries of the bas-reliefs that tell of tales from Hindu mythology and of the glories of the Khmer empire. Stretching for almost one kilometer, these intricate carvings are a candidate for the world’s longest unbroken piece of art. Following in the footsteps of the devout and the destructive before us, we then continue to the upper levels of the inner sanctuary. The final steps to the upper terrace of Angkor are the steepest of all, as pilgrims of old were to stoop on their pilgrimage to encounter the Gods. Finally the pinnacle, the sacred heart of Angkor Wat, a blend of spirituality and symmetry so perfect that few moments will measure up. Also this morning, we continue to Ta Prohm temple, which has been abandoned to the elements, a reminder that while empires rise and fall, the riotous power of nature marches on, oblivious to the dramas of human history. Left as it was ‘discovered’ by French explorer Henri Mouhot in 1860, the tentacle-like tree roots here are slowly strangling the surviving stones, man first conquering nature to create, nature later conquering man to destroy. In the afternoon, we visit the immense walled city of Angkor Thom that was the masterpiece of King Jayavarman VII. Following the occupation of Angkor by the Chams from 1177 to 1181, the new king decided to build an impregnable fortress at the heart of his empire. The scale is simply staggering and we are immediately overwhelmed by the audacity of Jayavarman on arrival at the city’s gates. The causeway is lined by an intricate bridge depicting the Churning of the Ocean of Milk from Hindu mythology in which devas (gods) and asuras (devils) play tug of war with a naga (seven-headed serpent) to obtain the elixir of immortality. We begin our visit at the Terrace of the Leper King. This intricately carved platform was the royal crematorium and the statue that was originally thought to be the leper king is now believed to be Yama, the god of death. We continue along the Terrace of Elephants, originally used as a viewing gallery for the king to preside over parades, performances and traditional sports. At the southern end lies the Baphuon, once of the most beautiful temples at Angkor, dating from the reign of Uditayavarman in the 11th century. It has undergone a massive renovation by the French and is now once again open for viewing. Our climax is the enigmatic and enchanting temple of the Bayon. At the exact centre of Angkor Thom, this is an eccentric expression of the creative genius and inflated ego of Cambodia’s most celebrated king. Its 54 towers are each topped off with the four faces of Avalokiteshvara (Buddha of Compassion), which bear more than a passing resemblance to the king himself. These colossal heads stare down from every side, exuding power and control with a hint of compassion, just the mix required to keep a hold on such a vast empire. Before clambering upwards, we unravel the mysteries of the bas-reliefs, with their intricate scenes of ancient battles against the Chams and their snapshot of daily life during the Angkor period. After leaving the temples we will be taken back to the hotel and we can explore the town or just relax, the rest of the evening and night are free for your leisure. (breakfast is the only meal included today)."

        "description": "Ban Lung (Beng Melea) - Travelling & Cultural Experience Today we leave Siem Reap after an early breakfast and start our adventure by journeying across the province of Preah Vihear, named after the late 9th century temple to the province of Steung Treng. Along the way we will stop at Beng Melea; a sprawling jungle temple that is still largely covered in vegetation as it is less visited by tourists than the main temple complex. We will spend some time exploring this adventurous temple before we stop for a local lunch. From here we then cross the Mekong River by a local ferry, which we share with local villagers. We then continue to Ban Lung, arriving in the province of Ratanakiri in the late afternoon. You will then have the rest of the day to relax until the gibbon trek evening briefing at 7pm. At the meeting we will run over the trek details for the next couple of days, this gibbon experience is run by the Gibbon Spotting Cambodia conservation project that are working hard to protect the Veun Sai-Siem Pang Conservation Area. Working with researchers they habituated a gibbon family and now through eco-tourism this critically endangered species of gibbon is being used as a model species for similar projects in South East Asia. Money raised from bringing tourists here is fed back into the local community which helps in preventing the illegal logging and poaching that unfortunately takes place in the area. At the briefing this evening you will be told more about the project and then go to see the gibbons and other wildlife in the forest. So for tonight you can then enjoy your last night in civilization (well for a night anyway) before your adventure begins. (breakfast only is included today)."

The journey is 35 km north to Kachon village (45 mins). In Kachon, a traditional boat will be waiting to take you the 12km (45 mins) downstream on the Sesan River to Veun Sai town. Along the way we will be able to observe some wildlife on the riverbank (mostly bird life) as well as the daily activities of the people who live along the river. In Veun Sai town we will take a bicycle for 30 minutes to the I Tub village, a Laotian community roughly halfway to the Veun Sai-Siem Pang Conservation Area station. Once in I Tub, we will take a short break for lunch and meet with a member of the Community-based Ecotourism Team. After lunch we continue to the station by bike along a forest path. There is a high possibility of seeing tracks and signs of some of the local wildlife that live here such as the claw marks of the sun bear on the tree trunks, the footprints of deer and other species as well as seeing some local bird species. We will cycle the majority of the way but in order to get a good look at our surroundings we will also walk in some parts. At around 3pm we will arrive at the gibbon research station where you will be introduced to the station chief, scientists, researchers, and your gibbon guide who will show you around the camp. You then have time to relax and make yourself comfortable before walking to the nearby savannah for a spot of bird watching; before sitting down to an early dinner at 6:45pm. At around 8pm we will head into the forest for a 1 hour night jungle walk, spotlighting is one of the best wildlife watching experiences and the only way to see several rare and elusive animals. The canopy is home to many nocturnal animals such as the pygmy slow loris (a small arboreal primate) and various species of civet as well as leopard cats and mouse-deer. We will then return to the accommodation and get some sleep before we go and search for the gibbons tomorrow morning. (all meals included today)."

As soon as dawn breaks the gibbons call to mark their territory and this is the best way of finding them. At 4am, whilst it is still dark we following a small trail to the protected gibbon area about 45 minutes away to make sure that we are there in time to hear their call. We then reach the edge of a grassy savannah and wait for the call of a certain gibbon family, currently the only group that accepts people in their presence. The different groups start to call (sing) at around sunrise with some calls carrying up to 2km. Once the habituated groups of gibbon’s starts to sing, the gibbon guide will try to locate them in the forest as fast as possible and he will guide us to the spot so we can watch them as they go about their morning activities in the tree canopy. In some cases they let you come very close – less than 15 meters – which provides an excellent opportunity to take pictures. This is a special time as the gibbons can travel quickly in the trees and leave in a split second, anytime they want. Once they do, it can be very difficult for us to find them again, however the group can often be followed for a couple of hours throughout the forest. After the gibbon spotting we head back to the station for brunch at about 10am. We then pack up and get ready to leave the forest. We will follow a different path through the jungle and head back to I Tub village. Again, some parts we will cycle some we will walk. On the way we visit a Chinese and Laos settlement and take a short walk around the village. It’s a nice idyllic village with friendly people and on certain days you will be able to witness traditional local weaving. We then continue back to Veun Sai town, cross the Sesan River by a small ferry, before stopping off for lunch at a restaurant that boasts a beautiful view of the river. Our journey has now come to an end and we are picked up by car and travel back to Ban Lung arriving at approximately 3pm. Once back at the hotel you will be free to have the rest of the day to rest and catch up on sleep from such an early start. Dinner can be taken at the hotel or a nearby restaurant but is not included. Tomorrow we depart and start our journey south-east through Cambodia and towards the border with Vietnam, however we have some more excellent things to see and do in Cambodia first, so a good night’s rest is well recommended.

However before reaching Kratie we will have a dolphin watching cruise up river. We will be aiming to encounter the rare (and largely freshwater) Irrawaddy dolphins which inhabit the stretch of river in the dolphin “pool” of Kampi. We we be taken aboard a traditional fishermen boat which takes us to the deep pools where the dolphins are found. Viewing is commonplace, although it is easier to see the dolphins in the shallower waters of the dry season, than in the swollen river of the wet season. This afternoon we will leave Kratie and enter Vietnam thru the Hoa Lu Border Gate. From the border crossing we will be taken directly to Cat Tien National Park which is roughly 150 km drive to the north (5 hours). Cat Tien National Park contains the largest remaining area of lowland tropical forest in southern Vietnam and an incredible diversity of mammals and birds. Cat Tien is home to three of Vietnam’s endangered primates; the Black-Shanked Douc Langur, Silvered Langur and Buff-Cheeked Gibbon. Upon our arrival, we will check in to your new accommodation and you then have the rest of the evening to settle into your new surroundings. We will arrive too late to enter the park today, however we will be able to discuss with the local guide about the possibility of a night walk with spotlights, we will have to play this by ear. Nam Cat Tien National Park covers 719km2 of lowland forest and swamp and is home to some of the highest biodiversity in South East Asia. Amongst the mammal species here are a number of primates such as the endemic buff-cheeked gibbon and the red-shanked douc langur, other mammals that inhabit the park include Asiatic black bears, Asiatic elephants, sun bears and gaur as well as around 100 other species. Over 350 species of birds have been recorded including specialities like Germain's peacock pheasant, bar-bellied pitta and the rare endemic orange-necked partridge. The range of life found here is incredible with over 120 reptile and amphibian species, over 130 species of freshwater fish, around 460 species of butterflies and to date over 1,610 species of plants have been recorded. Tomorrow we will hope to see as much of this flora and fauna as possible. (breakfast is the only meal included today)."

Bach Ma itself is 220km2 and harbours a great diversity of life, it is also up for consideration to be extended, the thinking being that the park could form a link from the coast through a protected areas in neighbouring Laos, and becoming a huge connected and protected ecosystem. This would be fantastic for Vietnam as the geographical position of Bach Ma (being in the overlap zone of the northern and southern Vietnam biomes as well as being part of the Annamite mountains) means its biodiversity is amongst the highest in the region. It is also one of the few places in Vietnam where wild Asiatic Elephants are still known from.

After breakfast we will depart and drive north to Phong Nha National Park and World Biosphere Reserve (5 hours), Phong Nha is regarded as one of the most beautiful parks in the region with a river that is bluer than blue and muddle of limestone karsts covered in very thick evergreen forest. In a country as agricultural as Vietnam is amazing that a place so wild and rugged still exists. There are some of the same primates here but also some new species such as Indochinese black langur, but we would look hard for these tomorrow morning. We would today check into our new hotel and then if we have time go into the forest in the afternoon."

Also found here are red shanked douc langurs, southern white-cheeked gibbons and the rare Indochinese black langurs. We will of course be on the look out for all of these species with the Ha Tinh langur and Indochinese langur the higher priorities here. There are also some caves around the forest here which we could explore, bat species that are known from here include Leschenault’s rousette, trident roundleaf bats and many more. The largest cave here is the Phong Nha cave and we can take a small boat ride through the cave and see the stunning rock formations and reflections on the water. Again it is not always possible to spotlight here because of the park rangers lack of interest or just bad attitudes, but we will see if it is possible and if so the chances of Owston’s civet and pygmy slow loris would increase. In between our safari activities we will return to the accommodation for our meals. (breakfast is the only meal included today)."

In order to see them we will travel to Van Long Wharf where we will take a boat trip along the reservoir of Van Long Nature Reserve.

In the mornings and late afternoons these primates aggregate here and are quite easy to see despite their very low numbers. From here we will then depart back to Hanoi and check into our hotel for the night.

The shops themselves have very narrow frontages but are actually quite deep; they are known locally as tube shops.

This afternoon there is the option to visit the emotive Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, formerly a high school that became the Khmer Rouge's main torture and interrogation centre; and the Killing Fields of Choeung Ek - where the memorial stupa is a glass tower filled with human skulls - a gruesome reminder of the scale of Pol Pot's atrocities."

Angkor was once a series of cities, built between the 9th and the 13th centuries by the Khmer kings, with a population of 750,000 in its heyday. The Angkor complex is spread out over 155 square kilometres, scattered with carved stone temples, elegant sculptures and incredible bas reliefs. We'll visit the Rolous group, which are some of the earliest temples. In the afternoon, we'll make the one-hour drive to visit Banteay Srei, a small but beautiful temple with exquisite carvings.

The fortified city of Angkor Thom, which he built at the end of the 12th century, is enclosed by a square wall with five monumental gates decorated with stone elephant trunks. Originally, crocodiles inhabited the moat and huge statues of 54 different gods protected each gate. The city contains another of Angkor's true gems - The Bayon. Although not as impressive as Angkor Wat from a distance, The Bayon is nevertheless incredible for its maze of corridors, gothic style towers and magical central temples. A highlight for many is a visit to the atmospheric temple of Ta Prohm, where the film Tomb Raider was filmed, lying half consumed by the jungle. We'll leave the best known and most breathtaking of all the sights, Angkor Wat, for last - where we'll stay until the sun sets on the last night of our adventure."

You have the rest of the day at leisure – to wander around the city centre, pamper in the spa or relax by the pool. Situated on the Kok River – a tributary of the Mekong, Chiang Rai is one Thailand’s great capitals – founded by the king of Lanna Mangrai, as his royal capital in 1262. Thailand’s most venerated Buddha image – the Emerald Buddha (now in the Grand Palace in Bangkok) was discovered here in the 1400s – when an earthquake cracked a stupa to reveal the brilliant green statue. The city is famous for its exquisite temples, including one of Asia’s most famous and spectacular: the ornate, brilliant-white Wat Rong Khun, designed by renowned Thai artist Ajarn Chalermchai Kositpipat. Chiang Rai is an important centre of hill tribe culture. You will meet your Tour Leader Alex Robinson in the evening we will have a welcome meal at Lu Lam, one of the best traditional regional restaurants in Thailand. Its tables are set on rafts on the Kok river and we will have our first glimpse of the streams of the Mekong which define our journey. Alex will brief you what’s ahead and you will have the chance to talk with him about any photography and writing tuition or tips you would like over the next few weeks. After supper we explore Chiang Rai’s lively night market where we will browse for hill tribe crafts and enjoy music and dance performances and sample local street food.

In the late afternoon we visit the Chiang Rai Hill Tribe Museum and Education Center: where you will discover the story of the hill tribe people of the Golden Triangle. The museum offers well-curated exhibits showcasing the traditional lifestyles, crafts, and customs of six major hill tribes: Akha, Lahu, Yao, Karen, Lisu, and Hmong. With its authentic artifacts and educational displays, this museum provides a deeper understanding of these communities and their contributions to the region.

Laos (19th November): It’s an early start this morning – for the Mekong and our date with your Upper Mekong River Cruise in the famous Golden Triangle where Thailand, Laos and Burma converge with southern China. After passing through Laos immigration you will be transferred to your cruise boat. It is a traditional Upper Mekong slow boat, built by a local team of family ship builders in Luang Prabang shipyard. They’ve been building Upper Mekong river boats to ply these ancient Golden Triangle waters for generations. Inside, comfortable, shaded seats and tables sit next to a huge open-air windows with superb views (and rain covers if necessary). There’s an open roof-top sun-sky deck, the front section has a long bench and the central section of boat is the main passenger seats, face-to-face seats with a table. The rear section is an engine room, kitchen area, toilets and observation area. Our boats are agile, secure and beautiful. No vessel gives you more of a sense of the Mekong and the movement and power of this magnificent river. And no Mekong boats are safer – these long boats have been honed over centuries of boat construction – they are unique to the Mekong and built to navigate the strong current, narrow water and fast water in both in dry and raining season. From the moment we leave, you are immersed in the beautiful landscapes of the Upper Mekong. Everything feels intense – the tiny temples that dot the shore (including a temple dedicated to a giant catfish!) as we leave Houeixay at the start of our voyage, the wild mountains, meanders and rushes of the river which follow, the rainforest and birdlife, the life in the local Khmu and Hmong villages we visit along the way. In the later afternoon we reach, the lovely local village of Pakbeng, squeezed between a towering cave-pocked cliff large enough to be in Yosemite and a wild forested riverbank, where the Mekong meets the Nam Beng. We stay here overnight under a sky filled with stars. Overnight at Le Grand Pakbeng."

We moor here and then walk the stone stairs (don’t worry, they’re wide and easy and there’s no sharp drop), to the spectacular Pak Ou Cave. This dry cavern sits high in an immense cliff which and is packed with some 40000 Buddha statues. With the river at its feet, rainforest beyond and serene Buddhas all around, it’s an extraordinary sight. We visit a hill tribe village and learn about their day-to-day life. If time permits and the season allows, we may offer a glimpse of the organic gardens where villagers nurture their crops (and we can try one or other local produce). We have lunch on board and then as the sun drifts low and golden over the river we arrive in the old imperial city of Luang Prabang, a Unesco World Heritage site, from where you will transfer to your hotel. After checking in, guests have the option to wander the streets of this lovely small city, which is only as large a small European town. The low key centre is lined with old teak wood mansions and French town houses, set alongside the old royal palace and myriad temples covered with elaborate carving and made in the unique Laos style. There’s a night market and dozens of craft shops where beautiful, intricate hill tribe textiles, indigo and silk scarves and sarongs, silverware and art are available for sale. It’s one of the best spots on our journey to pick up souvenirs, and it’s all locally made rather than shipped in from overseas. You can climb to the top of Phousi hill for the loveliest sunset view in Laos – of the day darkening over the terracotta and teak buildings and the sun sinking over the Mekong and the rolling mountain ridges. In the evening we will have dinner at a local restaurant and a Baci ceremony, a traditional Lao ritual that is deeply rooted in the country’s culture and spiritual beliefs. It is performed to celebrate important events and occasions such as weddings, births, homecomings, and other significant milestones and will be held in your honour to welcome you to the royal capital.

And you will learn how, first hand today when we visit a community-run organic farm supplying fresh vegetables, herbs, salads and rice to hotels and restaurants in Luang Prabang. The farmers here use methods which are millennia old. You will have a taste of ancient Southeast Asian rural life – participating in the various stages of rice cultivation, from planting to harvesting. You’ll gain insight into the life of local farmers and understand the importance of rice in Lao culture. The farm is in a gorgeous setting – surrounded by tropical greenery and rugged mountains, with paddy fields all around. It’s a wonderful way to connect with nature and appreciate the hard work that goes into producing the Mekong’s staple food. In the afternoon we drive through the countryside to the Kuang Si Waterfalls, which drop in tiers in lush rainforest. We will have time at leisure here (and to visit the Sun Bear rescue and rehabilitation centre on site), and Alex is on hand to help you with your photo skills. We take lunch at the waterfalls and on the way back to Luang Prabang stop at a Hmong village and learn about the traditional music, textiles and daily life of a people who helped to shape modern Laos, and who are one of the great forgotten ethnic groups of Southeast Asia.

There are many opportunities for wonderful pictures. We then visit Luang Prabang’s morning market before returning to the hotel for breakfast. In the afternoon we visit Luang Prabang’s most beautiful temples. We begin with five hundred year old Wat Visoun, the oldest temple in Luang Prabang.

One of its most distinctive features is the large round stupa known as That Makmo, or the Watermelon Stupa. We see Wat Xieng Thong, also known as the Temple of the Golden City, one of the most important and beautiful temples in Luang Prabang. It was built in 1560 by King Setthathirath and is a prime example of traditional Lao architecture. The temple is famous for its exquisite Tree of Life mosaic and royal funeral chapel. After lunch, we drive from Luang Prabang to Nong Khiaw, a scenic journey through the heart of northern Laos. The road winds over ridges and down through plunging forested valleys. It’s an untouristy area. There are breathtaking views of the Nam Ou River along the way and we get a real sense of rural life in the traditional Lao villages we pass through.

We will pass riverine villages, Ramsar-protected wetlands filled with water birds and cruise through the heart of rural Cambodia – past little villages that seldom if ever see a tourist and fields of golden rice paddies, arriving in Battamabang in the late afternoon. Battambang was once an important provincial city – governed by the French, the Thai (whose huge, opulent governor’s mansion sits next to the winding river) and then wrested back in the mid-Twentieth Century by the Khmer people. It’s a quiet spot today, it’s main river street lined with crumbling old French colonial town houses. There are some fascinating sights nearby which we will explore tomorrow. Transportation, tours and writing or photo tuition included. Location: Battambang; Hotel: Cambana La Riviere. Board Includes: Breakfast."

These astonishing makeshift locomotives comprise two bogeys, a bamboo platform and an engine harnessed from a long tail boat outboard. Passengers sit on the platform as the train whisks through paddy fields and pasture land, deftly captained by a local in a conical hat. Leaving early allows us to see the villagers tilling the fields and harvesting rice, the beautiful landscapes and the tiny villages along the railway side. The photographs are extraordinary. After our ride, we drive to visit one of the Ancient Khmer Traditional houses, and meet the house’s owner who receives us warmly with a snack and tea before we return back to the hotel for breakfast. After a tour of the town and the fruit markets we visit the striking hilltop pagoda of Phnom Sampeau – a huge limestone outcrop honeycombed with caves, some of them containing unexpected and poignant reminders of Cambodia’s turbulent history. On the top of the hill, we can view the surrounding countryside, a tapestry of villages, buffalo pastures and shimmering rice paddies, punctuated with sugar palm trees. We walk downhill back to the foot of the mountain at dusk to witness thousands of bats leaving their roosts as it gets dark and to enjoy a bottle of cold beer or one soft drink before we get back to the hotel in Battambang, and dinner at the local restaurant. Transportation, tours and writing or photo tuition included. Location: Battambang Hotel: Cambana La Riviere. Board Includes: Breakfast."

There are no other activities planned today, so you're free to arrive in Vientiane at any time. If you'd like an airport transfer today, you'll need to arrive into Watty International Airport (VTE) which is a 15-minute drive from our hotel.

This afternoon is free for you to explore more solo. You might like to visit the nearby Buddha Park, a vast green expanse just 30 minutes from the city that houses a selection of Buddhist and Hindu statues. Alternatively, you could visit the COPE Museum, a not-for-profit organisation set up to provide prosthetic limbs to the many victims of the unexploded ordinance (UXO) left behind from the Vietnam war. The museum does an excellent job of giving some of the background to the bombing campaign, along with showcasing the important work the COPE foundation is doing. Most report it to be a sobering, emotive but rewarding experience that enhances one's understanding of this fascinating country. This evening, why not head out to see the lively night markets that line the Mekong River. They offer a variety of local handicrafts, clothing, souvenirs, and delicious street food.

Influence from its French occupiers is peppered all over the city, with grand white-washed Indochinese villas lining its leafy streets, oddly complementing the golden-tipped wats (temples) found around almost every corner. Time moves so slowly here that it almost stands still, and a must-do is grabbing a Lao coffee, sitting down outside one of the many cafes and just watching the world go by, in traditional Lao-style.

The UNESCO site of Luang Prabang is a case in pointe, highlighted for its well preserved architectural, religious and cultural heritage. Until the early 1990's Laos was a bastion of communism and is now recognised as a one party socialist state where the Lao people now enjoy a somewhat more liberated existence.  Sadly, the country still languishes from the after effects of the of the ‘Vietnam War’, despite efforts at clearance an estimated 80 million unexploded mines and bombs remain from the US ‘secret war’ and Laos is said to have the unwanted tag of being the most bombed nation relative to its population size in the world. This tailormade tour supports work to assist the Lao people, often poor farmers, who bear the brunt of this legacy. Elsewhere, visits include projects working with small scale coffee producers to maximise returns and promote sustainable techniques. Without doubt, Laos is an emerging destination, but one with fulfilling authentic village experiences, Laos is superbly blessed with magnificent scenery, from vertiginous limestone cliffs to thunderous waterfalls. Lao people are among the most welcoming and friendliest you’ll meet, characterised kindly by those in neighbouring states ‘water buffalo’.

Scattered throughout a huge area of forest, they comprise one of the world’s greatest man-made wonders. Travel to Battambang and explore a slower and rural side of Cambodia before ending the tour in Phnom Penh, where we learn about the country’s dark history, as well as experiencing the vibrant and bustling markets. For an alternative view of the undeniable treasures of Indochina, but one that does not hide visitors from the tragedies and injustices of the not too distant past, this tour should not be overlooked.",

Your guide will first take you to the Women’s Museum – small, but a fascinating narrative of the role of women in Vietnam, particularly during the war. Your next stop will be Ngoc Ha Market to stroll around this huge, bustling place taking in the vibrant atmosphere that typifies Ha Noi, and then followed by the Temple of Literature, the first university in Vietnam dating back to the 11th century. Returning to the Old Quarter, the day will include a ‘Street Life’ experience, also on the back of a motorbike. You’ll spend a couple of hours wandering around the back streets in and nearby the Old Quarter. A street food brunch is included – take your pick from traditional Hanoi Pho (beef noodle soup), Nom (green papaya salad with seasoned beef), Banh Goi (pillow-shaped rice pastry with minced pork and mushroom), Banh Cuon (hot rice paper with pork and fried onion) or Bun Cha (fresh noodle with grilled pork). If you’re hungry, try two or three varieties – they’re snacks rather than a meal. Your next stop will be Long Bien Bridge, a magnificent structure built over a hundred years ago which spans the Red River and connects the Hoan Kiem and Long Bien districts, and provides shelter to locals living on boats underneath. You will spend the night in Hanoi."

    "generalInfo": "Laos and Cambodia are countries blessed with some incredibly beautiful landscapes, fascinating religious monuments, and delicious food. This Laos &amp; Cambodia Highlights itinerary will introduce you to best areas to explore these themes and take you away from the usual tourist trail.<br/><br/>You’ll begin in the former royal capital of Laos, Luang Prabang, a UNESCO World Heritage town with picturesque surrounding countryside. Explore its famous monuments, monasteries and streets lined with old French colonial villas before heading across the Mekong River to discover some less-visited temples and minority villages, where you will learn about the traditions and lives of the local people. Your time in Luang Prabang will also include a tour of some the best restaurants, market food stools and hidden bars in town, as well as a sunset cruise down the Mekong.<br/><br/>The next stage of your journey will take you to Southern Laos, home to some fascinating areas within easy reach of your base, Champasak. Visit the pre-Angkorian ruins of Wat Phou, not far from the town. Take a Jeep tour across the dramatic Bolaven Plateau, with its stunning waterfalls, quality coffee plantations and interesting minority villages. Head down to the unique 4,000 Islands area where the Mekong River reaches 14km wide and is dotted with thousands of small islands. Here you’ll see a totally different pace to life. <br/><br/>Next, you’ll fly to Siem Reap in Cambodia, which is home to the magnificent temples of Angkor. Part of your exploration of the Angkor Archaeological Park will be done by bicycle, an eco-friendly and peaceful way of accessing these impressive monuments. You’ll cover the main temples of the Small Circuit, including Angkor Wat, as well as some lesser visited, but no less impressive, temples of the Grand Circuit. Travelling further afield, you’ll also enjoy a short trek to the ancient Hindu site of Kbal Spean, with its riverbed carvings of gods, animals and phallic symbols, known as the “River of a Thousand Lingas”. Your time in Siem Reap will be capped with a performance of traditional and modern theatre, music, dance, acrobatics, juggling and contortion, at the Phare Circus.<br/><br/>Your final destination will be Cambodia’s capital, Phnom Penh. While transferring from Siem Reap you’ll take a small detour to Tonlé Sap, Southeast Asia’s largest freshwater lake. Take a boat out onto the lake and visit the village of Kampong Khleang, where houses are built on stilts among the petrified mangrove forests and waterways. In Phnom Penh you’ll take a walking tour of its residential neighbourhoods, local attractions and the dazzling Royal Palace. You’ll also be taken to some of the city’s best eateries and nightlife spots, travelling by local transport (remork).",

In the afternoon, we explore the interesting outskirts of the town, full of history and natural beauty. First, we visit the Killing Cave, a limestone cave with a dark past that tells an important part of Cambodia's history. Nearby, we stop at Wat Ek Phnom, known for its detailed stone carvings and classic Khmer architecture. From here, you can enjoy great views of the surrounding countryside and spot some playful monkeys in the trees. As evening approaches, we make our way to the Bat Cave, where thousands of bats take flight at dusk, creating a stunning and unforgettable natural show in the sky."

Used by the Viet Cong, the network covers three levels and approximately 150mi (240km) of tunnels. Exploring Cu Chi gives us an indication of the tenacity of the Vietnamese people and the conditions that both Vietnamese and American troops had to endure. Originally the tunnels were very narrow but some have been widened to allow visitors to explore the system. We can crawl through them and are introduced to life below ground as we visit makeshift kitchens, bedrooms and even an underground hospital. People with claustrophobia may prefer to stay outside in the sunshine. The afternoon is free for exploration and there are several interesting things to see and do – the Saigon River, Ben Thanh Market, Reunification Palace and Notre Dame Cathedral are all within easy walking distance.

Take part in some of the 14 steps of the rice cycle, from planting and harvesting to processing, and along the way, try your hand at traditional skills like bamboo weaving and blacksmithing. It’s a unique, hands-on glimpse into the life of a Lao farmer! If cooking is more your style, join the Cooking Experience. Hop in a tuk-tuk to the local wet market, pick up fresh ingredients, then learn to whip up authentic Lao dishes in a friendly, interactive class. And of course, the best part comes at the end — sitting down to enjoy the feast you’ve just made! For those wanting to give back, spend the afternoon volunteering with Big Brother Mouse, an inspiring organisation helping local people improve their English skills. By the end of the day, whether you’ve been farming, cooking, or volunteering, you’ll have had a hands-on cultural experience that truly connects you to the heart of Lao life."

From its tree-lined boulevards and hidden alleyways to tranquil lakes and lively streets, Hanoi is brimming with character and waiting to be explored. For those arriving on time, our tour leader plans to meet you in the hotel reception at 6pm for the welcome meeting and for those who wish, there is the chance to go out for dinner. There are no other activities planned today, so you're free to arrive in Hanoi at any time. Should you miss the welcome meeting our tour leader will leave a note at the front desk and will inform you of any essential information as soon as you catch up. If you'd like an airport transfer today, you'll need to arrive into Noi Bai International Airport (HAN) airport, which is around a 45-minute drive from our hotel. As part of our Upgraded range, we also offer a complimentary transfer to those who have made pre-tour accommodation arrangements through Explore, regardless of your arrival day. If your flight arrives earlier in the day, you might like to take a stroll around the peaceful shores of Hoan Kiem Lake, a favourite gathering place for locals. Another option is to visit Hanoi's famous Train Street, where houses and cafes sit just inches from the railway tracks. Please note, however, that access is restricted for safety reasons, and standing on the tracks is prohibited - if you do go, enjoy it responsibly from one of the nearby cafes."

With its tree-lined boulevards, colonial architecture, and timeless charm, the city often feels like a living museum. Highlights include the elegant Presidential Palace and the iconic One-Pillar Pagoda, a small but striking temple rising from a single stone column. On the same grounds, we'll see Ho Chi Minh's humble stilt house. Despite having the grand palace at his disposal, he chose instead this simple wooden home- reflecting his modest, austere lifestyle. In the afternoon, our tour leader will equip you with a map and tips to explore the maze-like Old Quarter at your own pace. Each street here has a story, with names recalling traditional trades such as silk, paper, or baskets. Though the shopfronts are narrow, they stretch deep inside, creating what locals call 'tube houses'. Wander the lanes where sizzling woks, fragrant noodle soups, and incense from tucked-away temples fill the air - an atmosphere that captures the very soul of Hanoi. In the evening, we gather for dinner at KOTO (Know One, Teach One), a pioneering social enterprise that supports disadvantaged youth by training them in the hospitality industry. Here, we'll enjoy a creative menu that blends Vietnamese flavours with modern techniques, all while supporting a worthy cause. After dinner, you might like to attend an optional traditional water puppet show - a uniquely Vietnamese art form where brightly painted puppets glide and dance across a water stage to live folk music, telling stories of rural life, legends, and history."

Lan Ha Bay, located next to the famous Halong Bay, is a quieter, more unspoiled alternative. With clearer waters, fewer boats, and a backdrop of towering limestone karsts, it offers a more intimate experience. The bay is dotted with secluded beaches, hidden lagoons, and dramatic grottoes, making it a paradise for those seeking both beauty and tranquility. Around midday, we board our boat and set sail. As we glide across the calm waters, you'll see a timeless scene of junks, sampans, and fishing boats crisscrossing the bay - echoes of a way of life that has remained unchanged for centuries. A delicious lunch featuring Vietnamese and international cuisine is served onboard, with panoramic views of the emerald-green seascape all around. In the afternoon, there may be the chance to kayak through hidden caves and lagoons, getting closer to the bay's natural wonders. Later, we anchor in a peaceful spot where we'll enjoy a dinner of freshly prepared seafood and regional specialities. In the evening, relax in your elegant cabin, take in the views from the panoramic deck, or unwind in the lounge with a drink in hand as the sun sets behind the limestone cliffs. Please note that the boat is not exclusive to our group - we'll be sharing it with other travellers. This is a wonderful opportunity to meet fellow adventurers from around the world, adding to the spirit of shared discovery."

After breakfast, taken with sweeping views of the tranquil waters, we continue cruising through Lan Ha Bay, passing more of its green limestone islands and islets - many untouched and uninhabited. Along the way, we'll see floating villages where fishermen go about their daily routines, offering a glimpse into the traditional life of the bay's communities. After lunch on board, we return to the pier and disembark, before making the drive back to Hanoi in time for our late-afternoon flight to Danang. From Danang, it's just a short drive to Hoi An, a beautifully preserved UNESCO World Heritage town. Once a bustling merchant port, Hoi An is now famous for its riverside charm, lantern-lit streets, and unique blend of Vietnamese, Chinese, and Japanese influences. We'll spend the next three nights here, allowing plenty of time to soak in its historic atmosphere. Our hotel is set in peaceful surroundings, with a serene outdoor pool and the convenience of being within walking distance of the Old Town. This means you can easily wander into the heart of Hoi An, where the streets come alive each evening with hundreds of colourful lanterns reflecting off the Thu Bon River - a magical sight that the town is celebrated for."

The mix of Vietnamese, Chinese, Japanese, and French influences, along with mustard-yellow facades, wooden shutters, and lanterns strung overhead, creates a truly picturesque scene. After the tour, you'll have free time for lunch, with opportunities to try one of Hoi An's famous specialties - perhaps Cao Lau noodles, a Banh Mi sandwich, or White Rose Dumplings. In the afternoon, we'll regroup for a hands-on cooking class in the peaceful countryside. A walk through fragrant herb gardens with our host chef introduces us to traditional farming techniques still used today, with no electrical machinery in sight.

If you'd like to explore beyond the Old Town, consider a gentle cycling trip to Kim Bong Village, a traditional carpentry village known for its skilled woodworkers and boat builders. Riding through peaceful countryside paths and riverside scenery, you'll have the chance to see artisans at work, from carving to weaving, while soaking in the slower rhythm of rural life. For something more relaxing, the golden sands of An Bang Beach are only a short taxi ride away, or you could drift along the Thu Bon River on a tranquil boat trip. Within the Old Town, you'll find endless opportunities to browse vibrant shops, sip coffee in cosy riverside cafés, or unwind with a cold drink at one of the lively bars. For those looking to venture further afield, an optional excursion to My Son - one of Vietnam's most evocative Cham sites - is highly recommended. Though the track leading there is bumpy and slow, the reward is an atmospheric complex of ancient temple ruins hidden among wooded hills, offering a fascinating glimpse into the spiritual world of the Cham civilisation."

Our first stop is the Marble Mountains, five limestone peaks said to represent the elements of water, wood, fire, metal, and earth. The mountains are home to caves and grottoes, many of which have been transformed into Buddhist sanctuaries adorned with statues and carvings. A torch comes in handy for exploring the darker caverns. Not far from here, we pause at My Khe Beach - nicknamed 'China Beach' by American troops, where its wide stretch of white sand makes for a pleasant rest. Continuing on to Danang, once the capital of the Champa Kingdom, we visit the Cham Museum to see its impressive collection of sculptures, offering insight into the artistry of this ancient culture. From here, our route takes us across the spectacular Hai Van Pass, also known as the 'Col des Nuages'. This winding mountain road offers sweeping coastal views, passing through rural landscapes of rice paddies, stilted houses, and fishing villages before we descend into Hue. The afternoon is free to relax or begin exploring the city. Set along the Perfume River, Hue is steeped in history and culture, once the imperial capital of Vietnam. Beyond its historic sites, Hue is also celebrated for its distinctive cuisine, with dishes such as bun bo Hue (spicy beef noodle soup), com hen (clam rice), and banh khoai (crispy pancakes) reflecting the city's royal heritage.

We'll also visit the Imperial Museum, where priceless royal artifacts - including costumes, ceramics, and artwork - offer further insight into court life. Rounding off the morning, we'll stop at the Tomb of Tu Duc, an elegant and atmospheric site set amidst pine forests and lotus ponds, built as both a palace of retreat and a final resting place for one of the dynasty's most revered rulers. The rest of the day is free to spend as you wish. You might explore more of Hue's other royal tombs, each with its own distinct character, or head to Dong Ba Market to experience the city's vibrant daily life and sample its famous street food.

Upon arrival at our riverside accommodation, we check in to charming bungalows tucked along the riverbank amid lush tropical gardens. Each bungalow blends local design with modern comforts, offering airy spaces, private terraces, and hammocks perfect for relaxing. The serene setting allows you to feel fully immersed in the pace and atmosphere of rural life, while still enjoying the convenience of comfortable, welcoming amenities. After settling in, we set out on an afternoon cycling adventure.

A tuk-tuk is available for anyone who prefers not to cycle the full route. Later, we meet local neighbours, including Viet Cong veterans, who share personal stories and insights into the region's history, providing a unique perspective on life in the Delta.

Built by King Suryavarman II as a Hindu temple dedicated to Vishnu, it later became a sacred Buddhist site, making it one of the largest religious monuments in the world. As you wander its expansive galleries, the intricate carvings reveal timeless stories of gods, battles, and legends. Next, we head to Angkor Thom, the 'Great City'. This massive walled capital has five grand gates, each guarded by stone elephants and rows of statues representing gods and demons from Hindu mythology. Once inside, explore the Bayon Temple, famous for its maze-like corridors and more than 200 giant serene stone faces gazing in every direction. The day concludes at Ta Prohm, where nature has reclaimed the temple with dramatic beauty. Enormous tree roots twist through crumbling stone walls, creating an atmosphere both haunting and captivating. Left largely in the state it was found, Ta Prohm offers a striking contrast to the restored monuments nearby and remains one of Angkor's most evocative sites. Please note: the itinerary may be adjusted by your tour leader in response to local conditions, ensuring the best possible experience. In the evening, don't miss a performance by the Phare Cambodian Circus.

It's a fascinating window into the artistry that once adorned the great temples of Angkor. From there, we head to Siem Reap's local market, a lively hub where the colors, scents, and sounds of Cambodia come alive. Wander through stalls overflowing with tropical fruits, fragrant spices, fresh herbs, and handmade goods.

We'll finish our visit with lunch at one of the market's eateries, where you'll have the chance to taste some of these local delicacies. The afternoon is yours to enjoy at leisure. You might choose to relax by the pool or continue exploring Siem Reap at your own pace.

Finally, we will head to your countryside resort located at the foot of the sacred Kulen Mountain. This mountain is considered one of the most significant sites in Cambodia, as it is where King Jayavarman II proclaimed himself a \"god-king\" and established the Khmer Empire in the 9th century. The mountain is also home to a magnificent reclining Buddha and numerous ancient carvings. In the evening, you'll have the chance to enjoy a unique campfire dinner at the resort. Please note that this dinner is an optional extra and requires a minimum of four participants. You will spend the night at Thisak Resort. OVERNIGHT"

Siem Reap Night Market (Street 60) After breakfast, we'll drive up to the holy Kulen Mountains, known locally as Phnom Kulen. The sandstone from this mountain was the primary source of building materials for the vast temples of the Angkor Kingdom. Our first stop is the sacred site of The River of a Thousand Lingas, a unique archaeological site where hundreds of phallic carvings are etched into the sandstone riverbed, dating back to the 9th century. Further downstream, you'll also see large stone blocks carved with figures of Apsara dancers and Vishnu. Next, we'll explore the mountain-top pagoda, home to ancient relics, statues, and a large reclining Buddha. Our final stop on the mountain is Kulen Waterfall, where you can cool off in the natural pool. It's also a perfect picnic spot, which is exactly what we'll do before heading back down. In the afternoon, we'll travel to the community of Tbeng, about 32km from Siem Reap. Here, you'll get a firsthand look at rural life, starting with a visit to a local vegetable garden and livestock area to learn about traditional agricultural practices. We'll also visit Damnak Thlork Vea Pagoda, where you will receive a blessing from a Buddhist monk. You'll also get to observe the traditional process of making mats and, on occasion, Khmer noodles, which you can then sample. Before returning to the city centre, we'll visit a local's favourite night market, known as Plov Hockseb, or \"Street 60.\" This is a vibrant, authentic market where you can discover a huge variety of Khmer street foods, fresh fruits, local beers, and if you're feeling adventurous, some protein-rich fried insects. We'll then return to Siem Reap for the night. OVERNIGHT"

Our first stop is the ancient city of Angkor Thom, entering through its impressive South Gate, which is famous for the colossal stone faces that greet you. Inside the city, we'll explore the mesmerising Bayon Temple, with its 216 enigmatic smiling faces, as well as the Royal Enclosure, Phimeanakas, the Elephant Terrace, and the Terrace of the Leper King. Next, we'll visit the most famous of all the temples, Angkor Wat. This architectural masterpiece, constructed in the 12th century, is the largest and most complete temple on the site, covering an area of about 210 hectares. You'll have plenty of time to explore its incredible bas-reliefs and intricate carvings, learning about its history as a Hindu temple dedicated to the god Vishnu. The tour concludes with a visit to the atmospheric Ta Prohm. This temple is an incredible sight, as it has been left largely in its natural state, with enormous fig trees and gigantic creepers embracing the stone foundations. The intertwining of man-made and natural elements gives the impression of a lost world being reclaimed by the powerful forces of nature. For dinner this evening, we will enjoy a delicious meal at Spoons Restaurant. This isn't just a place to eat; it's a social enterprise that supports underprivileged Cambodian youth by providing them with valuable hospitality training. By dining here, you're not only enjoying fantastic food but also directly contributing to a positive social mission. OVERNIGHT"

Among the interesting sights are the charming One-Pillar Pagoda and the Presidential Palace. Ho Chi Minh himself, a spartan-living and scholarly man, chose not to live in the Presidential Palace, he preferred instead a simple teak stilt house specially built for him on the grounds. In the afternoon, our tour leader will give you a map and instructions so you can discover the narrow lanes of the fascinating Old Quarter solo, where the streets are named after various crafts or specialities: Paper Street, Silk Street, Basket Street and so on. The shops themselves have very narrow frontages but are actually quite deep; they are known locally as tube shops. On the pavements, food vendors sell noodles, snacks and stir-fries from shoulder panniers. Take some time to really soak in your unique surroundings with the tempting smell of the food stalls mixing with the scent of incense from small temples dotted around."

First colonised by the Portuguese in the 16th century, it still retains its medieval charm today, with many of its old buildings superbly preserved. You might like to visit the Japanese Bridge or some of the Chinese temples and meeting halls in the Old Town. There are many shops, bars and restaurants and it's a great place to buy souvenirs, have clothing tailored or simply watch the world go by in a riverside café. There's also the option to take an excursion to the site of the My Lai village massacre memorial. The massacre was a significant turning point in the American War and the horrific story is told through a very emotive exhibition of photography. Another option is to take a fishing trip out to the Thu Bon River Delta, where you can learn how to fish using a traditional cast net. Travelling out by boat, we meet local fishermen and try our hand at cast net fishing as well as trying the bamboo winches used to haul in the huge drop nets from the river. There's also a chance to go out in a Vietnamese 'basket boat' - a circular boat constructed from bamboo that takes a little practice to row!"

The afternoon is free to enjoy Hoi An further. You could take a cookery class at one of Hoi An's restaurants or take part in a lantern-making workshop to learn how to make the lanterns that are ubiquitous in Hoi An.

Next, we'll drive to the Independence Palace (renamed the Reunification Hall) and the War Remnants Museum. Another side to the city awaits this afternoon, as we walk through Old Saigon's back alleys. Our walk takes us past ramshackle shopfronts, through local markets selling everything from colourful fruit to bootleg DVDs, and past houses, churches and schools, all squeezed into the small buildings that line the narrow alleys. If you need a pick-me-up, we'll stop at a local stall for a traditional Vietnamese coffee (brewed coffee served sweet with condensed milk). Here, we can also sample 'Banh Mi' - a Vietnamese take on the humble French baguette - freshly baked and packed with a combo of traditional and more exotic, aromatic ingredients. The walk ends at Saigon's 'Secret Weapons Bunker'. A small unassuming 'tube house' hides a trap door which conceals a basement stocked full of rifles, grenades and ammunition. The bunker played a key role in the TET Offensive of 1968. There's time to explore the house and bunker, filled with decommissioned weapons and photographs, news clippings and memorabilia from wartime."

This iconic abandoned temple, which adorns the national flag of Cambodia, is said to be the world’s largest religious monument. But there is far more to the whole site, known collectively as the Temples of Angkor, and away from the most famous site there are countless ruins to explore, many of which have been slowly reclaimed by the surrounding jungle and it doesn’t take too much effort to find yourself completely away from the crowds. We include entry for one day to the whole site, which can be explored either by tuk-tuk with a hired driver/guide for the day, or by yourself on bicycle, as it is only a short distance from Siem Reap itself. The fact that Angkor Wat is so nearby gives Siem Reap the feel of a busy tourist town. This has obvious pitfalls, but also means it is a great place to enjoy a night out and bump into travellers from all over the world going in each and every direction."

It is Sumatra’s lush jungles, one of the richest ecosystems in the world, steaming and at times rumbling volcanoes and blue crater lakes which make this part of the world fascinating and so different from everything else experienced on the expedition to date. As we head into the interior of the world’s sixth largest island our destination is Lake Danau Toba, home of the Batak people. The lake covers an area of 1707 sq km and we head for the island in the middle of the lake called Pulau Samosir which is almost the same size as Singapore. The island offers many different options but the best way to experience it is to head off on a bike or motorbikes and explore the countryside, from swimming to trekking, to trying your hand at Indonesian cooking in one of the culinary schools and just enjoying the stunning scenery. The cool air, highland setting, with steep, pine-covered slopes, descending into the lake's deep blue water is great place to kick back and relax. The island's unique and fascinating Batak heritage, is evident in the clusters of sopo (tribal houses) with roofs that curve upwards, like buffalo horns, white-washed churches that dot the landscape, and ancient stones and monuments For a bit of local flavour, visit a toddy shop and try a glass of 'tuak' (palm wine). The Batak people are known throughout Indonesia for their love of singing and playing music, and tuak is just the thing to get you fired up to join the singalong!"

By creating these feeding stations, the orangutans do not have to compete with the locals by raiding their fields. We visit the feeding station and there is also the opportunity to trek through the jungle and hope to spot these incredible creatures in their natural environment.

Other platforms have been loaded with large bags of rice before commuters use the bags as cushions. Monks have sat on the front and watched the countryside pass by. Your private cart trundles down the track. The surrounding lush trees whisper as you pass. There is only one real train a week and you think you can hear its whistle in the far off distance. The Bamboo Train is unique to Cambodia and allows you to immerse yourself in the culture of this rural landscape."

The shows blend personal stories with triumphant feats of physical strength and high-flying acts of imagination. Your guide meets you in the hotel lobby after breakfast and leads you to the shores of Tonle Sap Lake, Southeast Asia’s largest freshwater lake, encompassing an area of 1,000 square miles. Crocodiles and turtles linger in the marshlands, and mangrove forests grow against the mouth of the river. Macaques rifle through the trees and call out to one another in the cool morning air. You board a local boat and venture to the village of Kampong Phluck. Houses hover over the surface water on stilts nearly 20 feet tall. In the wet season, the lake rises and submerges the stilts, making it look as though the village floats along the surface. The thatched walls and corrugated pitched roofs grab your attention. Chickens cluck and graze on the grass away from the water. Villagers greet you with warm smiles. Children wave from the platforms of their houses as fishermen lay large traps in the water. Your guide explains that when the water rises too high or becomes too choppy, the villagers move to the floodplains. Outside the village, you float through the submerged forest, passing your fingers over the tree bark and waxy texture of the leaves. Passing fishermen nod in welcome as they squat near the front of their canoes. The villagers make boats with wood from the coki tree, which grows in abundance near the lake."

Passersby make their way to the gates of Angkor and the morning market fills with colorful clothing and vibrant paintings meant to catch a patron’s eye. Your private transfer meets you at the hotel and escorts you to Siem Reap International Airport for your flight to Bali. The city of Ubud claims the title of Bali’s “Cultural Capital,” with streets meandering along the Central Highlands and glowing with iridescent rainforest trees and emerald rice paddies. A cool mountain breeze rustles the surrounding trees and artists fill the marketplace with elegant paintings, spectacular jewelry, and captivating woodcarvings. Your private transfer meets you at Ngurah Rai International Airport upon your arrival. Your luxurious hotel overlooks the sweeping greenery of the bordering rice fields. Sporadic wildflowers bloom with orange petals. The scent of hyacinth blends with the aroma of coffee drifting out of the chic central cafes. For a unique first impression of Ubud, you venture to a hotel famous for its hillside location and spectacular views. A swing dangles between the two coconut trees on a hilly summit. You can sit on the swing and enjoy a gentle pace with views of the Ayung River. You can hear the tranquil splash of a mini waterfall while looking out to the rice fields and peak of Mount Agung."

After breakfast, your guide meets you in the hotel lobby, eager to introduce you to the lush landscape around Ubud. Trails crisscross the rice fields. Locals sell coconuts freshly fallen or taken from the trees. Farmers wear traditional thatched, conical hats. The trails wind beneath coconut canopies and alongside farmland. The rice grows over ankle-height. Sporadic huts rise out of the fields. You continue to Ubud Palace, where the royal family continues to live amongst the decorative statues and stone carvings. Bright flowers adorn the shrines and hints of jasmine drift through the air. The palace was erected in the 19th century and remains a splendid example of Balinese architecture. The beauty of the décor and design has established a deep seeded connection between the region and artists, bringing in artisan craftsmen from across Bali to take inspiration from the charming tropical garden. Once in the Sacred Monkey Forest, you discover more than 100 long-tailed macaques spread across 27 acres. The rainforest canopy shades the stone walkways. Monkeys linger on historical statues and watch passersby from the treetops. A rocky stream flows at the bottom of the central ravine. Your guide leads you to the first of a collection of ancient temples, reminding you of the moss-covered walls you saw at Ta Prohm Temple."

Your guide meets you at the hotel and leads you to the Tegalalang Rice Terraces to view the remarkable texture of the hillsides. Palm trees soar above the layered tiers of the rice fields overtaking the landscape. The iconic image of the Balinese countryside adheres to the subak , a cooperative irrigation system passed down through the generations, beginning in the 8th century. Farmers carry poles with woven baskets balancing at both edges. They walk barefoot through the puddled terraces as the rice grows into fields. The microclimates change across the hillside tiers, growing warmer as you reach the valley floor. You continue your exploration of the Balinese countryside on a scenic drive north to Pura Ulun Danu Bratan, the Lake Temple. The complex was erected in the 17th century and dedicated to the Hindu trinity of Brahman, Vishnu, and Shiva. The grounds also contain shrines devoted to the lake goddess. Tiers offer a theme for the day, taking you from the terraced hills to the concentric thatched-roof towers of the temples. The water laps against the stone-studded borders of the small islands and lakeshore setting. Lily pads wade in the soft wake. Four gates encircle the city to embody the four shrines and the four points of the compass. Your guide points to the Vishnu’s shrine, which contains 11 tiers, as opposed to Brahma and Shiva’s shrines, which contain seven and three tiers, respectively."

After breakfast, you meet your instructor at Geger Beach for a private surf lesson. Avid surfers have already made their way to the breaks, gliding across the water with dancer-like grace. You first learn the techniques of balance by popping up on the board while situated on the sand. You burst upward to your feet from a lying position. When you feel comfortable, your guide helps you out to the water, taking you over the small waves curling near the shore. He tells you when to paddle your arms to propel yourself forward. The water is refreshing beneath the tropical sun. You pop up when told, balance your body, and ride the wave back to the powdery shoreline. The remainder of the day is yours to enjoy the splendors of Bali and the southern peninsula at your leisure. For a unique view of the landscape, you make your way to the sacred and secret canyon near Sukawati. The canyon rocks are iridescent with gold and turquoise hues reflected in the crystal clear water. The cold and refreshing river courses gently along the rugged boulders at the base of the canyon wall. The magnificent landscape resembles a surreal painting in which you can find hidden faces protruding from the rocks."

The sunlight captures flickers of colorful coral glinting from beneath the water. After breakfast, you begin the day with a visit to the majestic Water Blow, a natural phenomenon turning the coastline into a geyser. The wake fills a narrow passage on the rugged shore with water. When the pressure builds, the water erupts over the viewing platform and craggy rocks, before receding. The mist remains for minutes at a time, cooling the surrounding air beneath the rising tropical sun. In the afternoon, your guide leads you to the cliffs of Uluwatu, overlooking the eponymous beach. The white sands glow against the fading sunlight beneath the breathtaking image of a temple erected along the limestone precipice. The edifice was built in the 11th century nearly 230 feet above the splashing waves. Monkeys linger in the trees and lounge on the walkways. The temple is regarded as one of Bali’s spiritual pillars. The sun fades behind the horizon, and an irrefutable rhythm erupts with a drumbeat. The Kecak Fire Dance begins with performers extending their arms and shaking their hands into the air. Their collective chant is fast and repetitive, combining their movements to tell a story from the Ramayana epic."

On the beaches near your resort, surfers have returned back to the water. You can’t help but recall your morning in the surf, riding the waves at Geger Beach. The thrilling excursion has you inspired to try again soon. Your private transfer meets you at the hotel and escorts you to Ngurah Rai International Airport when you are ready.

You arrive at your accommodation and immediately feel the small-town friendliness. The river’s gentle current runs against the banks. The scent of fresh-pressed coffee drifts from the café terraces. Along the eastern bank of the Sangkar River displays the heart of the French Colonial edifices left in the city. The buildings around the central market have thin, large windows that are arched at the top and decorated with wooden shutters.

The light slowly begins to ascend behind the surrounding jungle-clad mountains. Enter into the main courtyard and find the renowned Angkor Wat standing at the edge of a grassy field. The lily pond reflects the temple in the water. Monks emerge from the trees. Their orange robes imitate the sunrise to come. As the light spreads over the sky you can see five towers that resemble beehives, each rising from a significant point on the temple. The central tower stands 213 feet from floor to tip. The 12th-century temple is covered with intricate reliefs that tell Hindu and Buddhist myths. When you enter the building you find the scent of sandalwood from various small shrines.

The culture of Cambodia, like the trees that surround the temple ramparts, is strong from the deep roots upwards. The legends are displayed on the walls, and the walls are written into the people’s history."

Your guide meets you at your hotel and escorts you to the prominent 10th-century temple complex of Banteay Srei. The intricate details of the temples are so stunning and delicate that the artistry led to the complex’s name of “The Citadel of Women.” The red sandstone brings rich color to the verdant surroundings. The outer wall was once over 1,640 square feet. The deity Indra faces east and is mounted on his three-head elephant. The citadel towers shade the pathways. The libraries are made of brick and laterite and sit atop two pediments. Each relief displays a detailed story dear to the ancient kingdom, such as the burning of Khandava Forest, found on the sanctuary pediment. After lunch, you continue onward to the 12th-century temple Ta Prohm. The temple was constructed with flat rectangular walls that surround the central sanctuary. When you enter the complex you notice the colonnade. A large tree grows from the top of the rampart and stretches high into the air, its canopy giving shade to the plaza below. Its thick roots dangle down to the dirt floor. The solid stone structure now combines the manmade architecture with elements of time and nature. A bas-relief at the entrance shows a figure meditating. A variety of trees climb over the once forgotten citadel. The grace of the temple is in its shaped tremendous history shaped by its unearthed present."

After breakfast, your guide will take you to Tonle Sap, a large freshwater river whose water levels fluctuate dramatically throughout the year. Climb aboard a small boat and venture out onto the water. The lake is placid and the banks are verdant. Fishermen have long-tail boats that skim the surface of the water. You can watch them drop cone-shaped nets into the lake and draw out the grid shortly after, filled with fish. The rice fields sweep into the distance and are fed by Tonle Sap. The tall strands of grass almost glow with green. You find villages located directly on the lake. The houses rise on stilts and help the villagers avoid the water’s massive fluctuation from season to season. After your exploration, you will make the ferry journey to Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia. The boat drifts down the Mekong River. The waterway is over 2,700 miles long and begins at the Tibetan Plateau. The riverbanks are lush and calm. The breeze is cool and inviting. When you arrive in the city you find the wide boulevards and tall spires of the Royal Palace. The city is active both on the water and on the streets. A private transfer takes you from the Mekong to your hotel."

Independence Monument was inaugurated in the 1960s as a testament to commemorate the people who sacrificed for the welfare of Cambodia. The Khmer architecture gives a lovely illustration of the country’s roots. A number of fountains trickle in the plaza that leads to the outstanding tower. The National Museum of Cambodia is the largest cultural history and archeological museum in the country and holds over 14,000 items. The building was constructed in the 1920s with traditional Khmer embellishments mixed with a colonial style. The interior houses artifacts from Anchor and beyond, such as the large multi-faced stone head that dates back to the Khmer Empire. The artwork displayed shows masterpieces of Khmer work and identity, unique to the empire and the region. The character in the artifacts, from stone reliefs to statues, gives pride to Cambodians in a sense of understanding their past, and also the strength and creativity that continues today. Stone elephants guard the entrance. Bronze Buddha images sit atop platforms. The collection takes you back into the decadent décor of history. In the evening, you can dine at a riverside restaurant where the terrace offers a view of the slow and soothing trickle of Tonle Sap River. The scent of Beef Lok Lok is mouthwatering. You can watch the sun fade behind the horizon and enjoy the flavors of the country."

The blind doors are decorated with nagas , serpent deities. Phnom Da is situated on a hill that is surrounded by water at various times of the day, making it look like the Mont St. Michel of Cambodia. The temple was constructed in the 11th century and sits atop a foundation constructed in the 6th century. The canopy brushes against the stone structure and almost covers it as if it has been forgotten over time. The entrance is open and stands under an arched relief. The city’s ancient moated walls wrap around three and a half square miles and offer a hint at the scale of Angkor Borei. In the evening, you can enjoy a delightful ride along the Mekong River. The sunset glistens off the water. Fishermen stay late and paddle their boats, silhouetted by the coming night."

Their playfulness is captivating, their intelligence inspiring. Trumpets and foot stomps are interspersed, one giving a beat to the air, the other giving a bounce to the ground.

The true gem of the complex is not just in how the temples have been preserved but also in the conservation of the intricate reliefs that decorate many of the buildings. The 10th-century citadel is a mixture of archaic and innovative style. The temple walls were constructed with a combination of brick, laterite, and red sandstone. The towers on the eastern pediment display Indra near the beginning of a 219-foot causeway. The libraries are the most extravagantly decorated areas of the temple. The pediments feature Shiva and Kama. The artwork is intricate in detail and mythology, each showing a blend of realism and stylization equally enthralling today as it must have been over a millennium ago. The tallest tower is over 30 feet tall and when the reliefs are bathed in light you can see every last magnificent detail. Back in Siem Reap you will lunch at Sala Bai, a school that offers opportunities to disadvantaged youth through the hospitality industry. After your meal, you will head to Angkor Thom, the capital of the Great Khmer Empire, and filled with the tremendous ruins that held royalty and temples. The Terrace of the Leper King was named for the discoloration and rampant moss growing on the Buddha statue that sat in the courtyard.

        "description": "The regal majesty of the Angkor complex continues to sit within the vast jungle and displays its elegant architecture in the open and sometimes overtaking, nature. You come to Sambor Prei Kuk, an impressive group of pre-Angkorian monuments that date back to the early 7th century. There are more than 100 structures dispersed in the forest, the oldest made of brick. The forest is serene and has become as much of a part of the ancient complex as the temples themselves. The main temple is made up of three complexes enclosed in two concentric walls. The reliefs pay homage to Gambhireshvara , an incarnation of Shiva. The central tower contains brick carvings, including a series of yoni, female fertility symbols. In parts of the area, you can see tree roots wrapping around entire temples. They act like rope, both constricting and holding up the ancient structure. The leaves sprout from various points on the trunk and brush the golden bricks with green. Few sites can stand up to the sheer magnitude of Angkor; however, the quiet history and encompassing landscape of Sambor Prei Kuk can try. In the afternoon you will arrive in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia. The current of the Mekong ripples the river that flows alongside the city. Wide and pristine boulevards harken back to the French Colonial past. Large palm trees grace the sidewalk. You can sit and enjoy the evening at the Foreign Correspondent’s Club, watching out over the river and listening to the water rush against the banks."

        "description": "Phnom Penh is the largest city in Cambodia. Independence Tower stands in homage to the people that dedicated themselves to the freedom of the country and was built in the style of the Khmer Tower. The morning brings the energetic city to life. The fishermen set out on the rippling Mekong. Motorbikes weave through the streets. Cyclists ride alongside the river on the cobblestone walkway that lines the boulevard. After breakfast, you meet your private guide and venture out to tour the city. The Royal Palace was constructed in the 1860s and was divided into four separate components. It sits in a division of the Tonle Sap and Mekong Rivers. The Moonlight Pavilion is an open-air structure a short distance away from the main hall. It continues to serve as a stage for Khmer dances that represent the classical history and mythology of Cambodia. Evenly spaced pillars frame the interior and support the tiered, traditional roof, which contains a delicate but powerful central spire. When you come to the Silver Pagoda you find the exuberant display of the famous Emerald Buddha. The 17th-century crystal image is nearly life-sized and encrusted with 9,584 diamonds. It is dressed in royal robes that add to the opulence, elegance, and breathtaking display of devotion. The building’s exterior is pristine but nothing can compare to the majesty of the decorated Buddha. A tiny beam of light can cause the entire image to sparkle like a regal chandelier. It shows that the imperial beauty of Cambodia persists."

The flaky exterior crunches when diners take a bite. Music calls from the waterfront encouraging locals as they perform their morning exercise. This is beyond the imperial past; you are partaking in Cambodia’s present culture. Your private transfer takes you to the airport and you say goodbye, but the empires of Cambodia have now made its lasting impression on your memory."

Your visit begins with the unique temple of Ta Prohm whose construction dates back to the 12th century. The iconic image of the temple comes from the wide oak tree standing along the temple’s porticos, with vines cleaving to massive stones and spilling over the ramparts. Thirty-nine towers are connected by a number of galleries within an exterior wall that wraps almost 1,200 feet around the entire structure.

The stone complex stands on the far side of the grassy plaza reflecting in the pond at its forefront scattered with lily pads. The temple dates back to the 12th century under King Suryavarman II. As the sun rises over the five central shrines, the light mixture of colors turns the temple from a dark shadow to a vibrant outline. Monks in orange robes begin to appear from the tree line with the gentle repetition of a gong sounding through the air. When you enter the first gallery you find harmonious representations of the gods, men, and animals, carved in every flat surface that wind around the structure. The sandstone no longer looks like a silhouette and instead brings a delicate red to the morning sky. Within the third gallery you notice the roofing decorated with a snake’s body with a lion’s head.

The network was constructed in the 1940s and encompasses over 124 miles of passageways. Maps are hung at the entrance and show you the exceptional extent of the entire network. The entrances continue to be covered by the countryside, either blending into the rocks or covered with a trap door. The fit is tight when you enter the tunnels. The walls are narrow and cold. Follow your guide deeper into the complex until you arrive at the exit. An M-41 tank is situated beneath the canopy of a eucalyptus grove. There is a tangible power in the persevering efforts it took to create and maintain the entire tunnel system."

Chinese lanterns are strung across the narrow streets. They burn orange and red in the fading daylight. The Thu Bon River flows quietly on the outskirts of town. When you visit the Tan Ky house you notice the combination of Chinese and Japanese architectural influence. The triple-beam structure represents the balance between heaven, earth, and humanity. The central courtyard shows two vertical panels that are inscribed with paralleled sentences. When you stand back you realize that each sentence is also an illustration of a bird."

        "description": "In the morning you will see local men riding their bikes along the riverbanks. Their wheels add a gentle whir to the sounds of the river. After breakfast, you will venture to Sambor Prei Kuk to witness the ancient temples scattered amongst the trees. The temples, which were composed of brick, dating back as far as the 7th century and they predate Angkor by almost 500 years. The surrounding forest is lush and vivacious, and it occasionally overtakes the complex's temples altogether. The main group of temples is Prasat Sambor, which is dedicated to one of Shiva’s incarnations. You will see some of the carvings that decorate the temple walls, including a series of female fertility symbols around the central tower. The portals are adorned with Shiva lingams, a sign that signifies a representation of the god. The power of nature will be inspiring and fascinating as you will see structures overrun with tree moss and tree roots. In the afternoon you will make your way to Siem Reap and find yourself in the luxurious rooms of the Somadevi Angkor Hotel and Spa, where the mixture of modern comforts and traditional design creates a fabulous, embracing atmosphere."

        "title": "Siem Reap – Angkor Wat and the Ta Prohm Complex",
        "description": "Siem Reap is a city that encapsulates the modern world in its historic center but continues to feel like a village along the streets outside the central area. The French Colonial architecture is another reminder of the city’s archeological connection. Before dawn, your guide will meet you at your hotel and escort you to the fabled temple of Angkor Wat. You come to the first imposing structure at the western gate and walk through the corridor. The impressive 12th-century temple is breathtaking even as an early morning silhouette. Five towers rise out of the expansive structure. The collection of spires represents Mount Meru, home of the gods. Each tower is textured with tiers and somewhat resembles a beehive in their shape. The sun begins to rise and casts a golden glow over the entire complex. The lily pond that decorates the open courtyard reflects an image of the temple. When you enter the main edifice you will find detailed reliefs that highlight religious mythology. The scent of incense fills the multiple galleries and the pillars of the first corridor are decorated with lotus rosettes while the wall is decorated with dancing figures. You could spend an entire day tracing your finger against the dancing apsaras and prancing animals found throughout the sandstone. The grandeur is not just impressive but is also captivating for its artistry and magnitude."

        "title": "Siem Reap – The Ancient City Angkor Thom",
        "description": "Angkor Thom was once the largest city in the world with a population of up to 150,000 people at its peak. After breakfast, your private guide will take you to the city walls of ancient, epic proportions. The capital of the Khmer Empire has a large bridge that takes you over the 328-foot wide moat. The railing is made of statues with deities on the left and demons on the right, each holding the tail of a large naga. The gate is tall and contains three towers that rise over the portal. The entire complex is almost three square miles. The gates are decorated with stone elephant trunks and the emblematic faces of Avalokiteshvara , whose simple smiles are mysterious and spellbinding. The atmosphere is magnificent and when you walk amidst the exceptional artistry and architecture of historic proportions you will witness the significant details that differ from the previous day's exploration of Angkor Wat. The Terrace of the Leper King is a large decorative platform topped by a statue, which is decorated with intricate deity carvings, each posing, and centered around a multi-headed naga. The mythology abounds and the grandeur of the city is endless."

        "title": "Siem Reap – Explore the Overgrown Jungle Around Beng Mealea",
        "description": "The majesty of the jungle is not just in its inherent beauty but in its secrets. The trees sprout lush, dense, and tall and the sky is almost overrun with the canopy while the aroma of rich earth emanates from the ground. When you arrive at Beng Mealea you discover the forgotten treasures that the jungle can hide. The Hindu temple was constructed in the 12th century and was enclosed by a large moat. Today much of the temple has been submerged in the overbearing jungle as roots and moss wrap around fallen masonry. The ambiance is serene, which accentuates the sense of legend. Standing walls are decorated with Hindu mythology and the temple corridor is dimly lit but remarkably intact. The pillars are firm and the ceiling comes to a conical point as it leads you deeper into the complex’s center. The standing pediments maintain their marvelous details. Beng Mealea will welcome you like an archeologist set on uncovering the wealth of history."

        "title": "Battambang – Visit the Villages of Tonle Sap Lake",
        "description": "Siem Reap is a diverse city of tradition and history, luxury and modernity. You will wave goodbye to the treasures of the jungle and make your way to Battambang. You head to the shores of Tonle Sap Lake, the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia, and step aboard your boat. The water is cool and refreshing and the lake is known for its temperamental undulation, which rises and falls with the seasons. From July to December you will be able to course through the waterways that the lake provides. When the boat begins to move you will notice that the lake isn’t just a body of water but a source of life to all those that live beside, and even on, the water. The villages that line the shore quickly fade into the distance while the sun is warm and the breeze is cool. Longtail boats drift past you, filled with smiling children and waving fishermen and paddy fields line the distant shores. Open water turns to small canals that return to open water. Floating villages stand over the lake’s surface. The villages rise on stilts to endure the changes in the water’s depth. You arrive in Battambang in the afternoon, the second-largest city in Cambodia that feels like a relaxed town since it understands the calming effect of the nearby river. French Colonial architecture decorates the riverbanks and the current carries the water onward. You can sit close to the river at Jaan Bai Restaurant and sip on the semi-sweet flavors of a lychee martini as you indulge in the comforts of your hotel."

        "title": "Battambang – The Temple of Phnom Sampeau and the Bamboo Train",
        "description": "Battambang is a city rich with architecture, such as the French Colonial edifices that create the city’s historic center. The pastel colors and wealth of windows create a unique atmosphere amongst the best-preserved colonial structures in all of Cambodia. Outside the city is another preservation of culture, the Bamboo Train. The tracks were laid by the French and connect Battambang to Phnom Penh. The train runs once a week and in order to connect rural travelers to smaller cities and villages around Cambodia alternative modes of transportation were invented. The intrigue of the Bamboo Train comes from its well-designed and methodical system. The norry is the train car, a seven-foot plank of wood covered with bamboo slats. You will climb aboard the single-engine car and begin your short tour through the surrounding greenery. The train car can reach up to 30 miles per hour but often stays at an average of 15 miles per hour and passes jungle and paddy fields. Cows graze in the short distance. When the trees open up you find the splendor of the expanse of fields. This unique transportation system will give you a taste of the entrepreneurial and enduring spirit of Cambodia."

        "description": "Today you will depart from the riverside charm of Battambang and make the journey back to Phnom Penh. The capital awaits you with images of Siswath Quay and the jovial sounds of the Central Market. The jungle feels familiar in an inviting way as the trees are like old friends that have maintained their lush and vibrant spirit. Oudong was the capital of Cambodia in the 19th century and is situated at the foothill of Udong Mountain. You can see stupas that rise above the trees on the summit of the mountain. The north stairway will take you up to the ridge of the modern temple. Monkeys sit in the trees and relax on the railing as they play among the leaves and watch passersby. Three large stupas sit in a row as they provide a resting place to previous kings. Mak Proum is decorated with garudas and elephants and our faces are situated around the top of the stupa, similar to the Avalokiteshvara of Angkor. In the afternoon you arrive in Phnom Penh and return to the luxuries of your luxury hotel."

        "description": "The morning will begin with the familiar sounds of the Sisowath Quay. A small group of locals stand along the brick promenade and perform their morning exercises. The current carries fishing boats downstream as the sunlight glistens off of the water. After breakfast, your private transfer will escort you to the airport where you will make your flight home. You will have witnessed more than historic cities but discovered the true splendor of the spirit and culture of Cambodia. History is remembered but majesty is endless."
