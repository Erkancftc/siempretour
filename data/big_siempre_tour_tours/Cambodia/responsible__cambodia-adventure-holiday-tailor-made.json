  "generalInfo": "This 12 day Cambodia adventure holiday will reveal the numerous fascinating sides to this wonderful country. Join us for a unique journey, travelling from the temples of the north to the beaches of the south.<br/><br/>The adventure begins in Siem Reap, gateway to the wonderful Angkor Temples, including Angkor Wat, but you will also head further afield to visit the remote Beng Mealea Temple. Next, transfer to Phnom Penh, Cambodia’s capital where three rivers meet – the Mekong, the Bassac and the Tonle Sap. Evidence of its French colonial past is everywhere, with its riverside cafes serving perhaps the best bread in South East Asia. You will have time to explore this fascinating city, taking in the Royal Palace, Wat Phnom and the Killing Fields and Toul Sleng Museum.<br/><br/>After the bustle of the capital, retreat to the calm and peace of Koh Kong, an off the beaten track location where you’ll stay at the wonderful  4 Rivers Floating Lodge. Sitting at the base of the Cardamom Mountains, this eco resort is only accessible by boat. Once here, you can enjoy all kinds of adventure activities, from kayaking and hiking to fishing with the locals. Or just relax!  Finish your adventure in the popular coastal resort of Sihanoukville.<br/><br/>This is a tailor made holiday, and our travel experts can make it truly bespoke to suit your interests and requirements. You will have your own English-speaking driver and guide throughout, plus experienced local guides at key sites. <br/>",
