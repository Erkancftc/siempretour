  "generalInfo": "This is an exciting 14-day holiday to Cambodia and Laos which takes in the highlights of these two fascinating countries. Discover the ancient temples of Angkor with their intricate wall carvings depicting early Cambodian life and witness the ravages of time played out on jungle-bound Ta Prohm, or 'jungle temple'. Travel to the country's second largest city of Battambang and ride the quirky bamboo train for a unique open-air rail experience travelling past rice paddies and small villages. <br/><br/>Arrive in the bustling capital of Phnom Penh and visit the truly stunning Royal Palace which is also home to the equally impressive Silver Pagoda. Built in traditional Khmer style, the site dominates the riverside with its golden roofs and glinting spires: stroll the complex usually frequented by groups of scarlet robed monks and marvel at the 5,329 silver tiles which make up the floor of the Silver Pagoda.<br/><br/>Head to Laos, a land-locked country with far fewer visitors than the rest of Indochina despite a wealth of sights to discover. Discover the sleepy capital of Vientiane, the 'city of sandalwood',  with visits to beautiful Wat Sisaket and climb to the top of Patuxay Monument for sweeping vews of the city. Fly north and explore Luang Prabang, the historic jewel in the country's crown. Cruise the Mekong to the Buddha-filled Pak Ou Caves, witness the monk's morning alms procession and visit the magnificent wats of the city. <br/><br/>This is a holiday which aims to introduce you to the fascinating sights and sounds of a large part of Indochina and will hopefully give you a thirst for more.....",
