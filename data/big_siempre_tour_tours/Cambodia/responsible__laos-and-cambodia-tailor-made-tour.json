  "generalInfo": "Political isolation has ensured an enduring authenticity in landlocked Laos in comparison to other areas of South East Asia. The UNESCO site of Luang Prabang is a case in pointe, highlighted for its well preserved architectural, religious and cultural heritage. Until the early 1990's Laos was a bastion of communism and is now recognised as a one party socialist state where the Lao people now enjoy a somewhat more liberated existence.  Sadly, the country still languishes from the after effects of the of the ‘Vietnam War’, despite efforts at clearance an estimated 80 million unexploded mines and bombs remain from the US ‘secret war’ and Laos is said to have the unwanted tag of being the most bombed nation relative to its population size in the world. This tailormade tour supports work to assist the Lao people, often poor farmers, who bear the brunt of this legacy. Elsewhere, visits include projects working with small scale coffee producers to maximise returns and promote sustainable techniques. Without doubt, Laos is an emerging destination, but one with fulfilling authentic village experiences, Laos is superbly blessed with magnificent scenery, from vertiginous limestone cliffs to thunderous waterfalls. Lao people are among the most welcoming and friendliest you’ll meet, characterised kindly by those in neighbouring states ‘water buffalo’. Continuing into Cambodia, experience Siem Reap with a visit to the incomparable and iconic Angkor Wat and its overwhelming collection of jungle temples. Scattered throughout a huge area of forest, they comprise one of the world’s greatest man-made wonders. Travel to Battambang and explore a slower and rural side of Cambodia before ending the tour in Phnom Penh, where we learn about the country’s dark history, as well as experiencing the vibrant and bustling markets. For an alternative view of the undeniable treasures of Indochina, but one that does not hide visitors from the tragedies and injustices of the not too distant past, this tour should not be overlooked.",

Later, after lunch at a local restaurant, the mood changes as we visit Phnom Sampeou’s notorious ‘Killing Caves’. Victims of the notorious Khmer Rouge regime were sadly executed here, their bodies brutally thrown into the chasm. A glass memorial records these events, while the bones of just some of those who perished have been collected to stand as a reminder of these horrific crimes. The hill’s summit offers commanding views over the Cambodian countryside and if you choose to stay until sunset, countless bats emerge from the caves to feed on the evening air. It’s possible to watch the spectacle from a comfortable chair while enjoying a cold drink courtesy of some enterprising local entrepreneurs. After sunset, we’ll head back to the hotel.
