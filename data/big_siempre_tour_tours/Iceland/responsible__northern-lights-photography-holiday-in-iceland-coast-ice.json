  "generalInfo": "Iceland is a fantastic destination for any photographer, and this Northern Lights photography holiday celebrates its coast and ice. Iceland has some of the most accessible wild coastal and ice landscapes in the world and it’s also a great location for photographing the aurora borealis. This 10-day photography workshop, run by people who know all the locations intimately, takes you to some of the best photography spots on the island. <br/><br/>We concentrate on two key area, each with extraordinary scenery and landscapes. The trip kicks off in the beautiful Snæfellsnes Peninsula, West Iceland. The coastal scenery here is wild, with black beaches, sea stacks, fjords and unusual shaped mountains such as Kirkjufell which rises elegantly from the bay in Grundarfjörður. The North Atlantic coast is never far away. <br/><br/>Next, we move on to the glaciated wilderness of southeast Iceland. Here we find some of the most spectacular ice and glacial phenomena in Europe, as well as dramatic mountain scenery, Skaftafell National Park, several glacial lagoons, black beaches festooned with sparkling ice, the famous Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon and magnificent views of Iceland’s highest mountain Hvannadalshnjúkur. Our main base is just ten minutes drive from the Jökulsárlón.<br/><br/>This photography workshop is longer than our other Iceland trips, so it’s perfect for those photographers who want to really get to know the country and capture a diverse mix of subjects. We will experience sunrise and sunsets in well chosen spots and of course there will be lots of chances to capture the aurora borealis – a magical experience with or without a camera.<br/><br/>Photography tuition is included and this holiday suits all levels of photographers. There will be some walking every day, occasionally on uneven terrain, although this will normally be on paths or tracks. Hotel accommodation is included, providing a comfortable base where you can relax or wander in the surrounding landscape in your own time, work on images, receive post-processing tuition and enjoy viewing sessions of each others’ work. There is a maximum group size of 12 people, and all meals, transfers and transport are included.",

      "description": "West Iceland: Leaving the city behind we drive directly to the Snæfellsnes peninsula. Our sea front hotel is located by the harbour of a working fishing village, and is beautifully situated for all our locations. The area offers sparkling fjords, dramatic volcanic peaks, sheer sea cliffs, sweeping golden beaches, interesting rock architecture including sea arches and vast lava flows which all contribute to make the fascinating landscape of the Snæfellsnes Peninsula. The area is crowned by the glistening ice cap Snæfellsjökull, immortalised in Jules Verne’s Journey to the Centre of the Earth. Hotel on Snæfellsnes (B,L,D)"

As we travel along the south coast our locations en route may include the classic waterfall Seljalandsfoss, Icelandic horses in a lovely mountain location and sunsets at Dyrhólaey and Vík. This last locations lends themselves to both abstract and unusual landscapes, particularly in monochrome. Hotel in Vík (B,L,D)"

      "description": "South Iceland: Today we will have time to explore this beautiful area well maybe starting with a shoot from the east to catch some early morning light on the sea stacks of Vík beach. After breakfast we may return to a couple of waterfalls that are special in the morning light. These will include Skógafoss and a ’secret’ waterfall! The beaches around this area are rich in basalt column architecture. Sea arches, caves, cliffs and big waves make for some dramatic photography particularly at sunset. Back for dinner, then hopefully a chance to capture the aurora in one of several good locations that we know around this area. Hotel in Vík (B,L,D)"

      "description": "Vík to Skaftafell National Park and Hali: This morning we journey along the wild and awe inspiring south coast of Iceland. We pass through vast lava fields covered with moss and an abandoned farm with turf covered roofs. The location of the farm beneath the mighty mountain of Lómagnúpur is spellbinding. Travelling further our vistas are of huge glacial sandurs, mountains and glaciers. We stop whenever the light and subjects are inspiring. By mid-afternoon we should have arrived at the Svínafellsjökull glacier where we will encounter and photograph remarkable close up perspectives of bluish green crevasses and the milky brown lagoon. This surreal icy landscape includes vistas of Iceland’s highest mountain, Hvannadalshnjúkur. There are sometimes beautiful ice formations although it is worth noting that we can never predict what these natural phenomena will be like until we arrive as they are constantly changing. Driving east in the early evening we will take our first short look at the Jökulsárlón glacier lagoon; a location that we will become increasingly familiar with over the coming days. For the next three nights we are based in a comfortable hotel beautifully located by the North Atlantic Ocean Hotel in Hali (B,L,D)"

Both locations are excellent for sunrises, sunsets and aurora. Our daily locations are chosen in conjunction with the weather or the aurora forecasts. We have to be very flexible to get the best images and we will often revisit worthwhile locations. Hotel in Hali (B,L,D)"
