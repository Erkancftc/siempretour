  "generalInfo": "There are small ship cruises and then there are really, really small ship cruises. There are just ten berths on board this perky-looking motor boat, which cruises Alaska’s popular Inside Passage for eight thrilling days. Your trip features barbecuing local king crab on the beach, hovercraft flights and – if your boat isn’t quite small enough already – decamping to sea kayaks to paddle around icebergs.  <br/><br/>Your adventure starts in the city of Sitka and ends in Juneau, Alaska’s state capital. On the way you’ll wrap around Admiralty Island, visiting the inlets and straits that thread inland, like Tracy Arm Fjord, with its glacier, and Stephens Passage, where there’s a chance to see whales. <br/><br/>Modelled on a fishing vessel, your boat is designed to be as stable as possible and is owned by members of the Kaagwaantaan Clan. From the outer deck of this little boat you’ll brilliantly positioned for wildlife viewing. In these waters, sea otters, sea lions, harbour seals and even orcas can be seen coming to the surface. But in Frederick Sound, it’s all about humpbacks. If you’re lucky, you’ll see one breach the water – and you’ll definitely see the splash afterwards.",

      "description": "Sitka. Explore beautiful Sitka, considered by many to be one of the most picturesque communities in The Last Frontier.

Beautiful totem poles adorn public areas and the Sitka National Historical Park, while the famous St. Michael’s cathedral stands in the center of the downtown district. You’ll be charmed by the island-studded waterfront, rugged mountain peaks of Baranof Island, and abundant bald eagles and marine life. (Guests can also choose to book optional excursions, such as fishing and private wildlife excursions in the days before embarkation)."

      "description": "Skagway. Stroll the boardwalks of the rollicking Klondike gold rush town of Skagway while enjoying its unique history. In the late 19th century, thousands of crazed gold seekers poured into the community en route to the Klondike. Wooden buildings, streets, and docks were constructed in mere months. Skagway was rambunctious, lawless, and tormented by a notorious con man named Soapy Smith. Today, historic businesses, frontier homes, and museums bring the spirit of the gold rush to life. Aboard the White Pass and Yukon Route railroad, you’ll enjoy a journey retracing the steps of gold-seekers into Canada. Built in 1898, the railroad climbs nearly 3,000 feet in 20 miles and offers stunning wilderness views. This excursion crosses the border into Canada, so passports are required."
