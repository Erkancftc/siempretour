  "generalInfo": "There’s nothing more warm and cosy than a mug of hot chocolate in a small, family-owned lodge in the middle of a snow-covered Alaskan spruce forest.<br/><br/>If you’re heading into the wilderness, just outside the city of Fairbanks, this is exactly what you can hope to discover, alongside numerous opportunities to unique Alaskan outdoor activities. From dog sledding and off-grid farmsteads to curling lessons with the locals and traditional Native American arts; visiting Alaska in the winter is an unforgettable experience.<br/><br/>For many, the highlight of this week away is the chance to see the Northern Lights. Every opportunity will be made to ensure travellers get to see the Aurora Borealis including personal wake up calls made by our ever-vigilant expert guides. Seeing the lights in Alaska is one of those amazing experiences that you’ll never forget and we’ll travel to the darkest aurora areas where this fascinating natural phenomenon is at its brightest and most active.<br/><br/>This small group trip hosts a maximum of 18 travellers and has been designed to cause the minimum disruption to the Alaskan environment and to local communities. There will be opportunities for cultural exchange with the locals so you can learn how people live in this land of extremes. Solo travellers are always welcome and single room supplements are available at the lodge. <br/><br/>So, what are you waiting for? Grab your camera and head north to Alaska. Reindeer, ice sculptures, geothermal hot springs and the incredible Aurora Borealis await.<br/>",

      "description": "**Below is a sample itinerary. Activities change based on snow conditions. In early fall curling is not available, snowshoeing is replaced with hiking, and dogsledding will instead be a dog-cart ride or hike with the huskies. Aurora is a natural occurrence and predicting it is not foolproof** When you arrive Fairbanks we provide a complimentary ride to your lodge. We host a quick meet-and-greet with your guides in the lobby that night. Bring your camera if you have questions about photographing Northern Lights! The lodge is in a beautiful location, surrounded by snow-covered spruce forests."

Once we’ve done introductions and boarded the small bus, our afternoon includes lunch at a nearby restaurant and a visit to Pioneer Park. This 44-acre village features historical buildings moved from downtown Fairbanks and various museums with local artifacts, bringing you on a journey through time. We’ll head to the lodge in the afternoon where we’ll have a chance to unpack, relax, eat dinner, and learn about the Aurora Borealis."

      "description": "After breakfast, we head into town for a city tour of Fairbanks and visit the famous Trans-Alaska Pipeline, followed by lunch at a great local spot. Following a guided walk through town, we visit the Morris Thompson Cultural Center. Explore world-class exhibits on Alaska’s history and seasons and learn about traditional native art, dance, and music. It’s a great introduction to Interior Alaska! Back at the lodge, you can explore the hiking trails that surround the lodge or just grab a hot cocoa and relax in your new home base. Following dinner, you can come ‘hunt’ for the Northern Lights with us, or stay in the warmth of the lodge. Your guide will alert you if the Aurora appears."

      "description": "Today visit the remote and beautiful Chena Hot Springs. Soak in the steaming waters surrounded by snow; if it is really cold your hair might even freeze! While there we visit an ice sculpture museum where you can observe delicate artwork and sip an apple martini in a carved glass from the ice bar (not included in tour cost). The drive home from the Hot Springs provides a wonderful opportunity to search for the Northern Lights and spot moose."

      "description": "Enjoy another tasty breakfast before our most exciting excursion yet — dog sledding! Meet the friendly dogs (and maybe even some puppies!) and learn about mushing before hopping on a sled for a ride through the forest. You have free time in the afternoon when you can try snowshoeing around the property if the conditions are right or go into down for some shopping. We’ll enjoy a final farewell dinner together tonight."
