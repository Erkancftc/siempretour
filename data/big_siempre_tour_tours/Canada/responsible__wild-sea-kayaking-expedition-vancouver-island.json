  "generalInfo": "WHAT MAKES THIS TOUR SO SPECIAL?<br/>If you crave adventure, and a desire to kayak and explore an area that few ever get to, then this west coast sea kayaking expedition is for you. Our expert guides know the area, the currents, winds, and of course the best camping and sunset spots! Together with your small group, you will see sites and visit places that are outside the realm of the modern world, and accessible to only a select few. The dramatic seascape of the wild northwest coast of Vancouver Island provides the setting for one of the finest sea kayaking destinations in Canada, Nuchatlitz Marine Park. The area is sheltered from the open ocean by small and enchanting islands. This string of islets gives the adventurous kayaker an opportunity to experience the rugged coast while paddling in relatively protected waters.<br/><br/>THE TOUR<br/>Our adventure begins from the town of Tahsis on the west coast of Vancouver Island. From here we jump aboard our water taxi and head into the heart of the Nuchatlitz Provincial Marine Park. En route, we take in the mountainous coastal landscape and keep our eyes peeled for wildlife as we pass by historic village sites. <br/><br/>THE AREA<br/>This remote area is one of the few places where you can escape the crowds. Getting out to the park can be difficult for the solo paddler or independent group as the distance is far from the launch site and headwinds are often encountered deeper in the inlets. To avoid this long and arduous paddle, we transport you by water taxi to and from this prime kayaking destination. Once there we will establish our first night’s camp on a secluded beach among old-growth forests. Each day we will explore the numerous islands and beaches, marvel at the natural rock formations like sea caves and towering rock pinnacles, and reflect on the rich west coast First Nations culture.<br/><br/>HIGHLIGHTS<br/><br/>SEA OTTERS - The Nuchatlitz is home to one of the largest sea otter populations on the west coast of North America. Once hunted to extinction in this area, the sea otter was reintroduced in the late 1960s and now thrives. <br/><br/>WEST COAST SUNSETS - The sunsets on the West Coast of Vancouver Island are simply stunning. Watch as the sun sinks over the horizon to the west and beautiful colours illuminate the skies. <br/><br/>WHITE SAND - Most sea kayaking areas on the Inside Passage, between Vancouver Island and the mainland, have landing areas that range from rock to pebbles or gravel due to the lack of consistent wave action. Here on the outer coast, we are treated to numerous beaches where you can walk barefoot and really get the sand between your toes.<br/><br/>SEA STACKS &amp; CAVES - Stacks are formed when part of a headland is eroded by hydraulic action. The force of the water weakens cracks in the headland and causes them to collapse, forming free-standing stacks and small islands. These formations, along with the numerous sea caves in the area, make for some of the most picturesque and interesting paddling on the coast.",

      "description": "At 9 am you will meet your guides at the Municipal Dock. We will transfer ourselves and equipment aboard our water taxi and begin the scenic journey to the west coast paradise of the Nuchatlitz Marine Park. En route, we take in the mountainous coastal landscape and keep our eyes peeled for wildlife as we pass by historic village sites. After settling into our new surroundings and lunch we will have a kayak orientation and discuss safety procedures before setting off on an afternoon paddle. We will return in time for a fresh wild fish dinner (alternatives of course for those who do not eat fish). Enjoy the sunset from the beach (or from your tent) before retiring to rest for more fun in the morning."

      "description": "After waking up in one of the most beautiful places on earth, to stunning sunrises, we will begin our day with a delicious breakfast before we break camp. On the Nuchatlitz tour, there is no set itinerary. Instead, our route will depend on weather conditions and the group’s desires. Our days will be spent exploring the picturesque islands, lagoons, beaches, and sea caves hidden behind cascading waterfalls. We will also take some time out for beach combing, or simply lounging and taking in the magnificent surroundings. If we are fortunate we will end our day with a famous west coast sunset. Campsites are plentiful and scenically situated on either sand or pebble beaches, grassy knolls or beneath the canopy of ancient rain forests."

      "description": "This is our last day to enjoy the marine environment of the west coast. In the morning, our boat transport will take us back to Tahsis. Time for one last deep breath of ocean air, to take in the panoramic scenery and all the natural wonders around us, before our real life catches up with us. This 6-day adventure is the perfect introduction to sea kayaking in a remote and coastal BC environment. To learn new wilderness skills, and take a break from the hustle and bustle of your everyday life."
