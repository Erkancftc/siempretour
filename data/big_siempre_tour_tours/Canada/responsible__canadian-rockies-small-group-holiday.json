      "title": "Vancouver.",
      "description": "Welcome to Canada! Your adventure begins with a welcome meeting at 6 pm. If you do arrive early, perhaps explore the happening neighbourhood of Yaletown, or head to Granville Island to visit the colourful markets full of fresh produce and handcrafts. Vancouver’s coastal setting is beautiful, bordered by an ocean harbour to the north and a river to the south. The majestic Coastal Mountains, often snow-capped, provide the eastern horizon, making it a picturesque place to spend a few days before the tour begins."

      "description": "On your way out of Vancouver today, check out Stanley Park’s carved totem poles, representing the historical crests of First Nations families and their clans. During the drive to Whistler you’ll stop at the beautiful Shannon Falls, then learn more about First Nations art, history and culture at Squamish Lil'Wat Cultural Centre. Refuel with a late lunch at the onsite cafe, serving a modern take on traditional First Nations food. Once you arrive in Whistler Village, your leader will take you on an orientation walk through the bustling hub of shops and award-winning restaurants, all surrounded by beautiful mountain scenery.

      "description": "Stunning Whistler is ready to be explored, up the mountain or back down in the village. Perhaps buy yourself a ticket to ride the PEAK 2 PEAK gondola to enjoy unparalleled views of towering volcanic peaks and surrounding forest on the world’s longest and highest lift. Once at the top, check out the nearby scenic walking trails, mountaintop restaurants and indoor interpretive displays. Otherwise, you could hire a bike and ride along the Valley Trail to Lost Lake, or go for an easy hike along the Lost Lake Nature Trail. If you're after something a little more cultured, perhaps hit the Audain Art Museum to see a selection of First Nations and British Columbian artwork."

      "dayNumber": 4,
      "title": "Sun Peaks.",
      "description": "Say goodbye to Whistler and drive through the mountains to Sun Peaks. The Sun Peaks township is set on one of many peaks along the mountain range and the views from the top are incredible. On arrival you’ll have the choice to see those views for yourself by doing a hike along the Sunburst Loop. Or, you might like to take a shorter walk along the Shuswap Medicine Trail and learn about local flora, fauna and traditional First Nations medicines. This evening, rejoin your group for dinner together."

Along the way you’ll stop in at Mt Robson Provincial Park, stretching your legs on a short walk through the picturesque wildflower meadows.

      "description": "Today is a free day in Jasper. Join the group on a visit to Maligne Lake for some hiking, and perhaps book yourself a cruise on the lake’s shimmering blue waters past the much-photographed Spirit Island. If the lake cruise isn’t your thing, you might like to spend your time seeing the area while hiking either the Mary Schaeffer or the Moose Lake trails. There’s also the option hike or bike around Beauvert Lake, or a ride on the Jasper SkyTram is highly recommended if you didn’t do it yesterday!"

After, you might like to check out the interior of the luxury mountain resort, Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise. This afternoon, don an old-fashioned swimsuit and soak in the hot mineral waters of the Banff Upper Hot Springs.

There are opportunities for canoeing, mountain biking, hiking or riding the gondola to the top of Sulphur Mountain."

      "title": "Calgary.",
      "description": "Before leaving Banff this morning, join a guide from Yellowstone to Yukon (Y2Y). Y2Y is an initiative to create wildlife corridors spanning from Yellowstone to Yukon, and you’ll learn about how the US and Canada have come together to support the animals whose habitats span both countries. Then, complete your crossing of the Rockies today on a drive to Calgary. Along the way, make a stop in the cosy little town of Canmore, the perfect place to grab some lunch and soak in some final mountain views. Arriving in Calgary the afternoon. Home to the famous Calgary Stampede, the city is growing at a rapid rate, largely thanks to oil and mining. While it may not be the most picturesque of cities, Calgary makes up for it with a budding dining and nightlife scene. In the evening perhaps head for dinner at one of the city's great restaurants."
