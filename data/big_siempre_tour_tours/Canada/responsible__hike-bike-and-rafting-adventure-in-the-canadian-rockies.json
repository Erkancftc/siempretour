  "generalInfo": "If you want a Canadian Rockies holiday that’s active, varied, and fully supported, our Canadian Rockies Multi-Sport Guided Tour delivers six days of cycling, hiking, and rafting across Banff and Jasper National Parks. The trip starts and ends in Banff and is packed with daily mountain adventures. Two professional local guides look after the details—transport, timing, route choices, and on-trip support—so you can focus on the mountains. <br/><br/>You’ll experience the Rockies from three angles. On foot, you’ll hike glacier-view classics like Parker Ridge, Wilcox Pass and Lake Annette, where alpine meadows and icefields fill the horizon. On two wheels, you’ll ride beautiful stretches around Jasper and along the Icefields Parkway: ride to Maligne Canyon, a big-scenery parkway day toward Sunwapta Falls, and a finale from Lake Louise back to Banff. Along the way, we stop at Mount Edith Cavell for views of Angel Glacier. <br/><br/>To round out the week, you’ll swap pedals for paddles with a rafting trip on the Athabasca River (about 3 hours, Class II–III)—a Rockies rush framed by peaks and glacial-fed water. The highlights are built in too: Peyto Lake’s viewpoint, time at Moraine Lake, a photo visit at Lake Louise, and a memorable week in the Canadian Rockies<br/><br/>What makes this holiday special is the balance of adventure and comfort. You’ll travel in a small group (4–12), stay five nights in mountain lodgings, and enjoy a trip where the big logistics are handled: all transportation during the tour, national park and activity entry fees, luggage transfers, rafting, meals as listed, plus snacks and non-alcoholic beverages.<br/><br/>Before or after your tour, it’s easy to add extra Rockies fun: ride the Banff Gondola, soak in the Banff Upper Hot Springs, stroll Banff Avenue for cafés and restaurants, or explore Canmore’s riverside paths and local breweries.<br/><br/>Although we do our very best to adhere to the schedule below, the itinerary is subject to change for numerous reasons beyond our control, including weather and terrain conditions.",
