  "generalInfo": "There aren’t many better ways to kill 16 days than this tour – a small group holiday to Laos that starts in capital city Vientiane and winds up amongst the twin falls of Tad Fane.<br/><br/>Whistle stop is this tour’s middle name, so you’ll quickly get to the heart of each place you visit. In Vientiane, you’ll learn about the Vietnam War. Seek out the Hmong and Tai Dam villages tucked away in Phonsavan. And take the prettiest mountain road to Luang Prabang. The Plain of Jars might be the most bizarre thing you’ve come across yet – rolling hills pockmarked with 300 giant stone jars with mysterious origins.<br/><br/>There’s a common theme throughout: the chance to sail and kayak the rivers that join your stopping points. It’s a great opportunity to drift past unaged villages and learn about the slow ways of rural life – a real breather before your grand finish in neighbouring Thailand, where you’ll spend your last night in full-on Bangkok.",

The alms-giving ceremony is a serene daily ritual where locals and visitors offer food to rows of saffron-robed monks at dawn, symbolizing generosity and spiritual reflection. We then head out to the beautiful Kuang Si Waterfalls, approximately 45 minutes from Luang Prabang. Passing forested hills and several ethnic minority villages, we arrive at the limestone falls that cascade into several turquoise pools below. We have some time to explore the many levels of the falls as well as the near-by Sun Bear rescue centre. Returning to Luang Prabang we visit Ock Pop Tock, a centre dedicated to showcasing the tradition of northern Laos' silk-weaving cottage industry. The rest of this afternoon has been left free to further explore this charming city, or to relax at one of the many al-fresco coffee shops that pepper the street sides. In the evening, there is chance to walk to nearby Mount Phousi and climb its 328 steps in time for sunset, offering excellent panoramic views over this sleepy city. Or you could join our Tour Leader for monk chanting. Each evening, visitors can observe or participate in chanting ceremonies held in many of the local temples.

As we navigate upriver the city of Luang Prabang soon fades away, passing river-side villages and then rice paddies and fields of vegetation, all under the shadow of the rolling mountainous terrain in the background. Along the way, we stop at Pak Ou Caves, a cavern hidden in the rockface and filled with a plethora of Buddha images and statues. Depending on the season, we may see locals panning in the river, children playing, blacksmiths at work and basket weavers as we cruise past dwellings. Lunch is served onboard, and we plan to arrive into Pakbeng in the early evening."

It's worth noting that the path is uneven, involving climbing some rocks and crossing the river. Note: strap-on sandals or quick-drying shoes are ideal, as your feet might get wet along the way. If you wish you can bring hiking poles, however they are not essential."

      "description": ": After a leisurely morning, we begin our journey by heading to Oudomxay station to board the newly constructed Boten-Vientiane Railway for a short two-hour ride to the capital city of Vientiane. Opened in December 2021, this ambitious project, a collaboration between Laos and China, links the Chinese railway system at the northern border to the Thai railway system via the Friendship Bridge in the south. The railway now connects a network of rural villages in Laos, providing a significant boost to trade in a country with a challenging road network through mountainous terrain. With modern trains reaching speeds of up to 160 km/h, it has also made travel within Laos far more accessible and comfortable. The journey goes through tunnels and at times, pass lush rice paddies soaking in the scenic beauty of the Laotian countryside. Upon arrival, we transfer to the hotel where the evening is free to explore the night market and go out for dinner."

It's the perfect opportunity to immerse ourselves in the local culture and observe daily life in southern Laos. We then continue our journey into the heart of the Bolaven Plateau. Here the soil is very fertile and so cultivation of Arabica and Robusta coffee and tea is the most important trade, which is complimented by the small scale agriculture of fruit, vegetables, cardamom and rattan."

After soaking in the sights at Koh Ker, we'll continue on a scenic drive to Beng Mealea, about an hour away through the rural Cambodian landscape. Known as the 'Jungle Temple', Beng Mealea is an atmospheric site where nature has reclaimed the ruins. With its collapsed galleries, overgrown roots, and sense of mystery, it feels like stepping into another world - a true hidden gem. After exploring Beng Mealea, we'll head toward Siem Reap, which is just about an hour away, depending on the road conditions and traffic. We'll arrive in the late afternoon and settle in for the final three nights of the trip, giving you a chance to relax and reflect on all that we've seen."

      "title": "A full day exploring the magnificient Angkor temple complex, including Angkor Thom and sunset at Angkor Wat",
      "description": ": We start the day's exploration with a visit to the temples of King Jayavarman Vll, reputedly Angkor's greatest king. The fortified city of Angkor Thom, which he built at the end of the 12th century, is enclosed by a wall with five monumental gates decorated with stone elephant trunks. Originally, crocodiles inhabited the moat and huge statues of 54 different gods protected each gate. The city contains another of Angkor's true gems - Bayon Temple. Although not as impressive as Angkor Wat from a distance, Bayon is nevertheless incredible for its maze of corridors, gothic style towers and magical central temples. We'll explore The Terrace of the Elephants and the Leper King, the Baphuon and Phimeanakas, and the 'Tomb Raider' temple of Ta Phrom which has been quite literally consumed by nature. We leave the best known and most breath taking of all the sights, Angkor Wat, to the end. Originally built as a funerary temple for Suryavarman ll in honour of Vishnu, the temple is unique as it faces west - symbolically the direction of death. It is an immensely grand and imposing structure with an extensive and intricately carved bas relief that stretches throughout the galleries and inner temples. We stay here until after sunset to really appreciate the beauty of the temple in the changing light."

      "title": "Morning on Tonle Sap Lake exploring the floating villages",
      "description": ": This morning, we set out on the great Tonle Sap Lake, Southeast Asia's largest freshwater lake, for a captivating boat journey. As we glide across the water, we visit one of the many fascinating floating villages - entire communities that live, work, and go to school on the lake itself. Here, we witness the rhythms of daily life as locals ply their trade, fishing, selling goods, and navigating the waterways that serve as their roads. For much of the year, the lake is surprisingly shallow - just a metre deep in some areas. But after the monsoon rains, the Mekong River reverses its flow, swelling the Tonle Sap by up to ten metres and flooding nearby forests and fields. This remarkable natural phenomenon creates one of the most fertile ecosystems in the world, providing vital breeding grounds for freshwater fish and sustaining the livelihoods of countless communities. After exploring the lake, we drive back to Siem Reap, where the afternoon is free for you to relax or continue your discoveries. You might like to visit the Apopo Visitor Centre, where specially trained HeroRATs detect landmines and tuberculosis. Here, you'll learn about Cambodia's landmine history, watch a live demonstration, and gain insight into ongoing humanitarian efforts. Alternatively, take an optional excursion to Banteay Srei, often called the 'Citadel of Women'. This exquisite 10th-century temple is famed for its intricate pink sandstone carvings - some of the finest in all of Angkor. In the evening, we gather for a farewell dinner at a local restaurant, sharing one last delicious meal together and reflecting on the unforgettable journey we've shared through Cambodia's landscapes, history, and culture."
