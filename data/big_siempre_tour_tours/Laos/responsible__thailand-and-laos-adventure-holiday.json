  "generalInfo": "Travel with a small group by boat, bus and train, from Bangkok to Vientiane experiencing beautiful northern Thailand and the laidback river lifestyle of Laos. This 13-day adventure starts in Bangkok, where you can cruise down the Chao Phraya River to explore the famous ‘khlongs’ (canals) and visit Wat Pho temple before hopping on the sleeper train to Chiang Mai.  Then get to know this beautiful city, nicknamed the ‘Rose of the North’, on a bicycle tour, wander the night bazaar or head up the mountain to the stunning temple complex, Doi Suthep. <br/><br/>In Laos, take a lazy two-day journey down the mighty Mekong River to the former royal capital of Laos, Luang Prabang. This UNESCO World Heritage site boasts red-roofed temples and French-Indochinese architecture and each morning, saffron-robed monks walk its ancient streets to collect alms. Head into the hills to experience Vang Vieng, a riverside town surrounded by towering limestone karsts, where you can cycle, visit caves or stroll the local markets before ending your trip in the country's capital, Vientiane. Hardly touched by modernisation, its faded colonial mansions, tree-lined boulevards and old temples create an atmosphere of timelessness – a relaxing full-stop to this fascinating trip.<br/>",

      "title": "Bangkok.",
      "description": "Sa-wat dee! Welcome to Thailand. Your adventure begins in the bustling capital of Bangkok, famous for its tuk-tuks, khlong boats and street vendors serving up delicious local food. You’ll have a welcome meeting at 6 pm to meet your local leader and group of fellow travellers. It’s recommended you arrive a few days early to explore the city – uncover the Chinatown area, visit the Grand Palace and the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, wander down Khao San Road, indulge in a Thai massage or see the backstreets of Bangkok by bike on an Urban Adventure. After the meeting tonight, maybe tuck into some into world famous street food for dinner."

      "description": "Begin the day with a river cruise down the Chao Phraya River to explore the famous Khlongs (canals). Life along these canals seems a world away from the chaotic streets of the capital. Visit Wat Pho – one of the Bangkok temples, with a 46-m-long gold-plated Buddha reclining inside. Even the feet of this statue are incredible, 3 m long and intricately decorated with mother of pearl. The temple grounds are equally fascinating, filled with beautifully decorated stupas, halls and shrines. This evening you’ll head north to Chiang Mai on an overnight train journey."

      "title": "Chiang Mai.",
      "description": "The most vibrant city in northern Thailand, Chiang Mai has many famous temples and an interesting old city area. When you arrive, embark on a scenic, winding drive to one of the country's most stunning temple complexes – Doi Suthep. A 300-step naga-guarded stairway leads you to the temples, and the climb is well worth the effort. Take in the hypnotic atmosphere of chanting Buddhist monks and the sweeping views over the city. After making your way back down, you’ll check into your hotel and have a free afternoon and evening to explore. Maybe wander through the Night Bazaar or relax at a restaurant along the riverfront. Make sure to sample some traditional northern Thai food – the signature dish is kao soy (yellow wheat noodles in a curry broth, traditionally served with chicken or beef)."

      "description": "Today, you’ll have a pretty special time visiting the ChangChill elephant experience. Take a 1.5-hour drive out of Chiang Mai to ChangChill, where you’ll begin to learn how this organisation supports the protection, conservation and lifestyle of free roaming elephants in the region. You’ll observe the daily patterns of these jungle giants from a safe distance, seeing how they graze and socialise with their other friends. The expert local guides will be able to give you a ‘live lecture’ on the elephants themselves, its sustainable tourism practices and conservation efforts in the area. Enjoy some refreshments nearby the elephant’s mud pit but be careful not to get a spray! Be treated to some lunch in a riverside sala (pavilion) alongside your giant friends, who will be enjoying a meal too. Return to Chiang Mai where the rest of the time is at leisure."

      "title": "Chiang Khong.",
      "description": "Take a journey through rural countryside to the Thai border town of Chiang Khong. On the way, visit privately owned Wat Rong Khun, more commonly known as the White Temple – a must visit in Chiang Rai. This contemporary temple is constantly being updated, and its strange design references to Buddhist mythology, human sin and pop culture icons such as Michael Jackson, Harry Potter and Superman. Formerly known as Juon, riverside Chiang Khong remains an important market town for the surrounding hill tribes and for trade with Laos. Stretch your legs with a stroll around town, then maybe continue to Wat Phra Kaew and Wat Luang. Tonight, why not enjoy a final Thai drink and dinner, while Laos beckons from across the mighty Mekong."

      "title": "Mekong River - Pak Beng.",
      "description": "After crossing into Laos, you’ll be joined by additional Laos guides (a local government requirement). Board a slow boat for the 2-day journey down the mighty Mekong River to Luang Prabang. The journey is relaxed, so you can experience the slow pace of village life and the breathtaking scenery along the river up close. The river boat is basic in nature, with a toilet, covered roof and open sides to take in the fresh air. There are seats in the front of the boat and a small open area in the back where you can have a nap on the mat, play cards, read or have lunch. Dock at the small town of Pak Beng to spend the night. Hmong and tribal Thai people are frequently seen on the main streets, where vendors sell local textiles and handicrafts."

      "description": "Reboard the boat and cruise to the Pak Ou Caves – an important religious site overlooking the river at the junction of the Mekong and Ou Rivers, consisting of two sacred limestone caverns filled with Buddha images of all styles and sizes. The lower cave, known as Tham Ting, is entered from the river by a series of steps and can easily be seen in daylight. The higher cave, Tham Phum, is deeper and requires a torch for viewing. Continue to the former royal capital of Luang Prabang. This UNESCO World Heritage-listed city is a favourite of many travellers, sitting in the hills of northern Laos on the confluence of the Mekong and Khan rivers. The city is claimed to be ‘the best-preserved city in South East Asia’ by UNESCO. Stay in a hotel tonight and if you’re feeling energetic, maybe climb Mt Phousi for some sunset views. You can climb the 328 zigzag steps up to the sacred gilded stupa and big drum of the Phu Si Temple for a panoramic view of Luang Prabang and its surroundings."

      "description": "Once the heart and soul of the ancient Lao Kingdom (Lan Xang) and designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1995, Luang Prabang is endowed with a legacy of historic, red-roofed temples and French Indochinese architecture. Today, head to Kuang Si Falls – a multi-level cascade of bright blue pools. After a swim, visit a local social enterprise that supports and trains local women in weaving. Aiming to empower, while also preserving the traditional skill of making Laos textile, this enterprise will teach you about their work as you have a drink by Mekong River."

      "title": "Luang Prabang.",
      "description": "Rise with the sun this morning and witness a traditional alms giving ceremony. View the procession of saffron-robed monks on their daily outing collecting food offered by devotees (a practice that dates back centuries). The offerings must be collected early, as the monks cannot eat anything after midday. By giving food to a monk, it is believed you ‘het bon’ (make merit) which will be carried over into the next life. Your leader will guide you through the dos and don’ts and help you to take part. The rest of the day is yours to spend at leisure in this idyllic town."

      "description": "Take a high-speed train to Vang Vieng. Situated on the Nam Song River, Vang Vieng is surrounded by towering limestone karsts and is a great place to enjoy being surrounded by nature. After checking in to the hotel, use tonight to plan out your next few days with your group and leader."

      "title": "Vang Vieng.",
      "description": "There’s plenty to do in and around Vang Vieng, known as an adventure town thanks to its unique and varied surrounding country. The area is renowned for its caves, many of which are easily accessible from the town. Perhaps the most famous is the cave of Tham Chang – a beautiful cavern fed by a natural spring, making it a perfect spot for a swim. Hire bicycles to explore further afield, hike the trails to nearby lookout points, join a daytrip to go kayaking on the river, or visit an organic mulberry farm just outside town."

      "title": "Vientiane.",
      "description": "Continue by private minibus to the country's capital, Vientiane – possibly Asia's most laidback capital. Vientiane has a wealth of cultural delights to discover on foot, or by jumbo (tuk-tuk). Faded mansions, tree-lined boulevards and old temples create an atmosphere of timelessness, particularly in the older part of town along the Mekong River. Visit Wat Si Saket – the oldest temple still standing and home to almost 7000 Buddha images. Visit COPE visitors centre – an organisation dedicated to assisting those who have been injured by the multitude of unexploded ordinance across the country. This is an excellent cause and a chance to educate yourself about Laos' devastating war history as well as buy a snack or drink from their Karma Cafe. This evening, maybe join your fellow travellers for dinner and celebrate a trip well travelled."
