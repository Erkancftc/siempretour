      "title": "Chiang Rai – Surrounded by Lush Jungle",
      "description": "Chiang Rai is considered the capital of Northern Thailand, situated between mystical mountains and the rushing current of the Mekong River. Its proud history began in the 13th century under the Lao-Thai Lanna Kingdom, featured in the jade Buddha adorning the Phra Kaew Temple, a glistening icon modeled after the emerald Buddha that once filled the ceremonial halls of the Temple of the Bamboo Grove. Your flight lands at Chiang Rai International Airport, where your private transfer greets you upon your arrival. The aroma of fresh noodles emanates from the Night Market. The aisles fill with locals enjoying a stroll amongst the vendors offering candles, fresh cuisine, and handicrafts made by the hill tribe communities. Your luxury hotel offers you the first sense of Southeast Asia’s northern landscape, offering views of the rolling mountains and dense exotic jungles. Ruins of the Lanna Kingdom decorate the countryside on the outskirts of your accommodation bordering Chiang Rai. You return to the streets of the city with your guide for an introductory tour of the past and present splendors embodied in the various temples. The White Temple provides a glimpse into the new artistic movement meant to modernize the Lanna culture. The structure resembles an ice palace reflected in the stoic waters of the decorative pond. The décor fuses elements of orthodox Buddhist teachings with Westernized beliefs, such as the color white symbolizing purity and perfection. Ornate reliefs depict Buddhist legends and frame the glistening mirrors leading to the main chapel."

The marketplace fills with vendors showcasing lush spinach, crisp lettuce, and vibrant lychee. Your private transfer greets you at the hotel after breakfast and leads you over the Mekong River to reach the border of Laos. You enter the country at Huay Xai, where long riverboats glide down the waters of Southeast Asia’s largest river, extending from the Tibetan Plateau to the South China Sea. The cafes along the main road fill with the scent of cappuccinos and fresh-baked brioche, traditions carried over from the French colonial period. The façade of the French Fort Carnot continues to stand atop the hill overlooking the riverbanks and edges of town. Two towers flank the gateway where the decorative tiles of the antique structure have flaked away. Ruins of the ancient city of Souvannakhomkham rise out of the river bend seasoned with Buddha statues scattered across the fields. Flame trees blossom around the former stupas, providing lavish fiery colors to contrast the vast greenery. Continue into the hills to travel along the remarkable fields leading to the mountain splendor of Luang Namtha. The hills become steep, and the jungles grow thicker as you venture closer to the town. The air is crisp and cool as you pass villages with locals waving to you. The unbroken forest blankets the rolling fog in the distance."

Lotus and frangipanis blossom in the garden near the burgeoning rice paddies spreading to the foothills in the near distance. Your guide greets you after breakfast, eager to lead you on a full day hike through the lush landscape of Luang Namtha National Park. After a short ride into the countryside, your guide leads you onto the trail forging deep into the Nam Ha National Protected Area. The aroma of the moist bark and rich soil drifts through the trees. Thick ferns grow like fans from the earth and bamboo shades the underbrush from the sub-tropical sunlight. You can hear the twitter of the white-bellied redstart. Their temperate forest offers a perfect grazing and mating ground for the small bird. Your guide points to the royal blue bird resembling a nightingale, perched on a thin branch. In the cool temperature of the morning air, you have the best chance of finding traces of a clouded leopard, known for their dark gray fur with unique, blotch patterns. They can grow to nearly 45 inches long and prefer to rest in around strong tree limbs. Your guide points out various plants, explaining their traditional uses amongst local tribes for medicine or cooking, before finding a fresh elephant track in the soil."

Rice paddies radiate jade hues along an open plain. The iridescent forest canopy in the hills shimmers with dense greenery. Stop at a Black Tai village to meet with one of the 47 ethnic tribes living in the hills of Laos. The homes are built on stilts above a clearing, protecting the wooden base from flooding in the wet months and offering shade to the animals in the dry months. Chickens peck at the soil and cluck amongst meandering goats. The women greet you while wearing brightly hand-woven textiles, along with black headdresses. The intricate detail of the textiles glows against the bamboo slats supporting the walls. The clearing opens to a view of the rice fields and the road. You continue to Muang La to find a village set beside the Nam Pak River. Serene farms spread across the landscape, leading to traditional Khmu villages bordered by the familiar sight of dramatic mountains."

You journey into the treetops to travel along six lines reaching heights of nearly 215 feet above the forest floor. Your guide latches you to the line, and you soar through the jade leaves with the refreshing breeze brushing against your cheeks.

A jeweler displays detailed silverwork before reaching the decorated temples and shrines at the heart of the village. You meet a local distiller to learn how the local rice wine is crafted. The craftsmen process sticky rice, using air filtration inside steamed bamboo basket. They have yeast and let the results ferment for up to four weeks.
