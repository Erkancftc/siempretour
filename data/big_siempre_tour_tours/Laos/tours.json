    "generalInfo": "This Laos and Thailand budget tour is designed to showcase each country’s many highlights without being too expensive. But while this epic two-week small group trip might be light on the spending, it definitely doesn’t go light on the thrills, or the cultural discovery.<br/><br/>One of the main reasons to recommend a budget tour of Laos and Thailand is that the cultural side of things is brought to the fire throughout. You’ll travel by public transport several times, whether it be an overnight train from Bangkok to Chiang Mai, or the bus over the border to Laos, enabling you to meet local people on their own travels. And while there are plenty of fun activities included in the tour, you’ll also enjoy lots of free time when you can do your own thing and get a feel for local life in some diverse towns and cities.<br/><br/>Throughout this 14-day odyssey around two of Southeast Asia’s most popular destinations you’ll be able to tick off the must-do experiences. Wander the stalls of the famous night market, or get a Thai massage, in Chiang Mai. Visit a (responsibly managed) elephant sanctuary. Watch as the orange-robed monks make their morning procession to collect alms from the faithful in Luang Prabang. Spend a relaxing day cruising the mighty Mekong River. And visit the limestone caves of Vang Vieng, perhaps even doing a little river tubing too.<br/><br/>You’ll be accompanied by an expert tour leader at all times, there to ensure everything runs smoothly, and they’ll be complimented at some stops such as Bangkok and Vientiane by local guides, who will provide fascinating walking tours that really bring these cities, their architecture, history and culture to life far better than just flicking through a guidebook.<br/><br/>Small group tours are a fantastic way to see and experience this part of the world. They offer great value and convenience, but they’re also designed to provide authentic cultural experiences. Plus, of course, you have a readymade set of travel companions from diverse backgrounds – it’s far from unusual to make lifelong friends. <br/>",

The Tai-Lue and Nan people make most of their income through cotton weaving here as well, but in a different style to Thailand. Explore the local Buddhist temple and see the outskirts of Laos before continuing to Luang Prabang. When you arrive, head out on a leader-led orientation walk of ‘the best-preserved city in Southeast Asia’ (the local government started using this phrase, but it caught on for a reason). Tonight, you’ll hike up to Wat Phu Si for sunset. As the sun goes down, witness some epic views over Phu Si Mountain and then head to the Talad Mued Night Market for dinner. Enjoy a local BBQ feast (Sindad is the art of grilling meat on a hot pan – a type of traditional BBQ set on a charcoal stove that has a surrounding rim full of boiling water for blanching vegetables) and toast to a great night."

It’s a great opportunity to drift past unaged villages and learn about the slow ways of rural life – a real breather before your grand finish in neighbouring Thailand, where you’ll spend your last night in full-on Bangkok.",

Originally, crocodiles inhabited the moat and huge statues of 54 different gods protected each gate. The city contains another of Angkor's true gems - Bayon Temple. Although not as impressive as Angkor Wat from a distance, Bayon is nevertheless incredible for its maze of corridors, gothic style towers and magical central temples. We'll explore The Terrace of the Elephants and the Leper King, the Baphuon and Phimeanakas, and the 'Tomb Raider' temple of Ta Phrom which has been quite literally consumed by nature. We leave the best known and most breath taking of all the sights, Angkor Wat, to the end.

As we glide across the water, we visit one of the many fascinating floating villages - entire communities that live, work, and go to school on the lake itself. Here, we witness the rhythms of daily life as locals ply their trade, fishing, selling goods, and navigating the waterways that serve as their roads. For much of the year, the lake is surprisingly shallow - just a metre deep in some areas. But after the monsoon rains, the Mekong River reverses its flow, swelling the Tonle Sap by up to ten metres and flooding nearby forests and fields. This remarkable natural phenomenon creates one of the most fertile ecosystems in the world, providing vital breeding grounds for freshwater fish and sustaining the livelihoods of countless communities. After exploring the lake, we drive back to Siem Reap, where the afternoon is free for you to relax or continue your discoveries. You might like to visit the Apopo Visitor Centre, where specially trained HeroRATs detect landmines and tuberculosis. Here, you'll learn about Cambodia's landmine history, watch a live demonstration, and gain insight into ongoing humanitarian efforts. Alternatively, take an optional excursion to Banteay Srei, often called the 'Citadel of Women'.

The area of Doi Mea Salong has a strong Yunnan Chinese influence after a number of soldiers settled there in the 40s and 50s; we’ll find tea plantations, Chinese lanterns and signs and hear Yunnan dialects spoken by residents. We’ll head to a farm where we have the opportunity to take a chicken cage herbal sauna; these individual saunas involve a basket structure in which you sit covering all but your head. We then enjoy a cookery lesson, learning techniques of northern Thai cuisine and making delicious dishes with organic produce gathered from the farm. Well-fed and relaxed we’ll continue on to our accommodation on a tea plantation."

Cafes, restaurants, and hotels overlook the banks of the river and offer comforting shade beneath the lush jungle canopy. The French influence of the colonial era continues to abound in the form of renovated villas and pavement cafes while locals remain in touch with their ancient culture that is embodied in the Buddhist temple spires that emerge from the trees. On the outskirts of town, rice paddies overtake the countryside and line the roadways between the cities. Farmers wear conical hats to protect their face and neck from the sun as the landscape shimmers with emerald hues of the trees that rustle in the breeze along the riverfront. Your flight will land at Wattay International Airport, and your private transfer will greet you upon arrival and escort you to a hotel that offers an aristocratic ambiance of modern luxury mixed with French colonial flare. Take a moment to settle into the comforts of your lavish accommodation before meeting your guide in the lobby. Relish your introduction to the capital by embracing the traditional culture symbolized in the oldest temple of Vientiane, Wat Sisaket. The structure was the only temple to survive the Siamese-Lao war and dates back to the 19th century. The structures offer insight into Laotian-Buddhist architecture with thousands of miniature Buddha statues that decorate the colonnades and sanctuaries. The original statues located inside the niches were carved out of silver, but have since been replaced with clay figures. Murals inside the main prayer hall depict the fascinating tales of the Buddha’s past lives, and the cloister contains more than 6,800 Buddha images for an impressive array of serene faces and devout focus. In the evening, you can make your way to out into the city for a delightfully flavorful welcome to Laotian cuisine and find bright flavors, colorful ingredients, and a comfortable ambiance."

While the fish cooks, you will work together to craft the dressing for the salad and you mince the garlic and birds eye chili peppers together to make a paste.

Your private transfer will greet you at your hotel after breakfast and escort you north to Vang Vieng, a small town on the banks of the Nan Song River known for the surrounding majestic landscape. Stop at the ancient archeological site of Vang Xang en route to view the marvels of the preserved 11th-century statues.

For a day that blends relaxation and sightseeing, you can traverse the streets on your bike to enjoy the trails that meander outside the city. An engaging cycling route will lead you along the rocks to Kaeng Nyui Waterfall. The water moves through the jungle boulders until cascading down more than 110 feet into the waiting pool as the thundering sound echoes through the trees. The water resembles white beads in motion that tap against the rugged cliff face. Before returning to Vang Vieng, you can stop at the Blue Lagoon where the waters shimmer an unbelievable turquoise and offer a clean and refreshing dip beneath the emerald jungle canopy after riding through the countryside.

The ordination hall features a mosaic that depicts the Tree of Life, an intricate piece of art on the western wall. The temple held the coronations of Laotian kings before the invasion of the Siamese, and the gold leaf gilding and lacquering add flecks of radiance to the natural light that pours through the doorways. The aroma of sandalwood accompanies the glass montage that portrays the temple’s legendary founding as a funeral carriage inside the museum captures your eye, standing nearly 40 feet tall. After enjoying your exploration of the city, you will board a traditional Lao longboat to traverse the waters of the Mekong River. The mountains surrounding the serene city turn to karsts as the limestone cliffs frame the riverbanks as you reach the Pak Ou caves. The history of the caverns dates back more than two millennia between the upper and lower chambers. Your boat will dock, and you can ascend the stairs to enter into the cavern beneath the dangling stalactites.

Mirrors reflect the rich sheen of the Throne Hall, where the crown jewels stand on display. The majesty of the crown is surpassed only by the prestige of the Golden Buddha, which was brought from Sri Lanka in the 1st century AD. The icon was crafted out of more than 20 pounds of solid gold.

The falls reach nearly 70 feet at their highest point with rapids that stretch over six miles. The turquoise waters house the largest freshwater catfish in the world, which can reach a length of 10 feet. The sound of the cascades echoes like thunder in the open space of the vast river as the waters splash into the air and mist against the sandstone rocks. After taking it all in, you will continue to the airport in Pakse for your flight to Luang Prabang. The former Imperial city of Laos retains a sense of serene comfort cradled by the confluence of the Mekong and Nam Khan Rivers. 33 temple spires rise out of the trees in imitation of the mountain peaks that roll along the horizon. Your private transfer will greet you at Luang Prabang Airport and lead you to a stunning hotel that offers private views of the river bend, jungle canopy, and dramatic summits. Later on, set out into the quiet city with a guide keen to introduce you to the tangible majesty of the landscape.

The gilded scales of flanking dragons line the stairwell that leads to the peak as the scent of tamarind fades beneath the herbaceous aroma of incense lit from in the shrines. Soon, you will wander right to the 19th-century golden stupa of Wat Chomsi."

Exotic fruits, such as dragon fruit, bring an abundance of color. The stalls turn into a labyrinth of produce, from spinach to coriander, passion fruit to tomatoes. After breakfast and a wander of the market, you will venture into the jungle to visit the Elephant Village to meet some Asiatic elephants. The village was established in the early 2000s as a sanctuary to help protect and rehabilitate Laotian elephants. The Asian elephant grows to an average of nine feet tall around its shoulders, and they appear in the clearing through the trees, toppling over saplings and underbrush. You will soon climb aboard the elephant with the help of a staff member of the village and settle onto a seat around the elephant’s shoulders. The village no longer uses the howdah , a wooden box seat, which was known for chafing and hurting the elephant. You can touch the elephant’s thick, bristly hairs as they waddle through the forest. You can rub your fingers against the wrinkles on their skin as the elephant leads you down to the river. Children from the local village ride along the water on a shallow canoe and watch as the elephant steps to the bank, reaching closer to the water for a bath."

Long boats and ferries return to the current to travel downstream while restaurants in town serve fresh-baked baguettes and coffee from beans harvested in the highlands of Laos. Travel over the bridge with your guide to reach a traditional village in the morning, and the traditional wooden architecture frames the main unpaved road that leads to Wat Si Bun Yuen. The wooden roof was built in the early 19th century to protect the icon of Buddha. Murals wrap around the ceremonial hall that depicts lessons and legends of the great teacher that have been passed down through the generations. Continue to the village of Ban Bi Mi for insight into the traditional cotton weaving in the countryside, and then wander through the lanes between the wooden homes to find women working at their looms. They will weave the cotton into beautiful and vibrant textiles known for their elaborate, colorful embellishments. The villagers practice a combination of Buddhism and Animism, embodied in the small shrines located around the huts that are dedicated to the spirits of the river and the mountain."

        "title": "Chiang Rai – View the Golden Triangle with a Northern Thailand Excursion",
        "description": "The gorgeous city of Chiang Rai, Thailand touches the border of Laos and Myanmar, nestled into the bends of the Mekong and ridges of the dramatic mountains on the horizon. Rice patties and vegetable fields sweep across the flatlands and floodplains as limestone karsts rise in the west and reach over into eastern Laos. You will find the familiar saffron hues of monks’ robes decorating the street as Chiang Rai is considered the capital of the north, yet it retains a relaxed ambiance amidst the gorgeous landscape. The city was founded during the La-Thai Lanna Kingdom of the 13th century and remained an independent kingdom until the late 18th century. Your guide will meet you after a delightful breakfast of exotic fruits and fresh coffee, keen to introduce you to the treasures of the city as symbolized in the temple of Phra Kaew. Legend states that lightning hit the stupa in the 15th century to reveal the great emerald Buddha. A replica made of jade now decorates the interior of the temple and is surrounded by lush gardens and bamboo strands. After viewing the glistening treasure of northern Thailand, your guide will escort you to the fabulous panorama of the Golden Triangle, the meeting point between Laos, Thailand, and Myanmar along the confluence of the Mekong and Ruak Rivers. A stunning gilded Buddha statue reflects the name of the Golden Triangle and glistens in the sunlight atop a treasure ship shaped like a serpent."

        "description": "The aroma of clay emanates from the tranquil doorway of the pottery studio in Doy Din Daeng as the morning rises. Adobe huts house artists working in private galleries to craft decorative pieces and the scent of rich coffee drifts through the store of Doi Chang, named after the mountain on which Thailand’s top-quality Arabica coffee beans are cultivated. The ornate reliefs in Wat Klang Wiang shine at the heart of the city’s traditional religious houses with customary Lanna architectural style while gilded filigree contrasts with the crimson façade as the elephant regalia guards the octagonal base on all sides. Your private transfer will greet you at your hotel when you are ready, and escort you to Chiang Rai International Airport for your flight home."
