  "generalInfo": "A celebration of tradition, community, and the vast open landscapes that define Mongolia, this small-group journey offers a grounded introduction to the realities of contemporary life — going beyond familiar stereotypes.<br/><br/>Combining Naadam with time in Ulaanbaatar (Mongolia's capital city), the Gobi Desert, and the central heartland, you’ll experience Mongolia as it is today: the energy of the capital, small-town life, centuries-old monasteries, protected landscapes, and insight into rural livelihoods through ger stays with communities we have worked alongside for many years.<br/><br/>Designed for curious travellers seeking a thoughtful introduction to Mongolia, this journey lays the foundations for deeper understanding, connection, and respect for a country shaped as much by change as by tradition.<br/><br/>We are a small, Mongolian-registered company &amp; intentionally limit our scale to fewer than 200 bookings per year. Responsible tourism shapes how our trips are planned &amp; delivered, rather than sitting alongside them.<br/><br/>Our approach prioritises long-term relationships &amp; meaningful employment. We invest directly in our own operations &amp; in intergenerational, gender-mixed teams, including a free training programme for Mongolian women seeking to work in tourism. All of our trip assistants are Mongolian women, bringing local knowledge, lived experience, &amp; perspective to each journey. Our drivers &amp; trip assistants are employed year-round, providing stable income that supports extended families.<br/><br/>Every itinerary we run is designed to strengthen skills within our team while ensuring tangible, lasting benefits for the communities we partner with. This forms part of what we call our bigger travel philosophy — one that you as our guest becomes part of simply by joining the journey.<br/><br/>Who This Experience Is For<br/><br/>This journey suits curious, open-minded travellers — whether travelling solo, as a couple, or with friends — who value relationships, context, and everyday life, &amp; who appreciate small group sizes (a maximum of six) for a more genuine experience. Accommodation is simple &amp; shared, travel days can be long — a natural part of moving through a vast country with limited infrastructure — and plans may shift in response to weather and local conditions.<br/><br/>You don’t need to be especially fit, but you should have a flexible mindset &amp; be comfortable walking on uneven ground, spending extended time outdoors, and managing cold conditions with appropriate layers. Daily life involves getting in and out of vehicles, using outdoor toilets, and sharing space with others. <br/><br/>Accessibility considerations<br/><br/>Our small-group journeys are designed around seasonal conditions, rural infrastructure, and traditional celebrations. Depending on your access needs, this experience may or may not be suitable. We encourage you to get in touch with any specific questions so we can advise openly.",
