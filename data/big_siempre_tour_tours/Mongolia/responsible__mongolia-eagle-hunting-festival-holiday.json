  "generalInfo": "This eagle hunting festival holiday in Mongolia is a chance to witness the ancient art of hunting with eagles, practiced by the Kazakh people of western Mongolia. Travel to Sagsai, in the shadow of the lofty Altai Mountains, to enjoy the annual Golden Eagle Festival and spend time with a local Eagle Master and his family. <br/><br/>This is a 13 day small group tour, with plenty of time either side of the festival to discover Mongolia’s wonderful nomadic hospitality and vast landscapes. The adventure begins in the capital Ulaanbaatar, before travelling deep into the wilderness in the west of the country. This is land populated by Kazakhs – rich in history, natural beauty and traditional culture. See the ancient petroglyphs in Tavan Bogd National Park and soak up the vast landscapes, punctuated with lakes, glaciers and waterfalls. We can enjoy some hiking to hopefully spot snow leopards living in this remote wilderness, and can experience the vast steppe as a true Mongolia does – on horseback. We have a full two days at the Eagle Festival – ample time to enjoy this exciting and deeply traditional nomadic spectacle. Accommodation once outside Ulaanbaatar is in a mixture of log cabins and ger camps and we will use a mix of minibuses, 4WD vehicles and domestic flights to get around.<br/>",

      "description": "Lake Dayan: Today we will learn about our host's fascinating tradition of hunting with his golden eagle. There are an estimated 250 eagle hunters living in the region that still hunt with eagles to this day. The females tend to be the birds of choice as they are bigger and more aggressive than the males. Eagles can live up to 50 years, but hunters tend to keep them for around ten years before releasing them back into the wild. This is a great opportunity to delve deeper into these traditions and also get involved with other daily activities, herding and corralling animals, milking goats and sheep, and other daily nomadic tasks that need doing."
