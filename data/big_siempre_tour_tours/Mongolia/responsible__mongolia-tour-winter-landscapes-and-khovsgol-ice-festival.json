  "generalInfo": "Step into the frozen silence of Khövsgöl Nuur National Park on this slow-travel, small-group winter adventure—an immersive journey into northern Mongolia shared with the Tsaatan reindeer herders and the Darkhad, who call this remote landscape home.<br/><br/>This is Mongolia’s ultimate winter road trip — a cross-country expedition to and through Khövsgöl Province, where sacred mountains, forests, and sweeping valleys shape both the land and its people. Home to Tsagaannuur and the distant taiga forests where the Tsaatan live, as well as to the Darkhad communities of the lake’s western shores, this region is as culturally significant as it is visually striking.<br/><br/>Though Khövsgöl Lake is a central feature, the spirit of this journey lies in the travel itself. Journeying overland from Ulaanbaatar to the taiga encourages a deeper understanding of Mongolia’s sheer scale and diversity—its landscapes changing from high-altitude passes to deep river gorges, open steppe to solid ice. Along the way, you’ll encounter a cross-section of Mongolian life, gaining insight into how urban and rural worlds coexist and how strong cultural ties link communities across this vast terrain.<br/><br/>During the experience, you’ll spend three days living alongside the Tsaatan, gaining a respectful insight into their way of life. Then, travel across the vast, frozen surface of Khövsgöl Lake—reverently known as “Dalai Ej” or “Mother Sea”—with Baasanchuluun and his fellow Darkhad companions. Skilled in traditional sleigh-making, these winter herders will guide you on a three-day journey by horse-drawn sleigh, allowing you to experience their way of winter travel—quiet, deliberate, and deeply rooted in the rhythms of the land.<br/><br/>The adventure concludes at the annual Ice Festival, a colourful celebration of local culture held on the icy expanse of the lake itself. With games, performances, and community pride on display, it offers a joyful contrast to the solitude of the taiga and the lake crossing.<br/><br/>This trip is built on personal friendships cultivated over two decades, allowing you to engage meaningfully with the families you meet, providing them with long-term employment opportunities while respecting their way of life. It’s not just about witnessing the beauty of Mongolia; it’s about connecting with its people, culture, and diverse landscapes, ensuring a rich and genuine experience that will stay with you long after your journey ends.",

      "description": "ULAANBAATAR: Final arrival day into Ulaanbaatar - Ulaanbaatar maintains a strong Mongolian identity of its own and has a ‘frontier’ feel and vibrancy. It is a city well-worth exploring and, for those interested, we include our 'Intro To Ulaanbaatar' experience for a more local introduction. In the evening you will transfer to the train station with your trip assistant for the local overnight train to Erdenet, sleeping in four bed compartments."

      "description": "NORTHERN MONGOLIA - Road trip to Murun: Meet your team of local drivers in Erdenet, when you arrive off the night train before you settle back for a road trip to Murun. Once you arrive in Murun, the provincial capital of Khovsgol Aimag, you'll find a lively town that bears the hallmarks of a trading outpost near the Russian Siberian border. Slightly wild and rough around the edges, Murun's charm lies in its unique atmosphere, particularly at the bustling central market where you can soak in the vibrant local culture. Speak to your trip assistant about visiting the local market, hopefully they can fit it into the schedule."

      "description": "Road trip to Tsagaannuur: Tsagaannuur in Khovsgol is often overlooked by travellers who are more eager to venture out and meet the Tsaatan reindeer herders in the remote taiga. However, this small, seemingly unremarkable community plays a vital role in the Tsaatan's way of life—it’s where they shop for supplies, send their children to school, and handle necessary paperwork. To dismiss Tsagaannuur as inauthentic is to selectively decide what aspects of the Tsaatan’s life or culture are worth experiencing."

      "description": "With The Tsaatan reindeer herders: You will travel to and spend time living within the Tsaatan reindeer herder community. The Tsaatan, also known as the Dukha, are Mongolia's smallest ethnic minority, with their community split between two main regions known as the East and West Taiga. Though these areas are geographically distinct, the Tsaatan in both regions share deep kinship ties and are part of a unified community. Mongolians, including the Tsaatan, are known for their adaptability, a crucial trait in the face of the climate emergency. This adaptability also means that we cannot specify in advance which Tsaatan family you will stay with or where they will be located, as their movements depend on seasonal and environmental factors. Tthe exact route to and from the taiga will be determined by the location of the Tsaatan families at the time. Flexibility is essential, as conditions on the ground change daily and will influence the trek's path. It might be by vehicle, on foot or a short journey on horseback. It might involve two of these or even all three. The Tsaatan are not an undiscovered tribe and you will not be the first or last person they have hosted. They are a modern people who have welcomed visitors from all over the world, and confront many of the same challenges as the rest of the modern world, including the need to earn an adequate income. Upon arrival, you will find that Tsaatan life does not conform to rigid plans or schedules. Instead, you will be immersed in the everyday life of a local family, becoming part of their world and experiencing their way of life as it naturally unfolds."

      "description": "KHOVSGOL NUUR NATIONAL PARK - Khatgal: Travel to the small rural community of Khatgal - located on the southern shore of Khovsgol Nuur. At Khatgal you will be hosted by the Basaanchuluu (Bambakh) - a modern ‘malchin’ (herder) in the region. As is common, he has a winter home within the town of Khatgal itself and this is where you will stay - in his wooden house within the hasha - a typical fenced compound that belongs to each extended family. It will be a late evening arrival and, realistically you will just want to relax."

      "description": "KHOVSGOL NUUR HORSE SLEIGH EXPEDITION: Explore the frozen surface of Khovsgol Lake - the area of water that dominated Khovsgol Nuur National Park - Dalai Ej - Mother Sea to Mongolians. It is a spiritual place for Mongolians and its natural beauty makes it a stunning location to take a little time out. Khovsgol is 126km in length and represents roughly 70% of Mongolia’s freshwater and is the younger sister to Lake Baikal in Siberia and part of the same Rift System. If the sky is clear, you can stand on the shoreline and see the snowcapped Sayan Mountains - the border with Siberia. It is truly spectacular. We focus on community-based tourism – working directly with local people, rural families and communities – slowly building up relationships with them. Low season in Mongolia is brutally long – from the end of October almost up until the beginning of May. As part of our long-term support, we look at ways in which we can continue to provide support to the families and communities we work with even during this low period and thus created our horse sleigh expedition. Together with his brother Lokh and their childhood friend Zorgio, Bambakh & co have hand-built horse sleighs in the local tradition – sleighs are a common form of transport for the Darkhad at Khovsgol in the winter months. These are the sleighs we use for our Mongolia horse sleigh expeditions on Khovsgol – with Bambakh, Lokh and Zorgio driving the sleighs. It is their local knowledge that guide and lead our trips. We insulate the horse sleigh with our hand made traditional goatskin blankets. We also provide you with your own hand made full-length goat skin del (traditional Mongolian coat) and a pair of Mongolian felt boots. Lunches are taken always with a small campfire. Having these picnic lunches allows us to explore the sandy beaches, rocky shorelines, forested coves and the small cliffs that can be found alongside the lake."

      "description": "KHOVSGOL ICE FESTIVAL: Enjoy the Khovsgol Ice Festival, held in Khatgal to boost tourism outside the main tourist season. This festival celebrates the unique features of the region and is marked by significant local involvement. Unlike typical tourist-oriented festivals, this event feels like a genuine celebration for the locals, by the locals, with Mongolian spectators proudly donning their best winter deels. Please note that domestic and international tourism numbers to the event have increased in the last few years. Don’t expect a rigid schedule of events; the festival is more about community celebration, networking, and collaboration for the future of the region and its herding communities. Yes, there are activities and competitions throughout the two days, but the atmosphere is relaxed and festive. So, ditch your watch, bundle up, and enjoy the experience. Use the EL van as a base to warm up when needed, and immerse yourself in the festive spirit, which includes Ice Sumo, tug-of-war, ice sculpting, an ice-driving rally, and ice skating. The festival also usually features a shamanist ceremony and a musical concert."

Then head to Amarbayasgalant Monastery which is situated in a haven of rugged beauty in the cul-de-sac of a long, deep valley backed by Mount Buren-Khaan against which the monastery is built. The valley is well-watered by the Iver River and has long provided an essential water source for nomadic herders and their livestock. Be sure to consult your trip assistant about what you want to do at the monastery site and they’ll be able to help you."
