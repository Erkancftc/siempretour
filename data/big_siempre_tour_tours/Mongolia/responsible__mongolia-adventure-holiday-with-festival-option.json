  "generalInfo": "Vast landscapes and seemingly endless space are the unforgettable hallmarks of this Mongolia adventure holiday, that celebrates the diversity of Mongolia's landscapes. Spend 23 days here, exploring the dramatic Gobi Desert, the central grasslands, and the lakeland regions of northern Mongolia, Lake Khovsgol. The June departure includes the national Naadam Festival in Ulaanbaatar.<br/><br/>Many holidays to Mongolia include domestic flights, but these inevitably involve time spent queuing and boarding, and the risk of delayed flights. So instead, this holiday travels overland as the ultimate road trip combined with a camel trek, wild camping, day hikes and living alongside Mongolia’s herders that we work in long-term local community partnership with. Join our Untamed Mongolia for an introduction to the real 21st Century Mongolia - its diversity of landscapes, its people and its way of life. Exploring Mongolia in this unrushed way gives you the chance to see real-life, without ever feeling as though you’re intruding. It’s a relaxed, unhurried way to experience the real 21st Century Mongolia. It’s time to explore this huge country, but also time to slow down, think and unwind as you let the journey unfold.<br/><br/>This is a small group trip (but can be run as a private departure), for between two and six people – a number kept deliberately low to ensure a personal experience for both travellers and a positive, supportive experience for the local people that host you. This holiday is run by a very small independent business consisting of one westerner and a small Mongolian team. It’s based in Mongolia and was set up nearly two decades ago. Each holiday is designed and run by us and we work closely with local people to create personal, unique experiences. Our itineraries are diverse, flexible and designed to give you an authentic introduction to Mongolia. We don’t follow the typical stereotypes of a tour company either. We have nothing to do with big groups, must-sees or all-inclusive packages.",

By-passed by most companies for the more famous ‘southern Gobi’, Baga Gazriin Chuluu is so much more than just the rock formations. The underground springs provide a water source and as a result, Baga Gazriin Chuluu is rich in history as well as the herding culture. Wild Camping"

      "description": "Khongoryn Els (Singing Sands) & 2-day Camel Trek - For centuries, up until the 1920s, the Gobi was traversed by camel caravans – mainly on the trade route between Urga (UB) and Beijing. We still think this is one of the best ways to experience the Gobi and it is a journey well worth the effort and the sense of peace you will experience amongst the dune landscapes is one rarely found in everyday life. The trek is designed for two days/one night. There will always be time for climbing and exploring the dunes. Your ger accommodation at Khongoryn Els is a short drive to the base of the dramatic sand dunes. These are Mongolia’s highest dunes with the range stretching over 180km - known locally as Duut Mankhan - the singing sands. Mongolians say the Gobi consists of 33 different types of desert but only 3% is sand dunes. Khongoryn Els dunes make up a large proportion of that percentage."

Bayanzag means ‘Rich in Saxauls’ and the name shows what is important for the Mongolian people – not the red sandstone cliffs named the ‘Flaming Cliffs’ by Roy Chapman Andrews but the small desert shrub that is nurtured by the rare outwash from the surrounding gullies. En-route, visit the spectacular Khavtsgait rock petroglyphs en-route to the Flaming Cliffs. The petroglyphs show the culture, art and religious beliefs of the Bronze Age people who lived in the Mongolian Gobi and its neighbouring areas starting about 4000 years ago. The views are stunning"

Stunning views from the 108 Steps Temple."

It is a spiritual place for Mongolians and its natural beauty makes it a stunning location to take a little time out. Khovsgol is 126km in length and represents roughly 70% of Mongolia’s freshwater and is the younger sister to Lake Baikal in Siberia and part of the same Rift System. If the sky is clear, you can stand on the shoreline and see the snowcapped Sayan Mountains - the border with Siberia. It is truly spectacular."

Uran Togoo - Tulga Uul is a national protected area consisting of the extinct volcanoes of Uran Togoo, Tulga, Togoo, and Jalavch Uul.

They are part of the Khanuy-Gol Volcanic Field which has 10 cones with heights of 30–190 metres. Stay in Bulgan overnight. For the June 20th departure, on this day (July 10th) you attend the Naadam horse racing event located 40km outside of Ulaanbaatar."
