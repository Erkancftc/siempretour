      "description": "Altai Tavan Bogd and Eagle Hunter Ger Stay: Altai Tavan Bogd National Park offers majestic views of the snowcapped peaks along the Mongolian and Russian border, where two vast glaciers wind their way into a dramatic valley and give birth to the milky river that stretches across the open steppe. Within this landscape lies President Avoo, one of the nine most sacred sites in Mongolia. Travellers traditionally walk around it three times, placing small stones on the cairn and leaving their own heartfelt offerings. Our support vehicles will take us to the summit where we will pause to enjoy lunch surrounded by outstanding natural beauty. In the afternoon we will continue our journey with a scenic drive to Sagsai, where we will spend our first of two evenings with our host Kazakh Mongolian eagle hunter family beside the beautiful river. This will be a special opportunity to share time together and gain a deeper insight into this remarkable tradition. Transfer time 4-5 hours"

      "description": "Eagle hunter family: You will wake to a full day immersed in the life of your host Kazakh Mongolian eagle hunter family. Today offers a rare chance to step into this centuries old tradition and gain a true appreciation of the deep bond between hunter and bird. The day will be spent enjoying the eagle hunting experience, meeting the hunters and learning about the training and dedication involved in raising and working with these magnificent golden eagles. You will then saddle up for a horseback ride into the nearby mountains, where you can witness the skill of the hunters in action and even try hunting with the eagle yourself under careful guidance. It is an extraordinary cultural encounter and a memorable way to prepare for the excitement and celebrations of the festival days ahead. In late afternoon you will head back to Ulgii town."

      "description": "First day of the Eagle Festival: Archaelogists trace falconry in Central Asia back to the first or 2nd millennium BC. Sagsai Golden Eagle Festival is a collaboration between two Tour Operators and local Kazakh eagle hunters eager to show off their prowess. The festival is dedicated to photographers and filmmakers who focus on capturing action and cultural traditions. This morning we head to the Festival opening, where competitors parade, showing off their costumes and hunting techniques. We will watch how a Kazak Ger (yurt) is assembled and learn about the migration of nomadic families. The festival is a fantastic example of how tourism can benefit local communities - raising awareness of eagle hunting in Mongolia and abroad, and encouraging the continuation of the hunting traditions. In 2011, eagle hunting was added to the 'UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity' as an example of 'living human heritage'. We return to Uglii for our accommodation tonight."

When the competitions begin, the eagles chase fox skins, dragged by their owners on horseback, and are judged on their speed and gripping ability. Other events include Tenge-llu (coin grabbing while riding a horse), the best costume competition, Tug of war (Kokbar) and Kizkhuar, which is a traditional Khazak Couples Game). The winners of the festival will be announced this afternoon and we will be able to join the festivities and celebrations. Dinner will be in Ulgii town."
