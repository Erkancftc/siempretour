This Genghis Khan warrior training holiday takes you back in time to Khan’s Mongolia, first through the museums of the capital which reveal the traditional dress of various ethnic groups as well as the country’s military history – and then out into the steppe where your warrior training will begin.<br/><br/>Dressed in your own, tailormade ‘del’ overcoat you’ll undergo three days of Genghis Khan warrior training in Mongolia – including how to make and shoot a bow and arrow (while standing and on horseback); how to herd, ride and lasso a horse; how to cook traditional Mongolian dishes; and how to tie many useful knots. You’ll also learn Mongolian wrestling techniques, how to light a number of fires in one go to confuse your enemy, and to prepare your weaponry. Throughout the trip you will be staying in traditional felt ger tents, well designed for the nomadic lifestyle of the Mongolian warrior, and an incredible way to immerse yourself in life on the steppe.<br/><br/>The lifestyle of the warriors was simple yet extremely well organised, which enabled them to travel great distances. The Mongol Empire was criss-crossed with a network of ‘urtuuns’ – the distance that could be ridden in a day between camps. This impressive infrastructure, dating back over eight centuries, meant that messages would take just two weeks to be delivered from as far away as the Black Sea. Genghis Khan’s warriors may be no more – but many rural Mongolians still lead nomadic or semi nomadic lifestyles in the grasslands, and on this holiday you’ll meet families whose ways of life have changed little in centuries, as they move with their herds in search of fresh grazing grounds. Joined by an interpreter, you’ll learn how Mongolians survive in this seemingly harsh yet beautiful landscape; sample the infamous fermented mare’s milk known as koumiss; and Mongolian milk vodka. Sit around the campfire in the clear evenings, overlooked by millions of stars, and listen to the legends and folklore of the nomads – this holiday is not one that will be quickly forgotten.",

Unfortunately these were destroyed during Soviet times however in 2004 a new, smaller temple was completed. The location is spectacular, nestled amongst the Gobi mountains."

A great introduction to the country, this comprehensive trip shows you the incredible diversity to be found within its borders. Starting in Ulaan Baatar we visit the impressive Gandan Monastery, testimony to the strong Buddhist traditions that Communism never managed to completely suppress. From here we head south which brings a striking change of scenery as we venture into the Gobi Desert, Asia’s largest. Some of its most striking sights are the ‘flaming cliffs’ of Bayanzag and the canyon of Yolyn Am, a reminder of the sheer variety of desert landscapes, and as well as these we spend time looking for the Gobi’s rare and unique wildlife.<br/><br/>Moving on from the desert, we travel through the central rolling steppe, stopping at the monastery of Erdene Zuu and visiting the remains of Genghis Khan’s old capital at Karakorum. We spend time hiking among the sacred mountains and secluded valleys of Khogno Khan, where ruined monasteries and breathtaking vistas beg to be discovered.<br/><br/>All throughout the trip we take as much time as possible to meet the people of Mongolia, from camel herders in the Gobi to the yak herders of the steppe, to gain as much insight into the country as possible. Mongolia is one of Asia’s hidden gems, a land of endless horizons and some of the most breathtaking scenery you’re ever likely to see. None who visit fail to be impressed.",

This cultural adventure offers a rare chance to live alongside rural Mongolian families, observing daily life and gaining a genuine understanding of herding culture.<br/><br/>In spring, as the snows melt and the land awakens, the season of new life begins. Calves, foals and kids are born, and herders are at their busiest. Join local families at this productive time of year, learning about the rhythms of their work and the resilience of nomadic life. You’ll meet different generations – from families who move several times a year with their herds, to older couples living quietly with a few animals – each sharing their own story of life on the steppe.<br/><br/>This is a deliberately small-scale trip, designed for two to six people, to ensure a personal and respectful experience. Nothing is staged; instead, you’ll be welcomed into homes as daily life unfolds around you. The pace is unhurried, allowing you to absorb Mongolia’s vast spring landscapes while hosts continue with their work, offering you space to observe and engage naturally.<br/><br/>This journey is for curious, open-minded travellers of all ages – whether you’re joining solo, with a partner, or with friends. You don’t need to be especially fit, as the trip isn’t physically demanding, but you should be comfortable with a range of temperatures, including the cold. More important than fitness is a flexible attitude and a willingness to step into daily life as it naturally unfolds.<br/>Accommodation is simple and shared, with guest gers provided by each host family. Facilities are basic: outside squat or long-drop toilets, and showers available every two to four days. If you’re content living without modern conveniences, and excited by the chance to connect meaningfully with local families in a genuine way, then this experience is for you.<br/><br/>The holiday is run by a small, independent business that has been based in Mongolia for nearly 20 years. With a dedicated local team and a long-standing commitment to working in genuine partnership with herding families, the company crafts flexible and thoughtful itineraries that prioritise authenticity, cultural connection, and responsible tourism.",

It has an eclectic mix of wildlife from horses to two humped camels.  Then onto to seriously off road desert, where we can see Ikh Bogd Mountain, the Gobi’s highest peak and part of the Gobi Altai Mountain range.  And for the ultimate dune experience, we visit the ‘Singing Dunes’ or Khongoriin Els, the largest of their kind in Mongolia. And finally, more of the Gobi’s mountainous terrain in Gobi Gurvansaikhan National Park, where you have cliffs, chasms, sand, salt pans - the gamut of Gobi gorgeousness in fact. <br/><br/>These are just a few of Mongolia’s treats in store on this two week immersion into the country’s culture and landscapes. More urban highlights include a day in the cosmopolitan chaos that is Ulaan Baatar, with juxtaposed cultures that commemorate the revolutionary past, celebrate the Buddhist traditions of the country at Gandan monastery, and also demonstrate the city’s ever growing modern day development. In contrast, and much older, we visit Karakorum which was the13th century capital of the Mongol Empire, with its remnants of ancient stupas and a fascinating modern museum. <br/><br/>This trip also includes a visit to the famous Nadaam Festival during July, making the itinerary two days longer at that time, but giving guests the chance to enjoy this traditional celebration, also known as the  \" three games of men\" , where prized titles for Mongolian wrestling, horse racing and archery are competed for.  <br/><br/>",

Here we may see monks praying and a 65ft (20m) tall gold-and-bronze statue of Migjid Janraisig. We then drive on the main road westwards towards Karakorum, making a detour to Khustain Nuruu National Park, two hours west of Ulaanbaatar. Khustain Nuruu is famous for the re-introduction of Mongolia’s wild horse. The Przewalski’s horse (also known as the takhi horse) is native and almost became extinct earlier in the 20th century. Through the efforts of several Mongolian and international organisations, these magnificent wild horses now roam in the steppes of the national park once again. We visit the Project Information Centre and take a guided hike to see the wild horses. Tonight is our first night staying in gers, traditional Mongolian felt tents. Accommodation: Ger camp"

Spend 23 days here, exploring the dramatic Gobi Desert, the central grasslands, and the lakeland regions of northern Mongolia, Lake Khovsgol. The June departure includes the national Naadam Festival in Ulaanbaatar.<br/><br/>Many holidays to Mongolia include domestic flights, but these inevitably involve time spent queuing and boarding, and the risk of delayed flights. So instead, this holiday travels overland as the ultimate road trip combined with a camel trek, wild camping, day hikes and living alongside Mongolia’s herders that we work in long-term local community partnership with. Join our Untamed Mongolia for an introduction to the real 21st Century Mongolia - its diversity of landscapes, its people and its way of life. Exploring Mongolia in this unrushed way gives you the chance to see real-life, without ever feeling as though you’re intruding. It’s a relaxed, unhurried way to experience the real 21st Century Mongolia. It’s time to explore this huge country, but also time to slow down, think and unwind as you let the journey unfold.<br/><br/>This is a small group trip (but can be run as a private departure), for between two and six people – a number kept deliberately low to ensure a personal experience for both travellers and a positive, supportive experience for the local people that host you. This holiday is run by a very small independent business consisting of one westerner and a small Mongolian team. It’s based in Mongolia and was set up nearly two decades ago. Each holiday is designed and run by us and we work closely with local people to create personal, unique experiences. Our itineraries are diverse, flexible and designed to give you an authentic introduction to Mongolia. We don’t follow the typical stereotypes of a tour company either. We have nothing to do with big groups, must-sees or all-inclusive packages.",

We still think this is one of the best ways to experience the Gobi and it is a journey well worth the effort and the sense of peace you will experience amongst the dune landscapes is one rarely found in everyday life. The trek is designed for two days/one night. There will always be time for climbing and exploring the dunes. Your ger accommodation at Khongoryn Els is a short drive to the base of the dramatic sand dunes. These are Mongolia’s highest dunes with the range stretching over 180km - known locally as Duut Mankhan - the singing sands. Mongolians say the Gobi consists of 33 different types of desert but only 3% is sand dunes. Khongoryn Els dunes make up a large proportion of that percentage."

Travel to Sagsai, in the shadow of the lofty Altai Mountains, to enjoy the annual Golden Eagle Festival and spend time with a local Eagle Master and his family. <br/><br/>This is a 13 day small group tour, with plenty of time either side of the festival to discover Mongolia’s wonderful nomadic hospitality and vast landscapes. The adventure begins in the capital Ulaanbaatar, before travelling deep into the wilderness in the west of the country. This is land populated by Kazakhs – rich in history, natural beauty and traditional culture. See the ancient petroglyphs in Tavan Bogd National Park and soak up the vast landscapes, punctuated with lakes, glaciers and waterfalls. We can enjoy some hiking to hopefully spot snow leopards living in this remote wilderness, and can experience the vast steppe as a true Mongolia does – on horseback. We have a full two days at the Eagle Festival – ample time to enjoy this exciting and deeply traditional nomadic spectacle. Accommodation once outside Ulaanbaatar is in a mixture of log cabins and ger camps and we will use a mix of minibuses, 4WD vehicles and domestic flights to get around.<br/>",

From here, your journey begins. And it is a journey. The trip includes extensive travelling in some remote terrain away from modern facilities and conveniences. It’s a chance to explore a fascinating country ‘road-trip’ style, taking in the scenery as you go and enjoying the ride (however long it takes to get there!).<br/><br/>Experienced drivers, manning sturdy Russian vans fit to tackle the rugged environment, will take you to some of the most fascinating places in the country, from the rolling dunes just outside of Karakorum (where you can take a camel ride), to the volcanic craters of the Great White Lake among the mountains. Visit Lake Khovsgol, set amid stunning fir forests, lush green grasslands and meadows peppered with wildflowers. Then in the valley of the Delger River, relax at the Tsenkher Hot Springs, the perfect place to unwind after a long journey.<br/><br/>Accommodation is mostly in tourist ger camps once outside of Ulaanbaatar, but there are also two stays with local families, so you can live nomadic life from the inside – a rare and rewarding cultural experience to remember. Mongolia is a far-out destination, but you'll be in excellent hands, with local drivers and a guide bringing the country to life with tell tales of its legendary leader Genghis Khan.<br/>",

Your final destination today is Mongolia's second most important place of worship (after Gandan Monastery in UB), situated in the beautiful Iven Gol River valley, at the foot of Burengiin Mountain, in the Selenge province. After seeing the monastery, you will get your first taste of life in a ger at the first camp of the trip. This is the way that the majority of Mongolia's population has always lived – away from the city and in the wide open spaces of seemingly endless countryside. It's the quintessential Mongolian experience. Although such camps are set up for visitors, this type of housing is still used around the country, even in the capital where you will have seen many 'ger suburbs' surrounding the city centre. Our drivers and leader also often double as our cooks in those places where we prepare meals ourselves. You are always welcome to lend a hand too! We share our meals together in the dining quarters. Vegetarians can be catered for although choices may be limited - please let us know if you have any specific dietary requirements at time of booking. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are provided each day until our return to Ulaanbaatar. Some food will be traditional Mongolian style but as the traditional diet consists solely of meat and dairy products, most meals are less challenging and based more on Russian or Western meals which are now also common in the Mongolian diet."

This journey offers the opportunity to spend the festival alongside rural families with whom we have worked closely for nearly two decades, sharing daily life during a time that holds genuine importance for our hosts.<br/><br/>Travelling through Mongolia’s winter landscape at an unhurried pace, the journey creates space to observe how tradition and contemporary life coexist, while exploring the country’s cultural and geographic diversity. Time is spent in small towns as well as with herding families whose lives continue to be shaped by a close relationship with the land, offering a view of Mongolia grounded in lived experience rather than stereotype. This winter journey connects travellers with Mongolia as it is lived today, through the people who call it home.<br/><br/>We are a small, Mongolian-registered company and intentionally limit our scale to fewer than 200 bookings per year. Responsible tourism shapes how our trips are planned and delivered, rather than sitting alongside them.<br/><br/>Our approach prioritises long-term relationships and meaningful employment. We invest directly in our own operations and in intergenerational, gender-mixed teams, including a free training programme for Mongolian women seeking to work in tourism. All of our trip assistants are Mongolian women, bringing local knowledge, lived experience, and perspective to each journey. Our drivers and trip assistants are employed year-round, providing stable income that supports extended families.<br/><br/>Every itinerary we run is designed to strengthen skills within our team while ensuring tangible, lasting benefits for the communities we partner with. This forms part of what we call our bigger travel philosophy — one that you as our guest becomes part of simply by joining the journey.<br/><br/>Who This Experience Is For<br/><br/>This journey suits curious, open-minded travellers — whether travelling solo, as a couple, or with friends — who value relationships, context, and everyday life, and who appreciate small group sizes (a maximum of six) for a more genuine experience. Accommodation is simple and shared, travel days can be long — a natural part of moving through a vast country with limited infrastructure — and plans may shift in response to weather and local conditions.<br/><br/>You don’t need to be especially fit, but you should have a flexible mindset &amp; be comfortable walking on uneven ground, spending extended time outdoors, and managing cold conditions with appropriate layers. Daily life involves getting in and out of vehicles, using outdoor toilets, and sharing space with others. <br/><br/>Accessibility considerations<br/><br/>Our small-group journeys are designed around seasonal conditions, rural infrastructure, and traditional celebrations. Depending on your access needs, this experience may or may not be suitable. We encourage you to get in touch with any specific questions so we can advise openly.",

Though far from the sea, it offers a clear window into everyday life in rural Mongolia. This is a close-knit, traditional community where seasonal rhythms and family ties continue to shape daily life, and where we return regularly as part of long-standing local partnerships. Erdenedalai becomes one of our bases for this journey precisely because it allows time to slow down, stay in one place, and take part in life as it unfolds. Here you will celebrate both Bituun (Tsagaan Sar eve) and Shiniin Negiin (New Year’s Day) with your host family. Bituun – New Year’s Eve: Bituun translates as “to close down.” On arrival, you’ll receive a warm welcome from your host, Nergui, and his family. After changing into your Tsagaan Sar deel, you’ll take part in the evening preparations and shared meal. Traditionally, families eat until they are full on Bituun, as it is believed this sets the tone for abundance in the year ahead. Shiniin Negiin – New Year’s Day: Before dawn, you’ll join the head of the household to greet the first sunrise of the new year — one of the most important customs of Tsagaan Sar. Together, you’ll walk to the family ovoo (a traditional stone shrine) to make offerings and express gratitude for the year past and the one beginning. Returning to the home, the day continues with visits from extended family and neighbours, and the practice of zolgokh, the traditional New Year greeting. Taking part in these rituals offers an opportunity to understand Tsagaan Sar as it is lived — through family, continuity, and shared responsibility across generations."

The Tarna River — small but vital — flows through the area, providing an essential water source for local herding families. Here, you’ll be welcomed by the Davaasuren family, one of the families we work with through long-term local partnerships, and invited into their home. Davaasuren is a camel herder, and for those who wish there is the option to explore the nearby sand dunes by camel. There’s also time to simply take in the landscape or visit a quiet temple tucked into the foothills of the mountain."

They are modern-day herders and active members of the local community, moving with their livestock up to six times a year as part of a seasonal cycle that continues to shape life here today. The Orkhon River Valley is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, recognised for its cultural significance and for representing the long evolution of nomadic pastoral traditions in Mongolia. Often described as the cradle of Mongolian civilisation, the valley remains a vital landscape for herders, sustained by the Orkhon River, which continues to provide an essential lifeline for people and livestock. You’ll also travel into nearby Kharkhorin, the former capital of Ögödei Khan and the Mongol Empire. There is time to visit Erdene Zuu, Mongolia’s oldest monastery, and the Kharkhorin Museum, whose thoughtfully presented exhibits trace the history of the Orkhon Valley and the Turkic and Mongol empires. Even for those less drawn to history, these visits offer valuable context for understanding the landscape and communities you’re travelling through."

    "generalInfo": "Mongolia – its very name conjures up images of a mysterious land at the outer edge of the world. Set between two vast neighbours, Russia and China, Mongolia is characterised by sweeping wild panoramas roamed by hardy nomads following time-honoured traditions – which you'll experience through the fantastic Naadam summer festival as well as visits to local homes. But you'll also delve a stirring history, from the empire-forging warrior Genghis Khan to dramatic remote monasteries. <br/><br/>From the capital Ulaan Bataar, take in the giant statue of Genghis Khan en route to the rocky alpine scenery of Terelj National Park. You'll also spend time discovering the dramatically different nature and wildlife of Mongolia's sand dune desert, the yak country of the Tsagaan Sym River Valley wetlands, the bird mecca of Ogii Lake plus the Hustai National Park – home to arguably the world's only true wild horses. <br/><br/>Alongside Mongolia's natural marvels, the colourful festival of Naadam offers one of Asia's greatest experiences – a summer festival that lets you experience pulse-quickening traditional tests of skill and bravery including horse-racing and Mongolian wrestling. It's also a great chance to mingle with local families, many dressed up to the nines in traditional outfits called Deels. <br/><br/>In Kharkhorin, discover the ancient capital of Genghis Khan from where he led his armies to capture much of Europe in the 13th century. You'll also visit Mongolia's two finest monasteries at Amarbayasgalant and Erdene Zuu Khiid. The trip reaches its finale in the dramatic central uplands around the craft centre of Buglan, where Buzzards and Steppe Eagles soar.",

Once in the town, we will explore the stunning temples of the 16th Century Erdene Zuu Buddhist Monastery, surrounded by monumental walls and 108 white stupas. It is probably the earliest surviving Buddhist monastery in the country, having withstood (though been significantly damaged by) the purge of monasteries in 1939 by Communist leaders. Since the 1990s the monastery has become, once again, a place of Buddhist worship. We will also explore the local craft market where you have some time to pick up some last minute traditional gifts.

Head north, dive into the Khangai Mountains to discover the intriguing provincial capital Bayankhongor, from where you'll explore a surrounding landscape of rich forests, meadows and river valleys. You'll also visit the dramatic 16th century ruins of Kharkhorin – Genghis Khan’s capital in its 13th century heyday. <br/><br/>The trip finale brings you to the sweeping grasslands of the Hustai National Park, roamed by what are claimed to be the world's only true wild horses. In this iconic landscape, you will also experience the hospitality of the people of these plains – including a likely invite into their nomadic homes - gers - for a glass of airag (fermented mare’s milk)! <br/><br/>But wherever you are here, you'll find Mongolians are as unforgettable as their country.  <br/>",

Home to Tsagaannuur and the distant taiga forests where the Tsaatan live, as well as to the Darkhad communities of the lake’s western shores, this region is as culturally significant as it is visually striking.<br/><br/>Though Khövsgöl Lake is a central feature, the spirit of this journey lies in the travel itself. Journeying overland from Ulaanbaatar to the taiga encourages a deeper understanding of Mongolia’s sheer scale and diversity—its landscapes changing from high-altitude passes to deep river gorges, open steppe to solid ice. Along the way, you’ll encounter a cross-section of Mongolian life, gaining insight into how urban and rural worlds coexist and how strong cultural ties link communities across this vast terrain.<br/><br/>During the experience, you’ll spend three days living alongside the Tsaatan, gaining a respectful insight into their way of life. Then, travel across the vast, frozen surface of Khövsgöl Lake—reverently known as “Dalai Ej” or “Mother Sea”—with Baasanchuluun and his fellow Darkhad companions. Skilled in traditional sleigh-making, these winter herders will guide you on a three-day journey by horse-drawn sleigh, allowing you to experience their way of winter travel—quiet, deliberate, and deeply rooted in the rhythms of the land.<br/><br/>The adventure concludes at the annual Ice Festival, a colourful celebration of local culture held on the icy expanse of the lake itself. With games, performances, and community pride on display, it offers a joyful contrast to the solitude of the taiga and the lake crossing.<br/><br/>This trip is built on personal friendships cultivated over two decades, allowing you to engage meaningfully with the families you meet, providing them with long-term employment opportunities while respecting their way of life. It’s not just about witnessing the beauty of Mongolia; it’s about connecting with its people, culture, and diverse landscapes, ensuring a rich and genuine experience that will stay with you long after your journey ends.",

        "description": "With The Tsaatan reindeer herders: You will travel to and spend time living within the Tsaatan reindeer herder community. The Tsaatan, also known as the Dukha, are Mongolia's smallest ethnic minority, with their community split between two main regions known as the East and West Taiga. Though these areas are geographically distinct, the Tsaatan in both regions share deep kinship ties and are part of a unified community. Mongolians, including the Tsaatan, are known for their adaptability, a crucial trait in the face of the climate emergency. This adaptability also means that we cannot specify in advance which Tsaatan family you will stay with or where they will be located, as their movements depend on seasonal and environmental factors. Tthe exact route to and from the taiga will be determined by the location of the Tsaatan families at the time. Flexibility is essential, as conditions on the ground change daily and will influence the trek's path. It might be by vehicle, on foot or a short journey on horseback. It might involve two of these or even all three. The Tsaatan are not an undiscovered tribe and you will not be the first or last person they have hosted. They are a modern people who have welcomed visitors from all over the world, and confront many of the same challenges as the rest of the modern world, including the need to earn an adequate income. Upon arrival, you will find that Tsaatan life does not conform to rigid plans or schedules. Instead, you will be immersed in the everyday life of a local family, becoming part of their world and experiencing their way of life as it naturally unfolds."

As is common, he has a winter home within the town of Khatgal itself and this is where you will stay - in his wooden house within the hasha - a typical fenced compound that belongs to each extended family.

It is a spiritual place for Mongolians and its natural beauty makes it a stunning location to take a little time out. Khovsgol is 126km in length and represents roughly 70% of Mongolia’s freshwater and is the younger sister to Lake Baikal in Siberia and part of the same Rift System. If the sky is clear, you can stand on the shoreline and see the snowcapped Sayan Mountains - the border with Siberia. It is truly spectacular. We focus on community-based tourism – working directly with local people, rural families and communities – slowly building up relationships with them. Low season in Mongolia is brutally long – from the end of October almost up until the beginning of May. As part of our long-term support, we look at ways in which we can continue to provide support to the families and communities we work with even during this low period and thus created our horse sleigh expedition. Together with his brother Lokh and their childhood friend Zorgio, Bambakh & co have hand-built horse sleighs in the local tradition – sleighs are a common form of transport for the Darkhad at Khovsgol in the winter months. These are the sleighs we use for our Mongolia horse sleigh expeditions on Khovsgol – with Bambakh, Lokh and Zorgio driving the sleighs. It is their local knowledge that guide and lead our trips. We insulate the horse sleigh with our hand made traditional goatskin blankets. We also provide you with your own hand made full-length goat skin del (traditional Mongolian coat) and a pair of Mongolian felt boots. Lunches are taken always with a small campfire. Having these picnic lunches allows us to explore the sandy beaches, rocky shorelines, forested coves and the small cliffs that can be found alongside the lake."

This festival celebrates the unique features of the region and is marked by significant local involvement. Unlike typical tourist-oriented festivals, this event feels like a genuine celebration for the locals, by the locals, with Mongolian spectators proudly donning their best winter deels. Please note that domestic and international tourism numbers to the event have increased in the last few years. Don’t expect a rigid schedule of events; the festival is more about community celebration, networking, and collaboration for the future of the region and its herding communities. Yes, there are activities and competitions throughout the two days, but the atmosphere is relaxed and festive. So, ditch your watch, bundle up, and enjoy the experience. Use the EL van as a base to warm up when needed, and immerse yourself in the festive spirit, which includes Ice Sumo, tug-of-war, ice sculpting, an ice-driving rally, and ice skating. The festival also usually features a shamanist ceremony and a musical concert."

The city is home to nearly half of Mongolia's population, many of whom continue to live in gers (yurts) in the suburbs. For those arriving on time, our tour leader plans to meet you in the hotel reception at 2pm for an orientation walking tour of Sukhbaatar Square. The square is the administrative heart of the nation, surrounded by the Government Palace, central banks, theatres and the post office, and a bold display of Soviet-era architecture. There is an equestrian statue of Damdin Sukhbaatar and a huge bronze monument of Chinggis Khan flanked by two of his many sons and two of his most important generals. We'll also take a visit to the Mongolia National Museum, which will tell you everything you need to know about one of history's most divisive characters and more. After our orientation, our tour leader will hold a welcome briefing at 6pm in the hotel. Then, you have the option to get to know your fellow travellers over dinner. If you'd like an airport transfer today, you'll need to arrive into Chinggis Khaan International Airport (UBN), which is a one-hour drive from the hotel. If you miss the welcome meeting, our tour leader will inform you of any essential information as soon as you catch up on day two. Our time in Ulaanbataar is limited, so if you would like to spend more time exploring Mongolia's capital or take a visit to the Chinggis Khan statue, we'd recommend adding a day to the tour by booking a pre- or post-tour accommodation."

        "description": ": The adventure begins this morning as we leave Ulaanbaatar and drive out into Mongolia's beautiful countryside. As we set out, we'll pass through the new, the old and the chaotic parts of the capital, before reaching the rolling hills of the Mongolian steppe. Following the country's central road for around three hours, we'll leave the tarmac as we head into Hustai National Park, arriving at our camp in time for lunch. Hustai National Park (Khustain Nuruu) has been a protected area since 1993 containing both mountains and steppe within a relatively small area. The national park is home to the rare Mongolian wild horse known as Perzevalski or Takhi; once extinct in the wild, the Perzevalski Horse is a conservation success story with captive breed horses released into, and then surviving in the wild. After lunch, we'll have a little time to visit the on-site visitor centre and learn a little more about the region, the horses and various other flora and fauna found in Hustai National Park. Mid-afternoon is the best time to spot the beautiful Takhi horses, so we'll pile into our trucks and drive out into the rolling terrain to look for them coming down from the mountains for water at the nearby river. If we're lucky, we might also spot foxes, red deer, roe deer, eagles and various other animals. Once we've finished our Mongolian safari, we'll head back to the camp for dinner and to spend our first night in our authentic Mongolian Ger. 4WD vehicles are best suited to the rugged conditions when travelling around Mongolia. The group will be split up into 4WD vehicles (usually seven-seater) with approximately four or five passengers in each vehicle so everyone gets a window seat. Our tour leader will ride in one of the vehicles and will rotate between vehicles throughout the tour. Our ger camps on this trip generally consist of several canvas and felt tents, plus a large dining tent or restaurant. Each ger has two or more beds, bedding, plus a table and stools, all hand-painted in local style. Toilet and washing facilities are shared and separate from the living gers, with a mixture of flushing and long-drop style toilets. If you need to charge your cameras and electronic devices during your trip, there is electricity in the restaurant gers."

Once the site of a battle between Buddhist sects, nowadays Khogno Khan is considered a place of spirituality. We'll break our journey with a visit the \\ mini Gobi', an area of rolling dunes that look out of place surrounded by green steppe, where we hope to visit a local herder family. In the afternoon we'll explore the stunning terrain where red granite mountains tower above green meadows and arid desert landscapes. We'll visit a solitary Buddhist temple, hidden from the world, but still occupied and very much in use and head down to the beautiful crystalline lakes that sit between lush green steppe on one side, and towering sand dunes on the other. During the summer, these meadows and lakes come alive with flowers and butterflies, tiny frogs and majestic cranes and other birdlife that inhabits the area. Alternatively, you might like to relax with a good book and an exceptional view. We'll spend the evening at our ger camp, relaxing under the shelter of the Khogno Khan Mountains."

        "description": ": Waking up in the shadow of Khogno Khan, we'll spend a lazy morning enjoying the scenery of our surroundings before setting off in search of Mongolia's ancient capital, Karakorum (a two-hour drive away). Karkorum was the former capital of the Mongolian Empire. At its height in the 13th century, it was from here that Chinggis Khan's son, Ogedei Khan, once ruled the largest land empire the world has ever known. During Karkorum's golden age, much of the city was comprised of tents and, as the Mongolian Empire went into decline, the city's decay was rapid. These days, all that remains of this once-great settlement is the impressive Erdene Zuu Monastery, as well as a few scattered archaeological finds. On arrival at Karkorum, our first stop will be the immense Erdene Zuu Monastery - Mongolia's first Buddhist centre established in the 16th century and now an active monastery as well as a museum. At its zenith there were 1,000 resident monks and, although most of the temples were destroyed in the 1930s, the monastery is slowly being restored and is considered by many as the most important monastery in Mongolia. The political climate in Mongolia is changing and Buddhism, previously suppressed, is currently experiencing a resurgence. We'll hopefully catch the resident monks in their afternoon prayer. Following our monastery visit, we'll call at the Karakorum Museum, which chronicles the history of the Khan Empire along with artefacts from the ruined city. These days Karkorum has a real backwater feel to it, and before we head to our camp for the evening, we'll cut through the centre so we can gain a snippet of life in this once-grand settlement and, time permitting, we'll stop at the local market for a chance to see the local traders selling their wares within a labyrinth of small buildings and storage containers."

        "description": ": Continuing our journey south this morning, we'll stop 90 minutes in to visit Tovkhon Monastery - one of the most secluded and beautiful in the region. The only way to reach Tovkhon is on foot but the walk is worth it for the views alone. The walk is around 5 kilometres/3 miles in total, taking from one to two hours to get up and one hour to get down. Upon arrival, we'll meet the local monks and, for those brave enough, climb along the cliffside with the monks to find traditional meditation caves. Following our Buddhist adventure, we'll head back down the mountain and make our way to the Orkhon Valley. The Mongol culture of today is still pastoral and we hope to come across itinerant herdsmen, a group of two or three families, their gers pitched on the steppe. The nomads live in harmony with their surroundings and move with the seasons. Many rear camels, sheep and goats. It's likely that, at some point during our trip, we'll be invited to share a drink of airag or koumiss (fermented mare's milk) with these friendly people. There are many polite points of etiquette to learn, but our guide will help us through these so we don't inadvertently cause offence. The provision of a gift when you visit a ger is part of the culture in Mongolia, so feel free to pack something small. Practical items such as torches or sewing kits, that save a trip to town are often the most appreciated. Alternatively, a local speciality from home would be well received such as a biscuit, sweet or whatever you think would be well received. The two-hour drive to Orkhon takes us through the Khangai mountain range, offering beautiful landscapes comprising of gorges, river valleys and green steppe. Upon arrival, we'll stop to visit the Orkhon Valley Waterfall, Mongolia's tallest at 16 metres high, situated at the head of an impressive gorge cut into the landscape over millennia. Finally, we'll check in to our ger camp - our base for the next two nights."

We'll pass into Saikhan Ovoo, a small province in Mongolia's heartland with green steppe, rugged rock formations and Martian-like landscapes. Once again, there are no roads and few tracks to follow. The other thing that will doubtless strike you when travelling through these great expanses of Mongolia is the varied bird life. Mongolian Lark, Demoiselle Cranes and Black Vultures can be seen, to name but a very few. Our destination is a place of quiet solitude on the Ongiin Gol River known as Ongi Temple. The ruins of two monasteries, Barlim and Khutagt, remain on the north and south shores of the river. We'll visit this site, commonly collectively known as the Ongii Lamasery, and it's little museum. Ongii used to be one of Mongolia's most extensive monasteries and home to over one thousand monks until the Stalinist purges of the 1930s when it was destroyed. In 2002, some monks returned and began restoration work with a small budget, making up for what they lacked monetarily with inspiring spiritual fervour. This evening, our ger camp is located only a stone's throw from the temple and offers a chance of serene relaxation, further hiking or exploration."

Our foray onto its plains only gives us a snippet of its actual size - the Gobi is the sixth-largest desert globally and the second in Asia, it's a wide-open place of extremes that reaches into China. Our destination today is Bayanzag, home to the Flaming Cliffs - sandstone cliffs and canyons that light up brilliantly at sunrise and sunset. Aside from its obvious wow factor, Bayanzag is also where American palaeontologist Roy Chapman Andrews discovered the world's first-ever recorded dinosaur eggs and a mighty haul of various other fossils in 1922. Once we've finished our exploration, it's off to the nearby ger camp where we can relax, drink, and return to the cliffs to catch the changing colours at sunset - a perfect end to an exciting day."

        "description": ": The adventure continues as we bid farewell to the Flaming Cliffs, board our vehicles and drive for about four hours onwards through the wilds of the Gobi Desert to the Khongor Sand Dunes (Khongoryn Els) also known as the Singing Sands. Along the way, we'll pass typical Gobi terrain, a loose mix of pebbles, gravel and fine sand. We'll also cross a fertile area of steppe where we'll visit one of the traditional nomadic families who call this desolate region home. The Khongor Sand Dunes, as the name suggests, are a dune system found within the Gobi; as only around 3% of the Gobi Desert is covered in sand, the sight of these 300-metre-high gigantic dunes is something to behold. The shifting sands of Khongoryn Els stretch out for over 180 kilometres/112 miles - our ger camp looks out across these giants. After lunch, and once the weather has cooled down, we'll visit one of Khongor's resident camel herder families. For those who don't want to tackle the dunes on foot, there'll be the option to ride a camel. When the wind blows across the sand's surface in the right direction, an eerie sound is emitted, giving them the nickname the 'singing' sands. As with much of the Gobi Desert's natural scenery, the Khongor Dunes come alive at sunset and you might like to catch the view from the top of the dunes or the comfort of our ger camp while enjoying a cold drink after dinner."

The journey is short today but the going is bumpy as we leave the Khongor area on our way to the Yol Valley. You can see how the landscape transitions from a typical sandy desert into hard clay, rock, stone and steppe - showing how diverse the Gobi Desert really is. We'll eventually arrive at the Gurvansaikhan Mountains. Due to the altitude and deep gorges, a temperate ecosystem exists, with argali sheep, ibex and snow leopards living here - as opposed to the desert species we might expect. The Yolyn Am (Vulture's Gorge in Mongolian) is a magnificent 40-kilometre/25-mile long valley with great views and we'll explore it on a three-to-four-hour walk. Over the winter months, the river builds up a thick layer of ice which thaws slowly and, at times, remains long into the summer months. As you follow the winding path, eagles rise to circle in the thermals high above the canyon whilst wild goats can be seen perched on the high valley walls and picas scurry amongst the rocky terrain. Finally, we'll drive to our accommodation for tonight, another well-appointed ger camp where we'll have a chance to chat about our adventures and relax over a drink or two."

After lunch, we'll start our journey north back towards Ulaanbaatar, but between us and the capital, there is plenty more to see. Today's drive leads us on through the Gobi and after about three hours, we'll reach our destination - White Stupa. These magnificent white cliffs tower over the desert floor creating some of Mongolia's most stunningly picturesque natural scenery.

Baga Gazriin Chuluu National Park is home to 20 rare species of plant, ibex, marmot and mountain sheep. We'll explore the impressive geology and scenery on a walk in the afternoon along with some more ancient petroglyphs and burial mounds. We'll also visit the ruins of a temple, hidden between these towering rocks - a chance to see how nature has reclaimed this site.

    "generalInfo": "Winter in Mongolia is very cold – but that’s what makes the landscapes so extraordinary at this time of year. And not only will you explore some of the most iconic scenery in Mongolia’s central heartland  - made beautiful by winter - but you’ll experience the ways of life of three families that live within these landscapes. <br/><br/>Central to each experience is the long-term local community partnerships that we have formed with each of the host families. Supporting the rural communities through which you will travel and working directly with them and accessing their local knowledge leads to a more personal style of holiday for you as our guest. It also allows you to discover the realities of Mongolian herding culture in the 21st century - for an interesting take on how it is adapting and progressing.<br/><br/>You’ll spend each day exploring - whether by 4x4, camel, horse or on foot - and nights in a ger, warming yourself by the stove. Although the temperatures will be challenging, the star-filled night skies make up for any difficulties - as will the warmth of traditional Mongolian hospitality you will receive. <br/><br/>On this holiday we don’t ask our Mongolian host families to change their way of life to accommodate our guests. Instead, you’ll genuinely observe and be part of the way the people you meet live – all against a backdrop of wild winter landscapes. Winter here is pared back and resolute, with muted colour, long lines, and life continuing through the cold. Simply winter, on its own terms.<br/><br/>Who This Experience Is For<br/><br/>This journey is designed for curious, open-minded travellers. As it’s a tailor made holiday to Mongolia, the holiday can be adapted to suit your personal needs.<br/>The outline itinerary is a starting point and can be adjusted to reflect travel dates, accommodation preferences, and individual interests.<br/><br/>You don’t need to be especially fit, but you should have a flexible mindset &amp; be comfortable walking on uneven ground, spending extended time outdoors, and managing cold conditions with appropriate layers. Daily life involves getting in and out of vehicles, using outdoor toilets, and sharing space with others. <br/><br/>Accessibility considerations<br/><br/>Our journeys are designed around seasonal conditions and rural infrastructure. Depending on your access needs, this experience may or may not be suitable. We encourage you to get in touch with any specific questions so we can advise openly.",

    "generalInfo": "Discover the raw, windswept beauty of Mongolia’s far west on this cultural journey, anchored by a locally hosted eagle festival, genuine encounters with Kazakh eagle hunters, and the breathtaking wilderness of the Altai Mountains.<br/><br/>This is a slow-travel, small-group experience that takes you deep into the heart of Bayan-Ölgii Province—where the Kazakh people, Mongolia’s largest ethnic minority, have long made their home. With a population of over 100,000, the Kazakhs of western Mongolia maintain a distinct cultural identity shaped by centuries of tradition and the formidable terrain of the Altai range.<br/><br/>More than just a visit, this journey offers the chance to truly engage with the people and places that define the region. You’ll travel through stark yet majestic landscapes, spend time with eagle hunters as they go about their daily routines, and take part in one of the region’s celebrated eagle festivals—where Kazakh heritage is proudly displayed through competitive eagle flights, traditional music, horsemanship, and community pride.<br/><br/>The itinerary also includes time in the provincial capital of Ölgii—a dynamic yet often overlooked part of life in the west—providing insight into how Kazakh culture continues to evolve in modern Mongolia.<br/><br/>This adventure is curated and led by a small, purpose-driven travel company that works hand-in-hand with local families and communities, with each experience shaped with the intent to support rural livelihoods while maintaining cultural integrity. The result is a more meaningful, grounded journey that benefits those you meet along the way.<br/><br/>If you’re drawn to authentic cultural immersion and wild, remote landscapes, this is a journey you can either join as part of a small group or customise to fit your own travel pace and interests. While the eagle festivals are held in autumn—typically September and October—this region is captivating year-round for those seeking a window into one of Mongolia’s most resilient and culturally rich communities.",

Altai Tavan Bogd National Park can be divided into two regions, the Tavan Bogd Mountains in the northwest and the Lakes Region to the southeast. The lakes are fed by glacial melt and annual snowfall and form the headwaters of the Khovd River. We'll keep the remaining days flexible, but here's an idea you can discuss with your trip assistant: Consider a day hike to the Baga Turgen Waterfall. The round-trip trek from Khoton Nuur to the waterfall in Western Mongolia spans approximately 16 to 18 kilometers, featuring a mix of gradual and moderate ascents with a total elevation gain of 400 to 500 meters if hiking directly from the lake. If you'd prefer a shorter hike, a vehicle transfer can be arranged for part of the journey. On Sept 10, you will return to Ulgii. This stop is necessary because the drive from Khoton/Khurgan Nuur to Altai soum, where you’ll spend time with an eagle hunting family, is too long to complete in one day. Plus, this gives you the opportunity to enjoy a hot shower and recharge before continuing the journey."

We leave the visit flexible as this leads to a more natural experience but you’ll spend time living alongside the family in the stunning setting of their winter home. You'll experience their hospitality and their way of life as herders and eagle hunters, and learn more about the traditions and culture of the Mongol Kazakhs. Two days will be spent at the Altai Nomad Games. This eagle festival will provide you with a wealth of cultural experience as you mix in the company of small-town folk, herders and Mongol Kazakh eagle hunters. The festival is a celebration of Kazakh culture with traditional Kazakh games and horse races as well as competitions showcasing the relationship between hunter and eagles - focusing on the communication between them and the speed, agility and accuracy of the ‘berkut’ (the female Golden Eagle)."

    "generalInfo": "Mongolia is a land of horses and horsemen. What better way to really experience it than on a horse riding holiday in Mongolia?  This trek takes you far away from the main tourist areas, to remote Zavkhan Province.<br/><br/>Where We Travel: <br/>This rarely visited area is a wonderful mix of steppe, forest, rivers, mountains and desert, populated by hardy nomadic herders. The riding is often said to be the best in the world - no fences, few roads, and terrain that allows you to gallop forever. Zavkhan sees almost no foreign visitors, and tourism has had no impact on the traditional way of life.<br/><br/>The Horses and Riding:<br/>Experienced riders will love the local horses, small but fast and strong, and perfectly suited to the environment. However, the trek is also suitable for those with less experience - adventurous travelers who recognize that horseback is the ideal way to experience Mongolia.<br/><br/>We structure our treks so that experienced riders who dream of galloping across open steppe, like Genghis Khan on the war-path, can do so, while those of us who prefer a more gentle pace can take our time and enjoy the scenery. Even people with no riding experience at all are welcome to join us on our rides - we will make sure to look after you well. <br/><br/>At the end of each day we meet our 4WD support vehicles and set up camp. Zavkhan is an undeveloped region with no tourism infrastructure, so you will be wilderness camping during the trek. This is a rare opportunity to travel in a part of the country that has seen little change over the years. You will meet the local herders and experience their ancient way of life.<br/><br/>Why Trek With Us?<br/>We have been arranging treks in this region for more than 10 years, working directly with our friends amongst the nomadic herders. The staff who accompany you are very experienced - most have been with us from the start. Our horse wranglers will teach you how to ride the Mongolian horses in a way that is exciting and safe.<br/><br/>During the trek you will be accompanied by an experienced English-speaking trip leader and our team of wranglers, drivers and cook.  The trip leader will make sure you have the perfect horse to match your riding experience.<br/><br/>The Great Mongolian Road Trip:<br/>We begin with an epic road trip to Zavkhan, an experience not to be missed. Mongolia's roads are notorious, but our sturdy Russian 4WD vehicles can handle anything. The drive takes us west across beautiful open steppe and forested hills, stopping at the ancient capital of Karakorum, arriving in Zavkhan after two and a half days. At the end of the trek we fly back to Ulaanbaatar (driving one way is enough for anyone!).<br/><br/>Naadam Festival add-on:<br/>Before our 12th July trek, you may like to stay on for the annual Naadam Festival opening ceremony (11th July) in Ulaanbaatar, a spectacular celebration of Mongolian culture. Quite unlike any other festival in the world!",
