      "description": "Makola Market, Artist Alliance Gallery, Fantasy Coffins, Kwame Nkrumah Mausoleum and Jamestown Community The Makola Market in Accra offers a vibrant atmosphere for locals to shop and enjoy street foods, including Ghanaian herbal remedies, traditional cloth, jewelry, food, mobile phones, televisions, and sound systems. The bustling market provides an insight into daily life for locals who trade or shop there seven days a week. The Artist Alliance Gallery on the beachfront in Accra is an ideal location to experience traditional and contemporary art and artifacts from all over Ghana and neighboring countries. The \"Fantasy Coffins\" of Teshie Nungua are a must-see attraction, with various designs available for burial. Ghanaians believe that the departed move on into another world, and the coffins made here may represent the occupation of the deceased or something important to them, from cars, cocoa pods, cigarette packets and airplanes to crocodiles, shoes, bottles of beer and boats to mention a few. You can also visit their workshop and meet the coffin makers. In the afternoon, we pass by Black Star Square, which houses the independence monument, and continue to Independence Square, where we find the enclosed flame of African liberation lit by Kwame Nkrumah himself in 1961. The Kwame Nkrumah Memorial Park, is the final resting place of Ghana's founder and features an adjoining museum with photos, artifacts, and insights into his life. As we head downtown to Jamestown, we enjoy a walking tour of the old community, taking in historical structures that predate the colonial era. The locals are committed to conserving these buildings, giving us an excellent idea of what it was like during the colonial era. Jamestown, a neighborhood in Accra, is known for its rich history and cultural heritage. The area is home to the 30-meter-high lighthouse built by the British in 1871 and colorful fishing boats on the beach. Fort James, built by the British in 1673, was later joined by the Dutch Fort Crêvecoeur and the Danish Fort Christiansborg.These areas give us a perfect picture of old Accra, distinguishing between British Accra and Dutch Accra. The area is known for its Brazilian stone houses, built by free enslaved Africans who migrated back to Africa after the slave trade was abolished. This part of Accra is one of the poorest and there are many social issues within this community. Street children, orphans and child workers are common here and our evening will be dedicated to meeting locals who are trying to change the lives of the youth through boxing. Jamestown is known for producing several World Champion Boxers, including Isaac Dogboe, David Kotei, Joseph Agbeko, Richard Commey, and Azumah Nelson, considered Africa's greatest ever boxer. The youth in this area see boxing as an opportunity for a better life in the future, and they see it as a way to improve their lives. We can visit one of the many gyms in the area to witness the youth and professionals in training. A local street bar and restaurant in the heart of the community provides a comfortable and enjoyable experience for visitors. Accommodation – In Accra"

      "description": "Ancient Kente and Adinkra villages and West Africa’s largest Market Today, we explore the rich history of local cloth designs and meet new young vibrant designers. Our journey begins in the ancient villages of Adanwomasie and Ntonso, where we learn about the history behind the many designs and interact with skilled weavers who have been weaving kente cloth for generations.Former US President Bill Clinton has had a design named after him called the “Clinton Kente” as Ghanaians were so impressed with the respect, he showed our nation during his state visit to Ghana when he was in office. We visit the village to purchase quality kente cloth at exceptionally low prices before heading to Ntunso, where adinkra cloth and symbols originate. These traditional symbols are carved from calabash shells and printed onto traditional cloth using natural dyes made from the bark of certain local trees. Adinkra cloth has been adorned by the Ashanti's for over four centuries and pre-dates kente cloth. During our time in Ntunso, we learn the meanings behind the various symbols and can make our own strip of adinkra cloth using symbols with personal significance. Women in Ghana from the Ashanti region are famous for being hard working and excellent entrepreneurs. Many big businesses in Kumasi are owned by women, and we visit a successful local restaurant, Jofel, which sells a wide variety of local and international dishes.

Our afternoon is dedicated to exploring Adum and walking down to Kejetia market, the largest outdoor market in West Africa.

      "description": "Manhyia Palace and Village Life The Manhyia Palace, home to the Asantehene King of the Ashanti's, offers a fascinating excursion through the history and culture of this powerful tribe. The palace Museum provides first-hand insight into the legacies of the Ashanti's and allows visitors to understand their culture during their time in the region. After departing Kumasi, we head south to the villages of Bonkro and Breku, where most Ghanaians live as subsistence farmers. Our company has a strong connection with these communities, working with them to protect their surrounding upper guinea rainforest and endangered bird and mammal species. We have built a school for almost 300 children living in these villages, who previously did not attend school or had to walk 6km each way to the nearest alternative. Our aim was to connect the communities to the conservation of their environment through ethical tourism. In return, we built a school, accommodation, and a restaurant for them to sell food and drinks. All monies generated from this initiative go 100% into a community fund we have established for them. After getting to know the children, we visit the local representative for Kuapa Kokoo Cooperative, a Fair-Trade organization that ensures its members get a good price. Divine chocolate, one of the fastest growing chocolate brands in the world, is likely from Kuapa Kokoo farmers, who own 44% of Divine chocolate. When eating a bar of Divine chocolate, you will see a photograph and information on one of the Ghanaian farmers and their families who grow the cocoa and sell it to Divine through Kuapa Kokoo. They also work hard to promote women in business. This is where the chocolate process starts, visitors can learn about cooperatives improving working conditions, banning child labor, and ensuring women's voices are heard. They can visit local cocoa farms to witness the harvesting process, learn about children using unripe cocoa as sweets, and how cocoa pods are used for soap production. The evening is spent with the community, relaxing at their accommodation, and enjoying a meal while experiencing village life in this remote part of Ghana. Accommodation-In Bonkro"

      "description": "Cape Coast Castle, Baobab Foundation and Batik After breakfast in the village, we bid farewell to our new friends in the community and set off Southwards towards Elmina in the central region of Ghana. The town of Elmina was given its name by the Portuguese due to the abundance of Gold found in Ghana, translated Elmina means The Mine. Gold is of such importance to Ghana today and historically that we were even known as the Gold Coast before independence. Ghana’s gold is of the highest quality and we are the 8th largest exporter in the world and second largest exporter in Africa behind South Africa. Assin Manso, a town in central Ghana, is a significant stop along the enslaved African trade routes. The town is located around the Ndonkor Nsuo, a river where enslaved Africans were checked for fitness and bathed before being transported to Cape Coast for shipment to the Americas. The slaves would have walked hundreds of kilometers through thick forests in shackles and chains, many in poor health. Once bathed and rested, they would continue the final 32-mile march to the dungeons of Cape Coast Castle, where they would remain for up to 6 weeks before being shipped to the Americas. In 1998, a symbolic gesture was made when the bodies of two free (previously enslaved) Africans, Samuel Carson from New York U.S.A. and Crystal from Kingston Jamaica, were returned to Cape Coast Castle and symbolically passed through the \"Door of no Return\" before being transported to Assin Manso for re-internment. After visiting the river, we make our way to Cape Coast, a world heritage site designated by UNESCO. The castle holds more enslaved Africans captive than any other in West Africa, and visitors can view the dungeons and the infamous \"Door of no Return.\" The castle features a historical museum, a souvenir shop selling literature on Ghana's forts and castles, and a souvenir shop selling literature on Ghana's cultural history and traditions. This excursion provides an understanding of the recent history of Ghana. The fishing communities surrounding the castle are some of the poorest in Cape Coast, many children sleep on the streets, do not attend school and girls become very vulnerable as they have no safe place to stay. Our lunch today will be taken at a wonderful organization in this community that is giving these children hope of a better future. The Baobab Children Foundation is a non-formal vocational school in the poor fishing communities surrounding the castle in Cape Coast, focusing on helping children who have not attended school, left school early, or have disabilities. The foundation offers a wide selection of health-conscious dishes and a shop where visitors can purchase items made by children trained at the Baobab vocational school, from Batik dresses, bead jewelry, organic creams, bags, kente weavings, rings, postcards, paintings and potter. All proceeds go back into supporting the foundation. In the afternoon, visitors can immerse themselves in true African art during a traditional batik making workshop with Global Mamas, an organization that empowers local women to learn artistic skills and sell their finished products in the fair-trade market. By working side by side with local artisans, visitors can learn traditional techniques of batik making and production, such as wax heating, stamping, and drying. After a day of varied experiences, including exploring the tropical forests of inland Ghana and the beautiful coastal communities, guests can relax at beachfront accommodation in Brenu Akyinim.

      "description": "Kakum Rainforest Canopy Walkway, Stingless Bee Center, Palm Wine, Local Gin Distillery and Beach Relaxation An early start awaits as we head to Kakum National Park, a semi-deciduous upper guinea rainforest in Ghana's Cape Coast. This park protects the original habitat and was the local's home and major source of food before becoming a National Park. The walkway consists of seven bridges attached to seven emerging trees, 40 meters above the rainforest floor. The information centre offers breathtaking views and an informative information centre about the park's flora and fauna. Over 40 different mammal species have been recorded within the park, including forest elephants, leopards, and six primate species. On the border of the forest, the International Stingless Bee Project is located nearby, with approximately 9 species identified in Ghana. The project educates visitors about the importance of bees locally, their medicinal qualities, and their importance to the eco system. The park also features a stingless bee walkway and butterfly garden where many forest butterfly species feed. The surrounding habitat outside the forest is mainly palm plantations and cocoa farms, which are having a devastating effect on rainforest habitats. Palm oil is found in almost 50% of products sold globally, and most of these companies are in developing poor countries where they can exploit locals and have less restrictions on habitat destruction. Cocoa farms are better for the environment, as they yield better harvests if indigenous tree species are planted alongside them within the farm. Ghanaians have several traditional uses for the palm tree, and visiting a local farm will provide firsthand insight into why locally palm is so popular. A common sight in Ghana is locals tapping palm trees for palm wine, a low, popular alcoholic drink. Once a palm plantation is matured, farmers sell the trees to distillers who produce palm wine, a local low alcoholic drink of around 3% proof. The main income from the tree comes from distilling Akpeteshi, a local hard gin of varying strengths, believed to be around 70% proof. The name Akpeteshi translates to \"kill me quick.\" We stop for lunch at Han's cottage Botel near Kakum, built over a lake containing Nile crocodiles and surrounded by tropical guinea rainforest. After lunch, we relax at our accommodation in Brenu Akyinim, located on one of Ghana's finest beachfront locations. Accommodation-In Brenu Akyinim"

This is a great opportunity to meet the children you are helping and give back to communities in need. After meeting the children, we set off towards Ankasa Reserve, where we will reach Beyin for lunch before heading through the beautiful Amasuri wetlands in traditional dugout canoe to find the Nzulezu Stilt Village. Legend has it that the community migrated from Watala part of the ancient Ghanaian Empire 600 years ago after being driven from their homes during conflict. They built their homes over the lake for additional protection, and the snail is now sacred to this community. The main occupation of the community is farmers, not fishermen as expected. The boat ride on the wetlands is a major highlight, as they are now recognized as globally important wetlands for birds. The afternoon boat ride, and meeting the local community are highlights. Ankasa Reserve, connected to the Nini-Suhien National Park, protects over 500 square kilometers of mostly pristine wet evergreen upper guinea rainforest. This habitat played an important role in the life of Ghanaians historically, as it was their main source of water and food. By far Ghana's finest remaining rainforest habitat, it protects many endangered mammals and is home to many wonderful birds and wildlife. On our arrival we check into our accommodation and there will be an option for a night walk inside the forest. Alternatively, you can relax at your accommodation. Accommodation-In Ankasa"
