  "generalInfo": "Often considered West Africa’s most welcoming and vibrant nation, Ghana offers an array of wonderful experiences on this small group adventure. Tap into a vibrant pulse of Ghanaian life in the exciting capital Accra, then visit remote villages with strong ancestral traditions. Enjoy shifting  landscapes, from savannah to forest plus beautiful tropical shores – and contrast the startling rock formations known as 'the cave of the oracle' with the cooling rush of the Wli waterfalls.   <br/><br/>You'll learn about both ancient African kingdoms and the country's European colonial heritage, visit the home of sacred monkeys, meet women declared 'witches', and learn about the tragic history of slavery that casts a historic shadow over the beautiful coast in places like Elmina.   <br/><br/>As well as museums, the capital Accra offers the charms of its atmospheric old quarter and the celebrated modern tradition of craftsman who make arguably the world's most striking coffins! In Elmina, meanwhile, contrast Africa's oldest European building - St George’s Castle – with the town's unique Posuban shrines, made by traditional ‘asafo’ societies. <br/><br/>Visit Ashanti homes in Kumasi and Dagomba village huts, as well as the remarkable geometrical painted houses of the Gurunsi people. And if he's free, you may even meet the king of one of Ghana's tribes!",

Almost everything is sold here from herbal remedies, traditional cloth, jewellery and food to mobile phones, TVs and sound systems. We then visit the Artist Alliance Gallery on the beach front, showcasing traditional and contemporary art and artifacts from Ghana and neighbouring countries. From here we set off for the ‘fantasy coffins’ of Teshie Nungua. After a burial, a celebration follows and it is believed that the departed move on to another world and the decorated coffins may represent the occupation of the deceased, or something that was important to them, ranging from cars and cigarette packets to crocodiles and beer bottles! During our visit we have the opportunity to meet these infamous coffin makers. This afternoon we head to Independence Square where we find the enclosed flame of African liberation, lit by Kwame Nkrumah in 1961, and head to the Kwame Nkrumah National Park, the final resting place of Ghana’s founder before heading to Jamestown, one of Accra’s poorestsuburbs, yet steeped in history. Visit Fort James, and see the interesting Brazilian stone houses, built by free enslaved Africans who came over from Brazil after the abolition of the slave trade.
