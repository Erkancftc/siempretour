      "title": "Join trip in Amman",
      "description": ": Our tour of Jordan starts in Amman, one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world. Home to almost half of Jordan's entire population, Amman is a fascinating city of contrasts, where the ancient and the modern collide. Get lost in the bustling souks of downtown, where you'll be tempted by falafel and baklawa stalls, or visit the hillside Roman Theatre for a taster of the city's varied history. There are no activities planned for today, so you're free to arrive in Amman at any time. If you'd like an airport transfer today, you'll need to arrive into Queen Alia International Amman Airport (AMM), which is around a 30-minute drive from our hotel. As part of our Upgraded range, we also offer a complimentary transfer to those who have made pre-tour accommodation arrangements through Explore, regardless of your arrival day. Due to most flights arriving late in the evening, our Explore Leader will meet you for a welcome meeting the next morning. You'll find the meeting information on the notice board in the hotel reception. When choosing your flights, keep in mind that our tour starts right after breakfast on day two so be prepared to dive straight into the adventure. If you'd like to add on extra days in Amman before our tour starts to explore the capital at your own pace or simply catch up on rest, contact us to book accommodation. Our boutique hotel is in the heart of Amman and it is walking distance from the hustle and bustle of downtown."

      "title": "Explore Ajloun castle and visit to Jerash",
      "description": ": After breakfast, we'll gather for an introductory meeting before heading out for a guided tour of the city. We'll then travel north to the green and fertile area of Ajloun. Sitting high on a hilltop, Ajloun Castle is the highlight of our morning. Originally built as a defence post from crusaders, it's now a stunning example of medieval architecture and offers fantastic views over the Jordan valley. After enjoying a special lunch at a café owned and managed by women, we'll journey north of Amman to ancient Jerash. Inhabited for 6,500 years, the city's golden age was in Roman times when it became part of the Decapolis League - a confederation of important Middle Eastern cities. One of the best-preserved Roman ruins in the world, only 10% of the city has been uncovered since excavation began more than 100 years ago but you can still get a feel for how life in the city once was. Walk the colonnaded streets, visit the hilltop temples, explore the chariot-racing stadium, and hear your voice amplified in the ancient theatre."

      "title": "Amman city tour in the morning. Visit Mt Nebo and Madaba in the afternoon",
      "description": ": This morning we'll visit the Citadel Jabal al-Qal'a, the highest point in Amman, giving us panoramic views across the sprawling capital. Our tour will include the Roman Theatre and, prayer time permitting, a panoramic tour of the Blue Mosque. Making our way downtown, we'll weave through the winding streets of the souk, soaking up the energetic ambiance and the aroma of spices and delicacies on sale. Artifacts found here indicate that the area has been a royal city for thousands of years. Whilst earthquakes and invasions have taken their toll, two pillars of the Roman Temple of Hercules still stand strong alongside sections of the 7th-century Umayyad Palace. This afternoon, we head to Mount Nebo, referenced in the Old Testament as the place where Moses once stood to look over the Promised Land. From here, on a clear day, you can see out to the Dead Sea, Bethlehem, and Jerusalem. Our final stop of the day will be Madaba. Aptly dubbed the 'City of Mosaics', Madaba is home to hundreds of Byzantine-era mosaics, the most famous of these is a 6th-century map of Jerusalem and the Holy Land, created with two million pieces of stone."

      "title": "Journey to the south. Visit Kerak Castle and free time in Petra",
      "description": ": This morning, we'll leave Madaba and travel to Petra for a two-night stay. Along the way, we'll visit Kerak Castle. This ancient Crusader stronghold is the most famous in a chain of fortresses built for the Holy War against Islam. We'll stop to learn about its history and explore the maze of stone-vaulted halls and passageways. Abandoned centuries ago, Petra was the rock cut stronghold of the Nabateans. Surrounded by imposing mountains and approached through a deep, narrow cleft in the rocks, known as the Siq, it is a unique and unforgettable place and, enhanced by the play of light and shadow, an altogether overwhelming experience. On arrival, you can choose to either start exploring the archaeological site at your own pace or simply rest and enjoy the hotel's rooftop pool with a view of Petra's entrance and the tops of its canyons. This evening, we'll enjoy a Bedouin cookery demonstration and meal at a nearby restaurant, learning how to make a traditional Makloubah (upside down) dish, with meat, rice and fried vegetables, followed by Um Ali, a creamy Arabic dessert with croissant pieces, raisins and nuts."

      "title": "Guided tour of Petra. Optional Petra by night",
      "description": ": After an early breakfast, a guided orientation tour will take us to some of the key parts of this remarkable and ancient site. As you enter the site, you're led down a kilometre-long chasm (known as the Siq) where the towering canyon walls reach up to 200 metres high. At the end of the Siq sits the beating heart of the city, the Treasury - miraculously well-preserved, the façade stands at 43-metres-high. Beyond the Treasury, the ancient city becomes a sprawl of tombs and temples waiting to be explored. We'll take in the Colonnaded Street, the Royal Tombs and marvel at the amazing theatre, with its 8,000 seats carved from the solid rock. The afternoon is free for you to uncover more of Petra. Climb the steep path to the High Place of Sacrifice for a panorama over Wadi Araba and the Negev Desert or trek up to the Monastery - Petra's largest monument. In the evening, there's the option to witness Petra by night. Follow the candlelit Siq trail and watch how the light plays against the high canyon rocks, blanketed by stars, before coming upon the Treasury, lit up by night. Settle into the sands in front of the ancient temple and listen to a welcome speech from the Bedouin community that still calls the city home."

      "title": "Journey to Wadi Rum to camp in the desert",
      "description": ": This morning, early risers can choose to explore more of Petra for a few hours before we leave the Rose Red City behind. Today we'll embrace the nomadic lifestyle of the Bedouin and head into the dunes of Wadi Rum. We'll have the option of an exhilarating drive along the sands in 4WD vehicles, leading us through untouched parts of Wadi Rum. Described by T.E. Lawrence as 'vast, echoing and God-like…', Wadi Rum occupies 74,000 acres with its monolithic outcrops of granite rock and sandstone rising out of the blankets of sand. The Bedouins learned to live within this hostile environment 3000 years ago, adapting to the elements to perfect their nomadic way of life. We'll embark on exhilarating 4WD adventure to explore the hidden beauties of Wadi Rum. We'll have tea made in the traditional way on a fire and after watching the sun go down, setting the dunes aglow with fiery red and orange light, we'll head back to camp to experience Bedouin hospitality. We'll be served a traditional Zarb, a BBQ of chicken or goat meat (vegetarian options will be available) cooked under the desert sand and served alongside a selection of mezze. Our spacious camp features private, ensuite tents - each one is fully furnished with beds and bedding and is set up with solar-powered electricity. There's also a central fire pit shared by all visitors that's perfect to gather around for a spot of stargazing."

      "title": "Free day by the Red Sea in Aqaba",
      "description": ": After a full-on few days exploring the highlights of Jordan, we'll head to Aqaba for downtime by the Red Sea. A resort town, Aqaba is where local Jordanians come to holiday, lounge on the beach, and have a go at water sports. The port city is famous for its preserved coral reefs and sea life and this afternoon there'll be the option to get out on the water for a snorkelling trip or to unwind at the private Berenice Beach Club. If you don't have your sea legs, you can cool off in the hotel's rooftop pool or wander the vibrant souks. There are plenty of restaurants and bars to get a flavour for local life, too."

      "title": "Leave the Red Sea behind and float in the Dead Sea",
      "description": ": This morning, we'll depart Aqaba and head north along the King's Highway. Our next stop is the Dead Sea. This unique body of water is the lowest point on the earth's surface. With a salt content of 33%, it's almost impossible to sink and we'll take a dip to experience the mysterious floating sensation. While we're there, you can indulge in the water's rejuvenating mud, famous for its healing properties, too. After visiting the panoramic complex to take in the views, we'll continue back to Amman."
