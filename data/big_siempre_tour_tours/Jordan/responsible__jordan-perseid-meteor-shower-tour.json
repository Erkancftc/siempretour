  "generalInfo": "Embark on an extraordinary journey through Jordan that combines the country's most breathtaking historical sites with the magic of a celestial spectacle. This unique \"Nabatean Nights &amp; Perseid Meteor Shower\" tour is meticulously planned each year to ensure you are in the heart of the Wadi Rum desert during the peak activity of the stunning Perseid meteor shower. It offers a rare opportunity to experience Jordan's timeless wonders alongside an unforgettable night under a canopy of shooting stars, timed perfectly for optimal viewing. Your adventure covers Jordan's essential highlights, allowing you to step back in time as you explore the magnificent rock-carved city of Petra, an ancient Nabatean marvel. You'll also have the chance to experience the unique sensation of floating effortlessly in the hyper-saline waters of the Dead Sea at the lowest point on Earth. The itinerary balances these iconic experiences with discovering Jordan's rich history and dramatic landscapes as you travel through the kingdom. The true crescendo of the tour unfolds in the vast, silent beauty of Wadi Rum. After exploring its majestic sandstone mountains and sweeping red dunes by jeep, you'll prepare for the night's main event. Staying in a Bedouin camp chosen for its remoteness and minimal light pollution, you'll be perfectly positioned to witness the Perseid meteor shower. Imagine lying back on the desert sands, gazing up at the clear night sky as meteors blaze trails overhead – a truly magical experience deliberately scheduled as the tour's centrepiece. The standard tour price is based on comfortable 4-star hotels, however, an upgrade to superior grade hotels is also available, which enhances the accommodation used in Amman, Petra and the Dead Sea while the unique stay in Wadi Rum remains consistent across both options. 2027 is set to be an exciting year for astronomy enthusiasts, why not combine your time in Jordan with a once in a lifetime solar eclipse in Egypt on our Egypt Eclipse Adventure Tour",

      "description": "Explore Ancient Jerash and Amman, Street Food Experience & evening visit to the Wild Jordan Centre We begin our day travelling north from Amman to the nearby city of Jerash, home to one of the largest and best-preserved examples of Roman architecture outside of Italy. Often called the 'Jewel of the North', Jerash reveals an unbroken history of human settlement stretching back over 6,500 years. Hidden beneath sand for centuries, extensive excavations and restorations over the last 70 years have uncovered a remarkable example of the grand, formal Roman provincial urbanism typical throughout the Middle East. Upon returning to Amman in the afternoon, we explore Jordan's capital, famously known as the 'white city' due to its abundance of white limestone buildings. Amman's history spans millennia, with archaeological work uncovering remains from the Neolithic period through the Hellenistic, late Roman, and Arab Islamic eras. Our tour includes the Citadel, the historic site of the Temple of Hercules, the Umayyad Palace, and the Byzantine Church. We will also visit the impressive 6,000-seat Roman Theatre, dating back to when the city was known as Philadelphia. Following our exploration of the historical sites, we delve into the vibrant atmosphere of Downtown Amman with a street food tasting experience. You'll have the chance to sample local delicacies, which typically include sweet Kunefa, refreshing Sugar Cane Juice, and savoury Falafel, though specific offerings may vary based on availability during our visit. Afterwards, there will be time to return to the hotel to refresh before our evening activity. To conclude our day, we'll enjoy an evening visit to the Wild Jordan Centre. This unique establishment is not only a fantastic spot to relax but also plays a crucial role in supporting Jordan's natural heritage and local communities. It serves as a hub for the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature's ecotourism and handicraft projects, promoting sustainability by generating income for rural communities living in and around Jordan's nature reserves and aiding conservation efforts. For those who would prefer a more relaxed evening, you are welcome to remain at the hotel instead. OVERNIGHT"

      "description": "Kings Highway to Petra with stops in Madaba, Mount Nebo & Shobak Castle. Optional Petra by Night or Cookery Class We leave Amman behind us today as we drive along the scenic King's Highway towards Petra. The drive itself is beautiful, crossing deep wadis, passing through olive groves, and navigating remote rural villages, offering you a unique insight into the daily lives of the local people. Our first stop will be at Madaba, where we visit the Greek Orthodox Church of St. George, famed for its remarkable 6th-century Byzantine mosaic map depicting the Holy Land and other biblical sites. Next, we'll venture up Mount Nebo, a significant viewpoint offering breathtaking panoramic views over the Jordan Valley towards the Holy Land. We'll hit the road once more, this time crossing the stunning Wadi al-Mujib gorge. The route winds through olive groves before climbing over the deep canyon until we reach Shobak Castle. Perched dramatically on a mountainside, Shobak is another impressive example of the Crusader castles built during the early 12th century to guard the vital trade routes between Egypt and Damascus. Upon arrival in Petra, we'll check into our hotel. This evening offers two optional activities for you to choose from. You could opt for a magical first glimpse of Petra with the atmospheric Petra by Candlelight experience, walking through the Siq canyon to see the iconic Treasury illuminated solely by hundreds of candles. Alternatively, food enthusiasts might enjoy participating in a hands-on cooking class at the renowned Petra Kitchen, learning the secrets of preparing traditional Jordanian dishes. Please note that pre-booking is essential for the Petra Kitchen experience as it is very popular and spaces are limited. OVERNIGHT"

      "description": "Full day exploration of Petra. Astronomy experience and camping underneath the stars in Wadi Rum Today is all about exploring the Nabataean site of Petra. It was once the ancient capital of the Nabataean commercial empire until the Romans finally took over in 106 AD. For a long period, Petra was forgotten – except by the local Bedouins – before it was rediscovered in 1812 by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt. Petra is found at the edge of the Wadi Araba desert, where canyon walls and towering hills make it virtually inaccessible, except via a narrow cleft in the rock known as the Siq. There are very few free-standing buildings in Petra, as the Nabataeans chose to carve their dwellings into the multicoloured sandstone cliffs. Petra has become one of Jordan's main tourist attractions. We have most of the day available today to explore this ancient city (a 2-3 hour guided tour, then free time to explore independently). We start by making our way through the Siq, which rises to 200 metres above us and narrows to just 2 metres wide in certain sections. Keep an eye out for the ancient Nabataean water channel still visible on one wall, and remnants of the terracotta pipes that brought water into the city are also present. We'll turn a corner and suddenly – one of the most familiar sights of Petra will be in front of you – The Khazneh (Treasury) comes into view. Our guide will explain how this, and the other buildings here, are mainly elaborate facades carved into the rock from the top down, and also discuss the spiritual significance of the building style. From the Treasury, the valley opens out, and you'll see tombs carved into the rock on both sides. You'll get a glimpse of the ruined Roman amphitheatre and colonnaded streets. During your free time, you can walk up a steep and narrow winding gorge to the towering 'Monastery' – which is 50 metres high and 45 metres wide, providing breathtaking views of the Wadi Araba desert and the Jordan Valley. Another climb takes you to the High Place of Sacrifice and the Lion Fountain. All in all, this is a full and tiring, but hugely rewarding, day touring one of the world's most famous ancient sites. Walking distances today are an absolute minimum of 3km through the Siq to the Treasury and back, plus distance to see a few tombs; 8km to take the trail on as far as the main basin; plus an additional few km to the Monastery and back (over 800 steps up and down). For those with less mobility or who are worried about the distance golf buggies are available for around 25 USD per person one way 40 USD per person round trip to take you on the 1.2km journey through the Siq to the Treasury and back again at an agreed time. Horse carriages are also available but we recommend against using these due to animal welfare reasons. Later in the afternoon, we leave Petra and drive into the spectacular desert scenery of Wadi Rum. Whilst staying in Wadi Rum, several optional activities are available to enhance your desert experience, such as taking a traditional camel ride through the sand dunes, soaring above the landscape on a hot air balloon flight (typically at dawn, weather permitting), or enjoying an adventurous desert quad biking excursion. Upon arrival at our camp, friendly Bedouin hosts will greet us at our comfortable site, nestled beneath towering rocks and cliffs. We spend the evening relaxing at the camp and enjoying a delicious traditional Jordanian meal. As night falls and the stars emerge and we venture into the heart of Wadi Rum's captivating desert landscape after nightfall and witness a celestial display like no other. Far from city lights, the vast, clear skies above this ancient valley reveal a breathtaking panorama of stars. Our expert guides will illuminate the constellations, planets, and deep-sky objects visible to the naked eye, sharing fascinating insights into their mythology and scientific significance. Experience the profound silence and tranquillity of the desert night as you gaze upon the Milky Way's shimmering expanse. With the aid of powerful telescopes, you'll delve deeper into the universe, observing distant galaxies and nebulae with remarkable clarity. This is an unforgettable opportunity to connect with the cosmos and appreciate the sheer scale and beauty of the night sky in one of the world's most spectacular natural settings. OVERNIGHT"

      "description": "Half DAY Jeep Safari. Perseid Meteor Shower. Overnight at remote desert camp We start the day early, exploring the beautiful desert and mountain scenery of Wadi Rum. Keep an eye out for the copper-coloured rocky 'jebels', which mesmerised T.E. Lawrence during his visits to the desert during the Arab Revolt and were later famed in the movie Lawrence of Arabia. Today's Jeep Safari is specially extended compared to our standard Jordan tours, allowing for a much deeper exploration of this stunning desert landscape. This longer duration gives us ample time to venture further, seeing more of the sheer cliffs and bizarre, weathered rock formations, and includes time to visit the impressive natural rock arch. Our safari concludes this evening not at our usual camp, but at a second, more remote Bedouin site. Whilst this camp is more basic than our previous one, its location has been carefully selected as it offers the best possible conditions for viewing the spectacular Perseid Meteor Shower, far away from any significant light pollution. Later tonight, we'll head to a special spot close to the camp where foam pads will be provided, allowing you to lie back comfortably on the cool desert sands and watch the meteors streak across the vast night sky above. To enhance this unique experience, light snacks, tea, and coffee will also be provided under the stars. OVERNIGHT"

      "description": "Wadi Rum Jeep Safari and overnight stay at the Dead Sea (optional excursion to Wadi Mujib) We say goodbye to Wadi Rum this morning and head north towards the Dead Sea, one of the planet's most spectacular natural and spiritual landscapes. Not only is it the lowest point on Earth, at approximately 400 metres below sea level, but it's also filled with dramatic, natural wonders. The Dead Sea is fed by numerous rivers, including the River Jordan. Once the waters reach the Dead Sea, they are land-locked with no outlet, so they evaporate under the intense desert sun. This process leaves behind a dense, rich cocktail of salts and minerals, renowned worldwide and supplying the cosmetics, agriculture, and medicine industries with some of their finest raw products. The Dead Sea is flanked by mountains to the east and the rolling hills towards Jerusalem to the west, giving it an almost otherworldly beauty. Although sparsely populated and serenely quiet now, the area is believed by some to have been home to five Biblical cities"
