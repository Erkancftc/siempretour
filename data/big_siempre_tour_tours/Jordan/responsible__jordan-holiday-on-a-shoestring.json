  "generalInfo": "This tour of Jordan provides a great value introduction to the country's major sites including Amman, Jerash, Petra, Wadi Rum and the Dead Sea. <br/><br/>The bustling capital Amman is the springboard for a day trip out to the ancient Roman city at Jerash. One of the largest and best-preserved sites outside Italy, wander amid paved and colonnaded streets, hilltop temples, amphitheatres and spacious public squares. From here, you'll head across to the Dead Sea to enjoy floating effortlessly in its famously salty waters. <br/><br/>Heading south along the King Highway towards Petra, you'll experience a wonderfully scenic route taking in deep wadis, olive groves and characterful rural villages. Along the way, see Roman mosaics at Madaba, enjoy great views to Israel from Mt. Nebo, and visit the 12th century Crusader fortress of Kerak Castle.   <br/><br/>Your exploration of the wonderful \"Rose Red City\" of Petra includes a guided tour plus plenty of free time to wander on your own – perhaps walking along the ancient Siq and wondering at the majesty of the mighty Treasury built more than 2,000 years ago. There's an option too of returning to see this majestic memorial to past times by candlelight. <br/><br/>Moving on to Wadi Rum, you'll hear about its famous links to the legendary British army officer Lawrence of Arabia, as well as enjoying a 4WD jeep safari through spectacular desert scenery of  towering cliffs, bizarre rock formations and sandy dunes. <br/><br/>There are also some wonderful extensions to this trip, including a chance to spend a night under the stars at a Bedouin camp  inside the Wadi Rum reserve before returning to Amman. Alternatively, you can add three days by spending a night with the Bedouins then heading to the Red Sea for two-night kicking back in a 5-star beach resort before returning to Amman <br/><br/>This tour also connects well with our Fantastic Israel tour, and we can arrange overland or flight transfers to connect the two together.",

      "description": "Explore Ancient Jerash and Amman, Street Food Experience & evening visit to the Wild Jordan Centre We begin our day travelling north from Amman to the nearby city of Jerash, home to one of the largest and best-preserved examples of Roman architecture outside of Italy. Often called the 'Jewel of the North', Jerash reveals an unbroken history of human settlement stretching back over 6,500 years. Hidden beneath sand for centuries, extensive excavations and restorations over the last 70 years have uncovered a remarkable example of the grand, formal Roman provincial urbanism typical throughout the Middle East. Upon returning to Amman in the afternoon, we explore Jordan's capital, famously known as the 'white city' due to its abundance of white limestone buildings. Amman's history spans millennia, with archaeological work uncovering remains from the Neolithic period through the Hellenistic, late Roman, and Arab Islamic eras. Our tour includes the Citadel, the historic site of the Temple of Hercules, the Umayyad Palace, and the Byzantine Church. We will also visit the impressive 6,000-seat Roman Theatre, dating back to when the city was known as Philadelphia. Following our exploration of the historical sites, we delve into the vibrant atmosphere of Downtown Amman with a street food tasting experience. You'll have the chance to sample local delicacies, which typically include sweet Kunefa, refreshing Sugar Cane Juice, and savoury Falafel, though specific offerings may vary based on availability during our visit. Afterwards, there will be time to return to the hotel to refresh before our evening activity. To conclude our day, we'll enjoy an evening visit to the Wild Jordan Centre. This unique establishment is not only a fantastic spot to relax but also plays a crucial role in supporting Jordan's natural heritage and local communities. It serves as a hub for the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature's ecotourism and handicraft projects, promoting sustainability by generating income for rural communities living in and around Jordan's nature reserves and aiding conservation efforts. For those who would prefer a more relaxed evening, you are welcome to remain at the hotel instead. OVERNIGHT"

      "description": "Kings Highway to Petra with stops in Madaba, Mount Nebo & Shobak Castle. Optional Petra by Night or Cookery Class We leave Amman behind us today as we drive along the scenic King's Highway towards Petra. The drive itself is beautiful, crossing deep wadis, passing through olive groves, and navigating remote rural villages, offering you a unique insight into the daily lives of the local people. Our first stop will be at Madaba, where we visit the Greek Orthodox Church of St. George, famed for its remarkable 6th-century Byzantine mosaic map depicting the Holy Land and other biblical sites. Next, we'll venture up Mount Nebo, a significant viewpoint offering breathtaking panoramic views over the Jordan Valley towards the Holy Land. We'll hit the road once more, this time crossing the stunning Wadi al-Mujib gorge. The route winds through olive groves before climbing over the deep canyon until we reach Shobak Castle. Perched dramatically on a mountainside, Shobak is another impressive example of the Crusader castles built during the early 12th century to guard the vital trade routes between Egypt and Damascus. Upon arrival in Petra, we'll check into our hotel. This evening offers two optional activities for you to choose from. You could opt for a magical first glimpse of Petra with the atmospheric Petra by Candlelight experience, walking through the Siq canyon to see the iconic Treasury illuminated solely by hundreds of candles. Alternatively, food enthusiasts might enjoy participating in a hands-on cooking class at the renowned Petra Kitchen, learning the secrets of preparing traditional Jordanian dishes. Please note that pre-booking is essential for the Petra Kitchen experience as it is very popular and spaces are limited. OVERNIGHT"

      "description": "Full day exploration of Petra, camping underneath the stars in Wadi Rum Today is all about exploring the Nabataean site of Petra. It was once the ancient capital of the Nabataean commercial empire until the Romans finally took over in 106 AD. For a long period, Petra was forgotten – except by the local Bedouins – before it was rediscovered in 1812 by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt. Petra is found at the edge of the Wadi Araba desert, where canyon walls and towering hills make it virtually inaccessible, except via a narrow cleft in the rock known as the Siq. There are very few free-standing buildings in Petra, as the Nabataeans chose to carve their dwellings into the multicoloured sandstone cliffs. Petra has become one of Jordan's main tourist attractions. We have most of the day available today to explore this ancient city (a 2-3 hour guided tour, then free time to explore independently). We start by making our way through the Siq, which rises to 200 metres above us and narrows to just 2 metres wide in certain sections. Keep an eye out for the ancient Nabataean water channel still visible on one wall, and remnants of the terracotta pipes that brought water into the city are also present. We'll turn a corner and suddenly – one of the most familiar sights of Petra will be in front of you – The Khazneh (Treasury) comes into view. Our guide will explain how this, and the other buildings here, are mainly elaborate facades carved into the rock from the top down, and also discuss the spiritual significance of the building style. From the Treasury, the valley opens out, and you'll see tombs carved into the rock on both sides. You'll get a glimpse of the ruined Roman amphitheatre and colonnaded streets. During your free time, you can walk up a steep and narrow winding gorge to the towering 'Monastery' – which is 50 metres high and 45 metres wide, providing breathtaking views of the Wadi Araba desert and the Jordan Valley. Another climb takes you to the High Place of Sacrifice and the Lion Fountain. All in all, this is a full and tiring, but hugely rewarding, day touring one of the world's most famous ancient sites. Walking distances today are an absolute minimum of 3km through the Siq to the Treasury and back, plus distance to see a few tombs; 8km to take the trail on as far as the main basin; plus an additional few km to the Monastery and back (over 800 steps up and down). For those with less mobility or who are worried about the distance golf buggies are available for around 25 USD per person one way 40 USD per person round trip to take you on the 1.2km journey through the Siq to the Treasury and back again at an agreed time. Horse carriages are also available but we recommend against using these due to animal welfare reasons. Later in the afternoon, we leave Petra and drive into the spectacular desert scenery of Wadi Rum. Whilst staying in Wadi Rum, several optional activities are available to enhance your desert experience, such as taking a traditional camel ride through the sand dunes, soaring above the landscape on a hot air balloon flight (typically at dawn, weather permitting), or enjoying an adventurous desert quad biking excursion. Upon arrival at our camp, friendly Bedouin hosts will greet us at our comfortable site, nestled beneath towering rocks and cliffs. We spend the evening relaxing at the camp and enjoying a delicious traditional Jordanian meal. As night falls and the stars emerge, there is also an option to join a captivating astronomy experience, taking advantage of Wadi Rum's exceptionally clear desert skies and unique vantage point to observe stars, constellations, and planets in incredible detail. OVERNIGHT"

      "description": "Wadi Rum Jeep Safari and overnight stay at the Dead Sea (optional excursion to Wadi Mujib) We start the day early, exploring the beautiful desert and mountain scenery of Wadi Rum. Keep an eye out for the copper-coloured rocky 'jebels', which mesmerised T.E. Lawrence during his visits to the desert during the Arab Revolt and were later famed in the movie Lawrence of Arabia. We'll take a jeep safari through the stunning desert landscape, seeing more of the sheer cliffs and bizarre, weathered rock formations. We say goodbye to Wadi Rum later in the morning and head north towards the Dead Sea, one of the planet's most spectacular natural and spiritual landscapes. Not only is it the lowest point on Earth, at approximately 400 metres below sea level, but it's also filled with dramatic, natural wonders. The Dead Sea is fed by numerous rivers, including the River Jordan. Once the waters reach the Dead Sea, they are land-locked with no outlet, so they evaporate under the intense desert sun. This process leaves behind a dense, rich cocktail of salts and minerals, renowned worldwide and supplying the cosmetics, agriculture, and medicine industries with some of their finest raw products. The Dead Sea is flanked by mountains to the east and the rolling hills towards Jerusalem to the west, giving it an almost otherworldly beauty. Although sparsely populated and serenely quiet now, the area is believed by some to have been home to five Biblical cities"
