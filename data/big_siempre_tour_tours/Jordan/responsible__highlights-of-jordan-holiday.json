After touring the historical highlights of Amman, you’ll head for Jerash, one of the world's best preserved Roman provincial cities. Then it’s on to Petra, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, where you’ll have a full day to explore its many treasures.<br/><br/>The next day is spent in Wadi Rum, where you’ll take a jeep tour through the desert and have the opportunity to ride a camel, should you choose. You’ll be camping out in the desert and can either spend the night in a tent, or sleep on a mattress outside underneath the silence of a starry sky. Aqaba is the next destination, with its stunning beaches, fantastic snorkelling and crusaders castle. <br/><br/>After touring all of Jordan’s highlights, you get to spend a well deserved day at the Dead Sea. Here you may float in the salty waters or try out a pampering spa treatment. Being at the lowest point on earth is a unique experience; you can't swim in the water no matter how hard you try! <br/>",
