    "generalInfo": "Jordan is nothing short of extraordinary.<br/><br/>This nine-day small group tour takes you along the King’s Highway from the capital, Amman, to the iconic rose-red city of Petra, a UNESCO World Heritage Site carved into the rocks. From there you’ll explore the magnificent Wadi Rum, once a base for ‘Lawrence of Arabia’, and stay overnight in a desert camp to experience true Bedouin hospitality. And to finish, a few days by the coast in Aqaba, during which you can snorkel over coral reefs in the Red Sea, then take a memorable float in the salty Dead Sea. <br/><br/>Already you're tempted, no?<br/><br/>Let's explore further...<br/><br/>Along the way you will visit ancient crusader castles and Roman ruins, including hilltop temples and a chariot-racing stadium. You will see the stunning Byzantine mosaics of Madaba, with its 6th century map of the Holy Land and Jerusalem.<br/><br/>Over two days in Petra you will take a guided tour around its must-see landmarks, including the renowned Treasury, a site that was kept secret by the Bedouins for centuries and remains remarkably well preserved. You can also trek up to the Royal Tombs and Monastery if you wish, to bask in some truly spectacular views.<br/><br/>In Wadi Rum, which T.E. Lawrence described as “vast, echoing and God-like”, learn about traditional Bedouin lifestyles in such a harsh environment, before dining on a feast cooked in the ancient way, beneath the sand. Then you can enjoy unparalleled views of the starry skies, and relax in the intimate, comfortable camp. What a place to spend a night.<br/><br/>Before returning to Amman, there’s time to cool down a little. In Aqaba, your tour leader can arrange optional activities for you such as snorkeling in the Red Sea, and you certainly won’t want to miss a chance to visit the Dead Sea. The high saline count in this water means no animal life can survive in it, but it is said to cure all manner of ills. And it’s practically impossible to sink!<br/><br/>",

        "description": ": Our tour of Jordan starts in Amman, one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world. Home to almost half of Jordan's entire population, Amman is a fascinating city of contrasts, where the ancient and the modern collide. Get lost in the bustling souks of downtown, where you'll be tempted by falafel and baklawa stalls, or visit the hillside Roman Theatre for a taster of the city's varied history. There are no activities planned for today, so you're free to arrive in Amman at any time. If you'd like an airport transfer, you'll need to arrive at Queen Alia International Airport (AMM), a 30-minute drive from our hotel. Due to most flights arriving late in the evening, our Explore Leader will meet you for a welcome meeting the next morning. You'll find the meeting information on the notice board in the hotel reception."

        "description": ": After breakfast, we'll gather for an introductory meeting before heading north of Amman to ancient Jerash. Inhabited for 6,500 years, the city's golden age was in Roman times when it became part of the Decapolis League - a confederation of important Middle Eastern cities. One of the best-preserved Roman ruins in the world, only 10% of the city has been uncovered since excavation began more than 100 years ago but you can still get a feel for how life in the city once was. Walk the colonnaded streets, visit the hilltop temples, explore the chariot-racing stadium, and hear your voice amplified in the ancient theatre. After lunch, we'll travel back to Amman and spend the afternoon exploring the city. Our first stop is the Citadel Jabal al-Qal'a, the highest point in Amman, giving us panoramic views across the sprawling capital. Artifacts found here indicate that the area has been a royal city for thousands of years. Whilst earthquakes and invasions have taken their toll, two pillars of the Roman Temple of Hercules still stand strong alongside parts of the 7\\super th\\nosupersub -century Umayyad Palace. Making our way downtown, we'll weave our way through the winding streets of the souk, soaking up the energetic ambiance and the aroma of spices and delicacies on sale. We'll finish up in an old-style café that transports us back to Amman's early days."

Aptly dubbed the 'City of Mosaics', Madaba is home to hundreds of Byzantine-era mosaics, the most famous of these is a 6\\super th\\nosupersub -century map of Jerusalem and the Holy Land, created with two million pieces of stone. Continuing on, we'll arrive at Mount Nebo, referenced in the Old Testament as the place where Moses once stood to look over the Promised Land. On a clear day, from here you can see out to the Dead Sea, Bethlehem, and Jerusalem. Next, we'll journey south along the King's Highway to Kerak. This ancient Crusader stronghold is the most famous in a chain of fortresses built for the Holy War against Islam. We'll stop to learn about its history and explore the maze of stone-vaulted halls and passageways. Our day of sightseeing ends in Petra, a short drive from Kerak. A UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the seven wonders of the world, the ancient 'rose city' is Jordan's most valuable treasure. Depending on the day, we might arrive in time to experience Petra by Night. Follow the candlelit Siq trail and watch how the light plays against the high canyon rocks, blanketed by stars, before coming upon the Treasury, lit up by night. Settle into the sands in front of the ancient temple and listen to a welcome speech from the Bedouin community that still calls the city home."

        "description": ": Today we begin two full days exploring Petra. This ancient city, carved into pink sandstone cliffs, has to be seen to be believed but poet John Burgon beautifully described it as 'A rose-red city half as old as time'. Our Explore Leader will guide us on a tour through Petra's highlights before a free afternoon to wander at our own pace. As you enter the site, you're led down a kilometre-long chasm (known as the Siq) where the towering canyon walls reach up to 200 metres high. At the end of the Siq sits the beating heart of the city, the Treasury - miraculously well-preserved, the façade stands at 43-metres-high. Beyond the Treasury, the ancient city becomes a sprawl of tombs and temples waiting to be explored. The Bedouin community who still live within Petra sell their wares and offer refreshments along the colonnaded streets. As the day goes on, you'll notice the façades change colour with the light as the early morning and late afternoon sun brings out red, pink, and orange highlights in the rocks. Please note: The hotel location will depend on your departure date. All hotels are within a 5-10-minute walk from the visitor's centre or a 25-minute walk away from the site in Wadi Musa. Transportation will be provided for groups based in Wadi Musa on day 4. On day 5 no transportation is provided, but you can take a taxi for around £2-£4 each way. Your hotel will be listed in your final documentation."

We'll travel to the Wadi Rum visitor's centre by bus, where we'll meet our 4WD vehicles to journey onwards through the desert. Our three-hour drive along the sands will lead us through untouched parts of Wadi Rum and our Explore Leader will stop to tell us more about the history of the desert. Described by T.E. Lawrence as 'vast, echoing and God-like…', Wadi Rum occupies 74,000 acres with its monolithic outcrops of granite rock and sandstone rising out of the blankets of sand. The Bedouins learned to live within this hostile environment 3000 years ago, adapting to the elements to perfect their nomadic way of life. Once we've watched the sun go down, setting the dunes aglow with fiery red and orange light, we'll head back to camp to experience Bedouin hospitality. We'll be served a traditional Zarb, a BBQ of chicken or goat meat (vegetarian options will be available) cooked under the desert sand and served alongside a selection of mezze. Tonight, we'll sleep in a traditional Bedouin tent, crafted from goat hair which offers the best protection against the extreme desert climate. We'll share a communal tent (with gendered compartments) with rugs, mattresses, pillows, and blankets provided. There's a toilet and shower block at the end of the site. You can upgrade to a private tent at no extra cost, subject to availability. Please speak to your leader about arranging one."

While we're there, you can cover yourself in the water's rejuvenating mud, famous for its healing properties. After your dip, feel free to unwind by the pool or at the bar - there are shower facilities to freshen up in, too. Finally, we'll drive onwards to Amman.

We can tailor-make your diving holiday to include as much or as little as you would like – maybe add a visit on to the Dead Sea, Wadi Rum or Jerash?  Jordan is full of “hidden gems” so whether it is just a week's diving in Aqaba you are after or a complete Jordan adventure, our specialist team can guide you to your ultimate Jordan diving holiday experience.<br/><br/>This is a fantastic nine day tour which starts off with a visit to the wonderful Petra, a World Heritage site and one of the Seven Wonders of the World.  This ancient city is a unique example of an astonishing ancient civilisation and is known as the Rose City due to the colour of the Sharah Mountain stone out of which it was carved by the Nabateans. The city was lost to civilisation until it was rediscovered in 1812 by the Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt. Walk through the Siq, a narrow and winding fissure between the cliffs, to reach the Treasury, the Roman Theatre, the Courts, Qasr Bint Pharaoun,Temple of the Winged Lion and other monuments.  This is an experience never to be forgotten.<br/><br/>Your holiday then continues on to Aqaba for the ultimate in a Red Sea diving experience.  There are over 30 dive sites to visit along the Aqaba coastline most of which are in the Aqaba Marine Park.  With each dive being different from the next, from shallow coral gardens and pinnacles to deep canyons and shipwrecks there is something here for every diver.  One of the most famous dive sites is the Cedar Pride Wreck.  It was deliberately sunk nearly 30 years ago and has been described as one of the most photogenic wrecks of the Red Sea.  It lies on her port side between Rainbow Reef and the Japanese Gardens.  With a maximum depth of 25 metres and the top mast reaching 7 metres she makes a great dive for all levels of experience.  You are able to enter the wreck but that is only possible for those divers with the appropriate training.<br/><br/>With warm waters year round and great visibility the diving here is suitable for all levels of diving, from the complete beginner to the more experienced technical diver.",

Beginning in the bustling capital of Amman, the tour quickly immerses you in local life with a visit to the historic hilltop town of As-Salt. Here, you'll walk the 'Daily Life Trail', exploring its charming Ottoman-era architecture, bustling souqs along Hammam Street, and engaging with local artisans, all while supporting sustainable community tourism. The day continues with a visit to the significant Baptism Site at Bethany before returning to Amman. The adventure proceeds north to the magnificent Roman ruins of Jerash, one of the best-preserved examples of Roman provincial urbanism outside Italy. Back in Amman, you'll delve into the capital's rich past at the Citadel and the impressive Roman Theatre, followed by a delightful street food tasting experience in the lively downtown area. An evening visit to the Wild Jordan Centre highlights the country's commitment to conservation and supporting local communities through ecotourism, offering a relaxing end to a day of exploration. The tour then heads south along the scenic King's Highway, a route steeped in history, stopping at the mosaic city of Madaba, the biblical viewpoint of Mount Nebo, and the imposing Crusader fortress of Shobak Castle. The highlight for many follows: a full day dedicated to exploring the awe-inspiring Nabataean city of Petra. You'll walk through the narrow Siq to marvel at the Treasury, discover ancient tombs carved into sandstone cliffs, and have free time to climb to viewpoints like the Monastery. The experience shifts dramatically as you travel to the spectacular desert landscapes of Wadi Rum for an overnight stay in a traditional Bedouin camp, complete with a jeep safari through the mesmerising 'jebels' and optional desert activities like camel riding or stargazing. Concluding the journey, you'll travel to the lowest point on Earth, the Dead Sea. Here, you'll have ample time to experience the unique sensation of floating effortlessly in the hyper-saline waters and benefit from the mineral-rich mud. An optional trek through the water-filled canyons of nearby Wadi Mujib offers a final thrill for the adventurous. The tour wraps up with free time back in Amman for last-minute exploration or relaxation before your departure, concluding an unforgettable exploration of Jordan's most treasured sites. The standard tour price is based on comfortable 3 to 4-star hotels, however, an upgrade to superior grade hotels is also available, which enhances the accommodation used in Amman, Petra and the Dead Sea while the unique stay in Wadi Rum remains consistent across both options",

Visit the Baptism Site in Bethany We start the day with a visit to the hilltop town of As-Salt, a UNESCO World Heritage site recognised for its tolerance and hospitality, which once served as a trading link between the Jordan Valley and the Eastern Desert. As-Salt is known for its impressive Ottoman-era architecture built using yellow limestone, with distinctive domed roofs and arched windows. Today, the town serves as an example of the religious and cultural friendship between the local Muslim & Christian population. To experience its authentic atmosphere, we'll head out on a walking tour of its 'Daily Life Trail'. This route focuses on the vibrant market area (souq) along Hammam Street, the town's main commercial artery for generations. Here, bustling shops sell a wide array of goods – fresh produce at the farmers' market, aromatic spices, traditional clothing, intricate gold and silver items in the jewellery market, local sweets, perfumes, nuts, and handmade crafts from local artisans. The trail allows us to see locals go about their day, perhaps gathering in Al Ain Plaza (the central square, historically a water source and traders' meeting point) to chat or play the traditional board game, Mangaleh. We'll visit key sites like the beautifully restored Historic Old Salt Museum housed in the magnificent Abu Jaber House, pass by the Great Mosque, climb the Al-Eskafyeh stairs historically lined with shoemakers still plying their trade, sample traditional Shrak bread hot from A'shour Bakery, observe local artisans at work, and truly absorb the unique culture, textures, and sounds of the Salti lifestyle, all while supporting the local community and promoting sustainable tourism through direct engagement with authentic, independent businesses and traditions. We'll have lunch with a local family today, giving you your first taste of Jordanian cuisine (this is group size dependent, if the group is too large, we will head to a local restaurant). This meal further supports the local economy and offers genuine cultural exchange, reinforcing the sustainable approach. After lunch, we make our way to the Baptism site at Bethany, which is an excavated site believed to be the place where John baptised Jesus Christ. Many churches, caves and pools dating back to Roman & Byzantine periods have been found here. We'll also visit key sites there"

        "description": "Explore Ancient Jerash and Amman, Street Food Experience & evening visit to the Wild Jordan Centre We begin our day travelling north from Amman to the nearby city of Jerash, home to one of the largest and best-preserved examples of Roman architecture outside of Italy. Often called the 'Jewel of the North', Jerash reveals an unbroken history of human settlement stretching back over 6,500 years. Hidden beneath sand for centuries, extensive excavations and restorations over the last 70 years have uncovered a remarkable example of the grand, formal Roman provincial urbanism typical throughout the Middle East. Upon returning to Amman in the afternoon, we explore Jordan's capital, famously known as the 'white city' due to its abundance of white limestone buildings. Amman's history spans millennia, with archaeological work uncovering remains from the Neolithic period through the Hellenistic, late Roman, and Arab Islamic eras. Our tour includes the Citadel, the historic site of the Temple of Hercules, the Umayyad Palace, and the Byzantine Church. We will also visit the impressive 6,000-seat Roman Theatre, dating back to when the city was known as Philadelphia. Following our exploration of the historical sites, we delve into the vibrant atmosphere of Downtown Amman with a street food tasting experience. You'll have the chance to sample local delicacies, which typically include sweet Kunefa, refreshing Sugar Cane Juice, and savoury Falafel, though specific offerings may vary based on availability during our visit. Afterwards, there will be time to return to the hotel to refresh before our evening activity. To conclude our day, we'll enjoy an evening visit to the Wild Jordan Centre. This unique establishment is not only a fantastic spot to relax but also plays a crucial role in supporting Jordan's natural heritage and local communities. It serves as a hub for the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature's ecotourism and handicraft projects, promoting sustainability by generating income for rural communities living in and around Jordan's nature reserves and aiding conservation efforts. For those who would prefer a more relaxed evening, you are welcome to remain at the hotel instead. OVERNIGHT"

Optional Petra by Night or Cookery Class We leave Amman behind us today as we drive along the scenic King's Highway towards Petra. The drive itself is beautiful, crossing deep wadis, passing through olive groves, and navigating remote rural villages, offering you a unique insight into the daily lives of the local people. Our first stop will be at Madaba, where we visit the Greek Orthodox Church of St. George, famed for its remarkable 6th-century Byzantine mosaic map depicting the Holy Land and other biblical sites. Next, we'll venture up Mount Nebo, a significant viewpoint offering breathtaking panoramic views over the Jordan Valley towards the Holy Land. We'll hit the road once more, this time crossing the stunning Wadi al-Mujib gorge. The route winds through olive groves before climbing over the deep canyon until we reach Shobak Castle. Perched dramatically on a mountainside, Shobak is another impressive example of the Crusader castles built during the early 12th century to guard the vital trade routes between Egypt and Damascus. Upon arrival in Petra, we'll check into our hotel. This evening offers two optional activities for you to choose from. You could opt for a magical first glimpse of Petra with the atmospheric Petra by Candlelight experience, walking through the Siq canyon to see the iconic Treasury illuminated solely by hundreds of candles. Alternatively, food enthusiasts might enjoy participating in a hands-on cooking class at the renowned Petra Kitchen, learning the secrets of preparing traditional Jordanian dishes.

        "description": "Full day exploration of Petra, camping underneath the stars in Wadi Rum Today is all about exploring the Nabataean site of Petra. It was once the ancient capital of the Nabataean commercial empire until the Romans finally took over in 106 AD. For a long period, Petra was forgotten – except by the local Bedouins – before it was rediscovered in 1812 by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt. Petra is found at the edge of the Wadi Araba desert, where canyon walls and towering hills make it virtually inaccessible, except via a narrow cleft in the rock known as the Siq. There are very few free-standing buildings in Petra, as the Nabataeans chose to carve their dwellings into the multicoloured sandstone cliffs. Petra has become one of Jordan's main tourist attractions. We have most of the day available today to explore this ancient city (a 2-3 hour guided tour, then free time to explore independently). We start by making our way through the Siq, which rises to 200 metres above us and narrows to just 2 metres wide in certain sections. Keep an eye out for the ancient Nabataean water channel still visible on one wall, and remnants of the terracotta pipes that brought water into the city are also present. We'll turn a corner and suddenly – one of the most familiar sights of Petra will be in front of you – The Khazneh (Treasury) comes into view. Our guide will explain how this, and the other buildings here, are mainly elaborate facades carved into the rock from the top down, and also discuss the spiritual significance of the building style. From the Treasury, the valley opens out, and you'll see tombs carved into the rock on both sides. You'll get a glimpse of the ruined Roman amphitheatre and colonnaded streets. During your free time, you can walk up a steep and narrow winding gorge to the towering 'Monastery' – which is 50 metres high and 45 metres wide, providing breathtaking views of the Wadi Araba desert and the Jordan Valley. Another climb takes you to the High Place of Sacrifice and the Lion Fountain. All in all, this is a full and tiring, but hugely rewarding, day touring one of the world's most famous ancient sites. Walking distances today are an absolute minimum of 3km through the Siq to the Treasury and back, plus distance to see a few tombs; 8km to take the trail on as far as the main basin; plus an additional few km to the Monastery and back (over 800 steps up and down). For those with less mobility or who are worried about the distance golf buggies are available for around 25 USD per person one way 40 USD per person round trip to take you on the 1.2km journey through the Siq to the Treasury and back again at an agreed time. Horse carriages are also available but we recommend against using these due to animal welfare reasons. Later in the afternoon, we leave Petra and drive into the spectacular desert scenery of Wadi Rum. Whilst staying in Wadi Rum, several optional activities are available to enhance your desert experience, such as taking a traditional camel ride through the sand dunes, soaring above the landscape on a hot air balloon flight (typically at dawn, weather permitting), or enjoying an adventurous desert quad biking excursion. Upon arrival at our camp, friendly Bedouin hosts will greet us at our comfortable site, nestled beneath towering rocks and cliffs. We spend the evening relaxing at the camp and enjoying a delicious traditional Jordanian meal. As night falls and the stars emerge, there is also an option to join a captivating astronomy experience, taking advantage of Wadi Rum's exceptionally clear desert skies and unique vantage point to observe stars, constellations, and planets in incredible detail.

        "description": "Wadi Rum Jeep Safari and overnight stay at the Dead Sea (optional excursion to Wadi Mujib) We start the day early, exploring the beautiful desert and mountain scenery of Wadi Rum. Keep an eye out for the copper-coloured rocky 'jebels', which mesmerised T.E. Lawrence during his visits to the desert during the Arab Revolt and were later famed in the movie Lawrence of Arabia. We'll take a jeep safari through the stunning desert landscape, seeing more of the sheer cliffs and bizarre, weathered rock formations. We say goodbye to Wadi Rum later in the morning and head north towards the Dead Sea, one of the planet's most spectacular natural and spiritual landscapes. Not only is it the lowest point on Earth, at approximately 400 metres below sea level, but it's also filled with dramatic, natural wonders. The Dead Sea is fed by numerous rivers, including the River Jordan. Once the waters reach the Dead Sea, they are land-locked with no outlet, so they evaporate under the intense desert sun. This process leaves behind a dense, rich cocktail of salts and minerals, renowned worldwide and supplying the cosmetics, agriculture, and medicine industries with some of their finest raw products. The Dead Sea is flanked by mountains to the east and the rolling hills towards Jerusalem to the west, giving it an almost otherworldly beauty. Although sparsely populated and serenely quiet now, the area is believed by some to have been home to five Biblical cities"

Active families will enjoy hiking up to the 'High Place of Sacrifice' where the children's imaginations will be set to work picturing the gory practices that may have taken place there two thousand years ago. It is also worth climbing to the Monastery (although you can ride on a donkey if the legs are getting tired) as the views out over the desert beyond are breath-taking.<br/><br/>Not too far from Petra is the incredible desert area of Wadi Rum, famous for its connection with Lawrence of Arabia. The kids will love a 4WD jeep excursion across this incredible landscape, stopping to climb up (and race down) giant sand dunes and clamber over strange rock formations. You can also take a camel ride at sunset before heading for your Bedoiun tent and dinner around the camp fire.<br/><br/>The Dead Sea is also great fun for children as they can float in its buoyant waters and cover themselves in mud which reputedly has wonderful healing qualities.<br/><br/>Aqaba is the seaside city of Jordan and is famous for its coral and spectacular sea life. You can don a snorkel and mask and discover the underwater world, or with younger children, perhaps take a ride on a glass bottomed boat.<br/>Jordan is an incredibly welcoming country, particularly for those travelling with children and the distances are relatively small so it does not take too long to get around.",

There is heaps of fun and exciting activities to try, from sandboarding in the dunes of Wadi Rum to snorkelling off the beach in Aqaba or some light trekking in the Dana Nature Reserve, Jordan’s largest. And this is combined with many opportunities to simply wind down and enjoy each other’s company, whether that be watching as the kids run around living out their fantasies in a genuine Crusaders’ Castle, learning through play at a Children’s Museum, or indulging in some downtime at a spa resort on the Dead Sea.<br/><br/>And of course this is Jordan, once the battleground of the great British adventurer, soldier, explorer and diplomat T.E. Lawrence. You have his colourful history to explore, and you have those classic Jordan experiences that appear on the bucket list of so many intrepid travellers: journeying into the desert to the spectacular architectural work of art that is Petra; staying overnight in an authentic Bedouin camp where your hospitable hosts will keep you entertained around the campfire, and of course a memorable float in the Dead Sea.<br/><br/>Jordan is perhaps not the first place that springs to mind when planning a family holiday, but once you do start to think about it, it kind of seems the obvious destination. As we’ve hopefully convinced you here. The people are friendly and welcoming, and trips here run like well-oiled clockwork. It’s the type of place where people might say “Jordan? What are you all going to do there?” And you can then look through this itinerary with confidence and know that you, and your family, are going to absolutely love every minute. <br/>",

That night you’ll stay in a Bedouin encampment in Wadi Rum, sleeping beneath the stars – an exciting and unforgettable way to discover the traditional ways of life of these nomadic people.<br/><br/>As you make your way through Wadi Rum and the desert towards the Dead Sea you’ll admire some truly jaw-dropping scenery, so cameras should be at the ready throughout. Take to the salty waters for a float (you can’t swim) and you’ll find the minerals do wonders for the skin. <br/><br/>The tour ends where it began, in Amman. But not before a day spend roaming a handful of Jordan’s historic ‘Desert Castles’, built on old trade routes and fine examples of early Islamic architecture. And you’ll also venture to the Aqraq Wetland Reserve and the Shaumari Wildlife Reserve, to learn about the many species both native and migratory that dwell in these protected landscapes. There is the option to arrange a safari in Shaumari, where you might see striped hyenas, pallid harriers, even wolves. And your group’s visit serves to boost the reserves’ conservation efforts through paying the entrance fees. <br/><br/>Note that this tour can easily be combined with Egypt or Israel, and that you can opt for a tailor made version if you would prefer not to travel in a group. While excellent three-star hotels are used, upgrades to four- or five-star properties are possible too, as is adding in some more relaxation time perhaps around the Red Sea in Aqaba. <br/>",

As-Salt was a trading link between the Jordan Valley and the Eastern Desert as well as the former capital of Amman. Your guide will show you around the snaking narrow streets and point out the elaborate Islamic architecture made from yellow limestone. Today, this town is an example of the religious and cultural friendship between the local Muslim and Christian population. You will stroll along the self-designed 'Harmony Trail' and learn more about the history of the town and its people. Lunch will be served with a local family and you will get to sample some traditional delicacies. After lunch, you can meander out of the hills to the Baptism Site at Bethany. This site was recently excavated and is believed to be the biblical 'Bethany-beyond-the-Jordan' - the place where John baptised Jesus Christ. You will also see an assortment of churches, caves and pools from the Roman and Byzantine periods. Your guide will describe to you how both Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI visited this area. An electric minibus will drive you from the visitors centre to the three sites of Mar Elias, the Baptism Pools and John the Baptist's Church.

For centuries, this site was buried under layers of sand and was only discovered 70 years ago. Jerash is a significant model of Roman urbanism with its public squares, plazas, colonnaded streets, hilltop temples and theatres. The afternoon will then be spent seeing more of Amman and understanding its history. Your expert guide will describe in detail how many archaeological discoveries have uncovered remains from the Neolithic period as well as the Hellenistic and late Roman to Arab Islamic Ages. The walking tour will begin at the Citadel, home to the ancient Hercules Temple, the Byzantine Church, the Umayyad Palace and a 6000-seater Roman theatre, built during the Roman Period.

Before you arrive in Petra, the tour will stop at Madaba and you can check out the Greek Orthodox Church of St. George - famous for its 6th century-old Byzantine mosaic map of the Holy Land and other biblical sites. Your guide will lead you to Mount Nebo, the known burial place of Moses with some magnificent views of the Holy Land. The tour will then drive south over more gaping wadis and canyons to reach the Kerak Castle - one of many Crusader fortresses sprinkled across Jordan in the 12th century.

This site was the capital of the ancient Nabatean commercial empire until the Romans seized power in 106AD. Sitting on the edge of Wadi Aruba, the Siq is the best way to get into the site. It is a twisting tunnel that cuts through the canyon walls and hills. In Petra, you will soon see that there are not many freestanding buildings as the Nabateans liked to construct their homes into the pink sandstone cliffs. Your guide will take you into the city and you can also enjoy some free time to wander around by yourself. The Siq is the starting point for the guided tour and continues to Khazneh, one of the most impressive temples in Petra. As you walk, your guide will describe how the houses were carved and the spiritual importance of the site. The tour will also include the ancient ruined Roman amphitheater and the colonnaded street. In your free time you should head up the gorge to the Monastery - the largest of Petra's carved monuments. This uphill walk can take some time, but the vista over the Wadi Aruba and the Jordan Valley is worth it. If you have the energy, keep going until you reach the High Place of Sacrifice and the Lion Fountain. | OVERNIGHT"

Traversing by jeep safari, the tour will go past sharp cliffs and striking rock formations. The tour will turn north and go towards the Dead Sea - one of the world's most remarkable destinations. The Dead Sea is the lowest point on earth at 400 metres below sea level and is a most stunning sight. A variety of rivers including the River Jordan flow into this sea. As these rivers are landlocked, they then evaporate and create a combination of salt and minerals, which make high quality products for industries. There is a range of mountains surrounding the Dead Sea and the hills of Jerusalem lie to the west. This region is now sparsely populated, but was believed to have been home to the five biblical cities of Sodom, Gomorrah, Adman, Zebouin and Zoar (Bela). You will also get a chance to bath in these salubrious and salty waters. As a result of the large amount of salt, normal swimming is not possible so it is better to float or sit in the water. You should avoid getting any salt water in your eyes, as it will sting. The day will conclude back at your hotel in Amman. | OVERNIGHT"

        "description": "Desert Castles and nature reserves After you have eaten breakfast, the tour will leave from Amman to find Jordan's Desert Castles - remnants of early Islamic art and architecture. These 'castles' were constructed on the old trade routes during the Umayyad era and look like forts, bathhouses and palaces rather than castles. Your guide will point out the remaining mosaics, frescoes, carvings and illustrations that were inspired by Persian and Graeco-Roman traditions - offering insight into life during the 8th century. The tour will travel around the castles of Qasr al-Kharrana, Qal'at al-Azraq and Qseirr Amra. The tour will then visit the nature reserves run by the Jordanian Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature (RSCN). The first reserve, the Aqraq Wetland Reserve is a serene haven in the eastern desert, set between a limestone desert in the west and a basalt desert in the east. This sanctuary is filled with marshland, pools and streams that attract a variety of migratory birds on the Africa-Eurasian flyway. The second reserve is the Shaumari Wildlife Reserve, which was originally a breeding and reintroduction centre for globally threatened and locally extinct wildlife, particularly the Arabia oryx. Over the years, rare animals have resided in the reserve, including ostriches struthio, goitered gazelles and Persian onagers. Red foxes, wild cats, striped hyenas, caracals and wolves also live in the area. Bird lovers should keep an eye out for imperial eagles, pallid harriers and Egyptian vultures. The visitor's centre on site is an excellent starting point and guided safaris are also available in the reserves. You can arrange a safari with your tour if there is time and availability before the tour returns to Amman. For your last evening we suggest going to Downtown Amman and indulging in some Jordanian dishes. You shouldn't leave without trying the national dish of Jordan, Mansaf (lamb cooked in a sauce of fermented yogurt) or tucking into falafel and hummus along with a sweet dessert. | OVERNIGHT"

Get lost in the bustling souks of downtown, where you'll be tempted by falafel and baklawa stalls, or visit the hillside Roman Theatre for a taster of the city's varied history. There are no activities planned for today, so you're free to arrive in Amman at any time. If you'd like an airport transfer, you'll need to arrive at Queen Alia International Airport (AMM), a 30-minute drive from our hotel. Due to most flights arriving late in the evening, our Explore Leader will meet you for a welcome meeting the next morning. You'll find the meeting information on the notice board in the hotel reception."

Inhabited for 6,500 years, the city's golden age was in Roman times when it became part of the Decapolis League - a confederation of important Middle Eastern cities. One of the best-preserved Roman ruins in the world, only 10% of the city has been uncovered since excavation began more than 100 years ago but you can still get a feel for how life in the city once was. Walk the colonnaded streets, visit the hilltop temples, explore the chariot-racing stadium, and hear your voice amplified in the ancient theatre. Next, we'll stop in Madaba - a town with a strong Christian heritage. Aptly dubbed the 'City of Mosaics', Madaba is home to hundreds of Byzantine-era mosaics, the most famous of these is a 6th-century map of Jerusalem and the Holy Land, created with two million pieces of stone. We'll visit a workshop to learn how mosaics are made today before returning to Amman. Back in Amman, there'll be time to explore the city further. Uncover the Temple of Hercules in the heart of the city and explore the art galleries, boutiques, and coffee shops in the downtown neighbourhood."

While we're there, you can cover yourself in the water's rejuvenating mud, famous for its healing properties. After your dip, feel free to unwind by the pool or at the bar - there are shower facilities to freshen up in, too. Afterwards, we'll continue along the King's Highway - one of the oldest trading routes in the world, which once carried the treasure-laden caravan of Solomon. Our next stop is Kerak. This ancient Crusader stronghold is the most famous in a chain of fortresses built for the Holy War against Islam. We'll take time to learn about its history and explore the maze of stone-vaulted halls and passageways. From Kerak, we'll continue south to Siq al-Barid, also known as Little Petra. Our base for tonight is a traditional Bedouin camp located a ten-minute walk from the entrance to Little Petra. Feel free to take a stroll from the camp to the site and walk in the footsteps of the Nabateans as you explore the temples and tombs carved into the rocks. We'll gather at our camp to watch the sun sink into the dunes and share a traditional dinner before a spot of stargazing."

As you enter the site, you're led down a kilometre-long chasm (known as the Siq) where the towering canyon walls reach up to 200 metres high. At the end of the Siq sits the beating heart of the city, the Treasury - miraculously well-preserved, the façade stands at 43-metres-high. Beyond the Treasury, the ancient city becomes a sprawl of tombs and temples waiting to be explored. The Bedouin community who still live within Petra sell their wares and offer refreshments along the colonnaded streets.

    "generalInfo": "Jordan is such an enjoyable country to visit: small enough that you can see several stunning locations without too much travelling, and famous for both local hospitality and world-renowned landmarks. You’ll be astonished by the diversity of a country where 75 percent of the land is in a desert climate – there’s the lowest (and saltiest) place on earth (the Dead Sea); one of the best places for diving (the Red Sea); six UNESCO sites, including Wadi Rum and Petra; holy sites, and Amman, the capital. In Jordan, luxury tours are as interesting as they are comfortable.<br/><br/>This full tour visits the country’s most impressive sights on a very doable loop. You’ll start in Amman, the capital, before heading north to Jerash, with its Roman ruins, and then south to Madaba and Mount Nebo. On to Petra, where you’ll get two days to explore the ancient city, before heading even further south into the desert at Wadi Rum. Have three rest days at a resort in Aqaba on the Red Sea, before you end your trip back up north, with a float in the Dead Sea, and time in a spa hotel.<br/><br/>What makes this trip luxury? You’ll be staying in four and five star hotels. With private transport, and local guides meeting you at the sites, you can simply sit back and relax between destinations, watching Jordan’s special landscapes – from high mountains to low deserts – change before your eyes. <br/><br/>This tour includes a guided tour of a woman’s cooperative where Amman’s unemployed women are given jobs and financial independence. They are employed to make traditional crafts which showcase and preserve pieces of Jordan’s cultural heritage.<br/><br/>This journey can be tailor made to your requirements – whether you want to add highland forests, more Biblical sights, or eco lodges in the wilderness. Jordan, and this trip, has them all.<br/><br/>Female guide available upon request.",

On the second day, your guide takes you into the site for either a hike up to the High Place of Sacrifice or for free time to explore the city further. Only a few people attempt to visit the High Place as it can be quite arduous and is not recommended for those who are unsure of their fitness or are uncomfortable with heights. However, those who do make it to the top are rewarded with wonderful views over parts of the site visited on the previous day.

        "description": "Explore Ancient Jerash and Amman, Street Food Experience & evening visit to the Wild Jordan Centre We begin our day travelling north from Amman to the nearby city of Jerash, home to one of the largest and best-preserved examples of Roman architecture outside of Italy. Often called the 'Jewel of the North', Jerash reveals an unbroken history of human settlement stretching back over 6,500 years. Hidden beneath sand for centuries, extensive excavations and restorations over the last 70 years have uncovered a remarkable example of the grand, formal Roman provincial urbanism typical throughout the Middle East. Upon returning to Amman in the afternoon, we explore Jordan's capital, famously known as the 'white city' due to its abundance of white limestone buildings. Amman's history spans millennia, with archaeological work uncovering remains from the Neolithic period through the Hellenistic, late Roman, and Arab Islamic eras. Our tour includes the Citadel, the historic site of the Temple of Hercules, the Umayyad Palace, and the Byzantine Church. We will also visit the impressive 6,000-seat Roman Theatre, dating back to when the city was known as Philadelphia. Following our exploration of the historical sites, we delve into the vibrant atmosphere of Downtown Amman with a street food tasting experience. You'll have the chance to sample local delicacies, which typically include sweet Kunefa, refreshing Sugar Cane Juice, and savoury Falafel, though specific offerings may vary based on availability during our visit. Afterwards, there will be time to return to the hotel to refresh before our evening activity. To conclude our day, we'll enjoy an evening visit to the Wild Jordan Centre. This unique establishment is not only a fantastic spot to relax but also plays a crucial role in supporting Jordan's natural heritage and local communities. It serves as a hub for the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature's ecotourism and handicraft projects, promoting sustainability by generating income for rural communities living in and around Jordan's nature reserves and aiding conservation efforts. For those who would prefer a more relaxed evening, you are welcome to remain at the hotel instead. OVERNIGHT"

Optional Petra by Night or Cookery Class We leave Amman behind us today as we drive along the scenic King's Highway towards Petra. The drive itself is beautiful, crossing deep wadis, passing through olive groves, and navigating remote rural villages, offering you a unique insight into the daily lives of the local people. Our first stop will be at Madaba, where we visit the Greek Orthodox Church of St. George, famed for its remarkable 6th-century Byzantine mosaic map depicting the Holy Land and other biblical sites. Next, we'll venture up Mount Nebo, a significant viewpoint offering breathtaking panoramic views over the Jordan Valley towards the Holy Land. We'll hit the road once more, this time crossing the stunning Wadi al-Mujib gorge. The route winds through olive groves before climbing over the deep canyon until we reach Shobak Castle. Perched dramatically on a mountainside, Shobak is another impressive example of the Crusader castles built during the early 12th century to guard the vital trade routes between Egypt and Damascus. Upon arrival in Petra, we'll check into our hotel. This evening offers two optional activities for you to choose from. You could opt for a magical first glimpse of Petra with the atmospheric Petra by Candlelight experience, walking through the Siq canyon to see the iconic Treasury illuminated solely by hundreds of candles. Alternatively, food enthusiasts might enjoy participating in a hands-on cooking class at the renowned Petra Kitchen, learning the secrets of preparing traditional Jordanian dishes. Please note that pre-booking is essential for the Petra Kitchen experience as it is very popular and spaces are limited. OVERNIGHT"

        "description": "Full day exploration of Petra, camping underneath the stars in Wadi Rum Today is all about exploring the Nabataean site of Petra. It was once the ancient capital of the Nabataean commercial empire until the Romans finally took over in 106 AD. For a long period, Petra was forgotten – except by the local Bedouins – before it was rediscovered in 1812 by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt. Petra is found at the edge of the Wadi Araba desert, where canyon walls and towering hills make it virtually inaccessible, except via a narrow cleft in the rock known as the Siq. There are very few free-standing buildings in Petra, as the Nabataeans chose to carve their dwellings into the multicoloured sandstone cliffs. Petra has become one of Jordan's main tourist attractions. We have most of the day available today to explore this ancient city (a 2-3 hour guided tour, then free time to explore independently). We start by making our way through the Siq, which rises to 200 metres above us and narrows to just 2 metres wide in certain sections. Keep an eye out for the ancient Nabataean water channel still visible on one wall, and remnants of the terracotta pipes that brought water into the city are also present. We'll turn a corner and suddenly – one of the most familiar sights of Petra will be in front of you – The Khazneh (Treasury) comes into view. Our guide will explain how this, and the other buildings here, are mainly elaborate facades carved into the rock from the top down, and also discuss the spiritual significance of the building style. From the Treasury, the valley opens out, and you'll see tombs carved into the rock on both sides. You'll get a glimpse of the ruined Roman amphitheatre and colonnaded streets. During your free time, you can walk up a steep and narrow winding gorge to the towering 'Monastery' – which is 50 metres high and 45 metres wide, providing breathtaking views of the Wadi Araba desert and the Jordan Valley. Another climb takes you to the High Place of Sacrifice and the Lion Fountain. All in all, this is a full and tiring, but hugely rewarding, day touring one of the world's most famous ancient sites. Walking distances today are an absolute minimum of 3km through the Siq to the Treasury and back, plus distance to see a few tombs; 8km to take the trail on as far as the main basin; plus an additional few km to the Monastery and back (over 800 steps up and down). For those with less mobility or who are worried about the distance golf buggies are available for around 25 USD per person one way 40 USD per person round trip to take you on the 1.2km journey through the Siq to the Treasury and back again at an agreed time. Horse carriages are also available but we recommend against using these due to animal welfare reasons. Later in the afternoon, we leave Petra and drive into the spectacular desert scenery of Wadi Rum. Whilst staying in Wadi Rum, several optional activities are available to enhance your desert experience, such as taking a traditional camel ride through the sand dunes, soaring above the landscape on a hot air balloon flight (typically at dawn, weather permitting), or enjoying an adventurous desert quad biking excursion. Upon arrival at our camp, friendly Bedouin hosts will greet us at our comfortable site, nestled beneath towering rocks and cliffs. We spend the evening relaxing at the camp and enjoying a delicious traditional Jordanian meal. As night falls and the stars emerge, there is also an option to join a captivating astronomy experience, taking advantage of Wadi Rum's exceptionally clear desert skies and unique vantage point to observe stars, constellations, and planets in incredible detail.

Keep an eye out for the copper-coloured rocky 'jebels', which mesmerised T.E. Lawrence during his visits to the desert during the Arab Revolt and were later famed in the movie Lawrence of Arabia. We'll take a jeep safari through the stunning desert landscape, seeing more of the sheer cliffs and bizarre, weathered rock formations. We say goodbye to Wadi Rum later in the morning and head north towards the Dead Sea, one of the planet's most spectacular natural and spiritual landscapes. Not only is it the lowest point on Earth, at approximately 400 metres below sea level, but it's also filled with dramatic, natural wonders. The Dead Sea is fed by numerous rivers, including the River Jordan. Once the waters reach the Dead Sea, they are land-locked with no outlet, so they evaporate under the intense desert sun. This process leaves behind a dense, rich cocktail of salts and minerals, renowned worldwide and supplying the cosmetics, agriculture, and medicine industries with some of their finest raw products. The Dead Sea is flanked by mountains to the east and the rolling hills towards Jerusalem to the west, giving it an almost otherworldly beauty. Although sparsely populated and serenely quiet now, the area is believed by some to have been home to five Biblical cities"

The ancient walled town that survives today is a remarkable evocation of life 2000 years ago, with its collection of archways and theatres, baths, public buildings and colonnaded streets. Discover Hadrian’s arch, the partially restored hippodrome, ornate public fountains, the south amphitheater, and see the collection of daily artefacts uncovered during excavations. Grand columns encircle the city's centrepiece, the Oval Plaza. After a full day of exploring, return to Madaba.

After a good look around, we head back to Amman for an exciting city tour, where we’ll visit notable ancient sites such as the Citadel, Roman Theatre and the old city.

        "description": "Enjoy two days exploring the striking Nabataean Kingdom of Petra, which was hidden for centuries until the Swiss explorer Burckhardt rediscovered it in 1812. Two features of Petra are unique: firstly, it is a city made defensible by being built down a series of chasms, rather than on a hilltop. Secondly, it is built directly into the rock – beautiful red and yellow sandstone carved into the most impressive facades which sparkle in sunlight. To enter Petra, your expert leader will take you down a narrow chasm, known as the Siq, which is surrounded by high cliffs on either side. You’ll explore Al Khazneh, an elaborate temple known as The Treasury, which was once inhabited by the Arabs of the Nabataean Kingdom. Continuing to the city centre, we pass houses and visit the tombs of the rich citizens. Witness the vastness and sheer beauty of this ancient city from various vantage points. There is also an optional walk up 850 steps to El Deir, a monumental monastery carved out of rock. On the second day, you'll return to Petra, either for an optional hike up to the High Place of Sacrifice (accompanied by a local Bedouin guide), a clifftop sacrificial altar with immense views over Petra, or for free time to explore the city further. Only a few people attempt a visit to the High Place as it can be quite arduous. However, those who do make it to the top are rewarded with wonderful views over parts of the site visited on the previous day.

Often called the 'Jewel of the North', Jerash reveals an unbroken history of human settlement stretching back over 6,500 years. Hidden beneath sand for centuries, extensive excavations and restorations over the last 70 years have uncovered a remarkable example of the grand, formal Roman provincial urbanism typical throughout the Middle East. Upon returning to Amman in the afternoon, we explore Jordan's capital, famously known as the 'white city' due to its abundance of white limestone buildings. Amman's history spans millennia, with archaeological work uncovering remains from the Neolithic period through the Hellenistic, late Roman, and Arab Islamic eras. Our tour includes the Citadel, the historic site of the Temple of Hercules, the Umayyad Palace, and the Byzantine Church. We will also visit the impressive 6,000-seat Roman Theatre, dating back to when the city was known as Philadelphia. Following our exploration of the historical sites, we delve into the vibrant atmosphere of Downtown Amman with a street food tasting experience. You'll have the chance to sample local delicacies, which typically include sweet Kunefa, refreshing Sugar Cane Juice, and savoury Falafel, though specific offerings may vary based on availability during our visit. Afterwards, there will be time to return to the hotel to refresh before our evening activity. To conclude our day, we'll enjoy an evening visit to the Wild Jordan Centre. This unique establishment is not only a fantastic spot to relax but also plays a crucial role in supporting Jordan's natural heritage and local communities. It serves as a hub for the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature's ecotourism and handicraft projects, promoting sustainability by generating income for rural communities living in and around Jordan's nature reserves and aiding conservation efforts. For those who would prefer a more relaxed evening, you are welcome to remain at the hotel instead. OVERNIGHT"

        "description": "Kings Highway to Petra with stops in Madaba, Mount Nebo & Shobak Castle. Optional Petra by Night or Cookery Class We leave Amman behind us today as we drive along the scenic King's Highway towards Petra. The drive itself is beautiful, crossing deep wadis, passing through olive groves, and navigating remote rural villages, offering you a unique insight into the daily lives of the local people. Our first stop will be at Madaba, where we visit the Greek Orthodox Church of St. George, famed for its remarkable 6th-century Byzantine mosaic map depicting the Holy Land and other biblical sites. Next, we'll venture up Mount Nebo, a significant viewpoint offering breathtaking panoramic views over the Jordan Valley towards the Holy Land. We'll hit the road once more, this time crossing the stunning Wadi al-Mujib gorge. The route winds through olive groves before climbing over the deep canyon until we reach Shobak Castle. Perched dramatically on a mountainside, Shobak is another impressive example of the Crusader castles built during the early 12th century to guard the vital trade routes between Egypt and Damascus. Upon arrival in Petra, we'll check into our hotel. This evening offers two optional activities for you to choose from. You could opt for a magical first glimpse of Petra with the atmospheric Petra by Candlelight experience, walking through the Siq canyon to see the iconic Treasury illuminated solely by hundreds of candles. Alternatively, food enthusiasts might enjoy participating in a hands-on cooking class at the renowned Petra Kitchen, learning the secrets of preparing traditional Jordanian dishes. Please note that pre-booking is essential for the Petra Kitchen experience as it is very popular and spaces are limited. OVERNIGHT"

        "description": "Full day exploration of Petra. Astronomy experience and camping underneath the stars in Wadi Rum Today is all about exploring the Nabataean site of Petra. It was once the ancient capital of the Nabataean commercial empire until the Romans finally took over in 106 AD. For a long period, Petra was forgotten – except by the local Bedouins – before it was rediscovered in 1812 by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt. Petra is found at the edge of the Wadi Araba desert, where canyon walls and towering hills make it virtually inaccessible, except via a narrow cleft in the rock known as the Siq. There are very few free-standing buildings in Petra, as the Nabataeans chose to carve their dwellings into the multicoloured sandstone cliffs. Petra has become one of Jordan's main tourist attractions. We have most of the day available today to explore this ancient city (a 2-3 hour guided tour, then free time to explore independently). We start by making our way through the Siq, which rises to 200 metres above us and narrows to just 2 metres wide in certain sections. Keep an eye out for the ancient Nabataean water channel still visible on one wall, and remnants of the terracotta pipes that brought water into the city are also present. We'll turn a corner and suddenly – one of the most familiar sights of Petra will be in front of you – The Khazneh (Treasury) comes into view. Our guide will explain how this, and the other buildings here, are mainly elaborate facades carved into the rock from the top down, and also discuss the spiritual significance of the building style. From the Treasury, the valley opens out, and you'll see tombs carved into the rock on both sides. You'll get a glimpse of the ruined Roman amphitheatre and colonnaded streets. During your free time, you can walk up a steep and narrow winding gorge to the towering 'Monastery' – which is 50 metres high and 45 metres wide, providing breathtaking views of the Wadi Araba desert and the Jordan Valley. Another climb takes you to the High Place of Sacrifice and the Lion Fountain. All in all, this is a full and tiring, but hugely rewarding, day touring one of the world's most famous ancient sites. Walking distances today are an absolute minimum of 3km through the Siq to the Treasury and back, plus distance to see a few tombs; 8km to take the trail on as far as the main basin; plus an additional few km to the Monastery and back (over 800 steps up and down). For those with less mobility or who are worried about the distance golf buggies are available for around 25 USD per person one way 40 USD per person round trip to take you on the 1.2km journey through the Siq to the Treasury and back again at an agreed time. Horse carriages are also available but we recommend against using these due to animal welfare reasons. Later in the afternoon, we leave Petra and drive into the spectacular desert scenery of Wadi Rum. Whilst staying in Wadi Rum, several optional activities are available to enhance your desert experience, such as taking a traditional camel ride through the sand dunes, soaring above the landscape on a hot air balloon flight (typically at dawn, weather permitting), or enjoying an adventurous desert quad biking excursion. Upon arrival at our camp, friendly Bedouin hosts will greet us at our comfortable site, nestled beneath towering rocks and cliffs. We spend the evening relaxing at the camp and enjoying a delicious traditional Jordanian meal. As night falls and the stars emerge and we venture into the heart of Wadi Rum's captivating desert landscape after nightfall and witness a celestial display like no other. Far from city lights, the vast, clear skies above this ancient valley reveal a breathtaking panorama of stars. Our expert guides will illuminate the constellations, planets, and deep-sky objects visible to the naked eye, sharing fascinating insights into their mythology and scientific significance. Experience the profound silence and tranquillity of the desert night as you gaze upon the Milky Way's shimmering expanse. With the aid of powerful telescopes, you'll delve deeper into the universe, observing distant galaxies and nebulae with remarkable clarity. This is an unforgettable opportunity to connect with the cosmos and appreciate the sheer scale and beauty of the night sky in one of the world's most spectacular natural settings. OVERNIGHT"

        "description": "Half DAY Jeep Safari. Perseid Meteor Shower. Overnight at remote desert camp We start the day early, exploring the beautiful desert and mountain scenery of Wadi Rum. Keep an eye out for the copper-coloured rocky 'jebels', which mesmerised T.E. Lawrence during his visits to the desert during the Arab Revolt and were later famed in the movie Lawrence of Arabia. Today's Jeep Safari is specially extended compared to our standard Jordan tours, allowing for a much deeper exploration of this stunning desert landscape. This longer duration gives us ample time to venture further, seeing more of the sheer cliffs and bizarre, weathered rock formations, and includes time to visit the impressive natural rock arch. Our safari concludes this evening not at our usual camp, but at a second, more remote Bedouin site. Whilst this camp is more basic than our previous one, its location has been carefully selected as it offers the best possible conditions for viewing the spectacular Perseid Meteor Shower, far away from any significant light pollution. Later tonight, we'll head to a special spot close to the camp where foam pads will be provided, allowing you to lie back comfortably on the cool desert sands and watch the meteors streak across the vast night sky above. To enhance this unique experience, light snacks, tea, and coffee will also be provided under the stars. OVERNIGHT"

        "description": "Wadi Rum Jeep Safari and overnight stay at the Dead Sea (optional excursion to Wadi Mujib) We say goodbye to Wadi Rum this morning and head north towards the Dead Sea, one of the planet's most spectacular natural and spiritual landscapes. Not only is it the lowest point on Earth, at approximately 400 metres below sea level, but it's also filled with dramatic, natural wonders. The Dead Sea is fed by numerous rivers, including the River Jordan. Once the waters reach the Dead Sea, they are land-locked with no outlet, so they evaporate under the intense desert sun. This process leaves behind a dense, rich cocktail of salts and minerals, renowned worldwide and supplying the cosmetics, agriculture, and medicine industries with some of their finest raw products. The Dead Sea is flanked by mountains to the east and the rolling hills towards Jerusalem to the west, giving it an almost otherworldly beauty. Although sparsely populated and serenely quiet now, the area is believed by some to have been home to five Biblical cities"

Bedding down in a Bedouin camp in Wadi Rum is an exciting prospect and as you fall asleep under a blanket of stars anticipation levels are sure to rise as you prepare for Petra, the rose red city in the sand.<br/><br/>Entering Petra via the Siq allows you to catch a glimpse of Jordan’s crown jewel as she would have first been seen by traders centuries ago. Exploring the citadel and climbing up to the monastery with your guide allows for greater understanding of one of the world’s most enduring ancient wonders.<br/><br/>Crusader castles and Roman ruins await on the final leg of this small group holiday as you return to Amman via Jerash which is thought by many to hold some of the world’s greatest examples of Greco-Roman architecture. Completing your Jordan adventure with a calming float on the Red Sea caps off a week in the Middle East that will live in the memory long after the tan finally fades.<br/>",

    "generalInfo": "Embark on an unforgettable 11-day journey through the captivating landscapes and rich histories of Jordan and Lebanon. Your adventure begins in Amman, Jordan's vibrant capital, where you'll be transferred to your hotel upon arrival, with time to settle in before the explorations commence. The following day delves deep into antiquity, starting with a visit to Jerash, renowned for possessing some of the most extensive and well-preserved Roman ruins outside Italy. Returning to Amman, known as the 'white city', you'll explore millennia of history at the Citadel, encompassing the Temple of Hercules and Umayyad Palace, followed by the impressive Roman Theatre. The day is enriched with a lively street food tasting experience in Downtown Amman and concludes with an insightful evening visit to the Wild Jordan Centre, supporting local conservation efforts. The journey south unfolds along the scenic King's Highway, a route offering picturesque views of deep wadis and rural villages. Stops include Madaba, famous for the ancient Byzantine mosaic map in St. George's Church, and Mount Nebo, offering panoramic vistas towards the Holy Land. After traversing the dramatic Wadi al-Mujib gorge, you'll visit the imposing Crusader fortress of Shobak Castle before arriving in Petra. Here, optional evening activities provide a magical introduction to the city, choosing between the atmospheric Petra by Candlelight experience or a hands-on Jordanian cooking class at the Petra Kitchen (pre-booking recommended). The next day is dedicated entirely to the awe-inspiring Nabataean city of Petra. Following a guided tour through the narrow Siq canyon, revealing the breathtaking Treasury facade carved into the rock, you'll have ample free time to explore this vast site independently. Discover countless tombs, the Roman amphitheatre, and consider challenging climbs to the Monastery or the High Place of Sacrifice for incredible views and a deeper appreciation of this world wonder. Leaving Petra's rock-hewn marvels, you'll drive into the spectacular desert landscape of Wadi Rum. Experience the magic of the desert with an overnight stay in a comfortable Bedouin camp nestled amongst towering sandstone cliffs. An included jeep safari reveals the dramatic 'jebels' and unique rock formations famed by T.E. Lawrence. Enhance your desert experience with optional activities like camel riding, quad biking, a serene hot air balloon flight at dawn, or stargazing under the clear desert skies after enjoying a traditional Bedouin dinner. The following morning, after further exploration via jeep, the journey continues north to the Dead Sea, the lowest point on Earth. Check into your resort on its shores and enjoy ample time to experience the unique buoyancy of the salt-rich waters, indulge in therapeutic mud treatments, or simply relax. For the adventurous (typically April-October), an optional trek through the water-filled canyons of nearby Wadi Mujib is available. Day six marks the transition to Lebanon, with a transfer to Amman airport for your flight to Beirut (please note this flight cost is not included). Upon arrival in Beirut, you'll be met and transferred to your hotel. The Lebanese leg of your adventure begins by heading north to the stunning Jeita Grotto, a vast system of limestone caves filled with incredible stalactites and stalagmites. Continue to Harissa, taking a cable car up to the mountain-top shrine for breathtaking coastal views. The day also includes a visit to the unique Baatara Gorge sinkhole and waterfall (seasonal), exploration of Douma Village with an included traditional lunch, before reaching the serene Qadisha Valley for an overnight stay in a monastery or local guesthouse. Explore the UNESCO-listed Qadisha Valley (Holy Valley) the next morning, perhaps joining the monks for prayers, before visiting Becharre, birthplace of Kahlil Gibran, and the iconic Cedars of God reserve. The day concludes in the ancient Phoenician port city of Byblos, another UNESCO site, brimming with millennia of history. Enjoy a free morning exploring Byblos' charming markets and harbour before travelling inland. A highlight is the visit to Ksara Winery, Lebanon's oldest, for a tour of its historic caves and a wine tasting session, before continuing to Zahle. The penultimate day offers a spectacular immersion in history with a visit to the colossal Roman temple complex at Baalbek (Heliopolis), one of the most impressive Roman sites globally. Afterwards, explore the well-preserved 8th-century Umayyad city of Anjar in the Bekaa Valley, showcasing remarkable early Islamic urban planning, before driving back to Beirut for the final night. Your comprehensive tour concludes on day eleven with free time for last-minute exploration or souvenir shopping in Beirut before your included transfer to the airport for your departure flight. Throughout the tour, breakfasts are included daily, along with specific lunches and dinners as detailed in the itinerary.",

        "description": "Explore Ancient Jerash and Amman, Street Food Experience & evening visit to the Wild Jordan Centre We begin our day travelling north from Amman to the nearby city of Jerash, home to one of the largest and best-preserved examples of Roman architecture outside of Italy. Often called the 'Jewel of the North', Jerash reveals an unbroken history of human settlement stretching back over 6,500 years. Hidden beneath sand for centuries, extensive excavations and restorations over the last 70 years have uncovered a remarkable example of the grand, formal Roman provincial urbanism typical throughout the Middle East. Upon returning to Amman in the afternoon, we explore Jordan's capital, famously known as the 'white city' due to its abundance of white limestone buildings. Amman's history spans millennia, with archaeological work uncovering remains from the Neolithic period through the Hellenistic, late Roman, and Arab Islamic eras. Our tour includes the Citadel, the historic site of the Temple of Hercules, the Umayyad Palace, and the Byzantine Church. We will also visit the impressive 6,000-seat Roman Theatre, dating back to when the city was known as Philadelphia. Following our exploration of the historical sites, we delve into the vibrant atmosphere of Downtown Amman with a street food tasting experience. You'll have the chance to sample local delicacies, which typically include sweet Kunefa, refreshing Sugar Cane Juice, and savoury Falafel, though specific offerings may vary based on availability during our visit. Afterwards, there will be time to return to the hotel to refresh before our evening activity. To conclude our day, we'll enjoy an evening visit to the Wild Jordan Centre. This unique establishment is not only a fantastic spot to relax but also plays a crucial role in supporting Jordan's natural heritage and local communities. It serves as a hub for the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature's ecotourism and handicraft projects, promoting sustainability by generating income for rural communities living in and around Jordan's nature reserves and aiding conservation efforts. For those who would prefer a more relaxed evening, you are welcome to remain at the hotel instead. OVERNIGHT"

Optional Petra by Night or Cookery Class We leave Amman behind us today as we drive along the scenic King's Highway towards Petra. The drive itself is beautiful, crossing deep wadis, passing through olive groves, and navigating remote rural villages, offering you a unique insight into the daily lives of the local people. Our first stop will be at Madaba, where we visit the Greek Orthodox Church of St. George, famed for its remarkable 6th-century Byzantine mosaic map depicting the Holy Land and other biblical sites. Next, we'll venture up Mount Nebo, a significant viewpoint offering breathtaking panoramic views over the Jordan Valley towards the Holy Land. We'll hit the road once more, this time crossing the stunning Wadi al-Mujib gorge. The route winds through olive groves before climbing over the deep canyon until we reach Shobak Castle. Perched dramatically on a mountainside, Shobak is another impressive example of the Crusader castles built during the early 12th century to guard the vital trade routes between Egypt and Damascus. Upon arrival in Petra, we'll check into our hotel. This evening offers two optional activities for you to choose from. You could opt for a magical first glimpse of Petra with the atmospheric Petra by Candlelight experience, walking through the Siq canyon to see the iconic Treasury illuminated solely by hundreds of candles. Alternatively, food enthusiasts might enjoy participating in a hands-on cooking class at the renowned Petra Kitchen, learning the secrets of preparing traditional Jordanian dishes.

        "description": "Full day exploration of Petra, camping underneath the stars in Wadi Rum Today is all about exploring the Nabataean site of Petra. It was once the ancient capital of the Nabataean commercial empire until the Romans finally took over in 106 AD. For a long period, Petra was forgotten – except by the local Bedouins – before it was rediscovered in 1812 by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt. Petra is found at the edge of the Wadi Araba desert, where canyon walls and towering hills make it virtually inaccessible, except via a narrow cleft in the rock known as the Siq. There are very few free-standing buildings in Petra, as the Nabataeans chose to carve their dwellings into the multicoloured sandstone cliffs. Petra has become one of Jordan's main tourist attractions. We have most of the day available today to explore this ancient city (a 2-3 hour guided tour, then free time to explore independently). We start by making our way through the Siq, which rises to 200 metres above us and narrows to just 2 metres wide in certain sections. Keep an eye out for the ancient Nabataean water channel still visible on one wall, and remnants of the terracotta pipes that brought water into the city are also present. We'll turn a corner and suddenly – one of the most familiar sights of Petra will be in front of you – The Khazneh (Treasury) comes into view. Our guide will explain how this, and the other buildings here, are mainly elaborate facades carved into the rock from the top down, and also discuss the spiritual significance of the building style. From the Treasury, the valley opens out, and you'll see tombs carved into the rock on both sides. You'll get a glimpse of the ruined Roman amphitheatre and colonnaded streets. During your free time, you can walk up a steep and narrow winding gorge to the towering 'Monastery' – which is 50 metres high and 45 metres wide, providing breathtaking views of the Wadi Araba desert and the Jordan Valley. Another climb takes you to the High Place of Sacrifice and the Lion Fountain. All in all, this is a full and tiring, but hugely rewarding, day touring one of the world's most famous ancient sites. Walking distances today are an absolute minimum of 3km through the Siq to the Treasury and back, plus distance to see a few tombs; 8km to take the trail on as far as the main basin; plus an additional few km to the Monastery and back (over 800 steps up and down). For those with less mobility or who are worried about the distance golf buggies are available for around 25 USD per person one way 40 USD per person round trip to take you on the 1.2km journey through the Siq to the Treasury and back again at an agreed time. Horse carriages are also available but we recommend against using these due to animal welfare reasons. Later in the afternoon, we leave Petra and drive into the spectacular desert scenery of Wadi Rum. Whilst staying in Wadi Rum, several optional activities are available to enhance your desert experience, such as taking a traditional camel ride through the sand dunes, soaring above the landscape on a hot air balloon flight (typically at dawn, weather permitting), or enjoying an adventurous desert quad biking excursion. Upon arrival at our camp, friendly Bedouin hosts will greet us at our comfortable site, nestled beneath towering rocks and cliffs. We spend the evening relaxing at the camp and enjoying a delicious traditional Jordanian meal. As night falls and the stars emerge, there is also an option to join a captivating astronomy experience, taking advantage of Wadi Rum's exceptionally clear desert skies and unique vantage point to observe stars, constellations, and planets in incredible detail.

Keep an eye out for the copper-coloured rocky 'jebels', which mesmerised T.E. Lawrence during his visits to the desert during the Arab Revolt and were later famed in the movie Lawrence of Arabia. We'll take a jeep safari through the stunning desert landscape, seeing more of the sheer cliffs and bizarre, weathered rock formations. We say goodbye to Wadi Rum later in the morning and head north towards the Dead Sea, one of the planet's most spectacular natural and spiritual landscapes. Not only is it the lowest point on Earth, at approximately 400 metres below sea level, but it's also filled with dramatic, natural wonders. The Dead Sea is fed by numerous rivers, including the River Jordan. Once the waters reach the Dead Sea, they are land-locked with no outlet, so they evaporate under the intense desert sun. This process leaves behind a dense, rich cocktail of salts and minerals, renowned worldwide and supplying the cosmetics, agriculture, and medicine industries with some of their finest raw products. The Dead Sea is flanked by mountains to the east and the rolling hills towards Jerusalem to the west, giving it an almost otherworldly beauty. Although sparsely populated and serenely quiet now, the area is believed by some to have been home to five Biblical cities"

The caves contain one of the worlds largest collections of stalactites and stalagmites and was one of the finalists in the New 7 Wonders of Nature competition; it’s no wonder the caves are considered a symbol of Lebanon.

There are no activities planned for today, so you\\ re free to arrive in Amman at any time. If you\\ d like an airport transfer, you'll need to arrive at Queen Alia International Airport (AMM), a 30-minute drive from our hotel.

Inhabited for 6,500 years, the city's golden age was in Roman times when it became part of the Decapolis League - a confederation of important Middle Eastern cities. One of the best-preserved Roman ruins in the world, only 10% of the city has been uncovered since excavation began more than a century ago. Walk the collonaded streets, visit the hilltop temples, explore the chariot-racing stadium, and hear your voice amplified in the ancient theatre. We'll travel back to Amman, where we can enjoy some delicious street food and soak up the energetic atmosphere of the capital's souk before spending the afternoon exploring the historical sites of the city. Our first stop is the Citadel Jabal al-Qal-a, the highest point in Amman, giving us panoramic views across the sprawling city. Artefacts found here indicate that the area has been a royal city for thousands of years. Whilst earthquakes and invasions have taken their toll, two pillars of the Roman Temple of Hercules still stand strong alongside parts of the 7th-century Umayyad Palace. We'll finish up at the old main post office of Amman that transports us back to Amman's early days."

Aptly dubbed the City of Mosaics, Madaba is home to hundreds of Byzantine-era mosaics, the most famous of these is a 6th-century map of Jerusalem and the Holy Land, created with two million pieces of stone. Continuing on, we'll head to the Dead Sea. This unique body of water is the lowest point on the earth's surface. With a salt content of 33%, it's almost impossible to sink and we'll take a dip to experience the mysterious floating sensation. While we're there, you can cover yourself in the water's rejuvenating mud, famous for its healing properties. After your dip, feel free to unwind by the pool or at the bar - there are shower facilities to freshen up in, too. Next, we'll journey south along the King's Highway to Kerak. This ancient Crusader stronghold is the most famous in a chain of fortresses built for the Holy War against Islam. We'll stop to learn about its history and explore the maze of stone-vaulted halls and passageways. Our day of sightseeing ends in Petra, a three hour drive from Kerak. A UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the seven wonders of the world, the ancient Rose City is Jordan's most valuable treasure."

Our tour leader will guide us on a tour through Petra's highlights before we have a free afternoon to wander at our own pace. As you enter the site, you're led down a kilometre-long chasm (known as the Siq) where the towering canyon walls reach up to 200 metres/656 feet high. At the end of the Siq sits the beating heart of the city, the Treasury - miraculously well-preserved, the façade stands at 43 metres high. Beyond the Treasury, the ancient city becomes a sprawl of tombs and temples waiting to be explored. The Bedouin community who still live within Petra sell their wares and offer refreshments along the colonnaded streets. In the afternoon, you can choose to climb the steep path to the High Place of Sacrifice for a panorama over Wadi Araba and the Negev Desert or trek up to the Monastery, Petra's largest monument. This evening, there is the option to witness Petra by night. Follow the candlelit Siq trail and watch how the light plays against the high canyon rocks, blanketed by stars, before coming upon the Treasury, lit up by night. Settle into the sands in front of the ancient temple and listen to a welcome speech from the Bedouin community that still calls the city home."

Our drive along the sands will lead us through untouched parts of Wadi Rum and our tour leader will stop to tell us more about the history of the desert. Described by T.E. Lawrence as \\ vast, echoing and God-like\\ , Wadi Rum occupies 74,000 acres with its monolithic outcrops of granite rock and sandstone rising out of the blankets of sand. The Bedouins learned to live within this hostile environment 3,000 years ago, adapting to the elements to perfect their nomadic way of life. Once we\\ ve watched the sun go down, setting the dunes aglow with fiery red and orange light, we'll head back to camp to experience Bedouin hospitality. We'll be served a traditional Zarb, a BBQ of chicken or goat meat (vegetarian options will be available) cooked under the desert sand and served alongside a selection of mezze. Tonight, we'll sleep in traditional Bedouin tents, crafted from goat hair which offers the best protection against the extreme desert climate. Each individual tent comes with rugs, mattresses, pillows, and blankets provided. There's a toilet and shower block at the end of the site."

After meeting our Egyptian tour leader, it's a one and half hour drive to get to Dahab, our base for the next two nights. Dahab was a former sleepy Bedouin fishing village. Whilst the town has grown in recent years, unlike many of the other resort towns in Egypt, it has retained a lot of its charm, known as one of the best diving sites in the Red Sea. Our hotel for the next two nights has a wonderful setting, facing the Red Sea on one side and the mountains of South Sinai on the other.

        "description": ": For those who wish to this morning, there is the opportunity to trek to the summit of Mount Sinai to watch the sunrise. The trek is on a wide trail, rocky underfoot with numerous steps cut into the rock as we approach the summit. The total ascent from St Catherine's Monastery is 2,375 feet/715 metres to get to the highest point at 7,497 feet/2,285 metres. It typically takes three hours to reach the top, so we'll have a very early start, heading out at 2am with an aim to reach the summit around thirty minutes before sunrise. There are several shelters along the way where you can buy snacks and hot drinks. A head torch and walking boots with good ankle support are recommended, the path itself is well graded but there are lots of steps. The trek is graded moderate. Following time at the summit to watch the sunrise, we'll descend back down to St Catherine's Monastery, taking around two hours (depending on the group's walking pace) and have a late breakfast - joining the rest of the group who opted not to do the trek. Our journey to Egypt's bustling capital, Cairo, will take up the rest of the day, taking around six to seven hours with additional time for rest stops and lunch. Travelling through the Sinai desert, the route takes us under the Suez Canal, the dividing line between the Middle East and Africa. The 193-kilometre/120-mile long canal, completed in 1869, is one of the world's most heavily used shipping routes. Arriving in Cairo in the early evening, we'll head directly to our centrally-located hotel, where we have panoramic views over the Nile. Cairo is Africa's second largest capital city.

This afternoon, we'll head onto the mighty Nile River on a traditional felucca cruise. A felucca is a traditional sailboat used in Egypt, the primary mode of transport on the mighty Nile River and unchanged over the centuries.

Our visit includes entrance to three of the tombs which will be decided on the day, as many are periodically closed for resting and renovation to protect them. After the three, there will be an option to pay a supplement to visit Tutankhamun's tomb. Our next stop is the Temple of Hatshepsut. Pharaoh Hatshepsut is believed to be the most successful reigning female power of Egypt, no mean feat during Ancient Egyptian times, and was buried alongside her male counterparts in the Valley of the Kings. Historians throughout modern history offer contrasting information about her reign but walking into the shadow of Hatshepsut's immense temple, which is built into the limestone rock face on Luxor's West Bank, is a key symbol of her achievements. The structure is unexpectedly modern by design and was once linked directly with Karnak Temple on the East Bank. Continuing our exploration of the west bank, we visit the striking Habu temple, one of the less visited sites on the west bank and very much underrated. The temple complex is dominated by the highly decorated and well preserved funeral temple of Ramses III depicting scenes of conquests and famous battles. The complex also houses the Temple of Amun, built by Hatshepsut and Tuthmosis III. With the backdrop of the village in the foreground and the Theban hills behind its fitting end to our morning of visiting some of Egypt's best preserved ancient sites. A home cooked lunch is included today at a local families house on the west bank. Sample traditional dishes such as okra stew, koshari made with rice, lentils, pasta and chickpeas and tagen, a rich tasty tomato based dish, all served with delicious freshly baked bread. We arrive back to our hotel mid afternoon with time to relax for the rest of the afternoon, take a dip in the hotel pool or take a stroll to the lively markets in Luxor."

        "description": "As-Salt, Amman City and Local Food Tasting Our first visit today is to the hilltop town of As-Salt, around 40 minutes drive from Amman. As-Salt was an important trading link between the Jordan Valley and Eastern Desert, and once the capital of Amman. The town developed its old Islamic architecture using yellow limestone, which was the finest at the time and many impressive buildings can still be seen today, as well as tiny narrow streets packed with shops and stalls. Today the town provides an example of religious and cultural friendship between the local Muslim and Christian population and we take a walking tour on its self-designed 'Harmony Trail' to learn more about the town and local life in Jordan. In the afternoon we continue with a city tour of Amman. Amman is rich in history, dating back many millennia. Archaeological discoveries have uncovered remains from the Neolithic period as well as the Hellenistic and late Roman to Arab Islamic Ages. We'll start by making our way to the Citadel - the former home of the ancient Temple of Hercules, The Umayyad Palace, the Byzantine Church before we make our way to the 6000-seater Roman theatre, which was built during the Roman Period. The ancient theatre is still in use today, playing host to numerous cultural events. Whilst in Downtown Amman, we also include a food tasting tour. During the tour we'll try several different dishes (which will vary from departure to departure), starting with a snack of either Manakish (with its various toppings of egg, white cheese or za'atar) or a classic falafel sandwich. Perhaps the Jordanian national dish of Mansaf, slow cooked lamb with rice and yoghurt sauce. Finally we'll try one of the cities famous desserts like Knafeh from one the popular local sweet shops.

        "description": "Reverse-route mountain hike to Petra via Little Petra Today is all about exploring the Nabatean site of Petra. It was once the ancient capital of the Nabataean commercial empire until the Romans finally took over in 106AD. For a long period of time, Petra was forgotten - except by the local Bedouins - before it was rediscovered in 1812 by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt. Petra can be found at the edge of the Wadi Aruba desert, where canyon walls and towering hills make it virtually impossible to reach, except via a narrow cleft in the rock, known as the Siq. There are very few free-standing buildings in Petra, as the Nabateans chose to carve their dwellings into the multi coloured sandstone cliffs. Petra has become one of Jordan's main tourist attractions and the Jordanian Government is well aware of this. The tourism infrastructure in the adjoining village of Wadi Musa is booming, though, thankfully, once you enter through the Siq, the site is protected, there aren't that many touts or souvenir sellers, and all the building feels miles away. We have most of the day available today to explore this ancient city, though as an added bonus, we'll be exploring Petra via the back-route which starts at Little Petra. Before embarking on our hike into Petra, we'll explore the small but equally interesting site of Little Petra, or Siq al-Barid. From here we'll take a short jeep ride to the start of the mountail trail which links Little Petra to the Monastery and main site of Petra. The back-route into Petra makes for an interesting and much less crowded way of visiting, and what's more, you'll be rewarded with incredible mountain views towards the Holy Land. Whilst hiking the back-route you'll still have the opportunity to see all of the same monuments visited on the normal route, with the addition of Little Petra and the Monastery. The route starts with the ascent of a number of rock hewn steps and paths which straddle the mountain edge. After reaching a plateau, there is an opportunity to stop for refreshments at a small cafe from where you'll have some fantastic photo opportunities. From here the path continues until you'll have a glimpse of 'Ad-Deir' (or the Monastery) where you can have a well deserved rest before descending down into the main site of Petra. Once in Petra the valley opens out, and you'll see tombs carved into the rock on both sides. You'll get a glimpse of the ruined Roman amphitheatre and colonnaded streets. As we continue through the ancient city of Petra, we'll eventually reach The Khazneh (Treasury) which is probably the most familiar monument of Petra. Whilst the back-route hike into Petra isn't particularly difficult, as a number of ascents/descents and a significant number of steps are required, this route is only suitable for those who have no issue in hiking in this type of terrain for a minimum of 2-3 hours as far as the Monastery and then a further few hours walking on sandy terrain, whilst exploring the main site of Petra. For those with less mobility or who are worried about the distance, horse carriages are available for around 20JD (USD 28) for an agreed period of time (only available within the main site of Petra, not on the hiking route). We do not recommend riding the horses that are available. OVERNIGHT"

Dead Sea 'swim' After enjoying breakfast in Petra, we'll head north along the Dead Sea road to Wadi Mujib, where we'll hike along the exciting Siq Trail. Along the way we'll be rewarded with great views of the Salt Flats at the southern end of the Dead Sea. As we continue along the shores of the Dead Sea we eventually reach the visitor centre of Wadi Mujib. You'll have time to have lunch here (not included) before entering the water and embarking on the hike. Descending down into the gorge we enter the Wadi Mujib Nature Reserve where between months of April and October (see note below for periods outside of this) it's possible to take an exciting hike through the shallow waters that fill the gorge. Along the way you'll climb up small waterfalls where steps have being installed to make it easier, until eventually you'll reach the end of the gorge where you can relax beneath a large waterfall. The entire hike generally takes 2 to 3 hours roundtrip. We highly recommend bringing along a dry-bag (so your camera or mobile phone don't get wet) and water shoes. It is possible to hire a dry bag at the visitors centre for around US$7.00 and purchase water shoes for US$7.00). Note"

There are no activities planned for today, so you're free to arrive in Amman at any time. If you'd like an airport transfer today, you'll need to arrive into Queen Alia International Amman Airport (AMM), which is around a 30-minute drive from our hotel.

Due to most flights arriving late in the evening, our Explore Leader will meet you for a welcome meeting the next morning. You'll find the meeting information on the notice board in the hotel reception. When choosing your flights, keep in mind that our tour starts right after breakfast on day two so be prepared to dive straight into the adventure. If you'd like to add on extra days in Amman before our tour starts to explore the capital at your own pace or simply catch up on rest, contact us to book accommodation.

From here, on a clear day, you can see out to the Dead Sea, Bethlehem, and Jerusalem. Our final stop of the day will be Madaba. Aptly dubbed the 'City of Mosaics', Madaba is home to hundreds of Byzantine-era mosaics, the most famous of these is a 6th-century map of Jerusalem and the Holy Land, created with two million pieces of stone."

        "description": ": This morning, we'll leave Madaba and travel to Petra for a two-night stay. Along the way, we'll visit Kerak Castle. This ancient Crusader stronghold is the most famous in a chain of fortresses built for the Holy War against Islam. We'll stop to learn about its history and explore the maze of stone-vaulted halls and passageways. Abandoned centuries ago, Petra was the rock cut stronghold of the Nabateans. Surrounded by imposing mountains and approached through a deep, narrow cleft in the rocks, known as the Siq, it is a unique and unforgettable place and, enhanced by the play of light and shadow, an altogether overwhelming experience. On arrival, you can choose to either start exploring the archaeological site at your own pace or simply rest and enjoy the hotel's rooftop pool with a view of Petra's entrance and the tops of its canyons. This evening, we'll enjoy a Bedouin cookery demonstration and meal at a nearby restaurant, learning how to make a traditional Makloubah (upside down) dish, with meat, rice and fried vegetables, followed by Um Ali, a creamy Arabic dessert with croissant pieces, raisins and nuts."

As you enter the site, you're led down a kilometre-long chasm (known as the Siq) where the towering canyon walls reach up to 200 metres high. At the end of the Siq sits the beating heart of the city, the Treasury - miraculously well-preserved, the façade stands at 43-metres-high. Beyond the Treasury, the ancient city becomes a sprawl of tombs and temples waiting to be explored. We'll take in the Colonnaded Street, the Royal Tombs and marvel at the amazing theatre, with its 8,000 seats carved from the solid rock. The afternoon is free for you to uncover more of Petra. Climb the steep path to the High Place of Sacrifice for a panorama over Wadi Araba and the Negev Desert or trek up to the Monastery - Petra's largest monument. In the evening, there's the option to witness Petra by night. Follow the candlelit Siq trail and watch how the light plays against the high canyon rocks, blanketed by stars, before coming upon the Treasury, lit up by night. Settle into the sands in front of the ancient temple and listen to a welcome speech from the Bedouin community that still calls the city home."

Today we'll embrace the nomadic lifestyle of the Bedouin and head into the dunes of Wadi Rum. We'll have the option of an exhilarating drive along the sands in 4WD vehicles, leading us through untouched parts of Wadi Rum. Described by T.E. Lawrence as 'vast, echoing and God-like…', Wadi Rum occupies 74,000 acres with its monolithic outcrops of granite rock and sandstone rising out of the blankets of sand. The Bedouins learned to live within this hostile environment 3000 years ago, adapting to the elements to perfect their nomadic way of life. We'll embark on exhilarating 4WD adventure to explore the hidden beauties of Wadi Rum. We'll have tea made in the traditional way on a fire and after watching the sun go down, setting the dunes aglow with fiery red and orange light, we'll head back to camp to experience Bedouin hospitality. We'll be served a traditional Zarb, a BBQ of chicken or goat meat (vegetarian options will be available) cooked under the desert sand and served alongside a selection of mezze. Our spacious camp features private, ensuite tents - each one is fully furnished with beds and bedding and is set up with solar-powered electricity. There's also a central fire pit shared by all visitors that's perfect to gather around for a spot of stargazing."

Huge pieces are strewn across the ground, from rugged bricks to slabs that once made up the Temple of Hercules. Visit similar ruins in Greece or Turkey, and you’ll struggle to move for other tourists. Yet Jerash almost feels isolated, deserted and untouched since the Roman Empire evaporated. The ancient city dates back to the 1st century BC and flourished until the mid-8th century AD. The outline of the hippodrome contains traces of its former glory where chariot races attracted up to 15,000 spectators. The graceful ruins of the Temple of Zeus adorn the hilltop blending a fabulous view over the city’s remains with strong boulders embodying importance of the once significant structure. Jerash just one of the stops on your half-day tour from Amman, just one of the remarkable monuments that are scattered across Jordan."

        "description": "Travelers have been going up and down the King’s Highway for over 5,000 years, and the road is filled with sights from across the centuries. Mount Nebo is a place of pilgrimage with remarkable views over the Dead Sea; Christian mosaics illuminate the walls in Madaba, where a Byzantine church maintains the oldest map of Palestine in existence. Kerak Castle evokes stories of the crusaders as the largest fortress in Jordan with fountains dating back to the 2nd century AD. Then the valley opens up, and suddenly you’re looking down on the sandstone city of Petra. It’s a five-hour drive from Amman to Petra, but there are many stops en route, with the guide aiming to get you a sunset glimpse of the old city before your private tours over the next two days. Over the day, you’re likely to realize that one of the country’s greatest highlights is its humility. Rather than shout and overly advertise its attractions (other than Petra), Jordan likes to leave a lot for visitors to discover first hand."

        "description": "Wander the ancient corridor, through a red canyon that gets narrower with every footstep. Sprinkles of dust puff up as you get closer and the rock becomes marked with intricate swirls of orange and maroon. It feels like you’re immersed in nature, lost in the marvel of the desert. But then the canyon opens from nowhere, and you’re staring at a whole city carved into the sandstone. Remarkable tombs and temples grace the rock faces, with columns and sculpted sphinxes etched high onto mountains. Walk for another five minutes, and you learn that these first temples are just the start, just one suburb of an ancient city that stretches for many miles across the desert. Petra has far too much to see for a single day. Much like a modern capital city, you need to journey out to its disparate suburbs and distinctive areas. A local guide will discuss the options for this vacation, as the exact routes will depend on your energy levels and how far you’d like to walk. You might also want to split the days up, seeing different areas at sunrise and sunset, leaving a few relaxed hours at the hotel when the sun is high in the sky. As well as the famous temples, Petra is packed with caves, the homes of local people for many centuries. Over these two days, you’ll meet a family that occupies one of these caves, sharing a glass of tea and experience time-honored hospitality. The Treasury will cause you to fall in love with Petra through the iron-laden sandstone originally erected to serve as a tomb for King Aretas III. The pillars glisten with golden orange light between nine and 11am."

You have the option of staying in Wadi Rum overnight combining authentic charm and sophisticated beauty at Sun City Camp. The attentive staff and unparalleled location provide a majestic experience amid the panoramic view of the valley floor, ascending mountains, and scattered sandstone pillars.

Then it’s back along the King’s Highway to a luxurious five-star resort Kempinski Ishtar Dead Sea on the banks of the renowned salt lake at the earth’s lowest point, where rocks climb high above surreal green waters. Kempinski Ishtar Dead Sea embraces the majesty of Jordan’s illustrious nature and fascinating history within luxurious accommodations.

Your guide knows the best photographic angles, and you stay ahead of the crowds, climbing inside one of the temples and getting a sense of how the ancient wonder of the world was crafted. From Giza, you head to Saqqara and ride out to the first ever Egyptian pyramid on the back of a camel. It’s a remarkable sight, crumbling slowly yet still as classically shaped as it was more than 3,500 years ago.

You’ll be glad to have a guide, as these precious artifacts are difficult to piece together amongst the seeming disarray of the museum. The Egyptologist leads you through the most remarkable of what’s on offer then takes you into Coptic Cairo and medieval Cairo, historic suburbs that have retained their atmosphere of old-world Christianity and Islam. Comparing the two provides a sublime journey through architecture styles and atmospheres, from charming 6th-century churches to calligraphy draped across markets and lanes. Most of the suburbs are pedestrianized, a maze of lanes that twist through the stories of history, and then suddenly open out onto squares of alfresco terraces filled with the invigorating scent of brewing coffee."

Of all Egypt’s monuments, it’s the temples of Karnak and Luxor that most ignite the imagination, such majestic scale and intricate detail connected by the old Avenue of Sphinx. The ancient lane once extended for approximately three kilometers. Historians believe up to 1,350 sphinxes lined the avenue on which the Opet Festival took place annually celebrating the symbolic reenactment of the marriage between Amun and Mut. Fragments of 850 sphinxes dating back to the 14th century BC were recently uncovered.

This is where the pharaohs of old Thebes were entombed, and the scale of the monuments is almost too much to take in. A private tour breathes life into the hieroglyphs and images, so much history found in every corner. You explore four of the tombs, heading downstairs into the mysterious atmosphere of yesteryear, the Egyptologist helping to paint a picture of ancient Egypt’s 18th dynasty. It’s a short hop over to the nearby Valley of the Queens and elaborate mortuary temples, before a meze lunch at a restaurant with views over Luxor’s West Bank.

El Quseir is remote and a more boutique alternative to Egypt’s better-known Red Sea destinations. And for that reason, it’s as serene as it always has been.

Splashes of claret blur into rustic ochre with swirls of flaming cardinal mixed into the illusionary ruby of dreams. And then there is the sand that transforms with the sun’s rays to perform their own rainbow dance. It is all very impressive as a snapshot, but Wadi Run stretches for over a thousand square miles to create a stark emptiness where every vista is like the last but no two are ever the same. Perhaps no other desert landscape is as inspiring while also being too hard to understand until you have visited. You will explore in a trusty Land Rover and follow a trail of sights that date back from the time of Lawrence of Arabia. Pass semi-nomadic herders with their lonely goats, tour the waterholes, and get lost in the enormous splendor of the desert. Luxury camps are set up in the desert, away from the main eastern gate and hidden by the dunes that rise amongst the cliffs. Silence pervades and the world will seem to disappear. The escape is absolute, and it is almost impossible to get enough of the panoramas.

        "description": "Wake the next morning to be privately transferred to Cairo Airport for your short flight to Luxor and travel straight to Luxor Temple. Luxor baffles even the most worldly of travelers as seeing such ancient heritage stand in such a pristine state of conservation is hard to comprehend. Your mind will circle with questions on how these tombs and temples were built on such an immense scale? Palatial columns rise skyward and dwarf all of those who wander across the imposing temple floors. Sculpted figures guard entrances ten meters high, their eyes cast with indecipherable emotion. Footsteps will echo and bounce across the walls before evaporating into the desert sky. Your first glimpse will be forever memorable as the scale of the temple is experienced in all of its primitive glory. As you admire the hieroglyphs and soak up the murals, you will realize that this is just the start of your journey through Egypt’s dynasties. Like each day on this itinerary, every tour is private, and your Egyptologist guide will tailor the speed and information to your interests. There is almost too much to see around Luxor, and it will be easy to be overwhelmed by temple after temple, tomb after tomb. Your guide will individualize your discovery and focus your time on the most exquisite and interesting. You will continue down the old Avenue of Sphinxes to the temple complex of Karnak, and then the scale will multiply. The largest of all of Egypt’s temples, the scale can only be comprehended when you stand in the main temple courtyard. You can take your time and allow the silence to take over as impressions of stone imprint themselves. Your guide will unravel the details and over the course of the day, will answer those questions you had when you landed in Luxor earlier in the day. There will be time to visit the Luxor Museum should you wish, as you travel the banks of the River Nile."

The rulers of Ancient Egypt’s 18th dynasty were mummified and left in the Valley of the Kings and Valley of the Queens, where exquisite details adorn the walls and stories are told in strange images. You will visit four of the tombs, and your guide will explain the potential options. King Tutankhamen’s is usually seen as unmissable, predominantly for its fame. King Ramesses VI’s should also be seen for its beauty and size. Down in the musty tombs, you can inspect the walls of detail as your guide will point out what has been left behind after over 3,000 years. An ethereal atmosphere hangs in the air and will remind you that these were places of rest. There will be a beautiful moment as you ascend the steps and return to the tomb entrance and admire the endless vista over the desert. After a stop for lunch, you will be guided through the Valley of the Queens and take time in the Mortuary Temple of Queen Hatshepsut. Of all Egypt’s ancient monuments, perhaps none capture the era’s stylistic innovation as well as this one. Enjoy your time cruising away from Luxor in the evening."

After that, continue to Cairo and return for the night to the Marriott Mena House Hotel, a place of phenomenal old-world grandeur.

Explore the interior of one of the temples, visit the famous viewpoints, gaze up at the protective Sphinx of Giza, and understand why photos simply do not do justice to these monuments. By mid to late morning, you will be back at Mena House Hotel for a hearty brunch and some relaxed hours spent on the roof. Your private afternoon tour will reveal the oldest of the pyramids, the crumbling and weathered stepped pyramids of Saqqara. While not as visually impressive, these pyramids are a great insight into the construction and design of the icons."

The museum first opened in 1902 and houses approximately 120,000 artifacts. After lunch, you can spend the afternoon wandering through the cobbled streets of Coptic Cairo, where churches date to the 5th century AD.

You will be greeted at the airport, and it will be a three-hour drive out to Petra, with a couple of potential stops on route dependent on your mood. Relax at the five-star Movenpick Petra and let the heat of the afternoon slip away before you enter the mesmeric sandstone city. The hotel combines the beauty and flair of natural stone, intricate handcrafted wood, and Middle Eastern fabrics for a collection of sensational textures accentuating the ambiance around one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. The Arabic-style courtyard provides a soothing window into the past and a selection of the luxurious rooms offer enchanting views over the Great Rift Valley. The comforts of the modern rooms contrast the antique ambiance of the ancient city located across the street from the hotel. Late afternoon will cast a seductive glow onto the rock as swirls of rustic red and radiant orange bounce back off of the canyon walls. Tomorrow you will explore the different buildings to admire their contrasts, but today’s sunset will be about admiring the city from a raised vantage point and watching the subtle changes as dusk takes hold. Your private guide will lead you towards the famous entrance of Petra for the evening tour. You will descend slowly as the canyon narrows, and you approach Petra’s ancient, hidden entrance. Take a few more steps, and a whole world will open as buildings are carved into red cliffs and sculptures dominate the sandstone. With candlelight as your guide, you will make out the city avenues as they wind around the cliffs and lead to majestic layers of rock. Silence reigns, and you will hear every footstep. Hold your light out and reveal a new set of detail, which then disappears as you walk on. Exploring Petra at candlelight has an almost transcendent element, one that slowly evokes the atmosphere of this city’s distant origins."

This sandstone city is not merely a cluster of photogenic buildings, but a sprawling expanse of caves, tombs, Roman pillars, polished granite and sculpted icons. After breakfast, your private guide will explain the potential route options. You can only get around the city by foot, or by donkey. The area close to Petra’s narrow canyon entrance has the most famous sights but starting from the opposite side will reveal the city’s most impressive temple. The walk could be less than an hour, uncovering a few exceptional icons or you could also spend a whole day and only see half the city, such is its enormity and vivid detail. Take as long as you like because, like all good cities, the real beauty comes when you head off the beaten track.
