  "generalInfo": "Embark on an unforgettable 11-day journey through the captivating landscapes and rich histories of Jordan and Lebanon. Your adventure begins in Amman, Jordan's vibrant capital, where you'll be transferred to your hotel upon arrival, with time to settle in before the explorations commence. The following day delves deep into antiquity, starting with a visit to Jerash, renowned for possessing some of the most extensive and well-preserved Roman ruins outside Italy. Returning to Amman, known as the 'white city', you'll explore millennia of history at the Citadel, encompassing the Temple of Hercules and Umayyad Palace, followed by the impressive Roman Theatre. The day is enriched with a lively street food tasting experience in Downtown Amman and concludes with an insightful evening visit to the Wild Jordan Centre, supporting local conservation efforts. The journey south unfolds along the scenic King's Highway, a route offering picturesque views of deep wadis and rural villages. Stops include Madaba, famous for the ancient Byzantine mosaic map in St. George's Church, and Mount Nebo, offering panoramic vistas towards the Holy Land. After traversing the dramatic Wadi al-Mujib gorge, you'll visit the imposing Crusader fortress of Shobak Castle before arriving in Petra. Here, optional evening activities provide a magical introduction to the city, choosing between the atmospheric Petra by Candlelight experience or a hands-on Jordanian cooking class at the Petra Kitchen (pre-booking recommended). The next day is dedicated entirely to the awe-inspiring Nabataean city of Petra. Following a guided tour through the narrow Siq canyon, revealing the breathtaking Treasury facade carved into the rock, you'll have ample free time to explore this vast site independently. Discover countless tombs, the Roman amphitheatre, and consider challenging climbs to the Monastery or the High Place of Sacrifice for incredible views and a deeper appreciation of this world wonder. Leaving Petra's rock-hewn marvels, you'll drive into the spectacular desert landscape of Wadi Rum. Experience the magic of the desert with an overnight stay in a comfortable Bedouin camp nestled amongst towering sandstone cliffs. An included jeep safari reveals the dramatic 'jebels' and unique rock formations famed by T.E. Lawrence. Enhance your desert experience with optional activities like camel riding, quad biking, a serene hot air balloon flight at dawn, or stargazing under the clear desert skies after enjoying a traditional Bedouin dinner. The following morning, after further exploration via jeep, the journey continues north to the Dead Sea, the lowest point on Earth. Check into your resort on its shores and enjoy ample time to experience the unique buoyancy of the salt-rich waters, indulge in therapeutic mud treatments, or simply relax. For the adventurous (typically April-October), an optional trek through the water-filled canyons of nearby Wadi Mujib is available. Day six marks the transition to Lebanon, with a transfer to Amman airport for your flight to Beirut (please note this flight cost is not included). Upon arrival in Beirut, you'll be met and transferred to your hotel. The Lebanese leg of your adventure begins by heading north to the stunning Jeita Grotto, a vast system of limestone caves filled with incredible stalactites and stalagmites. Continue to Harissa, taking a cable car up to the mountain-top shrine for breathtaking coastal views. The day also includes a visit to the unique Baatara Gorge sinkhole and waterfall (seasonal), exploration of Douma Village with an included traditional lunch, before reaching the serene Qadisha Valley for an overnight stay in a monastery or local guesthouse. Explore the UNESCO-listed Qadisha Valley (Holy Valley) the next morning, perhaps joining the monks for prayers, before visiting Becharre, birthplace of Kahlil Gibran, and the iconic Cedars of God reserve. The day concludes in the ancient Phoenician port city of Byblos, another UNESCO site, brimming with millennia of history. Enjoy a free morning exploring Byblos' charming markets and harbour before travelling inland. A highlight is the visit to Ksara Winery, Lebanon's oldest, for a tour of its historic caves and a wine tasting session, before continuing to Zahle. The penultimate day offers a spectacular immersion in history with a visit to the colossal Roman temple complex at Baalbek (Heliopolis), one of the most impressive Roman sites globally. Afterwards, explore the well-preserved 8th-century Umayyad city of Anjar in the Bekaa Valley, showcasing remarkable early Islamic urban planning, before driving back to Beirut for the final night. Your comprehensive tour concludes on day eleven with free time for last-minute exploration or souvenir shopping in Beirut before your included transfer to the airport for your departure flight. Throughout the tour, breakfasts are included daily, along with specific lunches and dinners as detailed in the itinerary.",

      "description": "Explore Ancient Jerash and Amman, Street Food Experience & evening visit to the Wild Jordan Centre We begin our day travelling north from Amman to the nearby city of Jerash, home to one of the largest and best-preserved examples of Roman architecture outside of Italy. Often called the 'Jewel of the North', Jerash reveals an unbroken history of human settlement stretching back over 6,500 years. Hidden beneath sand for centuries, extensive excavations and restorations over the last 70 years have uncovered a remarkable example of the grand, formal Roman provincial urbanism typical throughout the Middle East. Upon returning to Amman in the afternoon, we explore Jordan's capital, famously known as the 'white city' due to its abundance of white limestone buildings. Amman's history spans millennia, with archaeological work uncovering remains from the Neolithic period through the Hellenistic, late Roman, and Arab Islamic eras. Our tour includes the Citadel, the historic site of the Temple of Hercules, the Umayyad Palace, and the Byzantine Church. We will also visit the impressive 6,000-seat Roman Theatre, dating back to when the city was known as Philadelphia. Following our exploration of the historical sites, we delve into the vibrant atmosphere of Downtown Amman with a street food tasting experience. You'll have the chance to sample local delicacies, which typically include sweet Kunefa, refreshing Sugar Cane Juice, and savoury Falafel, though specific offerings may vary based on availability during our visit. Afterwards, there will be time to return to the hotel to refresh before our evening activity. To conclude our day, we'll enjoy an evening visit to the Wild Jordan Centre. This unique establishment is not only a fantastic spot to relax but also plays a crucial role in supporting Jordan's natural heritage and local communities. It serves as a hub for the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature's ecotourism and handicraft projects, promoting sustainability by generating income for rural communities living in and around Jordan's nature reserves and aiding conservation efforts. For those who would prefer a more relaxed evening, you are welcome to remain at the hotel instead. OVERNIGHT"

      "description": "Kings Highway to Petra with stops in Madaba, Mount Nebo & Shobak Castle. Optional Petra by Night or Cookery Class We leave Amman behind us today as we drive along the scenic King's Highway towards Petra. The drive itself is beautiful, crossing deep wadis, passing through olive groves, and navigating remote rural villages, offering you a unique insight into the daily lives of the local people. Our first stop will be at Madaba, where we visit the Greek Orthodox Church of St. George, famed for its remarkable 6th-century Byzantine mosaic map depicting the Holy Land and other biblical sites. Next, we'll venture up Mount Nebo, a significant viewpoint offering breathtaking panoramic views over the Jordan Valley towards the Holy Land. We'll hit the road once more, this time crossing the stunning Wadi al-Mujib gorge. The route winds through olive groves before climbing over the deep canyon until we reach Shobak Castle. Perched dramatically on a mountainside, Shobak is another impressive example of the Crusader castles built during the early 12th century to guard the vital trade routes between Egypt and Damascus. Upon arrival in Petra, we'll check into our hotel. This evening offers two optional activities for you to choose from. You could opt for a magical first glimpse of Petra with the atmospheric Petra by Candlelight experience, walking through the Siq canyon to see the iconic Treasury illuminated solely by hundreds of candles. Alternatively, food enthusiasts might enjoy participating in a hands-on cooking class at the renowned Petra Kitchen, learning the secrets of preparing traditional Jordanian dishes. Please note that pre-booking is essential for the Petra Kitchen experience as it is very popular and spaces are limited. OVERNIGHT"

      "description": "Full day exploration of Petra, camping underneath the stars in Wadi Rum Today is all about exploring the Nabataean site of Petra. It was once the ancient capital of the Nabataean commercial empire until the Romans finally took over in 106 AD. For a long period, Petra was forgotten – except by the local Bedouins – before it was rediscovered in 1812 by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt. Petra is found at the edge of the Wadi Araba desert, where canyon walls and towering hills make it virtually inaccessible, except via a narrow cleft in the rock known as the Siq. There are very few free-standing buildings in Petra, as the Nabataeans chose to carve their dwellings into the multicoloured sandstone cliffs. Petra has become one of Jordan's main tourist attractions. We have most of the day available today to explore this ancient city (a 2-3 hour guided tour, then free time to explore independently). We start by making our way through the Siq, which rises to 200 metres above us and narrows to just 2 metres wide in certain sections. Keep an eye out for the ancient Nabataean water channel still visible on one wall, and remnants of the terracotta pipes that brought water into the city are also present. We'll turn a corner and suddenly – one of the most familiar sights of Petra will be in front of you – The Khazneh (Treasury) comes into view. Our guide will explain how this, and the other buildings here, are mainly elaborate facades carved into the rock from the top down, and also discuss the spiritual significance of the building style. From the Treasury, the valley opens out, and you'll see tombs carved into the rock on both sides. You'll get a glimpse of the ruined Roman amphitheatre and colonnaded streets. During your free time, you can walk up a steep and narrow winding gorge to the towering 'Monastery' – which is 50 metres high and 45 metres wide, providing breathtaking views of the Wadi Araba desert and the Jordan Valley. Another climb takes you to the High Place of Sacrifice and the Lion Fountain. All in all, this is a full and tiring, but hugely rewarding, day touring one of the world's most famous ancient sites. Walking distances today are an absolute minimum of 3km through the Siq to the Treasury and back, plus distance to see a few tombs; 8km to take the trail on as far as the main basin; plus an additional few km to the Monastery and back (over 800 steps up and down). For those with less mobility or who are worried about the distance golf buggies are available for around 25 USD per person one way 40 USD per person round trip to take you on the 1.2km journey through the Siq to the Treasury and back again at an agreed time. Horse carriages are also available but we recommend against using these due to animal welfare reasons. Later in the afternoon, we leave Petra and drive into the spectacular desert scenery of Wadi Rum. Whilst staying in Wadi Rum, several optional activities are available to enhance your desert experience, such as taking a traditional camel ride through the sand dunes, soaring above the landscape on a hot air balloon flight (typically at dawn, weather permitting), or enjoying an adventurous desert quad biking excursion. Upon arrival at our camp, friendly Bedouin hosts will greet us at our comfortable site, nestled beneath towering rocks and cliffs. We spend the evening relaxing at the camp and enjoying a delicious traditional Jordanian meal. As night falls and the stars emerge, there is also an option to join a captivating astronomy experience, taking advantage of Wadi Rum's exceptionally clear desert skies and unique vantage point to observe stars, constellations, and planets in incredible detail.

      "description": "Wadi Rum Jeep Safari and overnight stay at the Dead Sea (optional excursion to Wadi Mujib) We start the day early, exploring the beautiful desert and mountain scenery of Wadi Rum. Keep an eye out for the copper-coloured rocky 'jebels', which mesmerised T.E. Lawrence during his visits to the desert during the Arab Revolt and were later famed in the movie Lawrence of Arabia. We'll take a jeep safari through the stunning desert landscape, seeing more of the sheer cliffs and bizarre, weathered rock formations. We say goodbye to Wadi Rum later in the morning and head north towards the Dead Sea, one of the planet's most spectacular natural and spiritual landscapes. Not only is it the lowest point on Earth, at approximately 400 metres below sea level, but it's also filled with dramatic, natural wonders. The Dead Sea is fed by numerous rivers, including the River Jordan. Once the waters reach the Dead Sea, they are land-locked with no outlet, so they evaporate under the intense desert sun. This process leaves behind a dense, rich cocktail of salts and minerals, renowned worldwide and supplying the cosmetics, agriculture, and medicine industries with some of their finest raw products. The Dead Sea is flanked by mountains to the east and the rolling hills towards Jerusalem to the west, giving it an almost otherworldly beauty. Although sparsely populated and serenely quiet now, the area is believed by some to have been home to five Biblical cities"

      "description": "Jeita Grotto, Harissa cable car, Baatara Gorge After leaving the capital city of Beirut behind this morning, we begin our journey north, making our first stop to explore the awe-inspiring Jeita Grotto. Here you’ll get a chance to explore part of the system of limestone caves which span a total distance of almost 9km. The caves contain one of the worlds largest collections of stalactites and stalagmites and was one of the finalists in the New 7 Wonders of Nature competition; it’s no wonder the caves are considered a symbol of Lebanon. Moving on, our next stop is Harissa, which is famous for the mountain top Christian shrine, dedicated to the Virgin Mary. We’ll take the cable car up to visit the church and enjoy the stunning views of the coastline. Our final stop of the day is the unique Baatara Gorge sinkhole, where in spring and after rainy periods a 255 meter waterfall cascades down into the enormous cavern. We’ll have time for a short hike here and we’ll also explore a nearby Douma Village, where a traditional lunch is included. The day finishes with a short drive to the beautiful Qadisha Valley where we spend the night in the Monastery of St. Anthony, in a separate building with simple but comfortable en-suite accommodation (a nearby guesthouse will be used if the monastery is closed to visitors or unavailable).

      "description": "Qadisha Valley, Cedars Ski Resort & Byblos For those early risers, you have the opportunity to join the monks for their early morning prayers in the monastery. After breakfast, there will be time to explore some of the Qadisha Valley, another UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Qadisha Valley is known as the Holy Valley, and the Holy River, the Nahr Qadisha flows through it. There are many caverns to be found on its steep cliffs which were used for shelter during ancient times. After leaving the valley behind, our first stop will be the village of Becharre, famous for being the birthplace of the iconic poet and novelist, Kahlil Gibran. In the village there is a small museum dedicated to him where you'll be able to see some of his paintings and manuscripts displayed. Next, we'll visit the Cedars Ski Resort, famous as being one just a few ski resorts in the Middle East. The area often referred to as the Cedars of God is also found nearby, which contains some of the last groves of the cedar forests which once thrived in this region. The Cedrus Libani, Cedars of Lebanon are even mentioned in the Old Testament and have become a national symbol of Lebanon. Later today we arrive in Byblos, an ancient Phoenician city that is thought to have been inhabited for up to 7000 years. Locally, the city is known as Jbeil and is another UNESCO World Heritage site. Byblos is filled with significant historical and archaeological sites, and also features a lovely Phoenician harbour. OVERNIGHT"

      "description": "Exploring Baalbek and Anjar You're in for real a treat today as we'll be visiting the incredible site of Baalbek. Referred to as 'Heliopolis' or 'City of the Sun' by the Romans and Greeks, it is home to a sanctuary dedicated to worshipping the Heliopolitan triad of gods; Jupiter, Venus and Mercury. In ancient times, thousands of pilgrims would flock to the temple in order to venerate the triad. Today, the temple remains remarkably well preserved. After leaving Baalbak we'll make a stop at the nearby Umayyad city of Anjar, located within the Bekaa Valley. Caliph Walid founded the city in the 8th century and what remains of the city today, gives great insight into the excellent town-planning which must have taken place. You'll see mosques, palaces and baths. There were also up to 600 shops within the city in ancient times, demonstarting how important of a trading post Anjar must once have been. We end the day with a drive back to Beirut where we'll spend the night. OVERNIGHT"
