  "generalInfo": "This comprehensive 7-day journey through Jordan offers a captivating blend of ancient history, vibrant culture, and stunning natural landscapes. Beginning in the bustling capital of Amman, the tour quickly immerses you in local life with a visit to the historic hilltop town of As-Salt. Here, you'll walk the 'Daily Life Trail', exploring its charming Ottoman-era architecture, bustling souqs along Hammam Street, and engaging with local artisans, all while supporting sustainable community tourism. The day continues with a visit to the significant Baptism Site at Bethany before returning to Amman. The adventure proceeds north to the magnificent Roman ruins of Jerash, one of the best-preserved examples of Roman provincial urbanism outside Italy. Back in Amman, you'll delve into the capital's rich past at the Citadel and the impressive Roman Theatre, followed by a delightful street food tasting experience in the lively downtown area. An evening visit to the Wild Jordan Centre highlights the country's commitment to conservation and supporting local communities through ecotourism, offering a relaxing end to a day of exploration. The tour then heads south along the scenic King's Highway, a route steeped in history, stopping at the mosaic city of Madaba, the biblical viewpoint of Mount Nebo, and the imposing Crusader fortress of Shobak Castle. The highlight for many follows: a full day dedicated to exploring the awe-inspiring Nabataean city of Petra. You'll walk through the narrow Siq to marvel at the Treasury, discover ancient tombs carved into sandstone cliffs, and have free time to climb to viewpoints like the Monastery. The experience shifts dramatically as you travel to the spectacular desert landscapes of Wadi Rum for an overnight stay in a traditional Bedouin camp, complete with a jeep safari through the mesmerising 'jebels' and optional desert activities like camel riding or stargazing. Concluding the journey, you'll travel to the lowest point on Earth, the Dead Sea. Here, you'll have ample time to experience the unique sensation of floating effortlessly in the hyper-saline waters and benefit from the mineral-rich mud. An optional trek through the water-filled canyons of nearby Wadi Mujib offers a final thrill for the adventurous. The tour wraps up with free time back in Amman for last-minute exploration or relaxation before your departure, concluding an unforgettable exploration of Jordan's most treasured sites. The standard tour price is based on comfortable 3 to 4-star hotels, however, an upgrade to superior grade hotels is also available, which enhances the accommodation used in Amman, Petra and the Dead Sea while the unique stay in Wadi Rum remains consistent across both options",

      "description": "Visit As-Salt and experience the 'Daily Life Trail'. Visit the Baptism Site in Bethany We start the day with a visit to the hilltop town of As-Salt, a UNESCO World Heritage site recognised for its tolerance and hospitality, which once served as a trading link between the Jordan Valley and the Eastern Desert. As-Salt is known for its impressive Ottoman-era architecture built using yellow limestone, with distinctive domed roofs and arched windows. Today, the town serves as an example of the religious and cultural friendship between the local Muslim & Christian population. To experience its authentic atmosphere, we'll head out on a walking tour of its 'Daily Life Trail'. This route focuses on the vibrant market area (souq) along Hammam Street, the town's main commercial artery for generations. Here, bustling shops sell a wide array of goods – fresh produce at the farmers' market, aromatic spices, traditional clothing, intricate gold and silver items in the jewellery market, local sweets, perfumes, nuts, and handmade crafts from local artisans. The trail allows us to see locals go about their day, perhaps gathering in Al Ain Plaza (the central square, historically a water source and traders' meeting point) to chat or play the traditional board game, Mangaleh. We'll visit key sites like the beautifully restored Historic Old Salt Museum housed in the magnificent Abu Jaber House, pass by the Great Mosque, climb the Al-Eskafyeh stairs historically lined with shoemakers still plying their trade, sample traditional Shrak bread hot from A'shour Bakery, observe local artisans at work, and truly absorb the unique culture, textures, and sounds of the Salti lifestyle, all while supporting the local community and promoting sustainable tourism through direct engagement with authentic, independent businesses and traditions. We'll have lunch with a local family today, giving you your first taste of Jordanian cuisine (this is group size dependent, if the group is too large, we will head to a local restaurant). This meal further supports the local economy and offers genuine cultural exchange, reinforcing the sustainable approach. After lunch, we make our way to the Baptism site at Bethany, which is an excavated site believed to be the place where John baptised Jesus Christ. Many churches, caves and pools dating back to Roman & Byzantine periods have been found here. We'll also visit key sites there"

      "description": "Explore Ancient Jerash and Amman, Street Food Experience & evening visit to the Wild Jordan Centre We begin our day travelling north from Amman to the nearby city of Jerash, home to one of the largest and best-preserved examples of Roman architecture outside of Italy. Often called the 'Jewel of the North', Jerash reveals an unbroken history of human settlement stretching back over 6,500 years. Hidden beneath sand for centuries, extensive excavations and restorations over the last 70 years have uncovered a remarkable example of the grand, formal Roman provincial urbanism typical throughout the Middle East. Upon returning to Amman in the afternoon, we explore Jordan's capital, famously known as the 'white city' due to its abundance of white limestone buildings. Amman's history spans millennia, with archaeological work uncovering remains from the Neolithic period through the Hellenistic, late Roman, and Arab Islamic eras. Our tour includes the Citadel, the historic site of the Temple of Hercules, the Umayyad Palace, and the Byzantine Church. We will also visit the impressive 6,000-seat Roman Theatre, dating back to when the city was known as Philadelphia. Following our exploration of the historical sites, we delve into the vibrant atmosphere of Downtown Amman with a street food tasting experience. You'll have the chance to sample local delicacies, which typically include sweet Kunefa, refreshing Sugar Cane Juice, and savoury Falafel, though specific offerings may vary based on availability during our visit. Afterwards, there will be time to return to the hotel to refresh before our evening activity. To conclude our day, we'll enjoy an evening visit to the Wild Jordan Centre. This unique establishment is not only a fantastic spot to relax but also plays a crucial role in supporting Jordan's natural heritage and local communities. It serves as a hub for the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature's ecotourism and handicraft projects, promoting sustainability by generating income for rural communities living in and around Jordan's nature reserves and aiding conservation efforts. For those who would prefer a more relaxed evening, you are welcome to remain at the hotel instead. OVERNIGHT"

      "description": "Kings Highway to Petra with stops in Madaba, Mount Nebo & Shobak Castle. Optional Petra by Night or Cookery Class We leave Amman behind us today as we drive along the scenic King's Highway towards Petra. The drive itself is beautiful, crossing deep wadis, passing through olive groves, and navigating remote rural villages, offering you a unique insight into the daily lives of the local people. Our first stop will be at Madaba, where we visit the Greek Orthodox Church of St. George, famed for its remarkable 6th-century Byzantine mosaic map depicting the Holy Land and other biblical sites. Next, we'll venture up Mount Nebo, a significant viewpoint offering breathtaking panoramic views over the Jordan Valley towards the Holy Land. We'll hit the road once more, this time crossing the stunning Wadi al-Mujib gorge. The route winds through olive groves before climbing over the deep canyon until we reach Shobak Castle. Perched dramatically on a mountainside, Shobak is another impressive example of the Crusader castles built during the early 12th century to guard the vital trade routes between Egypt and Damascus. Upon arrival in Petra, we'll check into our hotel. This evening offers two optional activities for you to choose from. You could opt for a magical first glimpse of Petra with the atmospheric Petra by Candlelight experience, walking through the Siq canyon to see the iconic Treasury illuminated solely by hundreds of candles. Alternatively, food enthusiasts might enjoy participating in a hands-on cooking class at the renowned Petra Kitchen, learning the secrets of preparing traditional Jordanian dishes. Please note that pre-booking is essential for the Petra Kitchen experience as it is very popular and spaces are limited. OVERNIGHT"

      "description": "Full day exploration of Petra, camping underneath the stars in Wadi Rum Today is all about exploring the Nabataean site of Petra. It was once the ancient capital of the Nabataean commercial empire until the Romans finally took over in 106 AD. For a long period, Petra was forgotten – except by the local Bedouins – before it was rediscovered in 1812 by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt. Petra is found at the edge of the Wadi Araba desert, where canyon walls and towering hills make it virtually inaccessible, except via a narrow cleft in the rock known as the Siq. There are very few free-standing buildings in Petra, as the Nabataeans chose to carve their dwellings into the multicoloured sandstone cliffs. Petra has become one of Jordan's main tourist attractions. We have most of the day available today to explore this ancient city (a 2-3 hour guided tour, then free time to explore independently). We start by making our way through the Siq, which rises to 200 metres above us and narrows to just 2 metres wide in certain sections. Keep an eye out for the ancient Nabataean water channel still visible on one wall, and remnants of the terracotta pipes that brought water into the city are also present. We'll turn a corner and suddenly – one of the most familiar sights of Petra will be in front of you – The Khazneh (Treasury) comes into view. Our guide will explain how this, and the other buildings here, are mainly elaborate facades carved into the rock from the top down, and also discuss the spiritual significance of the building style. From the Treasury, the valley opens out, and you'll see tombs carved into the rock on both sides. You'll get a glimpse of the ruined Roman amphitheatre and colonnaded streets. During your free time, you can walk up a steep and narrow winding gorge to the towering 'Monastery' – which is 50 metres high and 45 metres wide, providing breathtaking views of the Wadi Araba desert and the Jordan Valley. Another climb takes you to the High Place of Sacrifice and the Lion Fountain. All in all, this is a full and tiring, but hugely rewarding, day touring one of the world's most famous ancient sites. Walking distances today are an absolute minimum of 3km through the Siq to the Treasury and back, plus distance to see a few tombs; 8km to take the trail on as far as the main basin; plus an additional few km to the Monastery and back (over 800 steps up and down). For those with less mobility or who are worried about the distance golf buggies are available for around 25 USD per person one way 40 USD per person round trip to take you on the 1.2km journey through the Siq to the Treasury and back again at an agreed time. Horse carriages are also available but we recommend against using these due to animal welfare reasons. Later in the afternoon, we leave Petra and drive into the spectacular desert scenery of Wadi Rum. Whilst staying in Wadi Rum, several optional activities are available to enhance your desert experience, such as taking a traditional camel ride through the sand dunes, soaring above the landscape on a hot air balloon flight (typically at dawn, weather permitting), or enjoying an adventurous desert quad biking excursion. Upon arrival at our camp, friendly Bedouin hosts will greet us at our comfortable site, nestled beneath towering rocks and cliffs. We spend the evening relaxing at the camp and enjoying a delicious traditional Jordanian meal. As night falls and the stars emerge, there is also an option to join a captivating astronomy experience, taking advantage of Wadi Rum's exceptionally clear desert skies and unique vantage point to observe stars, constellations, and planets in incredible detail. OVERNIGHT"

      "description": "Wadi Rum Jeep Safari and overnight stay at the Dead Sea (optional excursion to Wadi Mujib) We start the day early, exploring the beautiful desert and mountain scenery of Wadi Rum. Keep an eye out for the copper-coloured rocky 'jebels', which mesmerised T.E. Lawrence during his visits to the desert during the Arab Revolt and were later famed in the movie Lawrence of Arabia. We'll take a jeep safari through the stunning desert landscape, seeing more of the sheer cliffs and bizarre, weathered rock formations. We say goodbye to Wadi Rum later in the morning and head north towards the Dead Sea, one of the planet's most spectacular natural and spiritual landscapes. Not only is it the lowest point on Earth, at approximately 400 metres below sea level, but it's also filled with dramatic, natural wonders. The Dead Sea is fed by numerous rivers, including the River Jordan. Once the waters reach the Dead Sea, they are land-locked with no outlet, so they evaporate under the intense desert sun. This process leaves behind a dense, rich cocktail of salts and minerals, renowned worldwide and supplying the cosmetics, agriculture, and medicine industries with some of their finest raw products. The Dead Sea is flanked by mountains to the east and the rolling hills towards Jerusalem to the west, giving it an almost otherworldly beauty. Although sparsely populated and serenely quiet now, the area is believed by some to have been home to five Biblical cities"
