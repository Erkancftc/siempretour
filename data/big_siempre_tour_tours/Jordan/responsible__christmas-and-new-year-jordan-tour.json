  "generalInfo": "For a distinctive Christmas and New Year you'll never forget, head for Jordan! <br/><br/>This beautiful and welcoming country has some special Biblical links adding depth to the Christmas experience. Begin Christmas Day itself with a visit to the St George Church in Madaba to see its famous mosaic map – a 6th century jewel representing the oldest existing map of Palestine. Next is Mt Nebo - from where Moses viewed the Promised Land. <br/><br/>End Christmas Day with a visit to Bethany – a key pilgrimage site on the River Jordan where John the Baptist is believed to have baptised Jesus. Here you can explore Roman and Byzantine remains including a monastery, hermit caves and special baptism pools. <br/><br/>Enjoy Christmas dinner overlooking the Dead Sea, then fill the days between Christmas and New Year visiting some of Jordan's most evocative sites. You'll have a whole day, for example, amid the stunning rose-red 2300-year-old ruins of the majestic desert city of Petra – with the added enchantment of a night-time candlelit visit.<br/> <br/>You'll also explore the dramatic sandstone vistas of Wadi Rum, described by Lawrence of Arabia as a \"vast, echoing moon like landscape”, where your luxury campsite offers a chance to sleep outdoors under breathtaking starry skies. <br/><br/>Then party into the New Year over a fantastic gala dinner in the coastal resort of Aqaba – maybe after a day lazing on the beach or snorkelling the Red Sea's clear waters.",
