    "generalInfo": "This week long Iraqi Kurdistan holiday, sometimes called the ‘other Iraq’, is an extraordinary journey around this ancient region in northern Iraq, which has autonomous status. With parts of the region horrifically scarred by Saddam Hussein’s regime, we can’t avoid some of the memorials put in place to recognise these terrible times, but we can also celebrate its cultural and natural wonders which are now slowly being revealed to world travellers.  <br/> <br/>Iraqi Kurdistan is a fascinating and very beautiful place, with warm and friendly people and a profound if challenging history. This small group tour starts in the ancient city of Erbil, also the capital, which is packed with cultural sites and monuments that immediately show us what a vast history we are dealing with here.  This is, after all, one of the oldest continually inhabited cities in the world and sites like its Qalat Hawler citadel, Qaysari Bazaar and maze of ancient streets capture this.<br/> <br/>Travelling by private car or minibus, depending on the group size, we head from Erbil to Dohuk visiting more sacred sites en route and then spending a night in this picturesque town in the Tigris River Valley, totally enveloped by mountains. A fertile area, it is particularly famous for grape production, as well as other fruit and vegetables. Close to the Turkish border, it became an important hub for produce being grown or smuggled in during the years of sanctions imposed on the country. Like most places in this part of Iraq, there are many stories to be told and no better place to hear them than at Dohuk’s lively bazaar. <br/><br/>Zakho, with its stunning stone arch bridge over the Khabur River is another fascinating urban stop as are Suleimaniyah and Halabja, both of which were targets of Saddam Hussein’s brutality. The Kurds are a welcoming people, natural hosts, and are keen to share stories of recent resilience but also their ancient heritage, always over generous portions of tea and food. Visiting sites such as the Amna Suraka (Red Security) buildings in Suleimaniyah, where many Kurds perished, as well as the Monument of Halabja Martyrs and the Halabja Cemetery are difficult to take in, but a vital part of any trip to this region. You will also leave with some very happy memories of a thought provoking and totally inspiring destination. <br/>",

Hatra played a significant role as a caravan city, serving as a major religious and trading centre until its destruction by the Sasanian Empire. Despite its ancient fall, it has remained a symbol of cultural and historical resilience and remains one of the country’s most impressive sites. After lunch, we’ll return to Mosul to explore its old town and observe the restoration (being overseen by UNESCO as part of their Revive the Spirit of Mosul campaign) following the city’s occupation and destruction by Daesh less than a decade ago. The efforts to rebuild and restore the historic city centre are inspiring and reflect the community's dedication to preserving its rich heritage."

This massive structure, with its soaring brickwork and distinctive curve, is one of the last remaining examples of Sassanid architecture and a reminder of the empire’s architectural ambition. To conclude the day, we return to the heart of Baghdad and visit the lively Karada district. Known for its evening atmosphere, Karada is filled with local cafes, restaurants, jewelry shops, and food stalls. It’s the perfect place to relax, try traditional snacks, and get a feel for modern urban life in Iraq."

        "description": "After breakfast in Baghdad, our day begins with a visit to the Martyrs’ Monument, a striking symbol of remembrance designed by renowned Iraqi sculptor Ismail Fatah al-Turk. Initially built to honor the soldiers who lost their lives during the Iran-Iraq War, the monument has come to represent all Iraqi martyrs. Its powerful form and the stories it holds offer a moment for quiet reflection before we continue. Next, we’ll explore the Baghdad National Museum, which houses an extraordinary collection of artifacts spanning thousands of years. From the earliest Sumerian relics to pieces from the Islamic era, the museum provides a meaningful overview of the cultural and historical depth of Mesopotamia — one of the oldest cradles of civilization. We then travel south to visit the ancient city of Babylon. Once a major center of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, this archaeological site includes ruins of palaces, temples, and fortified walls. Babylon was a political and cultural powerhouse in the ancient world, and it is closely associated with King Nebuchadnezzar II, under whose rule the city reached its peak. Among the many legendary structures attributed to him are the Hanging Gardens, often cited as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Although their existence remains debated, their mention in historical texts adds depth to the site’s legacy. Above the ruins, we will also visit Saddam Hussein’s former palace, now repurposed as a museum. Built as a show of power, the palace directly overlooks the ancient city, creating a stark juxtaposition of past and recent history. By evening, we arrive in Karbala, one of the holiest cities for Shia Muslims. Our time here includes a visit to the Shrine of Imam Abbas, dedicated to the loyal brother of Imam Hussein, whose bravery and sacrifice are deeply honored in Shia tradition. We will also visit the Shrine of Imam Hussein himself, the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad, who was martyred in the Battle of Karbala in 680 AD. The atmosphere of devotion surrounding these sacred sites is both intense and moving. Tonight, we will stay in Karbala."

Here, we will visit Wadi-us-Salaam, the largest cemetery in the world and a profoundly significant site for Shia Muslims. With nearly six million graves, the cemetery stretches across a vast expanse and has been a sacred burial ground for centuries. It was recently added to the UNESCO World Heritage List due to its historical and cultural importance. Walking through this immense landscape offers a perspective on generations of history, reverence, and belief. From Najaf, we continue our journey south toward Nasiriyah. Our main stop in this region will be the ancient Ziggurat of Ur. Dating back to the 21st century BC, this stepped structure was once a central temple in the Sumerian city of Ur. Dedicated to the moon god Nanna, it is one of the best-preserved examples of Mesopotamian religious architecture. The ziggurat’s size and construction reflect the organizational power and spiritual life of one of the earliest known civilizations. Tonight, we stay in the city of Nasiriyah."

        "description": "Breakfast in Nasiriyah marks the beginning of a memorable day in one of Iraq’s most unique landscapes. The Mesopotamian Marshes, the largest wetlands in the Middle East, stretch across southern Iraq and offer an entirely different rhythm of life. Once drained during decades of conflict, they are gradually being revived, and today they serve not only as a critical ecological zone but also as a homeland for the Marsh Arabs — a community with deep-rooted traditions and a way of life shaped by the water. We will start with traditional tea and sit with local families who welcome visitors with warmth and storytelling, sharing memories passed down through generations. Then, we’ll glide through the winding waterways on a narrow wooden boat known as the Al-Mashhouf, which has been used here for centuries. The quiet movement through the maze of reeds and open lagoons offers a rare opportunity to experience life shaped by water, far from the pace of the cities. Lunch will be a true local experience — masgouf, the beloved Iraqi grilled fish dish, prepared on open flames made of reed instead of wood, and served inside a traditional guesthouse made entirely of reeds, known as Al-Mudhif. These arched structures are built without nails or modern tools, relying solely on the skill and heritage of the builders. After a peaceful afternoon among the marshes, we will make our way back to Baghdad, bringing with us the impression of a way of life that continues to endure against the odds."

        "description": "Breakfast in Baghdad marks the beginning of another remarkable day. We set off toward Samarra to visit its famous Spiral Minaret, a distinctive structure from the 9th century that rises over 50 meters into the sky. With its winding ramp circling the tower’s core, this minaret is one of the most recognizable landmarks of Islamic architecture and a reminder of the Abbasid Caliphate’s once-powerful presence in the region. Nearby, we will also visit the Abou Al Dalaf Mosque, another important site from the same era, reflecting the scale and vision of early Islamic design. In the afternoon, we continue to Hatra, an ancient fortified city that reached its peak in the second century. Positioned between the Roman and Parthian empires, Hatra became a wealthy trading center and capital of a small Arab kingdom. The site’s massive stone walls, temples, and watchtowers are a testament to its former significance. Though the city was destroyed and left in ruins by the third century, the scale and detail of what remains still leave a powerful impression. Its rediscovery in the 19th century brought to light a chapter of Middle Eastern history long buried beneath the sands. After taking in these important sites, we continue toward our destination for the night."
