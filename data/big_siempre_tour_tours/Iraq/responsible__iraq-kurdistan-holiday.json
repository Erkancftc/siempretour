  "generalInfo": "This week long Iraqi Kurdistan holiday, sometimes called the ‘other Iraq’, is an extraordinary journey around this ancient region in northern Iraq, which has autonomous status. With parts of the region horrifically scarred by Saddam Hussein’s regime, we can’t avoid some of the memorials put in place to recognise these terrible times, but we can also celebrate its cultural and natural wonders which are now slowly being revealed to world travellers.  <br/> <br/>Iraqi Kurdistan is a fascinating and very beautiful place, with warm and friendly people and a profound if challenging history. This small group tour starts in the ancient city of Erbil, also the capital, which is packed with cultural sites and monuments that immediately show us what a vast history we are dealing with here.  This is, after all, one of the oldest continually inhabited cities in the world and sites like its Qalat Hawler citadel, Qaysari Bazaar and maze of ancient streets capture this.<br/> <br/>Travelling by private car or minibus, depending on the group size, we head from Erbil to Dohuk visiting more sacred sites en route and then spending a night in this picturesque town in the Tigris River Valley, totally enveloped by mountains. A fertile area, it is particularly famous for grape production, as well as other fruit and vegetables. Close to the Turkish border, it became an important hub for produce being grown or smuggled in during the years of sanctions imposed on the country. Like most places in this part of Iraq, there are many stories to be told and no better place to hear them than at Dohuk’s lively bazaar. <br/><br/>Zakho, with its stunning stone arch bridge over the Khabur River is another fascinating urban stop as are Suleimaniyah and Halabja, both of which were targets of Saddam Hussein’s brutality. The Kurds are a welcoming people, natural hosts, and are keen to share stories of recent resilience but also their ancient heritage, always over generous portions of tea and food. Visiting sites such as the Amna Suraka (Red Security) buildings in Suleimaniyah, where many Kurds perished, as well as the Monument of Halabja Martyrs and the Halabja Cemetery are difficult to take in, but a vital part of any trip to this region. You will also leave with some very happy memories of a thought provoking and totally inspiring destination. <br/>",

Once the visit is over, we travel to the nearby village of Halabja, a place of almost unspeakable horror at the hands of Saddam Hussein’s military forces, and visit the fascinating Halabja Museum and Memorial Cemetery before returning to Suleimaniyah.
