  "generalInfo": "Moored in the Indian Ocean between Madagascar and Mozambique, this stunning archipelago is truly off the beaten path. Our Comoros holidays will help you explore the best that it has to offer, from stunning beaches to volcanic landscapes, to cities packed with history and culture.<br/><br/>Your tour kicks off on Grande Comore, the main island, where you’ll have time to explore the capital city of Moroni. It's a lively and enchanting place where medinas and markets rub shoulder with ancient sultans’ palaces – made all the more beguiling by the surrounding volcanic terrain.  <br/><br/>You’ll transfer to the island of Anjouan next, often thought of as the most beautiful island in the archipelago, full of luscious mountain terrain, lakes, waterfalls and, of course, gorgeous coastline.  <br/><br/>Then it’s on to the laid-back island of Mohéli, where days can be spent hiking in virgin rainforest, snorkelling in pristine waters, going whale and dolphin watching, and relaxing on beautiful beaches, which serve as turtle nesting sites at certain times of year. Returning to Moroni, there’s time to explore more of the town, or to hike to the summit of neighbouring Mt Karthala before your journey home. <br/>",
