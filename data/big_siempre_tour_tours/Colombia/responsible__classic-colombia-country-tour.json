      "description": "After breakfast, begin a half-day tour to visit the areas of Medellín that best represent the social transformation that has taken place in the city over the last 20 years. In the 1980s and '90s, Medellín was one of the most dangerous cities in the world, with the notorious drug lord, Pablo Escobar, and his Medellín Cartel operating at their peak. With his death in 1993, the reign of 'El Patrón' came to an end, but it took until 2002 for the city to start seeing real changes, when the government began to invest heavily in infrastructure and public education. Nowadays, the 'City of Eternal Spring' is one of the most innovative metropolises in the world. Visit the barrio San Javier, which used to be one of the most unsafe suburbs of Medellín. Located 7 km from the city centre, it is an excellent example of the social transformation that has taken place over the last few years. Arrive here by the Metrocable that joins the north-east area with the city centre, the installation of which has been life-changing for many of the inhabitants of Medellín. Learn more about the city’s transformation after the death of Pablo Escobar and explore Medellin’s newest invention: the outdoor escalators in the Comuna 13 district. Discover stories about the district's past by visiting the most important places marked by historical events and see graffiti that acts as a form of artistic expression for the community. Enjoy beautiful views over the city from San Javier. Then, continue to La Plazoleta (renamed Plaza Botero) located in the city centre. This area fell into decline in the 1980s but today houses 23 sculptures by Fernando Botero. The artist donated the sculptures to the city in 2000 and thus contributed to the cultural transformation of the city. After the tour, the rest of the day is at leisure for you to explore Medellín at your own pace. Meal plan: breakfast."
