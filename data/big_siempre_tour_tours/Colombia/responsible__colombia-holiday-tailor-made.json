  "generalInfo": "Colombia, few people do realize that Colombia has everything you can imagine of Latin America hidden in one country, and that nowadays it is a safe country to explore. It has the highest potential for an absolutely amazing holiday of whole South America, it has the Caribbean coast, absorbed African culture and rainforest, the Pacific coast, intact indigenous peoples with their traditions, the Andes in three mountain chains, the coffee zone, active and sleeping volcanoes, high mountains with glaciers, paramo’s, flat lands with cowboys, cattle and abundant wildlife as in the Brazilian Pantanal, the huge vastness of the Amazon rainforest with waterfalls that can compete with the Iguazu waterfalls, abundant birdlife, colonial history &amp; villages, arts &amp; handicrafts representing the variety of many countries in one, salsa, African mapale, vallenato and cumbia (and not to forget the Colombian reggaeton at the Caribbean): the only risk of this holiday is wanting to stay, el riesgo es que te quieres quedar ! The people of Colombia belong to the most welcoming, beautiful and warm hearted people of Latin America, many people won’t be able to match this with the image they have from Colombia, but it really is, be invited to explore this amazing country and its people with us.<br/><br/>This individual holiday of 27 days is a sample itinery and can be tailor made in all ways. We have chosen for a larger itinery of 27 days to show the variety of Colombia in one single roundtrip. We can make shorter itineries, more focused on culture, special theme travels as for bird watchers, photographers or beach lovers, family holidays with kids, all as you wish. We do work on tailor made basis but we can also offer travel modules of three or more days and classical roundtrips. All itineries are offered with private taxis as a standard. For traveling with public transport we need to check with our team in Bogota where this is safe and possible. For traveling with public transport you need to speak good Spanish and be an experienced traveller. Traveling with private taxis is expensive of course but the safest and most confortable way with photo stops along the way. With private transport the trip costs can be significant lower when you are able to travel as a small travelparty of eg 4 persons together. <br/><br/>To give an idea of more options in Colombia:<br/>- Walking, hiking and/or horseriding in the NP Cocuy, high Andes mountains (5-7 days)<br/>- Walking at Los Nevados NP between volcanoes, lagoons, paramos and glaciers (from day excursion, 3 day Paramillo trekking to valley Salento, to 2/3 ascent summit Santa Isabel and 5 days hiking program to top Nevado Tolioma), as long there is no high eruption risk and the NP is open<br/>- Extension to La Guajira desert and Caribbean coast after eg Cartagena, Santa Marta, Tayrona NP (4 days), as group excursion or with private driver-guide in 4x4, Wayuu indigenous culture<br/>- Trekking to the Lost City (Ciudad Perdida) at the Sierra Nevada and/or meeting of Kogui culture in the mountains (5 days)<br/>- Meeting with the Tayrona Kogui - Arhuaco culture before or after a visit to the NP Tayrona (4 days authentic program)<br/>- Wildlife in los Llanos – Casanares province at ecolodge Hato Aurora (filmed by BCC &amp; Animal Planet), with capybaras, 325 bird species, caimans, deers, anacondas of 7m long, jaguars, safaris, piranha fishing, walking and horse riding, traditional life of vagueros - Colombian cowboys &amp; cattle farming<br/>- Visit Cano Cristales, beautiful coloured river famous from photography books, from Yopal-Villaviciencia this can be combined by small plane after a stay at the hacienda Hato Aurora for instance<br/>- Staying at authentic coffee haciendas which are in production<br/>- Special birdwatching tours staying among others in lodges of Pro Aves mixed with other excursions<br/>- Diving holidays and PADI certification via dive school at Cartagena de Indias and/or at Santa Marta<br/>- Luxury Travel at the Caribbean and/or Pacific coast in the best ecolodges available with whale watching and boutique hotels, fincas and spas in the coffee zone and Cartagena, honeymoon at the Caribbean <br/>- Amazon travels: from Bogota to Leticia with Amacayacú National Park, from Villavicencio to Puerto Inírida, the start for the Cerros de Mavicure Amazonas tour, to travel with private guide into the Vaupes region, this is all pristine Amazonian rainforest off the beaten trek with amazing waterfalls and wildlife<br/>- Adventurous and special tailor made travel combining Venezuela’s tepui highlights with traveling upstream into Colombia at Inirida rainforest with private guide<br/>- Private guided roundtravels or Group travels through Colombia with Latin American expert speaking fluent English and Spanish<br/><br/>For the trek to Ciudad Perdida we work with a local partner, it is an all indigenous operated and owned operator, all of their staff is indigenous to the zone and therefore benefit directly from any reservations. During the trek itself, the group is always accompanied by at least one local indigenous guide and a translator and stays in indigenous owned camps. The Wiwa tribe in Colombia’s Sierra Nevada mountains have lived harmoniously with the wildlife surrounding them for thousands of years. Rising approximately 5,000 meters out of Northern Colombia’s Caribbean shores, the misty, cloud-shrouded Sierra Nevada mountains have been the home to several indigenous tribes for more than 2,000 years. As if unaffected by time, the Sierra’s indigenous tribes still live as their Tairona ancestors did centuries ago. Despite growing modernization and tourism in the area, the Wiwa community – the smallest of four tribes living in the Lost City today – show us how they strive to keep their ancient culture alive.<br/><br/>For those who would love to go into the mountains of the Sierra Nevada but wish to avoid a strenuous multiple day trekking, we have also a 4 day very authentic program in another area of the Sierra Nevada where you can visit a village of the Koguis with a 5 hrs walk, eventually with the support of mules for luggage. Rest of transport is with a 4x4 vehicle. The whole program is with a local Kogui guide. It starts in Santa Marta and you will return near NP Tayrona at the beach and is part of a 12 day itinery. You will walk through a subtropical ecosystem and enter the universe of the Koguis. After arriving in the community you will be welcomed and will meet with the local \"Mamo\". The program for the rest of the afternoon and evening is open, depending on the permissions given by the people of the village. You are guests and therefore the activities depend on the community suggestions. The aim is to interact as much as possible with the indigenous people, and your local Kogui guide will play a major role in this. You will have dinner in the village, and sleep in a hammock in a \"Choza\" (Kogui hut). <br/><br/>Featured activities: Meeting the authentic Colombia, being in nature, culture &amp; meeting the people of Colombia. Walking in mountains, visiting coffee haciendas, beachlife, colonial villages &amp; history, cumbia &amp; salsa, spa, horse riding, bird &amp; whale watching, snorkelling, diving, learning Spanish.<br/><br/>Then we make use of homestays at Tierradentro, Amazonas, Vaupes &amp; the Coffee zone but in case you are interested in an authentic experience homestays can be requested for whole Colombia. The families speak only Spanish and by making use of their homestay you directly support them. <br/><br/>In case you wish to travel from Colombia into Venezuela we can take care of the whole transfer in a private taxi with guidance from Cucuta airport crossing the border of Cucuta into Venezuela, heading to Bailadores, Tovar and Merida for your holiday. Venezuela is safer than any other country of South America at this moment and we really can recommend it. We offer adventurous hikes with waterfalls and canyoning, daywalks along high mountain lakes, tours by jeeps, birdwatching, wildlife, staying at an authentic coffee farm in the area of Santa Cruz de Mora, from turning inward at multidimensional gates in the Venezuelan Andes, to beach stays at Choroni and los Roques, have a 4 day program at Angel Falls at NP Canaima.
