In the 1980s and '90s, Medellín was one of the most dangerous cities in the world, with the notorious drug lord, Pablo Escobar, and his Medellín Cartel operating at their peak. With his death in 1993, the reign of 'El Patrón' came to an end, but it took until 2002 for the city to start seeing real changes, when the government began to invest heavily in infrastructure and public education. Nowadays, the 'City of Eternal Spring' is one of the most innovative metropolises in the world. Visit the barrio San Javier, which used to be one of the most unsafe suburbs of Medellín. Located 7 km from the city centre, it is an excellent example of the social transformation that has taken place over the last few years. Arrive here by the Metrocable that joins the north-east area with the city centre, the installation of which has been life-changing for many of the inhabitants of Medellín. Learn more about the city’s transformation after the death of Pablo Escobar and explore Medellin’s newest invention: the outdoor escalators in the Comuna 13 district. Discover stories about the district's past by visiting the most important places marked by historical events and see graffiti that acts as a form of artistic expression for the community. Enjoy beautiful views over the city from San Javier. Then, continue to La Plazoleta (renamed Plaza Botero) located in the city centre.

        "description": "Caribbean Paradise of Palomino: This morning you’ll be picked up from your hotel in Santa Marta and transferred to Tayrona National Park, one of Colombia’s well-known highlights. Here the tropical rainforest runs right up to the beach, the water is clear, the sand is soft and the palm trees are metres high. Entrance fees are included. After time to explore, your driver will take you to Palomino. Palomino doesn’t seem like much as you drive along the main road, but you’ll start to feel that Caribbean holiday vibe pretty quickly. Sandwiched between the Caribbean Sea and the snow-capped mountains of the Sierra Nevada, the laid-back beach village of Palomino has slowly developed into a popular stop-off for travellers who make it as far as Colombia’s north-east coast. It’s easy to see why, with a dreamy location and just enough good places to stay, eat and drink to keep you blissfully satisfied for a few days. You’ll stay 3 nights in a small-scale resort just outside the village overlooking the beach, and can spend your days relaxing under palm trees, tubing down the jungle-flanked river or swimming in the warm sea. On your last day you’ll be transferred from Palomino to Santa Marta Airport. This will take approx 2 hours."

We start with a visit to the evocative ruins of Panamá Viejo, the original city founded in 1519 and later destroyed by the infamous pirate Henry Morgan. Here, among the stone walls and cathedral remnants we begin to understand Panama’s origins as a critical junction of trade and empire. The narrative continues in Casco Viejo, the “new” colonial city founded after the destruction of the first. The intertwining stories of these two cities reflect the resilience and strategic importance of Panama through the centuries. We visit the Mola Museum, showcasing the intricate textile art of the Guna women; the beautifully curated Panama Canal Museum, housed in the former headquarters of the French and American canal builders; and the boutique Cacao and Chocolate Museum at Casa Coronel, which celebrates Panama’s growing artisanal chocolate culture. After lunch at a local restaurant, the journey continues to the Panama Canal Visitors Center at Miraflores Locks.

As we move through the treetops on a series of hanging bridges, witness the interplay of light and foliage and may catch glimpses of hummingbirds, toucans, or even the elusive resplendent quetzal among the bromeliads and moss-draped trees. Those with a taste for adrenaline may choose to replace the forest walk with an optional zipline adventure through the canopy. Later in the day, the focus turns to one of Panama’s most prized exports: coffee. A local finca opens its doors for a behind-the-scenes experience of specialty coffee production from the growing of high-altitude beans to their harvest, roasting, and final tasting.

Journey to the mountains of Zipaquirá and step into a masterpiece hidden 190 meters below the surface—the stunning Salt Cathedral. Built within a massive salt mine, this extraordinary Roman Catholic church is one of Colombia’s most iconic landmarks. Follow the 13-stage path that retraces Jesus’ last steps, culminating in the awe-inspiring three-caverned cathedral, home to the largest underground crucifix ever created. The Salt Cathedral is the second of its kind in Zipaquirá, constructed below its predecessor, which was closed for safety in 1992. Building this marvel required the removal of 250,000 tons of salt. The region’s salt mining history dates back to the 5th century BCE when the indigenous Muisca people, who named the town “land of the zipa,” were pioneers in salt extraction. As you explore this underground wonder, marvel at the intricate hand-carved decorations etched into halite rock and discover the spiritual history of a sanctuary originally created by miners seeking solace during their dangerous workdays. Today, the mines continue to produce 40% of Colombia’s salt, blending the country’s rich past and present. Discover the magic and history of the Catedral de Sal—a true Colombian treasure!"

The Wiwa tribe in Colombia’s Sierra Nevada mountains have lived harmoniously with the wildlife surrounding them for thousands of years. Rising approximately 5,000 meters out of Northern Colombia’s Caribbean shores, the misty, cloud-shrouded Sierra Nevada mountains have been the home to several indigenous tribes for more than 2,000 years. As if unaffected by time, the Sierra’s indigenous tribes still live as their Tairona ancestors did centuries ago. Despite growing modernization and tourism in the area, the Wiwa community – the smallest of four tribes living in the Lost City today – show us how they strive to keep their ancient culture alive.<br/><br/>For those who would love to go into the mountains of the Sierra Nevada but wish to avoid a strenuous multiple day trekking, we have also a 4 day very authentic program in another area of the Sierra Nevada where you can visit a village of the Koguis with a 5 hrs walk, eventually with the support of mules for luggage.

    "generalInfo": "Colombia, few people do realize that Colombia has everything you can imagine of Latin America hidden in one country, and that nowadays it is a safe country to explore. It has the highest potential for an absolutely amazing holiday of whole South America, it has the Caribbean coast, absorbed African culture and rainforest, the Pacific coast, intact indigenous peoples with their traditions, the Andes in three mountain chains, the coffee zone, active and sleeping volcanoes, high mountains with glaciers, paramo’s, flat lands with cowboys, cattle and abundant wildlife as in the Brazilian Pantanal, the huge vastness of the Amazon rainforest with waterfalls that can compete with the Iguazu waterfalls, abundant birdlife, colonial history &amp; villages, arts &amp; handicrafts representing the variety of many countries in one, salsa, African mapale, vallenato and cumbia (and not to forget the Colombian reggaeton at the Caribbean): the only risk of this holiday is wanting to stay, el riesgo es que te quieres quedar ! The people of Colombia belong to the most welcoming, beautiful and warm hearted people of Latin America, many people won’t be able to match this with the image they have from Colombia, but it really is, be invited to explore this amazing country and its people with us.<br/><br/>This individual holiday of 27 days is a sample itinery and can be tailor made in all ways. We have chosen for a larger itinery of 27 days to show the variety of Colombia in one single roundtrip. We can make shorter itineries, more focused on culture, special theme travels as for bird watchers, photographers or beach lovers, family holidays with kids, all as you wish. We do work on tailor made basis but we can also offer travel modules of three or more days and classical roundtrips. All itineries are offered with private taxis as a standard. For traveling with public transport we need to check with our team in Bogota where this is safe and possible. For traveling with public transport you need to speak good Spanish and be an experienced traveller. Traveling with private taxis is expensive of course but the safest and most confortable way with photo stops along the way. With private transport the trip costs can be significant lower when you are able to travel as a small travelparty of eg 4 persons together. <br/><br/>To give an idea of more options in Colombia:<br/>- Walking, hiking and/or horseriding in the NP Cocuy, high Andes mountains (5-7 days)<br/>- Walking at Los Nevados NP between volcanoes, lagoons, paramos and glaciers (from day excursion, 3 day Paramillo trekking to valley Salento, to 2/3 ascent summit Santa Isabel and 5 days hiking program to top Nevado Tolioma), as long there is no high eruption risk and the NP is open<br/>- Extension to La Guajira desert and Caribbean coast after eg Cartagena, Santa Marta, Tayrona NP (4 days), as group excursion or with private driver-guide in 4x4, Wayuu indigenous culture<br/>- Trekking to the Lost City (Ciudad Perdida) at the Sierra Nevada and/or meeting of Kogui culture in the mountains (5 days)<br/>- Meeting with the Tayrona Kogui - Arhuaco culture before or after a visit to the NP Tayrona (4 days authentic program)<br/>- Wildlife in los Llanos – Casanares province at ecolodge Hato Aurora (filmed by BCC &amp; Animal Planet), with capybaras, 325 bird species, caimans, deers, anacondas of 7m long, jaguars, safaris, piranha fishing, walking and horse riding, traditional life of vagueros - Colombian cowboys &amp; cattle farming<br/>- Visit Cano Cristales, beautiful coloured river famous from photography books, from Yopal-Villaviciencia this can be combined by small plane after a stay at the hacienda Hato Aurora for instance<br/>- Staying at authentic coffee haciendas which are in production<br/>- Special birdwatching tours staying among others in lodges of Pro Aves mixed with other excursions<br/>- Diving holidays and PADI certification via dive school at Cartagena de Indias and/or at Santa Marta<br/>- Luxury Travel at the Caribbean and/or Pacific coast in the best ecolodges available with whale watching and boutique hotels, fincas and spas in the coffee zone and Cartagena, honeymoon at the Caribbean <br/>- Amazon travels: from Bogota to Leticia with Amacayacú National Park, from Villavicencio to Puerto Inírida, the start for the Cerros de Mavicure Amazonas tour, to travel with private guide into the Vaupes region, this is all pristine Amazonian rainforest off the beaten trek with amazing waterfalls and wildlife<br/>- Adventurous and special tailor made travel combining Venezuela’s tepui highlights with traveling upstream into Colombia at Inirida rainforest with private guide<br/>- Private guided roundtravels or Group travels through Colombia with Latin American expert speaking fluent English and Spanish<br/><br/>For the trek to Ciudad Perdida we work with a local partner, it is an all indigenous operated and owned operator, all of their staff is indigenous to the zone and therefore benefit directly from any reservations. During the trek itself, the group is always accompanied by at least one local indigenous guide and a translator and stays in indigenous owned camps. The Wiwa tribe in Colombia’s Sierra Nevada mountains have lived harmoniously with the wildlife surrounding them for thousands of years. Rising approximately 5,000 meters out of Northern Colombia’s Caribbean shores, the misty, cloud-shrouded Sierra Nevada mountains have been the home to several indigenous tribes for more than 2,000 years. As if unaffected by time, the Sierra’s indigenous tribes still live as their Tairona ancestors did centuries ago. Despite growing modernization and tourism in the area, the Wiwa community – the smallest of four tribes living in the Lost City today – show us how they strive to keep their ancient culture alive.<br/><br/>For those who would love to go into the mountains of the Sierra Nevada but wish to avoid a strenuous multiple day trekking, we have also a 4 day very authentic program in another area of the Sierra Nevada where you can visit a village of the Koguis with a 5 hrs walk, eventually with the support of mules for luggage. Rest of transport is with a 4x4 vehicle. The whole program is with a local Kogui guide. It starts in Santa Marta and you will return near NP Tayrona at the beach and is part of a 12 day itinery. You will walk through a subtropical ecosystem and enter the universe of the Koguis. After arriving in the community you will be welcomed and will meet with the local \"Mamo\". The program for the rest of the afternoon and evening is open, depending on the permissions given by the people of the village. You are guests and therefore the activities depend on the community suggestions. The aim is to interact as much as possible with the indigenous people, and your local Kogui guide will play a major role in this. You will have dinner in the village, and sleep in a hammock in a \"Choza\" (Kogui hut). <br/><br/>Featured activities: Meeting the authentic Colombia, being in nature, culture &amp; meeting the people of Colombia. Walking in mountains, visiting coffee haciendas, beachlife, colonial villages &amp; history, cumbia &amp; salsa, spa, horse riding, bird &amp; whale watching, snorkelling, diving, learning Spanish.<br/><br/>Then we make use of homestays at Tierradentro, Amazonas, Vaupes &amp; the Coffee zone but in case you are interested in an authentic experience homestays can be requested for whole Colombia. The families speak only Spanish and by making use of their homestay you directly support them. <br/><br/>In case you wish to travel from Colombia into Venezuela we can take care of the whole transfer in a private taxi with guidance from Cucuta airport crossing the border of Cucuta into Venezuela, heading to Bailadores, Tovar and Merida for your holiday. Venezuela is safer than any other country of South America at this moment and we really can recommend it. We offer adventurous hikes with waterfalls and canyoning, daywalks along high mountain lakes, tours by jeeps, birdwatching, wildlife, staying at an authentic coffee farm in the area of Santa Cruz de Mora, from turning inward at multidimensional gates in the Venezuelan Andes, to beach stays at Choroni and los Roques, have a 4 day program at Angel Falls at NP Canaima.

In the 1980s and '90s, Medelli´n was one of the most dangerous cities in the world, with the notorious drug lord, Pablo Escobar, and his Medelli´n Cartel, operating at their peak. With his death in 1993, the reign of 'El Patro´n' came to an end, but it took until 2002 for the city to start seeing real changes, when the government began to invest heavily in infrastructure and public education. Nowadays, the 'City of Eternal Spring' is one of the most innovative metropolises in the world. Visit the barrio San Javier, which used to be one of the most unsafe suburbs of Medelli´n. Located 7 km from the city centre, it is an excellent example of the social transformation that has taken place over the last few years. Arrive here by the Metrocable that joins the north-east area with the city centre, the installation of which has been life- changing for many of the inhabitants of Medelli´n. Learn more about the city’s transformation after the death of Pablo Escobar and explore Medellin’s newest invention: the outdoor escalators in the Comuna 13 district. Discover stories about the district's past by visiting the most important places marked by historical events and see graffiti that acts as a form of artistic expression for the community. Bask in the beautiful cityscape views from San Javier. Then, continue to La Plazoleta (renamed Plaza Botero) located in the city centre.

For those arriving on time our Leader plans to meet you in the hotel reception at 6pm for the welcome meeting and for those that wish, there is the chance to go out for dinner. There are no activities planned today, so you are free to arrive in Bogota at any time.

From the market, we visit the Gold Museum; while many cities in Latin America have their own 'Museo de Oro', Bogota's is widely regarded as housing the region's finest collection of gold from pre-Hispanic times. The museum's star exhibit is the Muisca Raft - an impressive piece of pre-Colombian artistry that fueled the Spaniard's search for El Dorado. From the museum we'll walk to the colourful colonial streets of La Candelaria for a traditional Colombian lunch at one of the city's many restaurants - it's an opportunity to try the popular dish Ajiaco Santafereno, which is a hearty soup made from chicken, potato and corn. It's found throughout Colombia but is particularly popular in Bogota. After lunch we continue our exploration on foot. Walking under the balconied houses from where local residents often observe the comings and goings below, we'll encounter some excellent examples of colonial architecture, such as the Catedral Primada de Colombia. The visit continues with the Museo Botero, a colonial house filled with works of art by the Colombian artist and sculptor Fernando Botero, famous for his abstract portrayal of people with large, exaggerated proportions.

After our descent in the cable car, we depart the city, driving north to the Salt Cathedral at Zipaquira.

After some time for lunch, we continue our drive to the charming little town of Villa de Leyva. Founded in 1574, this town is one of Colombia's colonial treasures. Nestled in the Andean foothills where time seems to have almost stood still, it was declared a national monument in 1954. It is easy to see why Villa de Leyva's local residents have been keen to preserve the thriving heart of this old town. Cobbled streets thread their way between whitewashed buildings and the colonial architectural style, with wood framed windows and balconies laden with flowers and plants. It is a delight to behold.

        "description": ": Cartagena's beauty is well-documented throughout history. In recent times, the writer Gabriel Garcia Marquez put it at the fore of Colombian culture by using it as the setting for many of his novels, including the famous 'Love in the Time of Cholera'. The massive fortified walls around the old city, dating back several hundred years, helped with the designation of the city as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It's a wonderful place to get 'lost' in, with old plazas and churches galore, as well as plenty of cafes, restaurants, markets and a warm, welcoming atmosphere around every corner. We're free to explore today. For those who wish to go outside the city walls, you may want to take a taxi ride to visit the hilltop convent of Santa Cruz de la Popa, with its spectacular panoramic views of the city, or the 16th-century fortress of San Felipe. For bird lovers, there is also the option to visit the National Aviary of Colombia, an enormous natural complex located a one-hour drive outside of the city. In the early evening, we'll take a short drive out to nearby La Boquilla. Now an offshoot of Cartagena itself, this one-time fishing village still has a hint of its past and the residents balance their fishing heritage with tourism. There are fantastic sunsets from here, and we'll have our final drinks and dinner at the beach, before returning to our hotel for the evening."

After wandering around the city's historic centre, explore the central Plaza de Bolivar, ringed with four of Bogotá's architectural highlights: the city hall, the houses of congress, the supreme court, and the venerable Catedral Primada. The charming sight gives you a taste of the pre-Columbian era. Lastly you will get to explore the Museo Botero, which houses one of Latin America's most important international art collections. Among the impressive artwork, you can discover the paintings and sculptures of Colombia's most renowned artists Francisco Botero.

Walk the rim of the turquoise Quilotoa caldera, trace petrified lava trails to the Pita Waterfall, and breathe in the crisp Cotopaxi air.<br/><br/>Then swap altitude for islands, boarding a yacht to cruise the otherworldly  Galápagos. Wildlife here is endemic and often either curious about, or oblivious to, visitors. Step around giant iguanas lying across your path, walk among waist-height tortoises, observe sea lions sunning themselves on volcanic beaches. Cross lava fields, snorkel with turtles, see flamingo-filled lagoons and hike around crater-edges. Your floating home is small, stylish and sustainably run.<br/><br/>Next: Colombia for an urban change of scene. Touch down in Medellín and uncover a city transformed – graffiti-splashed Comuna 13, breakdancing kids and sun-dappled sculpture parks. Then it’s off to the coffee country for charming, colourful country towns and a hit of slow travel: drifting downstream on a bamboo raft, hiking beneath the world’s tallest palms, and sipping rich, freshly ground coffee in Filandia’s cafés.<br/><br/>Step into the jungle in La Macarena National Park. Hike to wild waterfalls in the Sierra de la Macarena, and bathe in the rainbow river of Caño Cristales where water is red and the pools glow pink. Then finish in style in Cartagena – all cobbled streets, bougainvillea-strewn balconies and sultry nights. Take a salsa class. Explore the fortress. Sail to secret snorkelling spots in the Rosario Islands.<br/><br/>This is Latin America at its most generous – wild and wondrous. You’ll walk, raft, hike and swim your way through it, with private guides, charming local stays and stories to tell for years to come.<br/><br/>Our sabbaticals and experiential holidays are entirely customisable to you - use this itinerary as an inspirational springboard and get in touch to make this trip your own.

If you miss the meeting, our tour leader will inform you of any essential information as soon as you catch up. If your flight arrives earlier in the day, head out to explore the colourful streets of La Candelaria, where you'll find museums, bars and restaurants dotted between colonial convents and churches. It's a great spot to orientate yourself and get a snapshot of local life. Our time in Bogota is limited, so if you would like to spend some more time exploring Colombia's capital we'd recommend arriving 1-2 nights before the tour starts and booking pre-tour accommodation."

Pereira is the capital of the Risaralda department, a key centre within the renowned coffee cultural landscape of Colombia and a UNESCO World Heritage site. Pereira sits in the foothills of the Andes mountain range and with its latitude, approximately 4 degrees north of the equator, combined with an altitude of around 1,411m/4,629ft and a gentle subtropical highland climate, it has the ideal conditions for cultivating the high-quality Arabica coffee bean. Colombia is in the world's top three coffee producers and is celebrated for producing some of the finest brews, including the exceptional coffees originating from this region. After checking into our hotel, we'll head out this afternoon for a coffee tour at the Finca Del Cafe. We'll spend the afternoon learning about the whole process from the planting of the beans all the way through the picking and roasting process. We'll try out 'cupping', a technique used to distinguish aroma, body and acidity, before finishing off with trying two different specialist coffees. Our hotel for the next two nights sits in the heart of coffee country, in an enviable location that affords wide sweeping views out the lush rolling hills and mountains beyond.

The tour aims to give the historical perspective behind Pablo Escobar's residency in Medellin, including what it was like when he was alive, and the changes that have made it the modern and diverse city it is today. We'll visit his old home, and the Casa de la Memoria Museum, an initiative started by the victims of the drug traffic trade that contributed to overcoming the conflict in Medellin. We will also visit the Parque Memorial la Inflexion, built where the Monaco building, Escobar's property, was located until its demolition in 2019. There were as many as 46,000 victims of narcotraffico in Colombia, and this park was built in their memory. This tour isn't designed to glorify Escobar's lasting imprint on the city, but to memorialise the people affected by the drug trade and to celebrate the modern face of Medellín. We'll also visit the outlying suburb of the once-notorious Comuna 13. This barrio, clinging to Medellín's western slopes, perfectly personifies Medellín's turn-around, once among the most feared neighbourhoods, it is now a vibrant and colourful community that is brimming with life.

While still hardly a mainstream travel destination, this off the beaten track holiday to Colombia takes you to many of the country’s even less visited regions as well as the classic draws of colonial Cartagena and Tayrona National Park. <br/><br/>Travelling as part of a small group enables you to stray from the traditional tourist trail with private transport, internal flights and a tour leader to take care of the language barrier and recommend places to eat and optional excursions. Free time is built in for you to relax, wander or take additional guided tours. Visit remote village, including Aractataca – the birthplace of Gabriel García Márquez, whose family home is now a museum. Travel on to the sleepy village of Mompós, which will make you feel like you’ve stepped into one of his surreal novels. Explore the stunning Cordillera Central, visit coffee farms and see archaeological remains from an ancient civilisation about which much remains unknown.<br/><br/>Head back into more familiar territory in Santa Marta and the stunning Tayrona National Park, where thick jungle meets Caribbean coast. This Colombia holiday ends in the unbelievably romantic city of Cartagena, the setting for another of García Márquez’s novels, and whose cobbled streets an horse drawn carts make you feel like you have stepped back in time a century or more. If this laidback city is still not quite tranquil enough, take a daytrip out to the castaway-style Islas del Rosario, just a short boat ride away.",

Treasure plundered from native inhabitants was stored here until the galleons could ship it back to Spain, and it therefore became a tempting target for pirates. In order to protect their booty, the Spanish constructed an elaborate system of ramparts, which still encircle the town. Today, while Cartagena has expanded dramatically, the walled centre has changed very little, allowing a glimpse of 16th and 17th-century Spanish architecture and town planning. Enjoy the shade provided by the buildings in these labyrinthine, cobbled streets, and explore the monasteries, palaces, churches, plazas and imposing mansions where the overhanging balconies are heavy with flowers. Beyond this, the city opens up: an eclectic and seductive mix of Caribbean and African influences produces a vibrant street life, with fruit stalls lining the roads and pulsating rhythms emerging from cars and houses. A guided tour will help you soak up the atmosphere of this unique city."

The town stands at the highest coastal mountain range near Tayrona National Park. Colorful fishing boats weigh anchor near the gold sand beach reaching into the receding emerald hills. The Archeological Museum of Tayrona features a rich collection of gold, pottery, and a model of the La Ciudad Perdida, a hidden gem covered in jungle brush reached only a multi-day trek. Sunlight drenches the mixture of shore and mountains as the scent of palm and fern trees blends with the briny coastal aroma. The trees sweep upwards to an altitude of nearly 3,000 feet above sea level. You can make your way along a trail to the fresh water cascade of Arimaka, a tiered waterfall that falls into a rippling pool of clear water."

The city was founded in the 16th century by Spanish conquistadors and today the Bogotanos consider their city as a beacon of culture that is spreading across the valley into Andes Mountains’ foothills. History winds around the cobblestone streets of La Candelaria, the antique downtown, in which colonial buildings pepper the walkways of elaborate museums that depict the wealth of the city and Colombia’s past. Churches and convents with three centuries of history rise above contemporary restaurants and cafes fill the streets with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Street vendors prepare fresh arepas, a traditional flatbread often made with maize and cooked on a griddle, on the narrow lanes leading away from Plaza de Bolivar. Your private transfer will meet you at El Dorado Airport, and then make your way north towards your luxurious hotel near the San Carlos Palace. You will be able to see the stunning emerald forest draping over the ascending slopes of Cerro de Monserrate, the proud symbol of the city that stands at nearly 10,340 feet above sea level. Your hotel emanates the glamour of the former colonial era mixed with contemporary luxury as the historical building glows with gilded edges and a spacious common area with a view of the El Mirador and La Scala bell towers."

At breakfast, you will find exotic fruits endemic to Colombia filling the dining room, with the bright yellow and orange rind of mangoes beside the most popular fruit in Colombia, maracuya , which is passion fruit. Your guide will meet you in your hotel lobby after your meal and lead you along the streets of the oldest part of the city. Murals decorate the stone and stucco walls beneath the overhanging rooftops. Thick stone steps lead to elevated doorways that frame the antique colonial homes as Plaza Bolivar remains the heart of the historical district and wraps around a 19th-century statue that depicts Simon Bolivar, after whom the square is named. The Cathedral borders the eastern edge of the plaza with a neoclassical façade that rises out of the 16th-century foundations. The sounds of the city encircle you, with vendors along Paloquemao Market selling meat, fish, dairy, and bright flowers. Cars amble through the business district, and you can see the funicular traversing the hillside to reach the summit of Cerro de Monserrate. The Botero Museum is located inside the Bando de la Republica’s museum complex, with galleries filling two floors. The open-air halls overlook a lush courtyard where a fountain trickles in the courtyard bringing a tranquil soundtrack to your time spent browsing the distinctive figures of Botero’s artwork.

At breakfast, you will discover more exotic fruits decorating your dining room tables, and this time you may bite into a gulupa , a cousin to the passion fruit with dark purple skin with a sweet and tart taste. The Iglesia de la Veracruz shimmers white against the powder blue sky in the distance, and locals refer to the church as the Pantheon of Colombia for the amount of revolutionaries that have made strides towards Colombian independence that are entombed inside the walls of the humble church. After breakfast, your private transfer will meet you at your hotel and escort you to the El Dorado airport for your easy flight to Armenia, the capital of the Quindío region. Your flight will descend onto the runway with the greenery of the valley glowing as if paved with precious stones. Palm trees rise surreptitiously around the airport, and your private transfer will meet you at El Eden Airport and escort you to the comforts of your accommodation in view of the Central Andes Range. Banana and coffee plantations overtake the countryside with fruit trees and bamboo growing wild around the hotel grounds. The pool reflects the greenery of the lush landscape with terraces that offer sweeping views of the undulating mountains and sweet scents of the orchards. Brahman white cattle graze on the mountain pastures and a gurgling fountain decorates the interior courtyard. You will take your time on the hotel grounds to watch the hummingbirds feed off of the nectar from the flowers that dangle around the hotel rooftop. With wings that flutter at a speed of up to 70 times per second, the hummingbirds have iridescent plumage that ranges from sapphire to crimson and bringing color to the skies."

At breakfast, the small purple berries known as mora decorate your plate. The tart flavor blends perfectly with the orange and cherry tomato sized fruit known as uchuva , that offers a blend of sour and sweet. Hummingbirds continue to flutter their wings around the flowers growing in the yard, and your guide will meet you in the lobby and lead you along the valley roads which are rich with the herbaceous aroma of the verdant, tropical plant life to the town of Filandia. Filandia is a traditional coffee town that was founded in the 19th-century. With an elevation of more than 6,300 feet above sea level, the viewing tower offers views to the meandering waters of the Cauca River and to the snow-capped peaks of volcanoes in Los Nevados National Park. The main square focuses on the colors of the central church, with lanes that crisscross beneath the bell tower and lead to welcoming cafes and delicious local restaurants. The decadent scent of coffee emanates from the cafes to create a cocktail of aromas, blending the roasted grain with exotic fruits and sweet, herbaceous flowers. Houses form continuous lines of pastel colors that border the streets. Continue into the Cocora Valley in search of Colombia’s national tree, the wax palm. The tree can grow up to 200 feet tall and grows bright red fruit in the canopy.

The pink flesh of the guava accompanies the traditional meal of fried eggs, black beans, and fried plantains. Your guide will lead you from the hotel to a hacienda that specializes in the cultivation of coffee beans. The crop thrives at an altitude between 4,900 and 5,900 feet above sea level, and the rainforest climate adds to the fertility of the soil and the character of the coffee. Your guide will lead you through the fields for a look at the plants growing in the plateau and into the hillsides. The plantation home glows white against the surrounding verdant trees, and the leaves of the plant feel waxy from the chlorophyll. The shrub produces red seeds similar to pomegranate seeds. Workers help blanch the coffee beans by washing and peeling the outer layer until the bean is revealed before letting the crop dry. The grain has a sweet, flowery aroma before it dries. However, after the drying cycle, you will find delicate hints of fruit fading behind notes of caramel and soft chocolates. In the tasting room, you will go beyond a simple sample for your palette with your guide taking a variety of beans from around the grounds, each aged and prepared differently. You will savor every single tasting as you inhale the amazing aromas deeply as they rise from your cup."

The early 20th-century Swiss clock adorns the 17th-century wall crafted from strong stone, and the tower itself glows with bright yellow paint against the aged façade of the supporting wall. The former customs house in Plaza San Pedro de Claver now houses the Cartagena Museum of Modern Art, in which Colombian artists blend images of a colonial past with contemporary techniques to offer insight into the ways the past has shaped the present. Enrique Grau painted Panoramica de Cartagena in the 1990s, which depicts an image of the city in three parts, each containing a realistic version of the architecture with a rich and eccentric portrait of the sky. The scent of fresh squeezed lemons emanates from carts that offer juice on the shaded cobblestones of Plaza Bolivar. History breathes deep inside the old walls with dynamic life renewed daily."

        "description": "Nestled in the Andes Mountains at an altitude of nearly 8,650 feet above sea level, Bogota embodies the rising spirit of Colombia. High-rise buildings soar in the sky beside elegant colonial churches, graceful university campuses, and opulent theaters. Futuristic architecture contrasts with the preserved wealth of history that decorates the streets with street stalls that emanate the aromas of fresh savory arepas and sweet pineapple. Your flight will arrive at El Dorado International Airport where you will meet your private transfer at baggage claim. The city is a riot of color that erupts around you as you venture north. Your luxurious hotel offers a view of the lavish skyline and the emerald trees that overtake Monserrate, the church-topped mountain at the edge of the city that rises 10,341 feet above sea level to the east. From the summit, you can see the entirety of the capital that spreads across more than 650 square miles. Patches of robust clouds drift across the sky and open to a view of Nevado del Tolima’s coned peak, a volcanic crater nearly 80 miles west of the city."

Richly roasted coffee, with beans harvested in the Colombian hills, drips into plastic cups served by street vendors and enjoyed by business people on their way to the office. After breakfast, your guide will meet you in your hotel lobby ready to take you through the charms of the bustling capital city, beginning with Paloquemao Market. Fruit vendors fill their stalls with ripe bananas and purple potatoes as the scent of plantains and bell peppers fill the air. Aromatic herbs, such as mint and cilantro son overtake the fruity aromas as the day unfolds. An abundance of colors fills the stalls and truck beds with florists that carry orchids, roses, and birds of paradise. A section of the market has long tables connected to eateries, with locals blending exotic fruits, such as passion fruit, with milk and ice. You can sample a fresh orange juice for a sweet and tangy vibrancy you have never experienced before. Venture next to the Gold Museum for an intimate view of the wealthy artifacts on display that exhibit upwards of 55,000 of pieces of jewelry, animal carvings, and figurines crafted by the indigenous population before Spanish colonization. The vibrant history and traditions that have been carried over from the indigenous population in the marketplace expand into an image of heritage and religion, set inside the colonial palace. On the third-floor, you will discover the “Offering Room,” which shows how the indigenous population used gold in their rituals, including throwing figures that depict warriors into the Laguna de Guatavita. The light glints off of the rich and intricate gold carving known as the “Muisca Raft,” representing the inauguration of the chief."

The Palace of Justice borders the plaza’s northern edge, with the early 19th-century neoclassical façade of the Cathedral of Bogota decorating the eastern border. The dominating figure first hosted mass in the 16th century and was rebuilt after an 18th-century earthquake. The largest chapel inside the structure contains the tomb of Bogota’s founder, Jimenez de Quesada. After breakfast, your private transfer will escort you to the airport for your short flight to Pereira to see it all, and the fast-paced city welcomes visitors from around the world with warm smiles and a pulsing nightlife filled with an abundance of dancing. Your guide will meet you at Metacana International Airport and lead you to a private horse farm celebrated for the unparalleled grace with which the horses parade across the plain. Paso Fino horses grow up to 15 hands tall, which accounts for five feet. They graze on the lush grass that stretches across the farm. The aroma of cedar drifts from the wooden gates with sporadic trees that rise along the hillside until reaching the bordering forest. The chocolate coat of the horse shines in the sunlight, and your guide will lead you around the farm to watch the horses trot elegantly around the stables. You will immediately notice their distinctive gait, a four-beat, quick stride with a head held high."

At breakfast, the scent of freshly cooked arepas , a flat, round patty of maize or flour, fills the air. You will sip a decadent hot chocolate made fresh with melting chocolate and milk before setting out on your daily adventure with your guide. The green mountains sparkle with an enrapturing emerald canopy around the town of Salento. Coffee plantations spread to the banks of the Quindío River, in which a freshwater trout thrives. Thin palm trees tower over the endlessly green landscape as cows graze on the fresh grass. Charming streets typical of the countryside lead to colorful colonial homes decorated with brightly painted facades and small balconies adorn the wide stone walkways, and structures known as bahareque, made with reed frames. The town was founded in the mid 19th century and remains one of the oldest towns in the Quindío region. Stalls offer handmade artisan crafts and line the main boulevard of Calle Real. Stairs lead from the end of the street to the summit of Alto de la Cruz, upon which a large cross stands to bless the people of Salento. Snow-capped volcanoes decorate the horizon beyond the mountains that border the Cocora Valley. Step aboard a four-wheel drive jeep to traverse the trails of Cocora National Park. The river rushes over large rocks and lush banks, with rickety bridges crossing the waterways to make you feel like an adventurous archeologist. The scent of waxy leaves emanates from the trees, decorated with the bright colors of hummingbirds. Wax palm grows wild in the unique mixture of tropical and alpine climate and grow up to 200 feet tall with dark green and grayish leaves. Orange-red globose fruits dangle from the canopy as the tree is unique in its size, but also important as it represents Colombia as the nation’s protected tree."

The mountains encircling the valley provide a stunning image of the landscape in the morning as immaculate clouds pass over the peak before dissipating. Your guide will meet you at your hotel after breakfast for an overview of the history of coffee production in the region, beginning with the grain’s colonial introduction to its continued cultivation and thriving around the Cocora Valley. The plantation overtakes the hillside with the local farmers selecting the best beans to grow and harvest based on tradition. After visiting the terraces on which the plants grow, you will turn to the cultivation of the crop. A large, antique hand-cranked mill helps peel the coffee beans during a process known as “washing.” The skinned plant resembles a cherry tomato before the beans dry in a tented, segmented area. The aroma of roasted coffee beans overtakes the exotic scent of the surrounding trees as your guide spills the beans into a frying pan to show how a person could easily roast a small amount themselves at home. At the end of the tour, your guide will add water to the handpicked beans to produce a delicate, yet bold, cup of coffee with natural hints of chocolate and nutmeg."

You may want to add a dash of milk and sugar to balance the bitter and sweet flavors before nibbling on juicy slices of fresh mango. Your private transfer will meet you at your hotel before escorting you to the airport for your flight to Medellin, located in a narrow valley nestled between the towering mountains. The city continues to reveal its true self as it emerges from the shadow of its tumultuous past marred by the image of Carlos Escobar. The moderate climate provides a relaxed ambiance with the colonial structure blending behind the swath of street vendors and food carts. A distinctive collection of bronze statues depicts pudgy dogs, people, and horses that decorate the main square of Plaza Botero, named after the famous Colombian artist. The black and white Gothic structure of the Palacio de la Cultura Rafael Uribe Uribe fills the square and frames the statue. To begin your exploration, you will land at Jose Maria Cordova International Airport to meet your private transfer. After checking into your opulent, contemporary hotel in the heart of the city’s lively streets, your guide will lead you on a tour of Comuna 13. The neighborhood was formerly the most dangerous barrio in the city but has engaged in innovative regeneration projects that have revitalized the community through various types of art and neighborhood involvement. Your guide will lead you up the electric escalators that ascend the hills to a height of nearly 1,260 feet. Sanctioned graffiti adorns the walls as the bright colors of the murals imitate the tropical hues also visible in the natural landscape. The view from the top of the hillside offers a panorama of Medellin’s rooftops that sprawl across the valley and the surrounding foothills."

After your meal, your guide will lead you out into the city once more, this time to highlight Medellin’s commitment to innovation by taking the metro-cable, which opened in 2004. The gondola carries upwards of 30,000 people daily across the city, even taking people outside the city to Parque Arvi. Look down on the passing city below to the brick homes that climb the hills, as well as to the sporadic high-rises found at the center of the city. Men sit outside of the colorful cafes and sip coffee or beer. Kids ride their bikes on the cobblestone streets of the barrios along the hillsides. Street art decorates the walls and rooftops where locals barbecue or fly kites. Lush greenery frames the cityscape as a reminder of the closeness between the vibrant streets and equally exciting countryside. On the outskirts of the city, you will discover a flower plantation, one of many that overtake upwards of 17,500 acres around Colombia. The town of Santa Elena stands at 6,560 feet above sea level and contains nutrient rich soil on which farmers grow an abundance of flowers for local and international markets. The fields glow with reds, whites, yellows, and blues from carnations, roses, and mums. You can wander the rows between the flowers with the mountain air brimming with the natural sweetness that emanates from the pollen. Continue into Parque Arvi, a nature reserve stretched between Santa Elena and Medellin, which features a number of important archeological sites connected to the indigenous communities and the heritage of the region."

Three interconnecting structures offer different programs, from books to training rooms, and an auditorium all connected by footpaths. After breakfast, you will take a private transfer to the airport for your flight to Cartagena. The Caribbean city on the eastern shores of Colombia has a fairytale elegance that emanates from the eight miles of centuries-old colonial walls erected in stone and surrounding the historical center. A labyrinth of cobbled alleys winds beneath the balconies that are decorated with bougainvillea. Church spires cast refreshing shadows over public plazas that maintain a European quality. Trendy cafes overtake the beach side of Bocagrande Peninsula, with luxury condos that overlook the water. Your private transfer will meet you at Rafael Nunez International Airport before escorting you to a luxurious hotel that effortlessly blends vintage style with contemporary amenities located inside a renovated 17th-century colonial structure. The bright yellow façade of the Cathedral was erected between the late 16th and early 17th centuries. The marble look of the interior is actually painted stucco, and the limestone exterior has protected the three naves and curved archways of the interior. Gold leaf adorns the retable set beside the stone columns and beneath the towering archways."

The stone glints as if molded in gold as a network of tunnels meanders around the fortress. Once needed to defend the city, the cacophonous halls echo with every sound an enemy might make. You will venture out on a guided tour of the city, traversing the tunnels of the Castillo and reaching Convento de la Popa, located on the tallest hill in Cartagena at nearly 500 feet tall. Elegant flowers fill the patio beneath the image of the city’s patron, La Virgen de la Candelaria. You will have a spectacular view of the city and its maze-like streets that reach towards the crystalline water. Step beneath the archways and into the former dungeons of Las Bovedas, set within the nearly 50-foot thick city walls. The vaulted ceilings once stood over munitions storerooms, which were later converted into a jail. Contemporary craft shops now fill the 23 cells and iron doors hang open to display handcrafted goods, such as colorful hammocks, sewn bags, and wooden puppets.

Four independent stands rise in front of a gray wall, and each stand holds a relevant artifact connoting a deity produce between 500 and 2,000 years ago.

Your guide will lead you through the fields of the plantation for an introduction to the coffee before it becomes a “bean.” The aroma of jasmine drifts upwards from the plants, as the coffee bush is a cousin of the jasmine flower. You will notice bright red cherries dangling from the branches, which are actually the ripening coffee bean. The chief roaster at the historic plantation will pick some cherries for you to taste, which contain notes of citrus and roasted fruit. The plantation takes pride in their cultivation process, as they pick the ripe cherries directly from the plants before processing. At the processing warehouse, you can dig your fingers into the fine, dry grains after they are roasted. The aroma of light char fills the air overtaking the subtle scent of jasmine. The warehouse de-pulps the cherries, then washes and dries the beans using traditional methods as well as methods designed specific to the property. Your guide will teach you how to taste the coffee like a professional coffee cupper, similar to a sommelier. You will slurp from a spoon and let the coffee coat your palate to find a combination of sweetness and acidity with notes of sugar cane and cinnamon.

You will see how the skin is then removed before the fermenting process that breaks down the pulp. Then, the remaining beans are washed and dried in the sun. Roldan’s proprietary methods have changed the trajectory of Colombian coffee as they have turned the familiar drink into a cherished occurrence for aficionados and routine coffee-drinkers alike by producing some of the highest quality coffee in Colombia.

As you make your way along the knolls, you will notice the flame-rumped tanager perched on a branch. The female has yellow hind-feathers near the tail accentuated by the black feathers around their underparts. Your driver will shift into 4-wheel-drive and take the path leading into the steep mountain slope at a 45-degree angle. The trees fill the air with elaborate subtropical aromas drifting from the starfruit, guanábana, and cardamom plants, which all affect the flavors of the coffee grown in the region. A magnificent view of Antioquia will greet you upon arrival at the plantation. Your guide will lead you into the zigzagging rows of coffee plants, which helps each plant soak up the nutrients in an area instead of fighting one another for the same space. The farmers produce organic charcoal and utilize the coffee shells from previous crops to fertilize the trees. The coffee is harvested by hand to produce up to 2 million bags of coffee annually. After walking through the mixture of farm and forest, you will return to the house and enjoy the sweet flavor of a cool and refreshing starfruit juice made from the produce growing on the property."

        "title": "Medellin – Trek the Stunning Biodiversity before Transferring to Medellin",
        "description": "The sharp call of an active rose-breasted Grosbeak echoes through the forest in the morning. At breakfast, you will indulge in a revitalizing cup of coffee cultivated from the landscape around Cocondo as you will find hints of cherry, apricot, and chocolate. You will set out into the wilderness after the meal as you admire the thriving forest, which contains hidden trails and protected underbrush leading away from the fruit trees and coffee plants of the farm. You will pass a collection of nests known as mochilero. Oropendolas weave the baskets dangling from the edges of the tree branches. The birds have gorgeous yellow tail-feathers and pointed orange pills against black or brown plumage. As you continue walking you will hear the trickling of water and the rush of a rive winding through hills. You will also notice ripe avocados and mangos dangling from the trees. Your guide will cut away the fruit and open it for you to sample near the river’s banks. After you return to the farmhouse, take the time to experience the unique treat of using coffee grinds and coconut oil as a natural exfoliant. A small waterfall with cool mountain water cascades near the house, where you will wash away the coffee mixture in the vibrant spring water."

        "description": "The following morning, the mist in the valley dissolves as the sunlight spreads across the hills surrounding Medellin.

The different sculptures are iconic of the artist’s particular style. More of the artist’s famous work decorate the Museum of Antioquia, the second oldest museum in Colombia, which hosts Botero’s famous painting La Muerte de Pablo Escobar.
