  "generalInfo": "Ghana, Togo and Benin are home to an amazing diversity of traditional cultures, from the once mighty kingdom of the Ashanti to smaller groups living in isolation in the bush. This tour combines all three, starting in Lome, one of West Africa’s liveliest cities. Explore its markets and witness a traditional voodoo ceremony deep within the swamps. We visit stilt villages and ancient kingdoms, as well as the fiercely traditional Tamberma people, with extraordinary fortress style houses designed to protect them from invaders. In Ghana we look for sacred monkeys in the forest and visit a population of 'witches', as well as visiting the fishing village of Elmina, home to an imposing slave castle dating back more than five hundred years. Depending on the departure date, you may also have the opportunity to witness the Akwasidae festival of the Ashanti, a glittering showcase of traditional culture honouring the Ashanti king. We don’t just visit these countries – we feel them, and in doing so it’s hard not to fall under their spell.",
