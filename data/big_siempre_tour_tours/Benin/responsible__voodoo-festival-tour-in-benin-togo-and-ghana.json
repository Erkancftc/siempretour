      "description": "COTONOU| PORT NOVO | COTONOU – Friday, January 9, 2026 | Following breakfast, we travel the short distance to Porto Novo, the official capital of Benin and the second-largest city of approximately 250,000 people – a nice change of pace from the bustling Cotonou. Porto Novo, named by the Portuguese in the 1500s, is still today showing significant Portuguese influence. For its size, Porto Novo has an interesting culture and tourist attractions. Visit the market and the old colonial town with its ancient mosque. The Great Mosque of Porto Novo is a unique and perhaps most colorful building in West Africa — the 19th-century Brazilian-style church now converted into a mosque. We also visited Palais Royal du Roi Toffa. This former residence of King Toffa is now officially called Musée Home. This well-maintained, rather simple, palace is a nice look into how African royalty really lived. 1883 was the year King Toffa signed the treaty with the French, agreeing to hand over land. The kingdom of Porto Novo was one of the longest lasting in Africa, lasting until 1976. After lunch (on your own account), we return to Cotonou and enjoy a city tour of Cotonou before our return to the hotel. We will visit the following sites. The ‘Esplanade des Amazones’, a public square located which is home to the ‘Amazon’, a 30metre high statue built in homage to the world’s only all-female army. These Amazons belonged to the Kingdom of Dahomey, a West African empire that existed from 1625 to 1894. Remembrance Square which reveals the splendour and fascinating historic works of the city. Here you will find the Mathieu Garden, the former home of the late President of the Republic, Mathieu Kerekou now, transformed into a flowery area with a pleasant scent for visitors. We will also visit the statue of the Wassangari warrior Bio Guéra on his horse while running. It glimpses the ardour and bravery with which the warriors fought to stop the colonial invasion. In addition, the Martyrs’ Square was refurbished to pay tribute to the soldiers and civilians who fell with their weapons in hand during the military aggression of 16 January 1977. Following lunch (on your own account) at a local restaurant, we returne to the hotel. Enjoy the rest of the day at leisure. Meal(s) Included : Breakfast, Dinner Hotel : Golden Tulip Diplomate"

Around the edges of the main performance area groups from various voodoo, temples perform their own rites and rituals. We will also have an unforgettable visit that takes you to the Voodoo Museum, the Sacred Forest (Kpasse Forest), the Cathedral and the Temple of the Pythons. Continue to the place of common grave, the tree of forgetfulness and the “Gate of No Return”. There may be a welcome reception from Dagbo Hounon, high priest of the voodoo cult.

      "description": "COTONOU | GANVIE | ABOMEY|COTONOU – Sunday, January 11, 2026 | One of the highlights of any trip to West Africa is Ganvie, the African Venice. In ancient times people took refuge on Lake Nokoue from the attacks of the feared Dahomey warriors who were forbidden by a deep belief to fight on water.
