      "title": "Join the trip in Krakow, Poland",
      "description": ": Our tour starts today in Krakow, Poland's capital until 1956. Thanks to its medieval core and old Jewish quarter, the city has gained a spot on the UNESCO World Heritage list, we have two nights here to uncover its rich history. Krakow's historic architecture survived World War II unscathed, unlike most other Polish cities, and its culture has been preserved to the present day. It was the residence of Polish kings and has nearly one hundred churches, as well as the country's oldest university. Among its most important architectural treasures are Saint Mary's Church, which contains the world-famous altarpiece carved by Veit Stoss, the medieval buildings of the Jagiellonian University and Wawel Castle and Cathedral. For those arriving on time, our tour leader plans to meet you in the hotel reception at 6pm for a welcome meeting and for those that wish, there is the chance to go out for dinner. There are no other activities planned today, so you're free to arrive in Krakow at any time. If you'd like an airport transfer today, you'll need to arrive into John Paul II Krakow-Balice International Airport (KRK), which is around a 30-minute drive from our hotel. If you miss the welcome meeting, our tour leader will inform you of any essential information as soon as you catch up. In the city centre of Krakow, you can find numerous Polish restaurants - 'pierogi' (Polish dumplings) are a must-try. There are also plenty of bars selling local beers and of course a wide range of vodkas, too. If you're looking for local hot spots, try Chmiel, which is a basement bar beneath the forecourt of Wawel Castle, C.K. Browar, which is a popular micro-brewery or Starka Restaurant and Vodkas where you can try out an array of homemade flavoured vodkas. There is a lot to see and do in Krakow; if you can spare the time, we suggest arriving a day early to make the most of this fascinating city (especially if you plan to take the optional excursion to Auschwitz or Wieliczka Salt Mine tomorrow). Alternatively, you could consider combining this holiday with our Budapest to Prague Adventure (trip code: CZ) to make a two-week adventure through Eastern Europe."

      "title": "Walk in the Old Quarter; option to visit Wieliczka Salt Mine",
      "description": ": This morning our tour leader will take us on a short orientation walk around the city's stunning Old Quarter to help us get our bearings. The rest of today is then free for you to explore Krakow and its surroundings. The Jewish Kazimierz district, the setting for the film Schindler's List, has many points of interest, including the Old Synagogue and the Museum of Jewish Life. Further afield, you might like to make an excursion to Oswiecim, the site of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Concentration Camp, which is a haunting reminder of the terrible atrocities that took place here during World War II. Alternatively, it's possible to visit the Royal Castle, perched high on Wawel Hill, which overlooks both the Old Quarter and the Vistula River. Constructed in Renaissance style, the castle houses exquisite treasures collected through the ages by Polish monarchs. Next to the castle is Wawel Cathedral, which is the final resting place of the Polish Kings. Another option is to visit the fascinating Wieliczka Salt Mines, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The mines go as deep as 300 metres underground and inside them you'll see a 400-year-old chapel, a subterranean salt lake and chambers large enough to hold the Eiffel Tower! The Chapel of Saint Kinga is the mine's most spectacular feature. Please note, there are 350 steps down into the mine at the beginning of the tour and then a further 450 on the route. The temperature underground can be much cooler than on the surface, so be sure to bring a jumper. Unfortunately, there's only time today to visit either Auschwitz or the Wieliczka salt mine. If you'd like to see both, you can always extend your stay in Krakow pre-tour. Please see the Optional Activities section of our trip notes about pre-booking the optional excursion to Auschwitz prior to travel. This excursion books up quickly so it is important to book this at least one week in advance of your arrival."

      "title": "Rafting in Dunajec Gorge; arrive in the Tatra Mountains, Slovakia",
      "description": ": This morning, we'll leave Krakow behind us and head out for an inflatable rafting trip on the Dunajec River, heading to a point close to the Polish border near Lesnica. It's a chance to get active and likely get wet, as well as enjoying the picturesque surroundings. Remember to bring a change of clothes and shoes that you don't mind getting wet and a towel with you today. The river has been a famous attraction since the middle of the 19th century when tourists came here to cruise on log-built rafts. We'll meander along the bottom of the spectacular canyon that bears the river's name, passing a landscape of towering limestone cliffs, blanketed in lush forests of fir, beech, larch and spruce. The gorge in Pieniny National Park is particularly noteworthy for its diverse collection of wildlife including lynx, wolf and stag that can often be spotted on its slopes. Birdlife includes some 14 species of bats as well as eagles, pygmy owls, three-toed woodpeckers and rare black storks that can be spotted along the river's edge. Later in the day, we'll visit Spis Castle. Sat on a hilltop above the town of Spisske, it was once home to the Hungarian kings and is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The ruins show both Romanesque and Gothic architecture. Finally, we'll continue by bus to Tatranska Lomnica in the High Tatra Mountains, one of the most scenic regions of Slovakia. Snow-capped for most of the year, the compact High Tatra range is sliced by beautiful valleys and lakes. An ideal region for winter sports, in summer the network of well-marked trails is a hiker's delight."

      "title": "Hiking in the Tatra Mountains",
      "description": ": Today we'll take a public bus to Biela Voda and from there, we'll start our full-day trek in the beautiful Tatra Mountains. We begin with an uphill walk to the picturesque Green Lake. We'll take in the views and have the option to have a picnic lunch here. For those who wish to walk further, there is the possibility to continue to the Great White Lake before returning to Biela Voda on foot. After our walk, we'll return to Tatranska Lomnica by public bus for the evening. Our trek is graded as moderate. The first section is 5 kilometres/3.1 miles long and goes from 915 metres/3,000 feet to an altitude of 1,550 metres/5,085 feet. It should take approximately two-and-a-half hours. If you continue to the Great White Lake, it's a further 2 kilometres/1.2 miles and goes to an altitude of 1,615 metres/5,298 feet and should take an extra 35 minutes. We'll need to walk the same distance back to our starting point, so we will cover around 10-14 kilometres/6.2-8.6 miles and walk for between five and six hours in total. Please make sure you bring comfortable walking shoes or boots. You may also find walking poles useful. Alternatively, if you'd prefer a shorter walk then you can take a local train to Lake Strbske and enjoy a gentle walk around the lakeshore. This large glacial lake offers great views over the surrounding valleys and lakes. An ideal region for winter sports, in summer the network of well-marked trails is a hiker's delight."

      "title": "Bus to Banska Bystrica with an orientation walk on arrival",
      "description": ": This morning, we'll travel by private bus to Banska Bystrica. Along the way, we'll make a stop at Vlkolinec, a UNESCO-listed village that's home to 50 timber-built houses that are a well-preserved example of folk architecture in the region. Upon arrival in Banska Bystrica, our tour leader will take us on an orientation walk of the city. The pretty town is set on the Hron River and is surrounded by mountains. The main square is a hive of activity in summer and the city castle, which is one of the main attractions, is located on the edge of the square. Back in 1944, it was in Banska Bystrica that the Slovak national uprising began against the invading German forces and their own collaborationist government. Although most were defeated a few members managed to hold on until 1945 when the Soviet, Czechoslovakian and Romanian armies arrived and liberated the country from Nazi rule. While we're here, you might like to try the traditional and delicious folded potato pancakes followed by 'Tatratea' liqueur, a tea-based strong herbal drink that originated in the High Tatra Mountains as a way of keeping warm on cold winter evenings."

      "title": "Visit charming Banska Stiavnica and the wine region of Sebechleby. Drive to Budapest.",
      "description": ": We'll start our day visiting the unique Hronsek wooden church, a remarkable engineering accomplishment, given the vast wooden building contains not a single nail or supporting metal in its construction. This beautiful building is protected by UNESCO and can seat a congregation of over 1,000. Our next stop is Banska Stiavnica, a beautifully preserved medieval town located in the centre of a huge caldera of an ancient collapsed volcano, surrounded by densely forested hills. While we're here, we'll visit the 17th-century open-air mining museum. Equipped with a helmet, mining coat and lamp we head 60 meters deep underground to traverse a two-kilometre tunnel providing a fascinating insight into the hard work of the mining community from the Middle Ages until the end of the 20th century. We'll continue our journey to Stará Hora, a picturesque small wine-making district of Sebechleby village, on the southern foothills of the Stiavnica Mountains sprinkled with small wine houses called \"hajlochy.\" After a short walk around the village, there is the option to visit a local wine cellar and enjoy some wine and dinner prepared by a local family, this is an optional activity - see the budgeting section for more details. Our final destination is Budapest, a two-hour drive away."

      "title": "Morning guided walking tour of Budapest",
      "description": ": Situated on a beautiful stretch of the Danube River, Hungary's capital consists of two parts: Buda and Pest. Buda is the older, more graceful part, with cobbled streets and medieval buildings, whilst Pest is the modern business centre. Using local transport, this morning we'll take a guided walking tour to see the major sites of this impressive city. Our walk will include the Basilica of Saint Stephen and the Parliament buildings before we cross the Chain Bridge to the Castle District and Watertown. Here, we'll stop to see Buda's most ancient gems - Castle Hill with the Old Town, Fisherman's Bastion and the Royal Palace. The afternoon is free for you to explore at your own pace. You might like to relax in one of the famous historic thermal baths, fed by natural hot springs, or take a boat cruise on the Danube. Another recommended attraction is Szentendre; an artist's town with a Serb minority located on the bank of the river, which can be reached by train or bus."
