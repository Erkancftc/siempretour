  "generalInfo": "From the beautiful Baroque churches of Budapest to the fabled castles of Transylvania, the colourful crosses of the Merry Cemetery and the traditional wooden homes of the Maramures region, this 10-day small group tour of Romania and Hungary uncovers an endlessly fascinating corner of Eastern Europe.  <br/><br/>You’ll meet the rest of your group, and your tour leader, in the majestic Hungarian capital: Budapest. Before moving on, you might like to spend your first day exploring this historic city by bicycle, admiring its grand architecture and boulevards, the Communist monuments in Statue Park, and not forgetting to take a soothing dip in the famous thermal pools.<br/><br/>First stop on the itinerary is Eger, a Baroque town home to some of the region’s finest vineyards. Sample local favourite the ‘Bull’s Blood’ red wine, which legend has it the Hungarian army once drank for extra strength.<br/><br/>Travelling by bus, train and private vehicle, cross the plains into the Maramures region, like stepping back in time to the medieval period with its handsome wooden houses and churches. The undisputed highlight here is the Merry Cemetery, known for its colourful crosses hand-carved by Stan Ioan Patras and his apprentice.<br/><br/>Reaching Sighisoara in Transylvania you’ll be immersed in stories of Castle Dracula, as Bran Castle here is said to have inspired Bram Stoker’s novel – but have no fear, the welcome you’ll receive will be genuinely warm. <br/><br/>Continuing on through charming Viscri and Brasov, you’ll reach your final destination in the lively Romanian capital: Bucharest, which just like Budapest is renowned for its stunning architecture. A perfect place to end your tour and bid the rest of your group happy trails.  <br/>",

      "description": "Szia! Welcome to Hungary. Your adventure begins with a welcome meeting at 6 pm tonight in Budapest. If you arrive early, maybe visit the historic Buda Castle or wander through the winding streets of the Castle District, which dates back to the 13th century. In the afternoon, maybe a cruise along the Danube to see the riverside Parliament Building, the Castle District and the bridges linking Buda and Pest. Tonight, maybe head out with your fellow travellers for dinner, then take a night walk along the Danube to see the buildings and bridges lit up in lights."

      "title": "Eger.",
      "description": "This morning, take a train east to Eger. This beautifully preserved Baroque town is surrounded by hills and is home to some of the most renowned vineyards in Eastern Europe. Visit the wine cellars of the Valley of the Beautiful Women to sample some of the town's famous Bull's Blood red wine, which supposedly gave the Hungarian army supernatural strength during their battle against the Ottoman Empire. In your free time, maybe explore Eger's 13th-century castle – the site of the historic siege that thwarted the Ottoman Empire's advance into Western Europe. Here, you can visit the Gothic Palace, view a gallery of fine Hungarian art and tour underground passageways filled with archaeological finds. You may also like to check out the town's 19th-century cathedral, climb the northernmost medieval minaret in Europe for views of the city or visit the Minorite Church in Dobo Square."

      "description": "After breakfast, travel to Debrecen. While here, you'll have time to explore Deri Square’s fountains, colourful buildings, museums and the golden Great Church. Continue by private vehicle across the central plains into Romania’s Maramures (mah-ra-moo-resh) region. This area may be modernising, but among the traditional wooden houses, churches, music and forests, you can still find parts of life unchanged since medieval times. When you arrive, settle into your room – your accommodation for the night is run by a local family. Sit down for a home-cooked dinner with your group and get to know the locals, their stories and their way of life."

      "title": "Maramures.",
      "description": "Today, you’ll discover more about the region of Maramures. Rich in tradition and folklore, the music, costumes, festivals and ancient superstitions of one of the last peasant cultures in Europe continue to thrive here. Maramures is particularly famed for its wooden churches, many of which are World Heritage-listed. Set out on a guided group tour to explore the region, visiting the unique Merry Cemetery in Sapanta, where the life stories of the deceased are displayed on colourful wooden crosses. You’ll also see other traditional villages, including the village museum in Sighetu – an assembly of beautiful local wooden architecture."

      "title": "Sighisoara.",
      "description": "Begin the day with a scenic drive to Sighisoara – while the name may conjure up images of haunted castles, gothic churches and vampires, this is only a small part of what makes Transylvania such an enchanting and exciting destination. Another UNESCO World Heritage site, the town was first settled by the Romans but flourished under the Saxons from the 12th century. Take a walk around the Old Town, which coils up a narrow hill surrounded on all sides by fortified walls, and explore the 64 m tall clock tower that dominates the citadel. The town is famed as the birthplace of Vlad Dracul III, better known as Vlad the Impaler, whose name inspired Bram Stoker’s iconic Count Dracula. Vlad III is revered as a folk hero by Romanians for driving off the invading Ottoman Turks, whose victims are said to have numbered as many as 100,000. Tonight, maybe sit down for a traditional Romanian dinner at one of local restaurants."

      "title": "Viscri.",
      "description": "This morning, you have some free time in Sighisoara. After lunch, take a short drive to the village of Viscri – a small Transylvanian village originally inhabited by Saxons from the Luxembourg area. This village of red-tiled roofs is a UNESCO World Heritage site, virtually unchanged for 900 years. When you arrive, you’ll visit the town's fortified church, thought to be the oldest in Transylvania. After, sit down to a home-cooked dinner prepared by a local family, sampling fresh produce, homemade wines and schnapps. Tonight, stay in rustic houses that the locals rent out to visitors."

      "title": "Brasov.",
      "description": "This morning, visit the famed Bran Castle, said to be the inspiration for the home of Bram Stoker's Dracula. Perched on a high cliff and surrounded by pine trees, you’ll explore the castle with your local leader and group. After, travel to Brasov and enjoy some free time to explore at your own pace – maybe visit the ornate churches, townhouses and squares surrounded by gingerbread-roofed merchants' houses. If you're looking for a bit of nightlife tonight, Brasov has plenty of funky bars and restaurants to enjoy once darkness falls."

      "title": "Brasov.",
      "description": "Today is a free day to explore Brasov at your own pace. Also known by its German name, Kronstadt, the town is flanked by mountains and was once a major medieval trading centre. When you arrive, maybe explore the town's main attraction – the Gothic Black Church (Biserica Neagra), which took its name from its blackened appearance after a fire in 1689. Later, you might stroll along Strada Republicii, take a cable car up to Mt Tampa or or hike one of the forested trails that start right from the edge of town."

Romania's capital also likes big things and is home to one of Europe's largest squares. The Palace of Parliament is also the second largest building in the world! When you arrive, set off on a guided walking tour around town to help you get your bearings. The rest of the afternoon is then free for you to choose your own adventure.
