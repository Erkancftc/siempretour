    "generalInfo": "This West Africa overland holiday is a two week adventure through an eclectic array of West African landscapes that are still virtually undiscovered by tourists, in both Senegal and Guinea-Bissau. Our journey through both of these countries allows us to not only experience the biodiverse beauties of this Sahel region of the African continent, the name given to the region between Sahara and the Savannah, but also the remote communities and indigenous people who still live traditional lifestyles there and welcome us into their communities. <br/><br/>Starting in the busiest hub of the region, the capital of Senegal, Dakar, it isn’t too far for us to experience wilderness as we journey on to Djoudj National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site so recognised for the 1.5 million migratory birds that favour this as habitat, including some of the largest flocks of flamingos in Africa. The nearby town of St. Louis is very different to the capital, with a laid back post colonial feel in a stunning location on a narrow island in the middle of the Senegal River. You can get around by horse and carriage or stroll out to the shores and watch the fishermen bring in their catch. In contrast, we spend one night in the desert again after St. Louis, enjoying precious time with the semi-nomadic Fulani people. <br/><br/>Another contrasting town awaits in Touba, home to Senegal’s Marabout Muslim Brotherhood where a deep seated spiritual heritage still thrives. Another contrast awaits in the Casamance region where the religious culture is still an ancient one, and where we have the honour of meeting a traditional Dioula monarch, possibly witnessing a religious ritual as well as being guided through their sacred, forested lands. This really is another side to Senegal altogether and a fascinating one too. <br/><br/>Our journey into Guinea-Bissau, south of Senegal, focuses on its magnificent coastline, made up of islands and lagoons, wildlife filled wetlands and mangrove forests boasting highlights such as the West African manatee, salt water hippos and sea turtles that inhabit the waters of the Bijagos Islands. Islands that are still home to very traditional communities, such as the matriarchal and ritual rich communities of Canhabaque Island where, yet again, with inimitable West African generosity, we are welcomed whole heartedly, bringing this wonderful adventure into these remote West African countries to a fine finale.",

Starting in the city of Marrakech, the end point of the Saharan camel caravans of old, we journey through the lands of the Berbers and across the mighty High Atlas Mountains, to the magical landscapes of the Draa Valley, encountering huge dunes and semi-nomadic people living in the desert.<br/><br/>From here our journey into the arid lands south begins, travelling south through endless horizons and stopping at small desert towns along the way, the Sahara getting ever closer. From Tarfaya we enter the disputed territory of the Western Sahara, a land of Saharawi nomads, rolling dunes and camel trains, where traditions are strong and the scenery awe-inspiring. Stopping at wells and to meet local people, we spend a few days exploring here before rejoining the coastal road south, crossing into the desert republic of Mauritania, where we visit the age-old city of Chinguetti and explore the striking Adrar region before moving on to Senegal. <br/><br/>As the Sahara starts to disappear into the Sahel we search for wildlife, see the striking Lac Rose, and visit the former colonial capital of St Louis. Travelling further south we make a brief stop in the Gambia before arriving in the Casamance region, where Islam and Christianity never quite managed to dominate; this is the Africa of old, where ancient beliefs and customs are still revered, a world away from the lands we have just crossed, and we take time to learn about the cultural traditions of its people. <br/><br/>Our last country on the incredible journey is Guinea-Bissau; here we visit traditional communities, explore old abandoned towns and spend two days sailing between the islands of the stunning Bijagos Archipelago. This is a journey like no other, showing you the incredible variety that exists within just one small part of the continent; we hope that you’ll be as excited as we are!",
