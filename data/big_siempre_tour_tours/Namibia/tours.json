For more information, please see Optional activities under Budgeting and packing. Our hotel tonight is the tranquil Utopia, an eco-lodge situated amidst lush gardens in the suburb of Klein Windhoek. Each of the 14 spacious rooms is carefully decorated using local natural materials and each room has its own private balcony or terrace. The boutique hotel also features two swimming pools, a central main lounge, and a bar and restaurant area where you can try a selection of specially curated craft beers and spirits."

Although initially established as one of the agricultural hotspots of Namibia, today it serves as a stark reminder of what it once was; a vast semi-arid savannah, dotted with the occasional camelthorn bush, that stretches as far as the eye can see. The drive to our home for the night is just over 300 kilometres/186 miles and we expect to arrive in the early to mid-afternoon, giving us time to unpack and freshen up before heading out on our first game drive. The Southern Kalahari plains are rich with wildlife and frequent visitors include black impalas, kudos, cheetahs, giraffes, rhinos and zebras, to name but a few. After our afternoon game drive, we'll soak in the sunset as we enjoy our first safari sundowner. Then, we'll return to our lodge for a traditional boma braai dinner under the stars. Tonight, we'll learn more about the surrounding plains with a talk and demonstration of some of the ancient San Bushman traditions."

Sossusvlei is undoubtedly one of Africa's most iconic landscapes; the orange-red dunes paired with the deep blue sky are instantly recognisable and are home to some of the highest sand dunes on the planet - a number of them tower more than 300 metres/984 feet above sea level. Our drive today will take us between five and six hours but we'll take frequent breaks, including a stop for lunch. As the main dunes are most picturesque in the early hours of the day, we'll save those for tomorrow morning. Instead, we'll take in the splendour of the smaller but no-less magnificent Elim Dunes which offer breathtaking views of the surrounding desert landscape. Tonight, we'll stay amongst the dunes of the Namib Desert, at the astounding Dead Valley Lodge. We plan to arrive in the mid-afternoon to take full advantage of our spectacular accommodation. Rising from the desert-like sails of a ship, this hotel combines modern design with a traditional safari aesthetic, giving us a taste of luxury as we enjoy Namibia's unparalleled landscapes.

As the sun travels across the sky, the normally red dunes change colour, transitioning from grey early in the day to pink and purple later in the morning. Close to Sossusvlei lies the equally impressive Deadvlei, home to 'Big Daddy' the largest dune in the world. Although climbing it is not for everyone as it takes over one hour to reach the top, the views of the Namib-Naukluft from the pinnacle are unrivalled. After a morning full of adventure, we'll head back to our lodge in the afternoon, giving us enough time to enjoy a drink by the pool or to venture out on one of the many marked walking trails in the area."

A walking safari is a much more intimate experience, and together with our team of experienced trackers and an armed ranger, our guide will do their very best to make this once-in-a-lifetime experience come to life. We'll be tracking the rhino in an area that doesn't often receive visitors, so although the main focus of the walking safari is the majestic rhinoceros, there is also the opportunity to spot other species such as kudos, mountain zebras, oryx and giraffes. We usually drive into the reserve in 4x4 vehicles before continuing on foot once the trackers have found fresh footprints and on most occasions, we'll be rewarded with safari memories that will last a lifetime.

The park is home to four of the Big 5 and, while we can never guarantee animal sightings, it's common to spot elephants and lions here. With more than 110 different species calling these plains home, we might also be lucky enough to see steenboks, jackals, wildebeest and giraffes to name just a few. There will be more than enough to keep us busy until the mid-afternoon when we'll arrive at our base for the next two nights.

    "generalInfo": "Stay at exclusive wildlife lodges throughout this Namibian wildlife safari adventure. Visit the vast and diverse Etosha National Park as well as visiting some of the most iconic sights in Namibia on this wonderful luxury safari holiday.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife safaris of Southern Africa including Namibia. Namibia is a vast country with some of the most photogenic and stunning scenery anywhere in the world. <br/><br/>Being home to one of the world’s largest national parks (Etosha National Park) and the world’s oldest desert (Namib Desert) the seemingly barren Namibian wilderness is alive with wildlife. This tour is an exploration around some of the most iconic and beautiful places in this wonderful country, whilst staying in some of the most prestigious accommodation in the country.<br/><br/>Unlike many other safari destinations in Africa it is not just the wildlife that is mesmerising here, instead the landscape plays a major role in bringing the wildlife and the wilderness to life. Whether it is the colossal orange sand dunes of Sossusvlei or the eerie petrified trees of Deadvlei, the very moon like eroded hills and canyons north of Swakopmund or indeed the vast rugged terrain of Damarland and the white empty expanse of the Etosha Pan, there is incredible and unique landscapes all over Namibia.<br/><br/>Being mostly a desert environment, it is easy to think of the country as being devoid of life, certainly it is hard to believe that the country could boast the largest population of rhinos in the world (outside of protected parks), or large numbers of elephants, lions, leopards, cheetahs and other iconic African wildlife. But that is Namibia, a land of contradictions a land of extreme environments which has led to the evolution of wildlife that has come up with some incredible adaptations to survive. Including handstanding beetles, cartwheeling spiders, dancing lizards, sand-swimming lizards and sidewinding snakes among others. <br/><br/>On this trip you will be taken to see some of the smallest but most bizarre inhabitants of the desert as well as enjoying many game drives in the presence of elephants, giraffes, lions, rhinos and other large African wildlife. Namibia is truly a unique destination and with the help of our expert naturalist guides, people with an intimate knowledge of the wildlife and habitats you will be visiting, we know you will be great hands when it comes to getting the most out of this Namibian safari. <br/><br/>There are so many different places to visit in Namibia, this is itinerary hits all of the key destinations, however if you wish to visit other places we are experts are tailoring wildlife and cultural tours to Namibia to suit any requirement. All you have to do is to get in touch with your budget and your group size and where you would like to go and we will come back to you with an itinerary and quote for your perfect Namibian wildlife safari tour.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Windhoek. We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers and game drives. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Namibia (and elsewhere in Southern Africa). Your naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the Namibian wilderness, night safaris are available in Etosha, however they are only available with the park services and it is a first come first basis and so you will have to speak to your guide on arrival there and book places on these (this is not included). A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>There are reasons to visit Namibia at any time of year, however we prefer to visit in October – November where the temperatures are a little cooler and the wildlife plentiful. <br/>Namibia has more than 300 days of sunshine per year. It is situated at the southern edge of the tropics; the Tropic of Capricorn cuts the country about in half. The winter (June–August) is generally dry, both rainy seasons occur in summer, the small rainy season between September and November, the big one between February and April. Humidity is low, and average rainfall varies from almost zero in the coastal desert to more than 600mm in the Caprivi Strip. <br/>Weather and climate in the coastal area are dominated by the cold, north-flowing Benguela Current of the Atlantic Ocean which accounts for very low precipitation (&lt;50mm per year), frequent dense fog, and overall lower temperatures than in the rest of the country. In winter, occasionally a condition known as Berg wind or Oosweer occurs, a hot dry wind bloWing from the inland to the coast. As the area<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist guides as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it. We do our best to include as many wildlife activities as possible in all of our itineraries.<br/>• Depending on budget and interest we have a range of different accommodation packages to offer, from luxury top end lodges, national park safari lodges and camps which often offer unbelievable wildlife watching deep inside national parks as well as camping. A mobile camping safari of Namibia is very popular and all of your camping gear will be provided.<br/>• Spend all the daylight hours searching for wildlife and visiting various natural wonders and stunning landscapes.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our Namibian wildlife safaris a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Southern Africa so that we can try and find and observe some of the rarer and more elusive species. We have great itineraries and expertise in all Southern African countries (Namibia, South Africa, Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Mozambique) and can arrange trips to find some of the rarer species such as aardvarks, aardwolves, brown hyenas and black-footed cats among other species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour visit various locations within Namibia. We will start and end the trip in the capital Windhoek along the way you will visit Etosha, Damaraland, Skeleton Coast and the Namib Desert.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from a vehicle and whilst there is some walking, most of the walking is over flat sand or rock. However you are welcome to walk up the iconic sand dunes in Sossusvlei if you wish. However even this is not too difficult and requires no special fitness level. The longest hike is to Deadvlei and this is around 2 hours there and back and the walk is mostly flat. The biggest consideration is the heat, it is very hot in the deserts of Namibia during the day.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 16 Years Old",

The seals are natural indicators of fish stocks in the ocean. If the fish stocks are healthy, then the seal numbers are high. If the fish stocks are poor, then the seal numbers will be low. The seals are quite big, an average male weighing in at anything up to 187kg (501 lbs.). The females give birth to a single pup around late November to early December. After our visit, we'll head inland, towards the majestic Brandberg Mountain (2,573 metres/8,441 feet and the highest point in Namibia) stopping at the Brandberg White Lady Paintings. To reach these famous San Bushman rock paintings, we'll walk for around one hour via mostly flat terrain between rock formations. We recommend wearing comfortable shoes and carrying a hat, sun lotion and plenty of water today. Please note, depending on our accommodation location, the rock art seen will either be the Brandberg White Lady or Twyfelfontein rock art. Both of these sites are of important, cultural significance in Namibia and are examples of ancient Bushmen rock art. Our tour leader will advise on arrival about the running order and which rock art site we'll visit."

Travelling through Damaraland we pass through local villages and will break the journey with some stops along the way. We'll travel to the edge of Etosha National Park, considered to be one of the finest national parks in Africa. Etosha is an immense, saline desert which can be seen from space, covering over 12,400 square miles, and the habitat for 114 species of animals. All the big carnivores, elephants, giraffes, wildebeest, zebras and various antelopes are commonly seen here, and we'll also try to spot some of the more endangered species, such as black rhinos."

Our programme of game drives will depend entirely on the interests of the group and the time of year, so it's left as flexible as possible. The terrain ranges from dense bush to large open plains where animals roam freely. As well as an abundance of game, Etosha is a good place to spot birdlife with over 340 species in the park, including weaverbirds, European bee-eaters, hornbills, ostriches and Africa's heaviest flying bird, the striking kori bustard. We drive along the network of gravel roads that crisscross the park, visiting the various viewpoints and the permanent waterholes around which animals congregate. There is something enigmatic in the vast silent grey-white pan that covers the reserve."

This 11-day tour is based on good accommodations, and offers you the best of Namibia on an affordable budget.<br/><br/>One of the safest countries in Africa, Namibia is the ideal family vacation – the beauty of the Namib desert combined with the endless dunes of Sossusvlei and Deadvlei and the history and charm of Swakopmund, makes it the ideal getaway. Etosha is one of the premier places to see the Big Five, and the tribal charm of the local Ovahimba people is a must-see. You can spend the morning onboard a catamaran, where the inquisitive seals jump onto the boat to eat the fish from your hands, and if you are lucky you can spot dolphins and whales from the boat. After your trip in the morning you can spend the afternoon at Sandwich harbour, where your knowledgeable guide will introduce you to the desert Oryx and some of the other animals that live in this remote harbour. Or you could spend the afternoon on a quad bike or a camel travelling through the endless sand dunes. <br/><br/>The best time to visit Namibia would be from June – October, however Namibia is a year-round destination and even in the wet season they typically get an afternoon thunderstorm and then the rain will stop. It is very rare to have a full day of rain. <br/><br/>We offer a complete tailor made service allowing you to decide when to travel, where you stay and what to do. We can also organise land only arrangements.",

Namibia’s a world-famous destination for both landscape and wildlife photography.  This country offers a motley patchwork of landscapes featuring mountain ranges, deserts, and waterfalls. It also has healthy populations of all of Africa’s most iconic wildlife. On this trip, you’ll get to experience all of it!<br/><br/>The itinerary for this tour covers a jam-packed roster of Namibia’s must-see destinations for photographers. You’ll explore Etosha National Park, witness the awe-inspiring Epupa and Ruacana Falls, and journey through the Brandberg Mountains before finding your way to the Skeleton Coast and taking in its iconic red dunes. Along this journey, you’ll get a solid mix of landscape and wildlife photography opportunities whilst receiving tips and tuition from your guides. Other highlights of the trip include prime conditions for astrophotography and the chance to encounter the semi-nomadic Himba people. You’ll take home a diverse portfolio of pics as well as a bank of new skills to improve your ability with a camera.  <br/><br/>There’s something special for wildlife enthusiasts on this tour too. Travelling through both Etosha National Park and the more desert-like Kaokoveld region, you’ll get a chance to spot all the Big Five but also get to see deserted-adapted species of giraffes, lions, and elephants too. This mix of subjects offers unique wildlife photography opportunities and the chance to take home a diverse range of photos. Along the way, you’ll also see a striking contrast in flora, an array of spectacular bird species, and great micro-photography opportunities with reptiles and insects. <br/><br/>The tour also includes a variety of game-viewing experiences, allowing you to approach by foot, safari vehicle, and boat. A highlight of the trip is a boat tour taken on the final day across Sandwich Harbour in Swakopmund. These waters have huge populations of pink-backed Pelicans and Flamingos, and a boat cruise lets you photograph these birds up close as they fly alongside the boat.<br/><br/>The possibility for landscape photography on this tour shouldn’t be overlooked either. Namibia is a treasure trove of exciting, striking environments, some of which are almost otherworldly. This tour covers a nice range of what the country has to offer. You’ll see rolling savannah in Etosha, rugged desertland in Kaokoveld, lush greenery along the Kunene River, the Brandberg mountain range, and red dunes of the Skeleton Coast. You’ll witness some true spectacles of nature. <br/><br/>Another great thing about this tour is the instructor-to-guide ratio. This trip's maximum group size is six and each trip has two guides, so there’s one guide for every three photographers. This means you can expect close guidance and even tailored tuition.",

    "generalInfo": "This two week Namibia safari holiday has been carefully crafted to take in coast and desert, wildlife and wilderness while offering you the choice between camping along the way, or staying in lodges and hotels. No matter which one you choose, the places you visit will have one thing in common. They are all stunning. Starting in Windhoek we see these dramatic landscapes almost immediately, heading south across the Namib-Naukluft Park, where the great Namib Desert spreads out in all directions. This part of the trip also includes a visit to the dunes of Sossusvlei, some of the highest in the world, with views across centuries-old camelthorn tree skeletons and seas of sand. <br/><br/>Journeying north again and following the coast, our first urban stop after the desert is the coastal town of Swakopmund, known for being Namibia's adventure capital. This is your free day, with optional activities such as dune boarding, skydiving and camel riding.<br/><br/>The inland deserts and mountains call once more, our next stop being in Damaraland, which is not only home to the county’s highest peak, Brandberg, but also desert elephants. There are plenty more of those to be found in the country’s most celebrated wildlife zone, Etosha National Park. The name translates as 'Great White Place', because of its vast white, salt encrusted Etosha Pan, a dry lakebed that takes up much of the park and attracts over 140 species of mammal. During the three days that we spend here, you have chances to see lions, wildebeest, zebra elephants, black and white rhinos and the endemic black-faced impala.<br/><br/>More spectacular wildlife experiences await on the last couple of days of this trip, before heading back to Windhoek. First, the Waterburg Plateau with hiking trails that take you to the top of this flat topped landscape with panoramic views, or you can take an optional game drive through the reserve that has protected the endangered white rhino. And last, but certainly not least, the AfriCat Foundation which is a sanctuary for carnivores. Seeing a cheetah on your last day in Namibia isn’t a bad finale to an amazing adventure. <br/><br/>",

    "generalInfo": "Namibia: a land of vast, open spaces, sweeping deserts, wild coastline, tall dark-sand dunes as high as skyscrapers, and diverse wildlife - all of which can be reached on this two week self drive itinerary.  Because of the mainly-gravel roads, we recommend a 4x4 vehicle to give traction and height which affords views across the expansive landscapes. <br/><br/>This is not a  mass tourism destination: roads are empty, lodges are small and distances to drive will range from 4 – 6 hours, but the rewards are great: the lack of light pollution makes star gazing immensely rewarding; seeing the sunrise over the towering sand dunes at Sossusvlei is a photographer’s dream; kayak alongside frolicking seals and dolphins off the coast; track desert adapted elephant on foot and in vehicle in the stark landscapes of Damaraland, and watch for predator activity in Etosha National Park: renowned for sightings of lion, rhino, elephant, giraffe, zebra, etc.  End your trip at a reserve dedicated to conservation work with endangered species: learn about how these animals have come to be endangered, and the work being undertaken to ensure their survival.<br/><br/>We always offer small, locally owned luxury lodges for road trips around Namibia, with a focus on Namibian culture and cuisine. From our years of experience, we recommend that the best time to go to Namibia is during the dry season, June-October, as this is not only when temperatures are manageable but also when you will get the best wildlife viewing. During these months temperatures range from 20 °C-25 °C, although they do dip at night time. The temperatures start to soar as high as 40 °C during the rainy season which, in Namibia, is between Dec-March.<br/><br/>We will provide you with detailed maps, driving directions, mobile phone pre-programmed with all supplier contacts, and 24/7 support should you require it on the ground.  You will cover some distance, but never feel rushed: the spectacular scenery, endless horizons and unique experiences make a road trip in Namibia one to remember.",

It’s home to elephant, rhino, lion, giraffe, and a host of unique flora and fauna. <br/><br/>Whereas much of southern Namibia is made up of desert, the north is home to the rich farmland of Damaraland, fed mainly by the Okavango River, as well as the sub-tropical forest and mopane bush of Etosha National Park, one of the largest game viewing parks in Africa. <br/><br/>This Namibia self drive explores the best of the country’s north and south, taking advantage of good tarmac roads, which are straight and traffic free. You’ll experience the country's wildlife, landscapes, and culture from your own vehicle and at your own pace, staying at lodges working with local community and animal conservation projects. <br/><br/>See black rhino, ostrich, springbok, wild horses and desert adapted elephants in the vast expanses of Namibian wilderness. Marvel at the scenery around the dunes of Sossusvlei and explore the prehistoric rock paintings of the San (Bushmen) in the Twyfelfontein Conservancy.<br/><br/>Next stop is Ongava Game Reserve, where you’ll stay at a lodge on the southern boundary of Etosha National Park. The reserve acts as a buffer to Etosha, helping animals to move freely around the park without coming into contact with the surrounding environment. Finally you will stop in Okonjima, home to animal rehabilitation and research centre the AfriCat Foundation, where you’ll come into close contact with cheetah, leopard, and lion first hand. <br/><br/>Your route ends back in Windhoek where you’ll return your hire car before being transferred to the airport for your flight home.<br/><br/>This itinerary is tailor made and can be modified to add Fish River Canyon, Victoria Falls, Botswana or any of the remarkable highlights of the region.

The final stop will be a couple of nights in the beautiful Wolwedans Nature Reserve, a Dark Sky reserve and a wonderful spot to round off any adventure.<br/><br/>The perfect choice if you are looking to focus on Namibia's dramatic landscapes, wide open spaces and interesting history as opposed to the wildlife found further north, this trip is fantastic for second-timers and can be easily combined with some time in the north to create an all-encompassing adventure through this incredible desert country.",

The shaded cool depths of the canyon allow pools of water to gather during the rainy season and remain for much of the year round. These pools were a vital source of water for early settlers who drew water for their livestock by knotting six (ses) lengths of rawhide thongs (riems) together, hence the canyon and surrounding area became known as Sesriem.

    "generalInfo": "When it comes to Namibia tours, this one takes the cake. Spent 12 days on a safari circuit around the country’s best sights. <br/><br/>The still, clear nights in Namibia are something to be celebrated. What better way than on a camping holiday? For the majority of this holiday, you’ll be staying in semi-permanent camps, with amazing stargazing found just beyond the tent canvas. There’ll be clear views of the Milky Way by night, and hopefully clear views of Namibia’s plains wildlife by day.<br/><br/>Your route is a loop that starts and ends in Windhoek. You’ll go north towards Etosha National Park for amazing game drives, then west to the Damaraland region to seek out the desert elephant. Even further west, you’ll explore a section of the coast around Swakopmund. Heading back inland, you’ll go south to the sand dunes as Sossusvlei before returning to Windhoek. There are a few long drives on this trip, balanced by days spent at leisure in the reserves and national parks.<br/><br/>Namibia’s wildlife is made even more magnificent when you consider the incredible, harsh landscape in which is it found. At Ongave Game Reserve you’ll camp close to a watering hole, for a great chance to watch oryx, springboks and giraffes converging to drink. <br/><br/>This trip includes time spent tracking desert elephants and the incredibly rare black rhino with support from both a reputable naturalist guide and the Save the Rhino trust. Even when the wildlife proves elusive, you’ll love searching for it in these dramatic deserts.  <br/><br/>For many travellers, a highlight is the dunes at Sossusvlei in the Namib Desert, where red dunes contrast with white salt pans, and the colour contrast is even more pronounced at sunrise and sunset – the best time to climb the dune. <br/><br/>These tours are done in tiny groups of a maximum of seven guests, so that locations are not overwhelmed by visitors, and you can enjoy the sights in almost complete peace. <br/><br/>Pictures by Jason Nott, Tarry Butcher - Ultimate Safaris, Okonjima and Etendeka, and Dr Olwen Evans, Ongava<br/>",

    "generalInfo": "During the course of this 12 day safari tour of Namibia we aim to showcase some of the rarest and most desert adapted species in Namibia. Animals such as the desert adapted elephants, gemsbok and hand-standing beetles which are perfectly suited to make a living in the barren and harsh looking Namibian wildernesses. <br/>This tour will spend time in the Namib Desert, Damaraland and Walvis Bay we will hopefully see bat-eared foxes, Namaqua chameleons, Heaviside's dolphins, dassie rats, striped polecats, palmato geckos and Damara dik diks to name a few. <br/>There is also a chance of seeing the very elusive black mongoose or Jameson's red rock rabbit and other very rare and elusive species. All in all this is a must for any dedicated wildlife watcher who want to safari off the beaten track and to see some of Africa's lesser known wildlife.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife safaris of Southern Africa including Namibia. Namibia is a vast country with some of the most photogenic and stunning scenery anywhere in the world. Home to one of the world’s largest national parks and the world’s oldest desert the seemingly barren Namibian wilderness is alive with wildlife. This tour is an exploration around some of the most iconic and beautiful places in this wonderful country.<br/>Unlike many other safari destinations in Africa it is not just the wildlife that is mesmerising here, instead the landscape plays a major role in bringing the wildlife and the wilderness to life. Whether it is the colossal orange sand dunes of Sossusvlei or the eerie petrified trees of Deadvlei, the very moon like eroded hills and canyons north of Swakopmund or indeed the vast rugged terrain of Damarland and the white empty expanse of the Etosha Pan, there is incredible and unique landscapes all over Namibia.<br/>Being mostly a desert environment Namibia it is easy to think of the country as being devoid of life, certainly it is hard to believe that the country could boast the largest population of rhinos in the world (outside of protected parks), or large numbers of elephants, lions, leopards, cheetahs and other iconic African wildlife. But that is Namibia, a land of contradictions a land of extreme environments which has led to the evolution of wildlife that has come up with some incredible adaptations to survive. Including hand-standing beetles, cartwheeling spiders, dancing lizards, sand-swimming lizards and side-winding snakes among others. On this trip you will be taken to see some of the smallest but most bizarre inhabitants of the desert as well as enjoying many game drives in the presence of elephants, giraffes, lions, rhinos and other large African wildlife. Namibia is truly a unique destination and with the help of our expert naturalist guides, people with an intimate knowledge of the wildlife and habitats you will be visiting, we know you will be great hands when it comes to getting the most out of this Namibian safari. <br/>There are so many different places to visit in Namibia, this is itinerary hits all of the key destinations, however if you wish to visit other places we are experts are tailoring wildlife and cultural tours to Namibia to suit any requirement. All you have to do is to get in touch with your budget and your group size and where you would like to go and we will come back to you with an itinerary and quote for your perfect Namibian wildlife safari tour.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Windhoek and Swakopmund. We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers and game drives. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Namibia (and elsewhere in Southern Africa). Your naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the Namibian wilderness. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>There are reasons to visit Namibia at any time of year, however we prefer to visit between August – November where the temperatures are a little cooler and the wildlife plentiful. <br/>Namibia has more than 300 days of sunshine per year. It is situated at the southern edge of the tropics; the Tropic of Capricorn cuts the country about in half. The winter (June–August) is generally dry, both rainy seasons occur in summer, the small rainy season between September and November, the big one between February and April. Humidity is low, and average rainfall varies from almost zero in the coastal desert to more than 600mm in the Caprivi Strip. <br/>Weather and climate in the coastal area are dominated by the cold, north-flowing Benguela Current of the Atlantic Ocean which accounts for very low precipitation (&lt;50mm per year), frequent dense fog, and overall lower temperatures than in the rest of the country. In winter, occasionally a condition known as Berg wind or Oosweer occurs, a hot dry wind blowing from the inland to the coast. As the area<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist guides as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it. We do our best to include as many wildlife activities as possible in all of our itineraries.<br/>• Depending on budget and interest we have a range of different accommodation packages to offer, from luxury top end lodges, national park safari lodges and camps which often offer unbelievable wildlife watching deep inside national parks as well as camping. A mobile camping safari of Namibia is very popular and all of your camping gear will be provided.<br/>• Spend all the daylight hours searching for wildlife and visiting various natural wonders and stunning landscapes.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our Namibian wildlife safaris a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Southern Africa so that we can try and find and observe some of the rarer and more elusive species. We have great itineraries and expertise in all Southern African countries (Namibia, South Africa, Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Mozambique) and can arrange trips to find some of the rarer species such as aardvarks, aardwolves, brown hyenas and black-footed cats among other species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour visit various locations within Namibia. We will start and end the trip in the capital Windhoek and then move westwards into the desert and the incredible Sossusvlei sand dunes, then the Namib Desert and the quaint coastal town of Swakopmund. From here we head inland through the rugged Damaraland with its ephemeral rivers and desolate looking rock plans and gravel pans. <br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from a vehicle and whilst there is some walking, most of the walking is over flat sand or rock. However you are welcome to walk up the iconic sand dunes in Sossusvlei if you wish. However even this is not too difficult and requires no special fitness level. The longest hike is to Deadvlei and this is around 2 hours there and back and the walk is mostly flat. The biggest consideration is the heat, it is very hot in the deserts of Namibia during the day.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 12 Years Old<br/><br/>Photo Credit <br/>Sfbergo<br/>South African Tourism<br/>NH53",

    "generalInfo": "When people think of Namibia most people do not think of dolphins and flamingos; but instead the massive sand dunes of Sossusvlei and the herds of elephants in Etosha. But Namibia is a wonderful location were both the desert and the ocean can be explored for wildlife. <br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife safaris of Southern Africa including many itineraries to Namibia. Namibia is a vast country with some of the most photogenic and stunning scenery anywhere in the world. Home to one of the world’s largest national parks (Etosha National Park) and the world’s oldest desert (Namib Desert) the seemingly barren Namibian wilderness is alive with wildlife. <br/><br/>This tour is an exploration around some of the most iconic and beautiful places in this wonderful country. But as well as exploring the will known locations we will also explore Walvis Bay searching for wildlife.<br/><br/>Unlike many other safari destinations in Africa it is not just the wildlife that is mesmerising here, instead the landscape plays a major role in brining the wildlife and the wilderness to life. Whether it is the colossal orange sand dunes of Sossusvlei or the eerie petrified trees of Deadvlei, the very moon like eroded hills and canyons north of Swakopmund or indeed the vast rugged terrain of Damarland and the white empty expanse of the Etosha Pan, there is incredible and unique landscapes all over Namibia.<br/><br/>Being mostly a desert environment Namibia it is easy to think of the country as being devoid of life, certainly it is hard to believe that the country could boast the largest population of rhinos in the world (outside of protected parks), or large numbers of elephants, lions, leopards, cheetahs and other iconic African wildlife. But that is Namibia, a land of contradictions a land of extreme environments which has led to the evolution of wildlife that has come up with some incredible adaptations to survive. Including handstanding beetles, cartwheeling spiders, dancing lizards, sand-swimming lizards and sidewinding snakes among others. On this trip you will be taken to see some of the smallest but most bizarre inhabitants of the desert as well as enjoying many game drives in the presence of elephants, giraffes, lions, rhinos and other large African wildlife. With endemic Heaviside's dolphins, Cape fur seals, turtles and a huge number of marine birds, Walvis Bay is a great location to visit and see many species which most people who visit Namibia do not usually see.<br/><br/>Namibia is truly a unique destination and with the help of our expert naturalist guides, skippers, drivers all have intimate knowledge of the wildlife and habitats you will be visiting, we know you will be great hands when it comes to getting the most out of this Namibian safari. <br/><br/>There are so many different places to visit in Namibia, this is itinerary hits all of the key destinations, however if you wish to visit other places we are experts are tailoring wildlife and cultural tours to Namibia to suit any requirement. All you have to do is to get in touch with your budget and your group size and where you would like to go and we will come back to you with an itinerary and quote for your perfect Namibian wildlife safari tour.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Windhoek and Swakopmund. We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles as well as wildlife watching boats with an excellent driver / captain for all transfers, game drives and boat cruises. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Namibia (and elsewhere in Southern Africa). Your naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the Namibian wilderness, night safaris are available in Etosha, however they are only available with the park services and it is a first come first basis and so you will have to speak to your guide on arrival there and book places on these (this is not included). A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>There are reasons to visit Namibia at any time of year, however we prefer to visit in September – November where the temperatures are a little cooler and the wildlife plentiful. <br/>Namibia has more than 300 days of sunshine per year. It is situated at the southern edge of the tropics; the Tropic of Capricorn cuts the country about in half. The winter (June–August) is generally dry, both rainy seasons occur in summer, the small rainy season between September and November, the big one between February and April. Humidity is low, and average rainfall varies from almost zero in the coastal desert to more than 600mm in the Caprivi Strip. <br/>Weather and climate in the coastal area are dominated by the cold, north-flowing Benguela Current of the Atlantic Ocean which accounts for very low precipitation (&lt;50mm per year), frequent dense fog, and overall lower temperatures than in the rest of the country. In winter, occasionally a condition known as Berg wind or Oosweer occurs, a hot dry wind bloWing from the inland to the coast. As the area<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist guides as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it. We do our best to include as many wildlife activities as possible in all of our itineraries.<br/>• Depending on budget and interest we have a range of different accommodation packages to offer, from luxury top end lodges, national park safari lodges and camps which often offer unbelievable wildlife watching deep inside national parks as well as camping. A mobile camping safari of Namibia is very popular and all of your camping gear will be provided.<br/>• Spend all the daylight hours searching for wildlife and visiting various natural wonders and stunning landscapes.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our Namibian wildlife safaris a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Southern Africa so that we can try and find and observe some of the rarer and more elusive species. We have great itineraries and expertise in all Southern African countries (Namibia, South Africa, Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Mozambique) and can arrange trips to find some of the rarer species such as aardvarks, aardwolves, brown hyenas and black-footed cats among other species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour visit various locations within Namibia. We will start and end the trip in the capital Windhoek and in between visit Etosha National Park, Namib Desert, Walvis Bay, Damaraland and Skeleton Coast..<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from a vehicle and whilst there is some walking, most of the walking is over flat sand or rock. However you are welcome to walk up the iconic sand dunes in Sossusvlei if you wish. However even this is not too difficult and requires no special fitness level. The longest hike is to Deadvlei and this is around 2 hours there and back and the walk is mostly flat. The biggest consideration is the heat, it is very hot in the deserts of Namibia during the day.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 12 Years Old<br/><br/>Photo credits:<br/><br/>By Moongateclimber - Own work, CC<br/>By betty x1138 from NYC, USA - Flickr, CC <br/>Jutta Luft",

But that is Namibia, a land of contradictions a land of extreme environments which has led to the evolution of wildlife that has come up with some incredible adaptations to survive. Including handstanding beetles, cartwheeling spiders, dancing lizards, sand-swimming lizards and sidewinding snakes among others. On this trip you will be taken to see some of the smallest but most bizarre inhabitants of the desert as well as enjoying many game drives in the presence of elephants, giraffes, lions, rhinos and other large African wildlife. Namibia is truly a unique destination and with the help of our expert naturalist guides, people with an intimate knowledge of the wildlife and habitats you will be visiting, we know you will be great hands when it comes to getting the most out of this Namibian safari. <br/>There are so many different places to visit in Namibia, this is itinerary hits all of the key destinations, however if you wish to visit other places we are experts are tailoring wildlife and cultural tours to Namibia to suit any requirement. All you have to do is to get in touch with your budget and your group size and where you would like to go and we will come back to you with an itinerary and quote for your perfect Namibian wildlife safari tour.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Windhoek and Swakopmund. We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers and game drives. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Namibia (and elsewhere in Southern Africa). Your naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the Namibian wilderness, night safaris are available in Etosha, however they are only available with the park services and it is a first come first basis and so you will have to speak to your guide on arrival there and book places on these (this is not included). A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>There are reasons to visit Namibia at any time of year, however we prefer to visit in October – November where the temperatures are a little cooler and the wildlife plentiful. <br/>Namibia has more than 300 days of sunshine per year. It is situated at the southern edge of the tropics; the Tropic of Capricorn cuts the country about in half. The winter (June–August) is generally dry, both rainy seasons occur in summer, the small rainy season between September and November, the big one between February and April. Humidity is low, and average rainfall varies from almost zero in the coastal desert to more than 600mm in the Caprivi Strip. <br/>Weather and climate in the coastal area are dominated by the cold, north-flowing Benguela Current of the Atlantic Ocean which accounts for very low precipitation (&lt;50mm per year), frequent dense fog, and overall lower temperatures than in the rest of the country. In winter, occasionally a condition known as Berg wind or Oosweer occurs, a hot dry wind blowing from the inland to the coast. As the area<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist guides as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it. We do our best to include as many wildlife activities as possible in all of our itineraries.<br/>• Depending on budget and interest we have a range of different accommodation packages to offer, from luxury top end lodges, national park safari lodges and camps which often offer unbelievable wildlife watching deep inside national parks as well as camping. A mobile camping safari of Namibia is very popular and all of your camping gear will be provided.<br/>• Spend all the daylight hours searching for wildlife and visiting various natural wonders and stunning landscapes.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our Namibian wildlife safaris a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Southern Africa so that we can try and find and observe some of the rarer and more elusive species. We have great itineraries and expertise in all Southern African countries (Namibia, South Africa, Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Mozambique) and can arrange trips to find some of the rarer species such as aardvarks, aardwolves, brown hyenas and black-footed cats among other species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour visit various locations within Namibia. We will start and end the trip in the capital Windhoek and then move westwards into the desert and the incredible Sossusvlei sand dunes, then the Namib Desert and the quaint coastal town of Swakopmund. From here we head inland through the rugged Damaraland to the wonderful Etosha National Park. This is a true exploration of Namibia and its major wildlife locations.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from a vehicle and whilst there is some walking, most of the walking is over flat sand or rock. However you are welcome to walk up the iconic sand dunes in Sossusvlei if you wish. However even this is not too difficult and requires no special fitness level. The longest hike is to Deadvlei and this is around 2 hours there and back and the walk is mostly flat. The biggest consideration is the heat, it is very hot in the deserts of Namibia during the day.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 12 Years Old",

        "description": "Damaraland / Twyfelfontein - This morning we will leave Swakopmund and head north along the world famous Skel¬eton Coast; so called from the large numbers of whale and seal bones that littered the beaches from the days of whaling and sealing. Nowadays there are ‘skeletons’ of many ships that have been shipwrecked here over the years. The first place we will visit along this road is the Cape Cross fur seal colony, this is the largest seal colony in Africa and also one of the few in the world that is located in a desert. It is bizarre to see around 210,000 seals in the desert. Continuing on we will inland and into the heart of Damaraland where the ranges of sweeping vistas or windswept dunes and rugged canyons with richly coloured volcanic rocks and extensive mountain ranges are as wild and remote as it gets in the modern world. The area around here is very delicate to over exploitation as most of the ground is covered in hundreds of species of lichen that when driven over or stood on can be damaged for decades with their slow growth rates. The lichen fields here change colour with the coastal fogs push inland and the li-chens catch the droplets and spring back to life for their dormant states in between the mists. If we have time this afternoon we will visit the Twyfelfontein area and the UNESCO World Heritage Site with over 2,500 rock carvings and painting made by the ancient bushmen who inhabited this for over 6,000 years. Don’t worry if we don’t make it here this afternoon because we will visit the site the following morning. The petroglyphs were made by the hunter-gatherers and then later by Khoikhoi herders, the rocks here have been used by both cultures as a place of worship and a site of shamanist rituals. The area is one of the most culturally and his¬torically important sites in the world and a reminder that this area was not always this barren and sparse as some of the carvings depict hippos, giraffes, antelopes and lions.

This is a huge park (over 22,000km2) and is one of Africa’s most im¬portant reserves with thousands of animals including many of Africa’s most iconic species includ¬ing lions, elephants, black rhino, giraffes, leopards, cheetahs, spotted hyenas, zebra and several species of antelope; the birdlife is also prolific here, with raptors being commonly seen.

By staying here we will also get an insight of the work being done in various places around Africa in terms of top predator conservation and research. The leopards, lions, cheetahs, hyenas and African wild dogs throughout the country are persecuted by farmers and other livestock owners and so projects such as Africat are of incredible importance and the benefits are being felt here with increasing numbers of predators and also a better understanding and appreciation of them and their part in the ecosystem by the local people.

    "generalInfo": "There’s nowhere like Namibia. This southern African country is a vast desert landscape, with high dunes bashed by Atlantic waves, and extraordinary scattered wildlife converging on the rare water sources. The towns and cities are interesting cultural centres; the space between them a photographer’s dream. <br/><br/>This tour is a circuit around Namibia’s best sites, starting and finishing in Windhoek. First, you’ll head south into the deserts, where you’ll find Sossusvlei and Deadvlei, amazing dune landscapes populated only by a few petrified trees. From here you’ll head to the Skeleton Coast, and Swakopmund town, where you can spot birds in Walvis Bay. Heading up the ‘Skeleton Coast’ by car, you’ll eventually turn inland in the north of the country, towards Damaraland, famous for its desert elephants. <br/><br/>The holiday’s grand finale is in Etosha National Park, where you can go on safari in the morning and the evening and watch the animals around the park’s water holes. There are 340 bird species to spot, as well as elephants, Hartmann’s mountain zebra and the very elusive black rhino. This trip directly supports Helping Rhinos, a charity which is working to ensure the long-term survival of the rhino. <br/><br/>This holiday exclusively uses local leaders, and local guides, to give you the best experience of the country. They’ll know whether you’ve spotted a springbok or an oryx in Sesriem, and what’s petrified the trees in Damaraland. <br/><br/>This is a premium tour of Namibia, meaning that the accommodation has been carefully picked out for its quality. Take Desert Hills Lodge near Sossusvlei, where you can stay in luxurious thatched chalets, on a small outcrop facing west. Raise a toast to the desert at sunset – the landscape might be parched, but you don’t have to be. <br/>",

        "description": "Dune 7 towers above the desert, rising 383 meters and dominating a landscape of shimmering yellows and glowing reds. From below it looks unconquerable, each step along the ridge seeming to take the summit further away. There are no ski style lifts when you’re sandboarding in the Namibian desert, so it’s a long sweaty walk up before you cruise back down. Unless …Well, unless you happen to have an ATV that can coast along the ridge. Now you’re quickly back at the summit. It’s a phenomenal view up here with a luscious blue ocean on one side, polychromatic dunes beneath you, and the charms of Swakopmund in the distance. Wax the board, rub the wax off with sand, clip in your feet, and…ahhhhhhhh! You coast diagonally down the world’s highest sand dune, trying to maintain balance and often falling onto the dune. Snowboarders will quickly notice the similarities and can start pulling tricks. First-timers find it’s very easy to pick up the techniques; the ultra-soft sand means that every fall is gentle, and that imbues you with a confidence that’s hard to find on an icy snow slope. For added exhilaration, you can lie down flat on a waxed wooden board and get pushed down the dune. Today starts with a three-hour drive from Windhoek, cutting through desolate landscapes and emerging at the Atlantic Ocean and Swakopmund. Check-in and check out the view, before your afternoon of sandboarding on the world's highest sand dune."

        "description": "Swakopmund is a rarity in Namibia, a colonial leftover in a country that was virtually unexplored by Europeans. Ships would land and be greeted by a formidable barriers of dunes. So they turned around. Or at least, they tried to turn around. Many great vessels couldn’t escape the sand and their remains provide a redolent insight into nature’s power. Slowly they’re being submerged, wooden wrecks that baffle your camera as you journey along the Skeleton Coast. They’ve been inundated by sand and, after exploring the shipwrecks, you’re being overwhelmed by a new natural wonder. Thousands of Cape fur seals dot the beach, completely covering the sand with wobbling antics. They squawk and shout, looking for mates and defending their sunbathing positions. On land they’re comical. Yet once in the water it’s you that becomes the amateur mover. Board a kayak and paddle through the bay, slowly floating alongside the whole colony. The seals are transformed in the water, disappearing beneath your craft and returning with fish, or diving off the rocks and rapidly swimming past. You can get indelibly close to them, although how close will depend on their playfulness; trying to paddle after a seal is a water race you’re not going to win. Return to Swakopmund after this full day tour and explore the town’s charming late 19th century buildings, each pastel colored leftover juxtaposed with palm trees. You’ll find a handful of excellent restaurants, glorious sunset vistas from the beach, and Namibia’s idyllically serene atmosphere."

The plane swoops low, providing close-ups as dunes reflect a smoldering sunrise. Slowly they emerge from the shadows, flickering red and then scorching through the oranges to yellow. When the pilot ascends the vistas become ethereal, hundreds of miles of desert gaping beneath your eyes. Touchdown near Sossusvlei, Namibia’s most photographed natural attraction. Here the dunes tower above desolate clay pans, the crusted ground a remarkable contrast to the sand. This is a place that rewards any camera with a cutting edge panoramic mode. Explore on foot, spinning around and trying to find an angle without dunes. In nearby Deadvlei, it’s scarred trees that offer a focal point, brittle black branches rising like mythical creatures from the clay. You return to Swakopmund in the same Cessna 210, the pilot looping further inland and offering increasing proof of Namibia’s diaphanous beauty."

Damaraland epitomizes the untamed and unpretentious splendor of the Namibian landscape. It looks like a shooting location for a Hollywood epic set on the moon. And then the sun goes down and it’s impossible to pick out constellations; the sky is so bright with stars that a telescope feels redundant. This ancient land will be your playground for the next three days. It’s not a case of following the path. You’ll be making trails that rarely ever see human eyes.

Strange rock features accompany every corner, like circular formations and bizarre isolated fingers. They’re slowly changing, the wind whipping through and continuing the million-year weathering of the landscape. Up ahead a small herd of kudu stands on the trail, the bike wheels coasting alongside their elegant presence. Broken tree branches suggest elephants are nearby, and as you picnic beneath a peculiar cave, the great pachyderms saddle past. Today is tailored to your fitness levels and there are thousands of possibilities. Either stay out exploring all day or split the exploration into a morning and afternoon ride. You can also switch mountain biking with hiking and vise versa. An eerie feeling of silence accompanies the ride, little but wind, and galloping antelopes filling Damaraland’s gulf in space and time. Disembark and climb up rocks for elegant vistas, or descend to the valley floor and follow in the trail of great migrating herds. With a mountain bike you can travel farther, and for the really enthusiastic, take a one-way journey into the heart of the wilderness and get a ride home in a Land Rover."

Behind every rock is another nook or cranny, above every mountain is a new panorama, and below your camp is a different wandering antelope. Most hiking trails focus on the mountains, ensuring a good canopy of shade and unveiling the land’s ancestors. Bushmen have called Namibia home for 40,000 years and they narrate history through rock art. Paintings depict scenes for the next nomads, each small tribe leaving a lesson for the next. Sketches show a successful hunt, a plant containing poison, or a tribe being chased away by white settlers. Thousands of years on and they’re just as poignant to our understanding of the world as they've ever been. Return to the camp and enjoy the vista once more. While you’re there, let’s indulge in the quality of accommodation you’ll be enjoying this vacation. Camping in the wilderness doesn’t carry the greatest of preconceptions. But this is a camping Namibia style. Raised wooden platforms stand above the landscapes, the spacious canvas tents flanked by private verandahs and glorious en-suite outdoor bathrooms. Taking a warm shower beneath the stars removes the day’s sweat, although sometimes you find yourself in the bathroom just so you can savor the view. Thick luxury beds and elegant wooden fittings complete the interior, nothing out of place with the natural environment. This isn’t really camping in its strictest sense. Instead, it’s using canvas tents to maximize the immersion in nature and not leave a concrete or glass scar on the environment."

Yet the audacity of the adventure brings a certain apprehension. You’re on the trail of White rhinos, wandering through the semi-arid landscape and heading straight for these two-ton endangered beasts. Up ahead the rhinos laze in the shade, twitching briefly and fully aware of your presence. Now’s not the time to ignore your guide’s instructions. Creep forward, a hand over your mouth to prevent shrieks of astonishment. Now you’re less than 20 meters away. Now it’s less than 15. The rhinos wait and watch, happy to doze and allow your startled amazement. Following wild White rhinos is only possible in a few places on the planet. It’s a quintessential introduction to the world of Ongava, an exhilarating natural encounter that redefines your notions of safari etiquette. Stay in the safari vehicle? That’s certainly not the case on this outdoor adventure. From Damaraland, it’s a three-hour drive to Ongava Game Reserve and the sumptuous Little Ongava Camp. Perched on a hill above Etosha National Park, the camp affords a new collection of pristine vistas, this time onto migratory herds and stunning collections of wild game."

Your game drives can access both, but other visitors to Etosha don’t have the same access to Ongava. Wake early and cross into Etosha, curling through the woodland and saying morning greetings to the other early risers; elephants are bashing at tree trunks, black-faced impala baffle the camera, and a critically endangered Black rhino is mooching through the trees. Etosha is where you'll find the rare and the random, mammals that have found a haven in this corner of Africa. Dik dik, banded mongoose, ground pangolin, Steenbok...you've probably never heard of them, but you'll soon learn how to recognize these unusual beauties. Lions are also fond of this assorted cast, the diverse dinner menu enabling abundant prides to coexist in close proximity. Beside the shimmering salt pan, you see a pride walking. No lion wastes energy unnecessarily so they must be up to something. Follow their paw prints, watching the lionesses separate from the youngsters and head out to hunt. The young cubs want to join but they haven't got the focus, they're too busy jousting with each other and giving away the pride's position. There might be a lot of food but hunting isn't easy in Etosha, and the skilled lionesses take cover, an indication that this dinnertime meal could be a few hours in coming. Of course, you could have turned a corner and spotted a leopard with a carcass in its jaw. Or a hyena with blooded lips. Etosha epitomizes the unpredictability and excitement of a safari to Namibia. Everyone will have a different experience because no two moments in this vast park are ever the same. Take a picnic and stay in Etosha all day, or return to Ongava for a leisurely lunch and a late afternoon game drive. It's iconic and achingly authentic, a jamboree of animals always bringing exultant eyes and wide smiles."

So why is the Bushmen guide so lackadaisical about walking through the savannah? Doesn't he know it could be dangerous? For 40,000 years, Bushmen have lived alongside Africa's great mammals, their ancestral knowledge passed down through the generations. Start walking with your guide, watching, and learning from his visual clues. They're naturally laconic and it's extremely rare to meet a tribe member who speaks English. But that doesn't stop an exchange of knowledge. The guide points to marks on a tree, the freshness of tree sap indicating when a leopard made the scars. Indentations in greenery reveal elephant presence. The age of dung can be calculated without touch. Game tracking keeps building the excitement, as once you recognize the clues you know what's coming. But how did this happen! You thought you were tracking an eland herd when your guide solemnly made you stop and stay very silent. Rampaging through the trees is a herd of elephants. So now's not the time to claim that the trail is yours. Later you continue the walk, feasting your eyes on the land, as well as impala, springbok, oryx, and giraffe. The guide was wise. He picked up on the leopard clues and respected who rules this landscape. That's why the walk weaved into the safe places of Ongava."

Slide back down the world’s highest sand dune on a sandboard, trying to carve a diagonal path down the sand. Anyone with snowboarding experience will immediately notice the similarities, however, sandboarding also provides great rewards for the first-timers. Sand makes for soft landings, helping to increase confidence and keep everyone safe. Board down to the bottom of the dune, then jump on the waiting ATV to go back up again.

Halfway between Damaraland and Etosha, Palmwag Concession provides a thrilling introduction to an African safari. Joining the elephants in wandering through this arid landscape are endangered Black rhino and a stealthy abundance of predators. First game drives are often overwhelming, the succession of sights leaving a whole family in dazed bewilderment. After seeking out the elephants turn your focus to the rhinos, meandering past zebra and kudu as you look for some of the rarest mammals on the planet. Giraffe stick their necks up and say hello, springbok herds litter the landscape, and then a spotted hyena excites everyone further. The children struggle to contain their excited chatter, but they’re going to have to when two Black rhinos emerge from behind the palms. Horns immediately bring hush, majestic evocations of the rhinos’ power and grace. It’s a mother and calf, sticking close to each other as they approach your camera.

Keeping children occupied is always easy when the safari is available directly from the balcony. Zebra, giraffe, oryx, and even elephants come to drink besides your accommodation, nature’s great just footsteps away. Game drives wind into the forest, everyone looking out for leopards in the trees. Unambiguous eyes defy their camouflage, and then a sweeping tail reveals a predator lounging on a high branch. The forest is unpredictable and intimate, the canopy of greenery reducing visibility and ensuring that most wildlife doesn’t see you coming. Turn a corner and a giraffe towers above the safari truck. Two minutes later and it’s a hartebeest herd that grazes within touching distance. What animals do your children most want to see? Which wildlife most fascinates them? Each game drive can be tailored to have a particular purpose; like searching for lion prides or close encounters with rhinos. Out around the Etosha salt pans it’s much easier to spot the wild game. As you drive around the edge of a white blanket everyone shouts out the sights, from elephant herds following the dust swirls to zebra stripes galloping across the crusted salt. Now the vast scale begins to impress, grasslands and savannah filled with big cats and their prey. Over three days you soak up a variety of habitats, each game drive bringing dozens of new mammals to tick off the list. It’s often the predators that most excite and enchant; lion prides laze beneath broad branches and then casually walk off through the grass. Where are they going? Perhaps on a hunt? Silence descends as you follow their paw prints, the cute cubs keeping pace with the glorious mane of the alpha male. They head to the waterhole, scattering the ungulates with effortless ease. On another day they could have been heading out for dinner."

Other people do roam within this unadulterated wilderness, maintaining a lifestyle that’s been passed down from their ancestors. Isolated San Bushmen communities enjoy the space and freedom, their traditional practices relatively unscathed from modern development. Meeting a tribe is a humbling experience for all the family, the huge disparity in culture helping to bring a fresh perspective on life. After the drive to Grootfontein, an experienced local guide takes you to the village, this first encounter a chance to say hello and glimpse how life is lived in this remote part of the world. Day 12 is much more in-depth. The spoken communication barrier rarely prevents children from making new friends; there’s a fascination from both sides and it generally blossoms into intimate tribal encounters for your children. Hunter-gatherer San Bushmen open up their homes to your family and they reveal bush survival through profound evocations of their culture. Each local plant has a use, from medicinal potions to building huts. Every journey has a purpose, exemplified by the hunters as they follow the wild game and aim to return with a meal. Learn the basics of game tracking; the bushland is packed with infinitesimal clues that escape the untrained eye. Homemade bow and arrows are their weapons and you can all take a rudimentary archery lesson. With a local guide as a translator you start to build a profound understanding of unique customs and culture, everything from local cuisine to how to wear a traditional loincloth. Few experiences are as powerful in elucidating how other cultures live."

        "description": "After a hearty Namibian breakfast, a driver will take you to the airport for your flight to Ongava. During the flight, you will find yourself captivated by the landscape below- not only by its stark, grand beauty and enormous scale, but by how unpopulated it is. There is almost no sign of human activity down there! Arriving at your first safari lodge, you will find an intimate and luxurious haven perched on a hillside overlooking a waterhole with stunning scenery beyond. Using wood, stone and thatch as construction materials, the lodge all but disappears into its surroundings, while the interiors are an intriguing blend of African artifacts and modern amenities. Your suite, one of only three, is elegantly designed and beautifully appointed, with large glass picture windows framing a picturesque view of the wooded hills. Outside, a porch leads to a private plunge pool perfect for lazing in on warm afternoons. Once you have settled in, return to the main building for a delightful high tea spread and to meet your guide for the afternoon’s activity. Set in the private Ongava reserve outside of the Etosha National Park, you are able to experience a wide variety of big game in relative exclusivity on your game drives. These woodlands and hills are home to lions and both black and white rhinoceros, as well as elephants and a multitude of antelope. The Black-faced Impala is an endemic species of ungulate that is only found here, as well as Hartlaub’s Spurfowl. After an exciting afternoon exploring the area, your guide will select a scenic spot for you to stretch your legs while he prepares a sundowner hamper, loaded with ice cold drinks and snacks. As the sun dips into the horizon creating a spectacular display of color, you raise your glass and toast your first day in the wilds of Namibia. When you return to the lodge in the evening, floodlights light up the waterhole below you, allowing you a bird’s-eye view of the animal activity while enjoying a sumptuous three course meal, accompanied by delectable South African wines."

        "description": "A knock on your door in the early morning wakens you with a freshly brewed cup of coffee. As dawn creeps over the land you enjoy a quick breakfast and then climb aboard your vehicle for the drive into Etosha National Park. This reserve covers the vast Etosha Pan, which is a saline depression covering thousands of square kilometers. Grasslands and acacia scrub provide the majority of the vegetation, and this region relies on annual rainfall to stimulate life to exist. When the rains replenish the water in the pans, it transforms the landscape, and for a few brief weeks it attracts thousands of flamingoes, that turn the shores of the shallow depressions pink with their feathers. In the dry season, waterholes become the focal point for wildlife, and a great many species can be observed coming and going within a few hours. This activity is not without danger for the animals, however. Scan the area and look below the low thorn trees for lurking lions waiting for the unwary. Elephants are the masters of the waterholes. All the other animals give way to their huge bulk and thirsty appetites when they appear at the water’s edge. Coated in a film of white dust from the pans, they appear as ghostly representations of themselves in this otherworldly landscape of shimmering heat and mirages. Returning to the lodge for a welcoming and hearty lunch, you spend the warm hours in the middle of the day relaxing at your pool with a chilled drink, occasionally looking down at the waterhole to check for any newcomers in the constant parade of thirsty wildlife below you. In the late afternoon, the wilderness beckons to you once more, and you feel compelled to answer. Choose to join either another game drive, or for something completely different, join a guide for a rhino-tracking walk. Experience the thrill of being on foot in the African bush, where you silently tread along game paths, with senses on high alert as you follow the tracks of these enormous animals through the wild. The terrain might give you clues as to where the rhino’s path may lead, and your guide will expertly use all of his vast knowledge and bush skills to locate the animals. Using the wind as an ally along with acute vision, instinct, sounds and even smell, the reward of finding your quarry is immensely satisfying. Crouched quietly in the closest safe position to see the rhino, you can only be overcome with awe and admiration for the size and beauty of this prehistoric-looking creature grazing peacefully just meters from you. Upon your return to the lodge in the evening, you will have a feeling of wonder, of accomplishment, and a sensation of having experienced a part of Africa’s wildlife that few have seen before. The excitement will remain with you, adding a sparkle to the stars above, heartiness to your appetite and a general feeling of well being as you later slip between your sheets, listening to the roars and growls of primal Africa echoing across the hills outside."

        "description": "After your morning’s activity, you enjoy a delicious brunch before departing for the airstrip. The flight takes you southwest to the Torra Conservancy, where your next camp is located. Set in a landscape of epic grandeur at the foot of the Etendeka Mountains and close to the Huab River Valley, the camp is a model of sustainability, environmental sensitivity and community engagement. Constructed of thatch, wood, canvas and adobe, the lodge is both stylish and comfortable, but also has minimal environmental impact; everything is removable to leave as little trace as possible. A large main building houses a lounge, bar and dining area with a pool terrace to one side. The guest suites are spread out from here along a small ridge to enhance the stunning views. Here the emphasis is less on big game, although there are desert-adapted elephants to be found along the Huab River watercourse, which is often dry, but can fill up dramatically following a period of rain in its catchment area. These enigmatic animals eke out a living in this sparse terrain, using techniques learned over generations to ensure their survival. What is amazing about this camp is the scale of the landscape, the colors of the geological formations that surround you, the strange life forms that exist only here in this incredibly harsh environment, and of course the night skies that are filled with countless galaxies, seeming close enough for you to touch. Whether you spend your days walking in the Etendeka Mountains, tracking the elephants in the Huab Valley, admiring the bizarre vegetation such as the Welwitschia plant, or going in search of rock art sites at nearby Twyfelfontein, your camp will deliver incredible experiences in a landscape unlike any you have ever seen. The warmth and hospitality of your Namibian hosts here will be a perfect counterpoint for the marvels of your encounters in the wilderness. Coupled with superb service and excellent cuisine, your time here will be nothing short of delightful."

        "description": "After breakfast on your last morning, depart Swakopmund by light aircraft and fly south to Sossusvlei. The landscape passing below you is one of indescribable beauty and grandeur: huge rocky mountains in every color imaginable, ancient valleys and watercourses, and to the west, the sinuous, rolling shapes of the Namib dunes marching towards the sea. Your guide meets you at the airstrip and takes you on the short drive through the private Kulala Wilderness Reserve to your next safari lodge. Using the surrounding desert as an inspiration, the lodge blends into the environment perfectly. A thatched main building is reminiscent of acacia trees and weavers’ nests, and the adobe style walls of the guest units make them seem a part of the landscape. Your climate-controlled suite has huge windows facing out over a landscape of gnarled trees, gravel plains and rearing mountains in the distance- a vision of stark, haunting beauty. The private front deck features a plunge pool, and the roof has an open-air sleeping platform, perfect to take in the dazzling array of stars at night. Daily activities include early morning rides to the dunes of Sossusvlei, where the lodge has the advantage of a private access gate into the reserve. This massive clay pan is dotted with dead trees and has enormous dunes looming over it. In the early light, the dunes take on a reddish tone, in contrast with the cobalt blue of the sky and the dark shadows cast by the rising sun- a photographers dream. Nature drives and walks in the Kulala Wilderness Reserve reveal a remarkable variety of life that exists here, sustained by the moisture from a coastal fog bank that drifts inland almost every day. Burrowing below the surface, and emerging at night when the temperatures are cooler, insects, reptiles, rodents and small mammals are adapted to survive. Larger animals include oryx, springbok antelope, and ostrich, while predators include jackals, bat-eared fox and the enigmatic brown hyena, which with its striped legs, dog-like face and shaggy coat make it appear to be made of several different animals put together. For the ultimate bird’s-eye view of this stunning landscape, there is no better way to experience it than by hot air balloon. You silently drift over the rocky outcrops, plains and dunes like an eagle, with nothing but the whisper of the desert wind in your hair. A champagne breakfast at your landing site adds an extra level of fizz to an already effervescent experience! In the evenings, the camp’s specialty is to serve you a magnificent dinner outdoors, below an equally magnificent chandelier of stars. The clear desert air and the utter lack of ambient light make for a dazzling display as you enjoy a sumptuous meal below the glittering Milky Way. Lying out on your rooftop sleeping platform, the stars hover over you, and the silence of the landscape is only broken by the sound of a barking gecko somewhere in the vastness of this incredible space."

        "description": "Anticipation accompanies your first journey into the wilderness, Windhoek quickly rescinding into the distance and the stark mountains of Damaraland coming into focus. In less than two hours you’ve been propelled into a seemingly desolate hinterland, the rocks shimmering through a vibrant collection of yellows and reds. There are few trails here, the land marked by occasional vehicle tracks and elephant footprints. Yet this landscape has been inhabited for many millennia, the evocative proof provided by ancient rock paintings around Twylfelfontein. Stories are narrated with scratched lines, telling of successful hunts and passing messages down to the next arriving nomadic tribe. Options for exploration are endless in Damaraland, and the afternoon will be tailored to your interests. Dozens of hiking trails are only shared with antelope herds; mountain biking and rock climbing can be arranged, and you’ve never far away from a peculiar rock formation and a glorious aerial view onto the Namibian wilderness. A feeling of insignificance accompanies tonight’s camp, vast valleys and mountains towering down on a small piece of paradise in the middle of nowhere. Occasionally an elephant or giraffe wander beneath the moonlight, an accompaniment to your dinner beneath the stars. Throughout this itinerary you only get the good parts of camping. The mobile camps are prepared, ensuring you don’t lose any relaxing time having to mess about with poles and pegs. And this isn’t camping in its strictest sense. Raised beds provide an idyllic night’s sleep, western toilets and hot bucket showers have been erected, and your guide cooks up a sumptuous feast. It’s hard to get any more comfortable in the midst of such breathtaking wilderness."

Sunrise light is always captivating in Namibia, the rocks slowly rising from the shadows and bringing a yellow glow to the landscape. Don’t worry about packing up (that’s all taken care of), just enjoy your cooked breakfast and get ready to hit the road. It’s not always a road today, a few off road stretches keeping you firmly in the heart of African nowhere. Despite the seeming desolation (casually roaming wildlife aside), the Himba people have skillfully forged an existence here and today provides an intimate experience with a welcoming indigenous tribe. At first it’s all about the sights. You admire the strange hairstyles and elaborate headdresses, take in the tribal clothes, and wonder why everyone is covered in a strange dull red paint. It’s a mixture of butterfat and ochre, which sounds bizarre on paper. Yet today isn’t about snapping a few photos and moving on. It’s an unobtrusive encounter with these rare semi-nomadic herders. There will be some verbal communication barrier, although that rarely prevents you from having conversations and making friends; the Himba are experts in gestures and smiles and you'll learn that this paint is sunscreen, skin care product, and mosquito repellent, all rolled in to one. There are no time limits, so soak up the experience, learn about their culture, and whenever you’re ready, a new mobile Damaraland camp offers a spectacular sunset and another tranquil evening listening to nature’s soundtrack."

        "title": "Palmwag Concession - Tracking Rhinos and Elephants",
        "description": "Namibia contains a number of riddles. Here’s the first you’re trying to decipher. How can the landscape look different from every angle, yet always look the same at a single glance? Another one is even more confusing. Why does the abundance of wildlife increase the further into the wilderness you go? By the time you reach Palmwag Concession you’re surrounded by hundreds of miles of desert. Yet an indelible soundtrack flickers through the palm trees and you’re wondering who is being so raucous in such a remote place. Strange trumpets indicate elephants, startled cries suggest predators on the prowl, and a distant lion roar is not an uncommon sound throughout the evening. Palmwag is the quintessential desert oasis, the sprouting waterholes attracting an outstanding collection of four legged nomads. Game drives weave through the palm trees and seek out the desert dwellers. Plodding across the dusty ground a melancholy old elephant bull goes in search of water, his immense horns indicative of old age and a lost position in the herd. He looks lonely, yet even now there’s a wonderful sense of elegance about the pachyderm. A whole herd controls a waterhole, the new alpha male controlling the drinking rights and allowing the youngsters to try out water wrestling. Few will challenge an elephant herd, the surrounding plains sporadically dotted with antelope waiting their turn, including the majestic horned hartebeest. There’s an inherent unpredictability to these two safari days. Desert oases rarely have permanent residents, they’re generally places where wildlife stocks up and moves on. It’s a popular haunt for a full range of Africa’s great mammals and they won’t be shy about checking out your tent. Now you’re really camping in untamed Africa, eating dinner beneath the stars and trying to predict who is responsible for the rustling nearby. A crackling camp fire provides warmth and keeps the big cats away (Namibian bush survival that you’ve already picked up from the Himba), and your experienced guide uses local knowledge to select the camp spot. For example, if a leopard has been recently seen in the vicinity, your guide will choose to move to a fresh location. Moonlit silhouettes provide plenty of enchantment, as does waking up and deciphering who is responsible for the nearby prints. Another dose of drama and charm is provided by Palmweg’s most endangered desert dweller. Hush descends as you spot one emerging along the horizon. Keep still. Stay silent. Now a second Black rhino comes into view. And they’re walking your way, horns pointing with effortless grace, great gray frames contrasting the rich green palms. Only a few thousand remain on the planet, so pinch yourself briefly…yes, this experience is real. It seems that they’ve come a long way to avoid the poachers. So sit back and take in this inimitable and inspiring encounter, the details of which will be recalled for years to come."

        "description": "Namibia is one of the countries that refuse to let a single memory settle. It’s iconic scene after iconic scene, the memories building on each other until they blur into a phantasmal mass of safari bliss. Photos help rekindle the details - “aha, of course, we saw those lions just after the those two baby giraffe…” Etosha keeps elevating the big game experience, the country’s most abundant national park very much bringing the safari to you. There’s a slight change in the accommodation for the next two days, your base being the fixed luxury tents at your next stop. An encompassing impression of serenity still exudes from this camp, located in the restricted western side of Etosha. Very few other tourists come here and the wildlife interaction hasn’t been adulterated by safari tourism. After four days of mobile camping, the fixed camp provides some additional features. Massage showers are the stand-out feature of elegant en-suite bathrooms, raised wooden decks give you a prime view onto Etosha, and the sumptuous interiors make this camp more like an opulent lodge than a tent. However, as always, the canvas tents ensure you are fully immersed in nature. So get ready for another night of listening to the lions roar at bedtime. Dinner is served beneath the stars, the floodlit waterholes bringing safari action to the dining table. Game drives in Etosha provide some of Africa’s most intimate safari experiences. There’s a sublime feeling of the wild as you cruise around the waterholes, the focus inevitably towards the predators. Follow a lion pride as they wander for a drink, the healthy collection of cubs indicative of Etosha’s rich feeding menu. They seem preoccupied with the water, but look carefully and you’ll see that a lion is always alert, one eye ever open for an opportunist hunt. By closing this side of the park off to most tourists, the park authorities have helped preserve the authenticity, as well as ensuring this is very much a personal encounter in Namibia’s most popular national park. Lions aren’t the only ones with salivating jaws around here. Hidden in the woodland you’ll find leopards, the clandestine hunter the most elusive to find, yet definitely discoverable with two days to explore. Spotted hyenas are far more abundant, their scavenging rambling an integral part of the landscape. Cheetahs also excite and enthrall, standing proudly on rocks and considering which way to turn. Of course they wouldn’t all be here if the antelopes and zebras weren’t covering the savannah. Etosha is a haven for over 100 different mammal species, so expect a merry-go-round of the alternative and peculiar."

        "description": "Etosha is a big fan of surprises. By now there are certain sights that blend into the landscape, incredible wildlife that becomes as much a part of the scenery as the waterhole or rocky outcrop. Today’s drive unveils a dramatic impression of scale and diversity, taking you from west to east across Etosha and weaving through an eclectic selection of ecosystems. Start in the forest, and then cruise across the epic floodplains, feeding your senses on the small and peculiar. Tiny little dik dik skip around in the grass, black-faced impala provide endearing photo opportunities, then some raucous calling alerts you to the treetops where birds flutter and sing. Follow their wings as they head to the swamps and waterholes, some 300 species of bird guiding you towards more unique delights, like the wonderfully strange fringe-eared oryx. Etosha’s heart is its salt pan, a huge crusted expanse of white that leaves a mirage along the horizon. For a couple of wet season months it's flooded and filled with flamingos, but for the rest it’s shriveled and rugged. It seems abandoned, the dust swirling and floating away like dry tumbleweed. Then a shape ignites the imagination. A distant image begins to emerge from the white blur, waddling your way but far in the distance. What is it? Buffalo? Elephant? It’s getting closer, step, step, step, and could it be? It’s a rhino! The horn points skyward and the hooked lip reveal that this is another of the critically endangered Black variety. There are two of them, tiny eyes and opened nostrils leading a marvelous body of power and grace. Keep cruising along, heading past the center point of the park and leaving the salt pan behind. It’s the complete safari drive, joining together Etosha’s disparate ecosystems and watching the wildlife subtly change every couple of hours. Stop for lunch besides a small group of white rhinos, and then continue to the far western reaches of Etosha. While this drive takes the full day, it’s never tiring. This is a nonstop game drive through forest, grassland, salt pan, and now to the secluded savannah of your safari camp. This final camp exudes charm, the raised tents harmoniously blending into the environment and acting as magnets to bring final endearing safari moments."

        "description": "Head off into the Namibian wilderness, straight sealed roads cutting past snaking mountain chains and a chameleonic landscape of reds and yellows. It’s around 350 kilometers to Okonjima and this self-drive itinerary allows you set your own pace. Gradually you ascend towards the Central Highlands, passing the odd collection of antelopes and melancholy elephant bulls. These glimpses hint at the life that patrols the rugged hinterland, evocative sights that flicker past the window on your first day of driving through Namibia. Okonjima intensifies these impressions, serving up a palpable atmosphere of big cats and thirsty ungulates. You don’t need to look far, they all seem to congregate around your luxury bush suite, elegantly sipping from the waterhole and always keeping an ear out for stealthy paws. Spotted cats dominate the Okonjima landscape and skilled local guides know how to betray their camouflage. On a guided game drive you slowly explore the forest, ever alert for signs of Africa’s most elusive predator. A tail swings, and then a pair of eyes shines like lucid moonlight through the trees. Focus the binoculars and a dazzling exterior of fur comes to attention. But there’s much more. Wait and stay silent, following the four paws as they move towards the safari vehicle before dipping into the undergrowth and heading out to hunt. You’re at the home of the AfriCat Foundation, a successful rehabilitation project that has been helping to grow wild leopard and cheetah numbers in this part of Africa. A visit to the project is much more than just being educational, it offers close quarter moments with these majestic cats. Like each destination on this itinerary, the safari experience blends thrills with a liberal coating of tranquility and quietude. Even when you’re feasting your eyes on two speedy predators there’s something indelibly serene about being on safari."

        "title": "Etosha National Park - Spectacular Safari Experiences",
        "description": "Journey north and the safari experience intensifies, Etosha National Park bringing together a surreal abundance of African wildlife. Gaping salt pans provide the theatrical stage, glimmering white and swirling with dust as they crack beneath the sun. Gaze across them to spot the wandering nomads; elephant herds leave immense footprints in the salt, giraffe rise above the ethereal mirage, while zebras bring shocks of black to the scene. Dotted around the salt pan you’ll find savannah and grasslands. Head further afield and the woodland dominates the landscape, another unique ecosystem which helps Etosha support over 100 different mammal species. Your safari camp is indelibly located in the eastern fringes of the park, nestled on popular migration routes and surrounded by flourishing savannah. Like all great safaris, the action starts from your private verandah, everything from kudu to hyenas likely to skip past at some point in these three days. You can choose to self-drive through Etosha National Park, excellent signposts providing a leisurely day of private adventure. It’s also recommended to take guided game drives with the local experts. Sometimes the guide stops and you can’t work out why. You look around. Nothing. You grab the binoculars and still you can't see anything. Then something moves in the nearby grass. Another flicker and it’s only now that you see it. Just 15 meters away, a whole lion pride has been resting beneath the grass line. Now it’s obvious, the cubs slumbered on each other and the lionesses yawning to reveal rapacious teeth. Back at camp, you will dine beneath the stars, telltale silhouettes crossing the horizon and nature’s inimitable soundtrack providing a calm accompaniment. Your luxury suite is raised on stilts above the savannah, with a wonderfully appointed en-suite bathroom and spacious interior providing additional charm. A memorable resonance reminds you of your location in big cat country, and then you open the curtains for glorious panoramas of untamed Africa and its eclectic four legged characters. Three days ensure you can take things slow and leisurely, exploring each distinct area of Etosha and stopping to indulge in every inimitable scene; black-faced impala and oryx covering the salt pan, majestic lions causing the antelopes to scatter, baby elephants swinging their trunks like new toys, and vibrant birds that flutter down from the treetops. And just when you think Etosha can’t offer anything else, a pair of endangered Black rhino gently meanders past and leaves you in bewilderment."

        "description": "Omnipresent desert impressions will have filled the last six days, Namibia’s arid land always delivering shocks of color and benign beauty. You’ll have grown accustomed to a set of rouge colors, but that begins to change as you reach the Caprivi Strip. Famous rivers rumble across the land here, bringing blues and greens and lots of elephants. The pachyderm road signs aren’t merely there to excite tourists. Elephants crossing the road are a genuine occurrence in this part of Namibia. You’ll see them beside the road, crashing a way into the forest. Don’t worry though, an elephant isn’t going to step out in front of your vehicle and the authorities have built flat run off areas to increase visibility and prevent any collisions. However, it’s advisable to avoid driving in the dark. Watch the scenery change as you drive east from Etosha to the Caprivi Strip. Arrive by mid-afternoon and spend a few hours at Popa Falls, the enchanting spot where rocks divert the Okavango River into a veiled cascade of water. Today is your longest day of driving so tonight offers an idyllic antidote: sunset over the Okavango from your river lodge. Gaze across the river to Angola and watch the floodplains slowly turn to shadows, then wait for the portentous snorts of hippos to grace the still evening air."

        "description": "Once you’ve reached Caprivi, there will be a half dozen reserves and parks within astonishingly close proximity. This whole area is part of the unfenced Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area, the largest of its kind in Africa. Most people are aware of the great wildebeest migration in the Serengeti. Kavango-Zambezi is equally as impressive; up to a million mammals cross the lush plains and migrate between four different countries. Self-drive through Mudumu National Park; a herd of bushy haired buffalo complete your collection of the Big Five. Springbok, kudu, oryx, impala, dik dik, hartebeest…the impressive assortment of antelopes indicate the fertility of the land. And by now you’ll have learnt that wherever there are four hooves there are usually four paws. So make sure you check what’s lurking in the grass. Adding an extra dimension to the experience is the opportunity to spend an afternoon in a nearby village meeting the locals and visiting a rural bush school. Visitors are always enthusiastically welcomed with waves and smiles, dozens of children competing for your attention. While the village and school are undeniably simple, the people have a determination and honesty that lingers long in the memory. Again, two days provide ample time to continue this vacation at a serene pace, with the your next lodge elevating the serenity. Snuggled on the Kwando River, this one has been enchanting visitors for over 25 years."

        "description": "The Okavango and Kwando rivers provide an exemplary route map for elephants. The world’s largest wild elephant population circles through this area, over 100,000 individuals gobbling up the riverine forests and bringing their antics to the Caprivi. Flanking Bwabwatu National Park, these two unruffled rivers channel elephant herds into a narrow migratory passage; you just need to enter Bwabwatu and watch them wander past. There’s one, there are another two; turn around and there are half a dozen more. And we’re not talking about spotting elephants here; we’re talking about spotting elephant herds. It’s arguably Namibia’s most idyllic safari, virtually no driving required for a sudden immersion in pachyderm heaven. Once again you have a glorious riverside location, the sumptuous next property completing the feeling of being alone with nature. Another Bwabwatu favorite doesn’t sound happy at your elephant adoration. Loud grunts emanate from the river, boisterous hippos grabbing the attention with cacophonous calls. While the elephants roam on land, the hippos spend their days in the water, fighting over wading space like unruly teenagers. Occasionally one pops up and charges onto land, devouring a midday snack of grass before thumping a trail back into the river. From the land they look impressive. Yet they grow in size and stature when admired from water level. An evocative boat safari slowly takes you past the different hippo pods, allowing close quarters admiration of these remarkably charming beasts. Because as much as they snort and shout, hippos have a prodigious captivation that captures almost every heart."

        "description": "After the Okavango and the Kwando comes the Zambezi, another of Africa’s remarkable rivers. Cutting a great scar across the land it hurtles towards Victoria Falls, the water accelerating before thundering down into an over 100 meter deep chasm. Every single second an average of 1000 tons of water drops over the edge. Can you imagine the noise that makes? Even from your lodge the waterfall’s roar leaves an impression. Just upstream from the falls, this elegant retreat offers a luxuriant final stop on this handcrafted itinerary. You’ll have crossed the border into Zambia, leaving your vehicle with a representative in Namibia and being picked up by a local Zambian guide. Although Victoria Falls is in a new country, it’s less than an hour from the border, so you still won’t have any long drives to negotiate. Victoria Falls deserves a few days of your time. Even after you’ve spent a morning admiring all the different angles, you’ll still want to return in the afternoon for more impressions of beauty and power. Mist rises from the abyss, often sailing above the falls and raining down like spectacular cataracts. Bridges and walkways run alongside the falls, each few meters bringing an alternative vista. For the ultimate all-encompassing angle take a helicopter ride above the Zambezi, admiring how the river scars the landscape and then plunders into this epic valley. Zambia has a couple of excellent nearby national parks for active visitors wanting another safari. It also has Namibia’s laid-back atmosphere, so it’s easy to laze away the hours in riverside bliss."

        "description": "After a delightful Namibian breakfast, you board your vehicle and depart for the south. The road leads you through a landscape that is as grand as it is awe-inspiring; the sheer scale of the jagged peaks, rocky outcrops and gravel plains beggar belief, as does the utter lack of any sign of human activity. Namibia is a country roughly the size of France, with a population of only two million people. The road leads you closer and closer to the huge red dunes of the Namib Desert, and skirting them to the east, you arrive at Kulala Desert Lodge, overlooking a riverbed with a stunning view of the dunes in the near distance. After a delicious lunch, you settle into your thatched adobe and canvas suite, which also boasts an open air sleeping platform on the roof should you wish to sleep out under the stars, which is highly recommended. The absolute lack of any ambient light at night makes the Milky Way appear close enough to touch in the clear desert air. You spend the afternoon exploring the Kulala Wilderness Reserve with your guide, either by quad bike or in a game drive vehicle, discovering more about the fascinating geology and ecology of this region. The plants and animals have adopted some incredible survival strategies here, where the only source of moisture, sometimes for years, is the coastal fog that drifts for miles inland from the Atlantic Ocean. Scimitar-horned oryx stand on the high edges of dunes like sentinels, catching the air currents drifting across the sands to keep them cool. Ostrich and springbok shimmer in the heat haze, dancing across the horizon, and below the surface of the sands lie an entire world of burrowing creatures both large and small. As the sun begins to sink into the horizon, you stop at a viewpoint to take in the scene, enjoy an ice cold drink and nibble on a snack. At this hour the magic of the desert reveals itself: when the rocky mountains change color from browns to purples, the dunes glow red, and a golden light catches the glittering quartz crystals on the gravel plains. You stand bewitched by this incredible sight, sipping on your favorite beverage until the stars begin to emerge in the sky above. Returning to the lodge, you find it aglow in the light of lanterns, and a welcoming campfire draws you nearer. A delectable dinner awaits you, and afterwards you find yourself sitting back at the campfire, gazing upwards at the translucent stars and galaxies that seem to be hanging just above your head."

Kulala has a private gate into the reserve, ensuring you arrive at Dead Vlei as the sun rises, creating an extraordinary spectacle. This huge, flat clay pan is dotted with gnarled acacia trees and surrounded by towering dunes that flush red in the morning light. The azure sky coupled with deep razor-edged shadows make this a photographer’s delight. If you are feeling energetic, the climb up the dunes is worth the effort to see the endless sea of sand dunes marching relentlessly towards the ocean in a series of crescents and curves. As the day warms up you return to the lodge for a welcome brunch on the shady terrace before a refreshing dip in the pool. As the day cools off, the need to explore returns and your guide takes you for a quad bike ride into the Kulala Wilderness Reserve. There can’t be much more fun than zooming through a vast wilderness of sand dunes and gravel plains as you keep a lookout for springbok and ostriches, and the sight of an oryx standing regally on the edge of a high dune. As the sun lowers to the horizon, the landscape magically begins to change color; tans and whites become tinged with deep purple, reds and mauve, and this is the ideal time to stop, shake off the dust, and enjoy an ice-cold sundowner drink while taking in the splendid view. You return to the lodge in the dusk, ready to enjoy a delicious dinner by candlelight below a glittering canopy of stars."

You drift silently like a bird of prey over the landscape, soaking up the panorama of truly epic proportions: jagged mountains to the east, and an endless parade of dunes to the west. Touching down on the red sands, a champagne breakfast awaits you, the effervescent bubbles reminding you of the dizzy heights from where you have descended. Bidding Kulala farewell, you board your vehicle and set off across the desert towards Swakopmund. This barren landscape has a haunting beauty, made even more enigmatic by chance sightings of antelope and ostriches shimmering in the heat haze. You arrive at the coast near Walvis Bay, and follow it north to Swakopmund, arriving in the afternoon.

This remote and inhospitable shore received its name from the many shipwrecks along the coast, where treacherous currents, fog and rocks claimed their victims. Once ashore, the survivors faced an even more desperate fate: that of starvation and thirst, lost in the desert with scant hope of rescue. You will encounter the skeletal frames of ships looming from the sand and whale bones littered on the shore, giving a palpable sense of eeriness to the area. Turning inland, you follow the road into the rugged terrain of Damaraland, which passes the rugged massif of the Brandberg (Burnt Mountain) and the Petrified Forest before reaching Twyfelfontein, Namibia’s first World Heritage Site and the scene of ancient petroglyphs carved into the rock by San Bushmen thousands of years ago. Arriving at your mountain camp, you barely discern it is there until you are almost on top of it. Dwarfed by huge boulders, the rounded thatch roofs of the buildings appear as a part of this incredibly dramatic landscape. Heading up to a scenic viewpoint for a sundowner, you gaze out over a series of rocky hills and plains that seem like another planet, turning red and mauve in the soft light of the setting sun."

This is desert rhino and elephant habitat, and it may surprise you that such large animals can survive in such an unforgiving landscape. In the afternoon you arrive at your next lodge set on the ridge of the Klip River canyon, boasting incredible views along the valley. The first lodge in Namibia to be entirely staffed and owned by the local community, the lodge is a model for the sustainability of tourism and conservation in Africa for its inhabitants. After you have settled into your suite, there is time for you to join the afternoon game drive down the Klip River valley. This watercourse is a haven for a great variety of animals, and springbok, zebra, oryx and kudu are always to be seen, as well as the diminutive klipspringer, an antelope adapted to clambering sheer rock walls on tiny hooves. Lion, elephant and rhino are also occasionally seen, adding a frisson of excitement to your drive."

Today you will be heading out on a tracking expedition in search of the area’s famed rhinos or desert elephants. Together with your guide and team of scouts, you drive the rocky and rugged terrain in search of spoor, combing this massive region, looking for any sign of your quarry. Once a spoor is located, you disembark and set off on foot in search of these elusive animals. Walking through the rocky hills with expert trackers showing you their skills, you gain a new respect for the supreme ability of these men as they interpret the tiniest signs: a scrape mark on a rock, a shifted pebble, a bent twig, all are signs of the passage of the animals you seek. With eagle eyes sweeping the landscape ahead, they finally locate the rhino, resting in the shade of a euphorbia tree some distance away. Looking just as red and rugged as the rocks around it, you are filled with wonder at the skills they have demonstrated to get this far, and also filled with excitement at encountering such a rare and endangered animal in its natural habitat. After enjoying a picnic lunch in the welcoming shade of a tree, you begin the journey back to the lodge, filled with elation at the experience you have just had. In the late afternoon, you set off to visit a nearby Himba village. One of the last truly free tribes in the world, these semi-nomadic people are herders of cattle and goats, moving seasonally to find pastures for their herds. The women rub their bodies and braids with ochre, giving them a coppery sheen, which when combined with the elaborate hairstyles and jewelry they wear makes them appear statuesque and magnificent. You are welcomed into their conical homes made of palm thatch, mud and cow dung, and learn of their intriguing way of life so different from our own."

Constructed of local stone and wood, the buildings appear as part of the hillside, with only their thatched roofs visible from a short distance away. Your air-conditioned suite is elegantly appointed, with an inviting outside veranda and large windows to maximize the views. Once you have settled in, it is time to visit the lounge for a delightful English high tea before you set off to explore the reserve. Created from former farms, the Ongava reserve encompasses thousands of acres of diverse habitat that in turn support a great variety of animals and birds. This is an important buffer area for the Etosha National Park, and here you can find most of the endemic species for which this region is famous: black-faced impala and Hartlaubs spurfowl, among others, along with a host of big game, including both Black and White rhino. Prides of lions prowl the woodlands in search of prey, leopards stalk the steep hillsides, and cheetahs favor the open plains, where their superior speed allows them free rein. When you return to the lodge in the evening, floodlights illuminate the waterhole, allowing you to observe the comings and goings below while enjoying a sumptuous meal featuring delightful cuisine."

        "description": "Today you depart Ongava and drive into and across Etosha National Park en route to Onguma. This vast area is a saline depression covering thousands of square kilometers, and is a vital haven for wildlife. Summer rainfall is the only source of water in this arid region and, for a few short months, the landscape is transformed by the arrival of thousands of flamingos that wade the immense shallow lakes in search of food. When the rains pass and Etosha begins to dry up once again, waterholes become a focal point of intense animal activity. It is possible to see a great many species come and go at the water’s edge within the space of a few hours; oryx, zebra, kudu, springbok, rhino and elephants all take their turn to slake their thirst, while lions gaze hungrily from the concealing shade of acacia bushes. Moving on, you drive across vast open plains, where even elephants are dwarfed by the immensity of the landscape that engulfs both you and them. Covered in white dust, they appear as a ghostly procession, marching along a route proscribed by the generations they have lived and learned to survive in this harsh, yet hauntingly beautiful landscape. You exit the park in the afternoon, and head into Onguma Reserve on the eastern border beyond Fisher’s Pan. Arriving at your tented camp, you will find an elegant haven of sophistication tucked away in an acacia grove, looking out over a waterhole. The lodge is constructed of stone, wood, thatch and canvas in keeping with its environment, while the interiors are a delightfully fresh and vibrant version of haute safari chic. Although you are in the middle of the wilderness, no effort has been spared to provide every modern comfort and convenience you might need. The main building houses a lounge, bar and dining room, and a rim-flow pool deck lies off to one side. The waterhole a few meters away often attracts thirsty animals, and it is a delight to simply sit comfortably and watch the passing parade with an ice cold drink in your hand. As the day draws to a close, allow yourself to drift into the peaceful serenity of the African bush; lost in contemplation, you listen to the evening chorus of the birds and the distant calling of a lion echoing across the landscape. In the evening, you indulge in the culinary skills of the chef, presented in a series of scrumptious courses each more delightful than the last. Sipping on a beautiful South African wine with the sounds of the night drifting in from beyond the circle of firelight, moments in Africa do not come better than this."

After a fresh coffee and a light breakfast, you set off into the wilderness to see what nature holds in store for you. Along with an armed guide, you take a safari walk into the reserve to capture the essence of this wild and extraordinary place. Being on foot in the bush is an experience that takes you to a level where you are at one with nature, no noisy vehicle, just the sound of your own footsteps as you follow ancient paths worn by the passage of hooves and paws over the vastness of time. The warm desert breeze drifts lazily through the thorn trees, carrying the scent of earth, sagebrush and dust; your hearing becomes sharper, attuned to every sound around you, and your vision picks out every detail of your surroundings. The sight of a giraffe from your new perspective throws everything into sharp relief; the colossal animal towers over you, giving you an inkling of our own small size and how you fit into the glorious mosaic of life. Your guide reveals the smaller aspects of the bush that you would normally miss from a vehicle: the tracks in the sand, the secret life of a termite mound, the myriad plants and their uses, from medicine to poison for a hunter’s arrow-tip. Return to the lodge invigorated and inspired, and with an appetite sharpened by the crisp desert air, you indulge in a delicious brunch on the terrace overlooking the waterhole. The warmth of the day tempts you to the swimming pool, and you enjoy a lazy afternoon watching the animals coming to drink at the water. On your final afternoon, you join the rhino research team as they demonstrate their data collection methods, camera traps and introduce you to the ways of the elusive and critically endangered Black rhino. You discover how to identify their dung, seek out their secret middens and run your hands over trees worn smooth by their hides. Encountering one of these animals in the wild is a remarkable experience; prehistoric in appearance and imposing in bulk, they move as lightly and nimbly as dancers through the thorny acacia thickets they favor. Return to the lodge as dusk falls and the sun lights up the dusty sky in otherworldly colors with the silhouettes of the acacias in sharp contrast. Sipping on an ice cold drink, you toast the magic of Namibia, and the extraordinary journey that has led you to this moment. After another delicious dinner, you slip between the sheets, listening to the lonely call of a jackal carrying through the night."

        "description": "Namibia is quick to unveil its inimitability, the capital city of Windhoek running at a wonderfully leisurely pace. Nothing in Namibia is hurried or impersonal. This is a land where there’s always time to say hello and start a conversation with strangers. At Windhoek International Airport you’ll be met by a representative and taken to your vehicle. This itinerary includes two options to explore Northern Namibia. Choose to self-drive or be driven by an experienced local driver. The excellent quality of Namibian roads comes as a surprise to most and there is virtually no other traffic on the road. However, road signs warning of crossing elephants indicate the sort of adventure you’re going to have. There will be some short sections on unsealed roads as well as a full day of rugged trails when you drive through Etosha. Namibians drive on the left and a choice of geared and automatic vehicles are available for self-driving. Or sit back and let someone else do the driving, leaving you free to ogle at the scenery. After getting comfortable in the vehicle you head into Windhoek and rest up in an idyllic boutique lodge that exudes tranquility."

These inexhaustible expanses of glimmering mountains provide two thrilling days of quintessential Namibia. Guided walks meander through outlandish rock formations, the weathered sandstone sculpted into peculiar shapes that litter the horizon. Sharing the trails are the odd antelope herd, a melancholy desert elephant searching for water, and the telltale towers of migrating giraffe. Nestled into this unfathomable environment is the Ugab Terrace Lodge, another charming accommodation full of coziness and serenity. Over these two days you choose the adventure, exploring Damaraland through a range of activities. Guided walks are tailored to your interests and fitness levels, the landscape holding hundreds of evocative possibilities. Mountain bike trails take you into valleys that rarely see human footprints. Choose to simply sit back on your balcony and admire the fluttering colors of Damaraland’s vibrant bird collection. Or get in the car and tour the wilderness in search of elephants, giraffe, and an assortment of those who travel on four legs."

        "title": "Damaraland - Intimate Encounters with the Himba People",
        "description": "The Western world has a tendency to visualize tribal Africa into one all-encompassing stereotype. Yet simplistic preconceptions can’t come close to portraying a continent with some 2000 different languages and almost as many ethnic groups. This itinerary offers a genuine opportunity to interact and experience two very different tribal groups. In recent centuries, tribal culture has been heavily diluted and lost in many parts of the continent. However, the Himba and San Bushmen of Northern Namibia continue a lifestyle that is relatively unchanged from their ancestors, and they’ve inhabited the land for many millennia. Drive further north into Damaraland and spend your first afternoon with the Himba people, semi-nomadic herders that greet you with an enthusiastic display of color. Earth-toned red paint covers many bodies, a natural mixture of butterfat and ochre with a multitude of purposed including sunscreen, skin cleanser, and mosquito repellent. Intriguing hair styles are the norm, deep red braids flowing down past traditional headdresses. This first meeting is relaxed and informal, allowing you to gently soak up a culture that couldn’t be further away from your own. It often takes a couple of hours to get used to how the Himba dress and interact. The desolateness of the landscape has played a huge role in the Himba maintaining their traditional lifestyle. This arid and scorched wilderness has enabled isolation from outside influences. On day five the experience is much more in-depth, offering an indelible immersion into their lifestyle and traditions. A local interpreter helps provide answers to all your questions, although it’s not often required as the Himba are well versed to communicating through gestures and expressions. Unless you own cattle, you’ll be considered poor by Himba standards, the local signifier of wealth indicative of their subsistence lifestyle. This is a non-intrusive experience so don’t expect every member of the tribe to stop their chores and smile for the camera. Relax and enjoy the low-key opportunity, taking time to say hello and learn about each aspect of their lifestyle."

        "title": "Etosha - Spectacular Big Game Safari",
        "description": "By now you’ll understand why Namibia remains so untamed. The land is dusty and dry, the evident lack of water dictating the lifestyle of Himba tribes and local wildlife. The scenic journeys hold a strange captivation; each moment offers a new panorama of scale and beauty, yet you struggle to describe why or how it’s different from the last. The aridity has also helped preserve Etosha as one of Africa’s most seductive national parks. Enter through the Anderson Gate and begin your safari adventure, weaving into the mopane woodland and shrieking with excitement as an elephant herd stands on the trail. They’ve torn down a huge swathe of trees and they’re not stopping the destruction, macho males bumping bums against trunks, and endearing babies swinging their trunks at branches. Note that you can choose between self-driving or being driven through Etosha by an experienced local guide. Emerge from the forest and the Etosha salt pans crackle beneath your eyes. A mirage of blurred white dominates the horizon, disguising the footprints that wander in the distance. For a couple of months this pan is flooded, and the Etosha residents enjoy their annual feast. Then it shrivels and bakes, forcing the wildlife to drink from a collection of waterholes. So there are no prizes for guessing where you’ll find the iconic safari scenes. Tour the waterholes, admiring the elegant antelopes as they bashfully drink. Hartebeest impress with their subtle colors, black-faced impala provide charm, while springbok and kudu skip away to find grazing land. It’s all so, well, picturesque. Yet a predatory presence always lurks nearby, lucid leopard eyes and lazy lion tails also inspecting the thirsty antelopes. A hyena scuttles past, bringing brief alarm in the sentry but failing to scatter the herds. Crisis averted? Not likely. Keep watching the waterhole and a dramatic interaction between carnivore and herbivore plays out, the voracious cats also benefiting from the lack of water in Etosha. It’s easy to spend hours admiring one water hole and that’s very much a part of the safari experience here. It’s not just a case of getting personal with the great African mammals; you’re continually watching the unique interactions. And it doesn’t stop when you’re back at the lodge. Suggestive silhouettes mark the horizon, lion roars interrupt your dinner beneath the stars, and there’s never a dull moment when you’re submerged in the wilds of Etosha."

Perhaps you can’t stop thinking about the sleepy lion pride you photographed from unforgettable proximity. Or the cheetah that accelerated with effortless grace. Yet you’re still just grasping the scale of Etosha. Its dwarfs some U.S states and it would take half a lifetime to see it all. Today’s cross-park drive helps brings some semblance of Etosha’s true size, taking you from the western edge and the Dolomite Camp to Halali in the heart of the park, and then onwards to the isolated eastern ranges. It’s the ultimate in scenic drives, so go slow and stop whenever and wherever you like. Watch as a critically endangered Black rhino decides to inhabit the trail with her small calf, or when a gang of spotted hyena follow the vultures’ circling and scavenge a meal in the bush. Take a picnic and spend two lazy hours at a waterhole, indulging in the delights that have arrived for a drink. If you're self-driving, the park gates are well signposted, so it’s easy to follow lions down a random trail and then find your way again. Nestled in the far east of the park, Mushara Outpost offers an idyllic final night of big game revelry, the intimate tented suites often engulfed by a gaggle of four legged locals."

        "title": "Grootfontein - Authentic Experiences with the San Bushmen",
        "description": "Black rhinos, lions, leopards, elephant herds; yesterday certainly wasn’t a time to get out of your vehicle and explore on foot. Yet the San Bushmen have been doing exactly that for some 40,000 years. Local knowledge is their secret, this hunter gathering tribe revealing an intimate understanding of wildlife behavior. Once again you have two days with a local tribe, with the first afternoon all about meeting and greeting. Admire the local dress and marvel at the difference in appearance between the Bushmen and the Himba. Take time to ask questions and engage with their culture, and don’t be surprised in their intrigue at your way of life. From Etosha you drive through Tsumeb to Grootfontein, a remote outpost that thrives with birdsong and ungulate herds. After an afternoon in the Bushmen village, you spend day 10 in the bush, learning first hand about their traditions. Walk into the landscape, local gesticulations helping impart knowledge about medicinal plants and bush survival. Tracking clues are everywhere, although they quickly escape the untrained eye. Claw marks can be instantaneously dated, upturned stones are as telltale as footprints, and the slightest of indentations suggests the path an antelope recently took. While you won’t go on a hunt with the San bushmen (unfortunately, an amateur’s presence will inhibit the tribal hunters), you will spend time practicing their ancient traditions. Learn how to make arrows, try your hand at Bushmen archery, and start to recognize how to follow a trail of infinitesimal clues. It’s not just the men that provide the captivating experiences; your time in the village also involves a genuine interaction with the women. Participate in a bush-style cooking class, all the wilds from the land cultivated into tasty snacks. Discover the meanings behind their jewelry and accessories, and use your expert guide to translate and enhance the experience. This is a version of Africa that many people dream of experiencing, yet almost nobody can accurately preconceive. You’re left with profound impressions, ones that help to dispel stereotypes and deconstruct previous notions of tribal life. In many ways the San Bushmen symbolize the beauty of Northern Namibia; genuine, untouched, and bursting with nuances."

        "description": "Few people land in Africa without dreams of big cats. Some are even surprised that lions don't patrol the airport runway. Catapulting you straight into safari action, you'll head north to Okonjima, one of the continent's most spectacular leopard hangouts. Every park or reserve has its specialties, and Okonjima's are the predators that usually prove to be most elusive. As the safari truck weaves through the grassland you spot a swishing tail, a captivating glimpse of a cat on a hunt. Wait. Be patient. Slowly the spotted fur emerges and effortlessly glides forward, each movement marked by solemn precision. Springbok are the intended target, unsuspectingly grazing on precious plains. Keep still. A safari tour in Namibia is not like being in the zoo; this is where you'll see the world's greatest mammals in their natural environment. One false move and the sentry raise an alarm, a flurry of hooves kicking up dust and the antelope rushing away. Today's game drive will have explored Okonjima, picking a trail into a spectacular haven. Tonight's accommodation increases the enchantment. Your lodge sits in the middle of the reserve, surrounded by the same scenes that accompany your game drive. Wild dogs and spotted hyenas hunt and scavenge, the density of predators supported by a diverse collection of ungulates. As night falls the sounds provide an eerie lullaby, silence interrupted by gargling cries and mating calls. Sit on your private balcony and listen to the scenes, then admire the floodlit waterholes as they begin to dance with life. Your lodge has its own private water hole, ensuring that nature delivers a very intimate spell."

But the local Bushmen have forever coexisted with nature, effortlessly tracking animal movements and sharing the landscape, so step out of your comfort zone and let 40,000 years of ancestral knowledge take you on a walking safari through Okonjima. Upturned stones, old dung, branches that weep from a sharp cat's claw, the wilderness is alive with clues that guide your journey, enabling you to get spine-tinglingly close yet always remain safe. It all becomes evocatively real when you're at ground level, each mammal inspecting you as an individual, not as a part of a much bigger and scarier vehicle. You're not going to be walking with the big cats, you're going to be sharing the same ground of these stunning creatures. After a leisurely lunch and gentle siesta the afternoon is free to soak up the landscape. Enjoy, indulge, and appreciate the Namibian definition of silence. As the afternoon sun cools, and the wildlife becomes active, you'll explore the wilderness once more, another game drive unveiling a natural world of delight and intrigue. Then nighttime reveals nocturnal treats, a private hide offering uninterrupted views of everything that comes out to play: porcupine, honey-badgers and caracal among the delights."

This morning's journey offers your first impression of this scale, six hours of achingly authentic landscapes taking you into the Southern Kalahari. This is one of Africa's truly remote safaris, a rarely experienced journey onto unpredictable plains. It seems desolate and barren. Yet desert dwellers have adapted to the challenges and they await your intrepid eyes. Okonjima's compactness makes it a perfect first time safari. The Southern Kalahari’s rust colored landscape now builds upon this experience. No sighting can be guaranteed. No game drive can be repeated. Yet every safari is packed with fascination and the unexpected. Perhaps all is quiet, little but a few mountain zebra and wandering gemsbok covering the arid grassland. Then you turn a corner and a pride of black-maned lions doze beside the trail. Meerkats comically emerge, standing to acknowledge your arrival and then scurrying into holes. Roan and sable antelope are among the continent's rarest, and Black rhino will enchant a lucky few. A long game drive fills your afternoon, and then an astonishing night sky mingles with the roars of distant lions."

You'll be aware that the Grand Canyon is the world's largest, perhaps you're only just discovering that Fish River is a close second. There are no other people to interrupt your vista here, no coach loads of tourists filling the car park. You stand alone (well, except for your guide and any travel companion) amongst one of nature's most unique wonders, marveling at the canyon walls as they glisten and glow with the sun. There's beauty in the scale, your eyes trying to look beyond the horizon and glimpse where this canyon might end. As you drive to alternative viewpoints it still seems surreal, exuding superlatives as you grapple with the enormity and gaze down into the abyss. It's a four hour journey to the canyon, and after admiring it from above you can marvel at it all from below. Short hiking trails zigzag down the canyon walls and an incumbent feeling of insignificance is impossible to shake. When does it end? 500 meters you can descend and as you look across it's almost 20 miles to the other side with a length of over 100 miles."

        "description": "On day six it's a long journey to Luderitz, cutting across dusty desert to the ghost town. There's an indelible ruggedness to the landscape, the panoramas occasionally interrupted by a stone farmhouse or juddering mountain. Part of experiencing Southern Namibia is about acknowledging this scale, about driving for six hours and finding that hypnotic enchantment always fills the window. A new vehicle provides the maximum possible comfort in the wilderness, and like most of Namibia, the roads are of a surprisingly good quality. Yes, the distances are big, but you'll be moving at speed, certainly not crawling along and avoiding potholes the whole time. Kolmanskop was once the home of the rich, diamond diggers that struck it lucky in the Namib Desert. Millionaires Avenue now stands derelict and desolate. A late afternoon sun reflects off faded wood as you start to explore, and the remains of this neighborhood lie engulfed by sand. Dunes fill kitchens, bathtubs stand on scorched red, staircases are redundant as the sand connects floors, and the last relics of street signs poke above the surface. Soon there will be nothing but sand. After visiting Kolmanskop you'll then spend two nights in Ludaritz, the next place that's destined to be swallowed by sand. Its transition from diamond capital to ghost town has already started, and it makes for some evocative photography. It's impossible to miss nature's irrefutable power as you wander the streets. Wake on day seven and tour Kolmanshop in the morning light, the mist sweeping off the Atlantic and adding further mystique to this surreal sight. The rest of the day is free and offers the chance to unwind along the Atlantic Ocean."

        "description": "It was sand dunes that kept Namibia so pristine. When explorers landed they couldn't cross the desert, saving Namibia from colonialism until the late 19th century. Some ships turned around. Others perished and left behind wooden skeletons. It's these sand dunes that you now cross, weaving a journey through the endless ridges and peaks, troughs and summits. Tiny oases dot the journey, shocks of green that challenge the red rainbow. Mountains rise and fall with the dunes, shimmering towers that guide your trip towards Sossusvlei. These dunes come alive at sunset, flickering through a euphoric prism of vibrant color. Climb the ridge for an aerial view, hundreds of miles of untamed desert offering a phantasmal panorama. Your lodge offers unrivaled views, silhouettes of mountains dancing beneath the moonlight and beckoning you towards morning exploration. An early start on day nine takes you to Dune 7, the diamond shaped dune relatively easy to climb and offering Namibia's premiere view: sunrise over the Namib-Naukluft desert. One by one the ridges come alive, illuminated by the sun and bringing their fairytale shape to the day. Return to the lodge for a languid afternoon, the odd springbok herd walking past beneath the unrelenting sun. A second late afternoon journey provides another ethereal experience. Scorched trees dot the Deadvlei clay pan, brittle remnants stubbornly refusing to accept the desert's power. Are they dead or just hibernating? Deadvlei makes for iconic photographs; cracked clay in the foreground, red dunes in the background, and scarred black trees the indelible focal point. Across another ridge is Sossusvlei itself, sprouts of green filling its pan. When water flows it fills Sossusvlei, transforming the aridity into one of nature's greatest shows. You can't plan to see it. But if the clouds open you're in for a real once in a lifetime experience."

In contrast, Swakopmund is Namibia's urban oasis, a charming colonial town that's cooled by the Atlantic Ocean breeze. Palm trees mix with 19th century leftovers, sunset is enjoyed from the beach, excellent restaurants combine African and European cuisine, and encompassing greenery provides a halfway point between desert and civilization. You're still surrounded by natural wonders, the laid-back Swakopmund atmosphere blending with new sights as you enjoy the last few days in Namibia. It's quite a drive to Swakopmund, not in distance terms, but in the snaking mountain chains that guide you along provocative desert trails. Stop en route at Dune 7, the 383 meter high monster that's now the highest sand dune in the world. It's still growing, and it still attracts people who think they can climb it. The best views are from below, gazing up at its freestanding control of the desert. Evenings in Swakopmund are always leisurely, a handful of cute cafes and bars helping you readjust from the wilderness. Or kick back and take in the ocean view from your balcony. Namibia's final hurrah comes from the Skeleton Coast, a stretch of desert that hides dozens of shipwrecks. Hulls have become sand pits, masts peak out from beneath dunes, and nautical skeletons have been decimated by nature. It's another sight that will baffle your camera. Many ships became wrecks but not everything is stranded on land. Cape fur seals dive off the rocks, swimming beneath your kayak as you paddle around a sheltered bay. There's hundreds of them, thousands perhaps, all coming out to play on your kayaking adventure. Back on shore you'll also come within touching distance; tens of thousands of these seals cover the beach, comically waddling around and grunting at each other. Heading back to Swakopmund you can still hear them, a cacophonous oink that represents another of Southern Namibia's wonders."

Go slow and gorge yourself on this canvas of natural beauty, a hundred photographs unable to recreate Damaraland’s epic scale or subtle color changes. Dancing between these enchanted rocks are springbok and kudu, gemsbok and those graceful elephant footsteps. It’s not a case of following the path.

Like everywhere on this itinerary, your safari camp redefines your perceptions of African accommodation and “camping.” This is unrivaled luxury in the wilderness, each thick canvas tent coming with a king sized bed, varnished wooden flooring, an en-suite bathroom with views over the landscape, and a personal verandah to watch the action. Tents and wooden fittings help the camp harmoniously blend into the landscape, rather than scar it. And when nature’s cradle song accompanies nighttime, you’ll be glad of not staying in soundproofed concrete."

        "title": "Ongava Game Reserve – Tracking White Rhinos",
        "description": "Imagine a White rhino for a moment. Up to two tons of solid gray bulk, encased within a prehistoric armored frame with two horns protruding from the snout, elegant symbols of their power and beauty. The rhino is 15 meters away from you. It’s standing and it’s looking. At you. Oh, and you’re on foot. Tracking White rhinos certainly raises the heart rate, although there’s something wonderfully tranquil about the whole experience. As you stand before these endangered greats, nothing exists in the world except for you and them. Other thoughts vanish and everything zooms into this inimitable interaction. Some people are so captivated they forget to take photos. There are very few places in Africa where this experience is possible, after all, there are less than 20,000 rhinos remaining in the wild. Your walking safari with White rhinos isn’t the only highlight in Ongava. Out on a game drive you spot the even rarer Black rhino, your guide unveiling how to distinguish the browser from the grazer (clue: both rhino species are actually gray). The same rules apply even though you’re now in a vehicle. Stay still and silent. Don’t use the flash. Just admire their idiosyncratic splendor and soak up their enormity. This time it’s a mother and calf approaching your delighted eyes, the bashful youngster sticking close to more experienced footsteps. She slows the pace, surveys the scene, and considers your presence. Then the pair waddles off and your camera shutter can’t snap quickly enough."

        "description": "Etosha is consumed by a mythical veil in the early morning, a thin covering of condensation floating through the mopane woodland. Open the curtains and gaze down on Etosha, your camp perched on rocks overlooking Namibia’s premier national park. Then descend into the trees and roam through the park. Dense vegetation reduces visibility, something that elevates the safari experience. Most of the wildlife won’t see you coming, meaning astonishing proximity. Turn a corner and an elephant herd fills the trail, babies swinging their trunks as if they’ve just discovered a new trick. Meander onto a clearing and giraffe stand above the vehicle, delectable combinations of yellow and orange contrasting the woodland scenery. Today and tomorrow you go on long morning game drives into Etosha National Park, each moment providing another mammal to tick of the wish list. And let’s not forget the 300 plus bird species that flutter along the treetops and fly across the salt pans, their cacophonous calls blended with insatiable colors. Etosha and Ongava Game Reserve share unfenced boundaries, meaning that wildlife freely roams between the two. So in the afternoon you stay more local to the camp, savoring the complete privacy of Ongava and spotting the rare and peculiar. Black-faced impala confound the camera, oryx point their horns in your vicinity, and then a quivering tail brings your focus to the trees. Once again a tail moves. But what is it? Drive forward for a better angle and train your eyes on the branch. Placidly lounging is a leopard, unambiguous eyes returning your gaze. But just as you take a photo it’s gone, slyly descending onto the forest floor and following the nearby rustling sounds."

        "description": "So just how big is the Southern Africa wilderness? Etosha alone is over 20,000 square kilometers, and that’s before you consider the adjacent reserves. Go deeper into Etosha this morning, emerging from the forest and ogling the shimmering whiteness of the salt pans. Now nature’s battle for survival consumes your experience, the wandering herds always in search of water, and predatory instincts taking the cats to permanent waterholes. On this uninterrupted landscape you can spot the action from a distance. Zebra bring stripes of black to the pan, eland kick up dust as they cross the salty crust, and it’s not long before a lion pride grabs your attention. They seem lazy this morning, a herd of wildebeest grazing within predacious distance of the cats. Young males playfully fight, purred fisticuffs in the dawn light. But somehow the lionesses have gone. Surely you were watching the pride the whole time? Some hunting scenes play out over hours, this one has just occurred when you blinked. After the morning game drive you return to camp for a leisurely lunch and two hours of panoramic safari spotting from the verandah. Then it’s another afternoon exploring what surrounds the camp. Black and White rhinos await the camera, lion prides and leopards have their own favorite hangouts, and now the darkness of night brings new delights. You must use your ears for wildlife clues in the dark. Rustling comes from the trees. Trumpeting calls suggest elephants are somewhere. But where ? Your guide slowly edges forward before killing the engine. Sounds become brighter and silhouetted shapes are half glimpsed in the distance. Nighttime safari is always like this; thrillingly unpredictable, yet wonderfully calm. The guide turns on the spotlight and a large herd of one ton red hartebeest are barely meters away, the sighting causing brief shock, momentary panic, and now elated smiles. It’s synonymous of the Namibian safari experience. Not only can the country offer the complete collection of wildlife. It’s full of unique ways to experience it."

        "title": "Okavango Delta – Immersed in the Beauty of Botswana",
        "description": "Okavango’s exuberant blue waterways come as a shock after Namibia. There’s water everywhere and the wildlife seems suitably ecstatic. They migrate for thousands of miles to sample this desert oasis, gouging on the liquid goodness and covering the floodplains in hooves. From Etosha you first fly to Windhoek, before connecting on a scheduled flight to Maun and then a breathtaking micro flight over Southern Africa’s biggest animal jamboree. Zebra and springbok skip through the shallows, elephants drink with unstoppable abandon, and all around your camp there are telltale footprints. Chief’s Island magnifies the feelings of intimacy with nature. You can only get here via the tiny aircraft landing strip or a boat trip through thousands of hippos. Let’s start with the game drives, the journeys that explore the nooks and crannies of the savannah and woodland. Water brings the ungulates, and they in term support a dazzling assortment of cheetahs, leopards, and lions. Turn a corner and a pride lies in wait. Turn another and the frisky footsteps of spotted hyenas make a merry journey. Like always, there’s also an incumbent impression of serenity. Because no matter how exciting each individual sight may be, the landscape’s luxuriant beauty maintains an overarching sense of tranquility. Just take your camp as an example. Kick back and admire the view, a multitude of different species slowly crossing the horizon. Focus in on the waterhole and a pair of giraffe is drinking. Nothing is rushed or over-dramatized, even when a cat enters the fray. This is just your private evening’s entertainment in Okavango. For the ultimate Okavango exploration you must go by boat, traditional wooden mokoros expertly paddled down the river channels. As the guide steers you along, a succession of hippo pods raise their snouts from the water. Along the riverside you marvel at rare wildlife enjoying a drink. Then an impala herd skillfully sidesteps the Nile crocodiles. Then you're floating past two dozen eyes, each hippo watching you pass, one burping, another grunting, and two more starting a fight over wading space. Okavango provides a very different experience to Etosha and Namibia. So marvel, applaud, and feed your adventurous spirit."

        "title": "Sabi Sands Game Reserve – Spectacular Kruger National Park",
        "description": "Completing the threesome of Southern Africa’s best national parks is Kruger, an immense stretch of competing habitats that covers northeastern South Africa. As you’ll have learned by now, different wildlife prefers different ecosystems. What you spot in the desert contrasts with what you find in the forest. However, Kruger somehow creates an environment where a dozen contradictory habitats can survive. Let’s start with the classic savannah, ideal for a smorgasbord of characters, from the wandering rhinos to grazing antelopes, lions resting beneath trees to elephants bashing down branches. Your luxury lodge in the Sabi Sans Private Game Reserve swarms with life, most of Kruger’s iconic scenes visible from your own verandah. Big Five? You could see them all without even leaving the room, floor to ceiling windows offering spectacular panoramas onto the action. Game drives tour the juxtaposed habitats; stop at hippo filled swamps for a hearty brunch, cruise across the grass plains on the tails of cheetah, find thirsty crowds down at the Sabi River, and shake your heads at the elephants tearing a trail through the woodland. Up ahead you recognize the horns, memories of walking with rhinos coming flooding back. Wait. Be patient. In the next 15 minutes a further ten White rhinos emerge and pass by the safari truck. Don’t be surprised, over half of the world’s wild rhino population can be found in Kruger National Park. Options for walking safaris are included and they bring proximity to a whole array of South Africa’s finest. And it just wouldn’t be Kruger without a dramatic soap opera of hunting scenes. A solitary leopard silently emanates from the woodland, spreading shocks of excitement and anticipation through the safari truck. The tail swishes and then the neck dips, the camouflaged hunter dropping below the grass line and using a boulder for cover. From a raised vantage point you can see predator and prey. All seems calm. But where’s the leopard gone? As you were focusing on the springbok, the leopard’s disguise has fooled everyone. Scan the grass. Nothing. Use the binoculars. Still nothing. And now a flurry of dust and excitement, the leopard appearing from nowhere and the antelopes blindly charging in multiple directions. The outcome of the hunt? Let’s leave some surprises for when you’re in Kruger, reveling in the dramatic beauty of a third Southern African national park."

        "title": "Okonjima Reserve - Intimate Leopard Encounters",
        "description": "As you leave Windhoek you're eager for those first glimpses, the first sightings that help confirm Namibia's status as safari premiere. Okonjima Reserve doesn't allow you to slowly settle in. You don't build up to the predators with some gentle ungulate spots. Leopards are the specialty, the most elusive of the Big Five out on display on your very first game drive. A tail flickers, a neck dips, and a pair of eyes fixes on your astonished stare. Suddenly it’s gone, the stealthy cat blending into the grass and continuing its bashful lifestyle. Perched on a rock another spotted cat grabs your attention, a look of serene elegance accompanying the cheetahs' survey of the savanna. By the way, you still haven't checked in to the lodge yet. This is just a quick game drive to get you in the Namibian mood. Okonjima's compact size makes it a perfect first stop. While the abundant leopards and cheetahs linger longest in the memory, the ease of the safari is a huge part of the experience. There aren't large distances to cover or long hours staking out a waterhole. A diverse collection of characters coexist in close proximity, ensuring every game drive is crowded with highlights. Zebra, kudu, giraffe...keep taking the photos as the list of first encounters grows ever longer. Visit the reserve's rehabilitation center for even closer encounters, rescued big cats nursed back to health and then successfully returned to the wild. As the sun comes down on your first full day the experiences continue to roll. All is quiet as you sit on the private verandah, Namibia's expressions of silence and space most apparent when the stars are twinkling. A floodlit waterhole is just meters away and slowly the nocturnal delights come out for a drink. First a porcupine, now a handful of honey-badgers, and then a rush of dispersal as a caracal announces his presence. Undisclosed hides offer a stunning proximity, the delightful wildlife seemingly within touching distance. Indulge in the feeling of being alone with nature. Your private bush suite is 500 meters from the rest of the bush camp. You've already experienced the predators in the park. Leopards, cheetahs, hyena...they confirm the famous safari mantra of “stay in the vehicle.” So why is the guide taking you out on foot? Namibia's private reserves offer unrivaled walking safari opportunities, each bringing new perspectives on the untamed landscape. Yes, it's safe. Honestly. The local Bushmen have survived alongside leopards and the rest of the predators for some 40,000 years, so they make the perfect guides. Tentatively, then more confidently, you step into the savannah. It's the same wildlife as yesterday, except it's a lot more impressive when viewed from ground level. Step, step, step, a zebra over there and a springbok herd over here. Keep walking, evidence of hyenas scarring the trees. Stop. Wait. And listen to your guide when he says that the galloping herd should have right of way on the trail."

        "description": "Got your breath back yet? Keep the walking boots to hand as you journey north, the Land Rover crossing great swathes of wilderness and revealing the endless expanses of one of the world's most sparsely populated countries. Ongava Game Reserve provides another indelible panoramic, the lodge perched above quintessential African savanna and gazing down onto Etosha National Park. It's a hypnotic sight when the sun goes down, but that's for later. Right now you need to lace up those boots and stride, more confidently now, into White rhino territory. Rhinos! Surely this isn't safe? Endangered White rhinos have exceptional hearing, picking up on distant sounds as they take an afternoon snooze. Stay downwind and walk slowly, a team of guides evaluating the rhinos' behavior and respecting their personal space. Even when prostrate these rhinos display an incredible bulk, great hulks of armor and muscle hinting at serious power. Remember, the Bushmen and rhino have lived together for 40,000 years. That's a lot of generational knowledge keeping you safe. Shaking fingers work the camera shutter and the surrealistic images transport you into a microcosmic setting. During every moment you spend with these majestic mammals there is nothing but you and them. You don't need a spa or yoga retreat to forget about everything and escape from the world. Just go walking with White rhinos. Like each stop on this itinerary, you have complete control over the program. Tailor the safari schedule on a day to day basis, combining different activities dependent on your interests and mood. Perhaps a game drive that seeks out the mammal closest to your heart. Maybe a concoction of walking safaris. How about a nighttime drive to explore the nocturnal activity within the reserve? Of course your guide will be offering suggestions and ideas, using intimate knowledge to help maximize the safari experience. This inimitability is another of Namibia's strong points; few other destinations can provide such a customized service. And don't think that another group is going to be copying the ideas. Namibia is blissfully devoid of tourists, each reserve far quieter than those in neighboring countries. In this vast provocative landscape there's no need to share. For example, your small camp only has three units, each wonderfully spacious and secluded from each other. Captivating your heart at Ongava is an assortment of the spectacular and charming, the reserve sharing an unfenced boundary with Etosha National Park. Game drives can stay locally within the reserve, or meander into Etosha. Giraffe stand proud on dusty plains, elephants puncture holes in the forest, and the keen eyes pick out big cats preparing to hunt. Your private verandah overlooks a permanent water source, and it's often teeming with wildlife as late afternoon becomes evening and the Milky Way cuts across the sky. So do you admire the indelible scene from the outdoor bath, maybe from the sumptuous private sitting room, or perhaps in-between a dip in the plunge pool."

        "description": "As your Namibian journey continues the drama intensifies. Etosha National Park is one of Africa's finest, a gaping expanse of mopane woodland and shimmering salt pans. Contradictory habitats keep a range of mammals happy and the search for water dominates the atmosphere. During the wet season the animals disperse, greedily gobbling up fresh pastures and seasonal rivers. Then the land shrivels and swirls of dust go on captivating journeys across the pans. Herds roam and wander, standing lost on desolate landscapes that scream of nature's power. Elephants, giraffe, antelopes, lions...each group makes its journey across the 5000km² salt pan, always in search of water and survival. Nestled on the edge of the pan, your next camp provides endless panoramas of this natural spectacle. When it floods the flamingo flocks create a pink mirage, and when it's dry the nomadic wanderers keep you enchanted all day. Like everywhere in Namibia, safari here is a 24-hours-a-day experience. Swim in the pool and gaze out at a roaming herd. Lie back in your freestanding luxury chalet and let lion roars interrupt dreamy sleep. On a morning game drive the plains come to life. Three lionesses are on the prowl, deliberate movements taking them towards the ungulate masses. They stalk the waterholes, hoping to remain anonymous as early risers head for a drink. You were expecting to experience their raw power, but most people are surprised by the grace of a hunting pride. A solitary leopard is also searching for breakfast, the ingenious hunter's eyes only visible when wind flickers through the grass. Particularly in dry season, there are great opportunities to witness a hunt in Etosha. Most aren't successful. But allowing a big cat attack to play out is captivating whatever the outcome. Even a spotted hyena's desperate scavenge has a certain hypnotism to it. Etosha's diversity ensures every game drive is fresh. Over 100 mammal species call this park home, from the famed to the rare, the diminutive to the delightful. How's your antelope recognition after six days of safari? Red hartebeest, Black-faced impala, gemsbok, kudu, Steenbok, springbok, a gaggle of different species march around with the zebras and elephants. They're all the common sights, ubiquitous mammals that blend into the scenery, as much a permanent feature as the rocky outcrops. Keep exploring and the rarest of Africa's game sticks up a horn, now a head, and now a great mass of grey elegance. Critically endangered Black rhinos are a special sight for even the most experienced of safari goers. They should mark a spectacular end to this unique safari adventure."

There could even be time for a last glimpse at the wildlife, a lost antelope crossing the desolate highway. As much as you're bursting to reveal the experience and wonder, you leave with a fervent desire that Namibia should remain untouched and untamed.

There’s plenty to admire on the way, your first impressions of Namibia’s wilderness starting as soon as you leave Windhoek. A perfect sealed road cuts towards the highlands, yet it’s virtually devoid of traffic. Namibia is one of the world’s most sparsely populated countries and you’ll discover that even the highways are wonderfully quiet. The closest thing they have to rush hour is when two elephant herds cross the road at the same time. Which sounds unbelievable, but wait until you see the road signs warning about crossing pachyderms Enter Okonjima Game Reserve and start the big game adventure, an infamous abundance of leopards bringing an unforgettable first safari. These cats are one of Africa’s most elusive sights, the stealthy hunter carefully camouflaged and ever bashful. Yet it’s hard to visit Okonjima and not see them. Gaze at the lucid eyes that return your stare, admire their pristine fur coats of spotted yellow, and watch them descend from branches and search for the resident ungulates. In Okonjima you’ll go on game drives with local guides, their intimate knowledge of the predators maximizing the safari experience. However, you don’t always need a guide.

It's the perfect time to explore; hartebeest skip across the fertile plains, a leopard dips beneath the grass line, and an elephant rumbles to the waterhole without inhibition. Okanjima is also the home of AfriCat Foundation and has successfully rehabilitated cheetahs and returned them to the wild. Your game drive finishes with a tour of the AfriCat center, bringing unfathomable proximity to these majestic cats. It’s only 10am and you’ve already filled the memory card with unforgettable safari images. After a hearty brunch you drive further north, a superb wilderness road taking you into Ongava Game Reserve on the edges of Etosha. It’s late afternoon now and time to slow the pace, the journey through Ongava infused with nature’s endangered wonders. Black rhinos call this colorful landscape home, plodding through the lush green forest and drinking from swampy waterholes. Stop and admire the natural scenery, a pair of the planet’s remaining rhinos sharing the now rugged road. Others are nearby, a visual feast of sights to explore over these next three days.

Continue the safari wonderland by self-driving into Etosha, taking the Anderson Gate and meandering into the heart of Namibia’s most famous national park. Once in the park the roads become a little rough and rugged, although it’s nothing that you can’t handle and helps Etosha maintain its wild atmosphere. For this self-drive trip you'll be in a luxury four wheel drive, a vehicle that oozes comfort yet can tackle any brief jaunts off road. Signposts help guide your journey, but today is very much about choosing random trails and indulging in exploration. Deep in the forest an elephant herd charges around, half encircling your vehicle and then slowly rumbling off. Follow them towards a waterhole, watching the baby elephants chase away black-faced impala and then deciding to follow the ungulates into the grassland. You’re transfixed by the peculiar antelope until a lioness emerges from behind a rock. Go slow and loop around the rock, feasting your eyes on the whole pride of big cats. Self-driving allows complete control over the route and itinerary. You decide to take an hour off and relax beside a waterhole, watching the mammals come to you. Stay still for twenty minutes as you aim for the perfect lion cub photos. Or take a rugged trail and explore the weird sounds emanating from the bush. With a sumptuous picnic lunch provided, day four is all about crossing Etosha National Park on a breathtaking day of authenticity and idiosyncratic experiences. Your final destination is Mushara Outpost, a secluded getaway on the western edge of the park. Supplementing the exhilaration of the day, Mushara ensures unabridged tranquility and a raw sensation of being alone in nature. Dine beneath the moonlight and watch the wildlife grazing nearby, before settling into a pristine wooden suite and allowing nature to sing the bedtime story. On day five you once again have the whole of Etosha to yourself. The guides at your next camp can provide maps and advice on routes, enabling you to tailor the drive around a myriad of interests and expectations. Want to spot giraffe? Maybe you’re looking for the diminutive dik dik? Or the chance to add White rhinos to your tick list? Tailor your journey and tour the waterholes, following the hyenas as they follow the impalas that are running from the cheetahs who got spooked by the rhinos, another cog in this vivid ecosystem of intrigue and delight."

        "title": "Etosha National Park - Himba Tribal Culture Immersion",
        "description": "In the crisp morning air you make a final journey through Etosha, passing the four legged residents that have been blending into your daily landscape. Drive to the southern gate, a quick few stops for giraffe and lion photos, and then continue farther into the wilderness. While the abundance of wild mammals is rescinding there’s still evocative traces, footprints that head into the mountains and suggest that you’re never far away from wildlife in Namibia. But on day six there’s another group of infamous residents that captures your heart; an iconic Himba tribe opens up its village for an incredible afternoon of cultural interaction. It’s immediately apparent why this ancient indigenous tribe is so adored by travel photographers. Beaded hair flows past their hypnotic headdresses, loin clothes and leather belts wrap around bodies laden with mud red paint, and jewelry glints with the sun. This isn’t a point and shoot the camera experience, it’s a chance to learn about their culture, beginning with a tribal welcome and continuing with a journey through the bush. This arid land holds many treats and surprises, from medicine to poison, digging sticks to natural carpets. A local villager reveals these secrets, unveiling a natural lifestyle that has survived unhindered for many centuries."

        "title": "Damaraland - Endless Adventure",
        "description": "The arid remoteness of Damaraland has aided the preservation of Himba culture. Few people ever set eyes on this landscape of kaleidoscopic mountains, bizarre rock formations, and gaping red valleys. It’s desolate and sequestered, something that adds further enchantment to your journey. Take it slow today with just an hour of driving to the Twelfyfontein area. Choose to maintain the leisurely pace or ramp up the excitement by trying out hiking trails and rock climbing walls. In Damaraland you’re never too far away from a short hike to a rocky peak, the little bit of effort being rewarded by gorgeous panoramas of an otherworldly landscape. It almost feels like you’re journeying on the moon, the landscape as pristine as the place Armstrong landed so many years ago."

        "title": "Swakopmund - Cruising the Skeleton Coast",
        "description": "Hit the coast and the color blue is added to this natural art gallery, the Atlantic Ocean shimmering and glistening as you drive south. On one side the water ripples and the waves roll, while on the other, a towering collection of dunes hide compelling surprises. Poking out of the sand are shipwrecks, the last remains of abandoned crafts now engulfed by the irrepressible sand. The road isn’t in great condition, although you’ll want to go slow given the evocative surroundings. In between the wooden skeletons you find a beach that’s very much alive, thousands of Cape fur seals covering the sand with their raucous calling and bizarre waddling. Keep the ocean on your right and soon you hit Swakopmund, the broad roads littered with palm trees. A luxury hotel in Swakopmund is your base for the next three days, so check in to the sumptuous suite and check out the panoramas of the Atlantic."

        "title": "Swakopmund - Soaking Up the Sand",
        "description": "Swakopmund is Namibia’s cute urban oasis, a town of gentle charms that can soothe any travel aches. After seven days of real driving adventure, the next two days provide a thick dose of lazy tranquility. A handful of endearing cafes support quiet afternoons, restaurants are housed in colonial relics, and the ocean is always on the itinerary. But Swakopmund doesn’t have to be about soaking up serenity and beachside treats. Dominating the horizon are more sand dunes, including the world’s highest, a 380 meter monster that’s rather blandly named Dune 7. Sand board down it, ATV around the desert, lie on a wooden board and downhill across the dunes or just wander here for an unforgettable sunset view. Another unforgettable optional experience is a micro flight over the Namib-Naukluft Desert, the endless red dunes illuminated by sunrise and Namibia’s scale revealed with exhilarating charm. However you choose to spend the days, your hotel ensures there’s always an overarching air of calmness."

That’s why you keep stopping and taking it all in. It’s a three to four hour drive back to Windhoek, the journey always delivering impressions of the Namibian landscape you've come to adore. You’re returning to the your first hotel for a final night of luxury accommodation in Namibia. A representative will come to collect your vehicle from the lodge and hear about your immense travel stories. Enjoy, indulge, and spend hours musing over just how much has happened in just 11 days."
