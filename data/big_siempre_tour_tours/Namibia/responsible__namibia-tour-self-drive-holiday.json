  "generalInfo": "Discover the incredible landscapes and wildlife of Namibia on this excellent value tailormade tour. Starting in the capital Windhoek, travel south to the scarlet sands of the Kalahari desert. Continue to the epic expanses of the Namib and climb the scarcely believable towering dunes of Sossuvlei set against a back drop of skeletal trees contributing to other worldly scene.  Next up is the dramatic Atlantic coast and the town of Swakopmund where you will see the distinctly German influence in the architecture. Here there will be ample time to take in optional activities ranging from adrenaline fuelled sky dives to a leisurely nature walk learning about the resilient wildlife found in desert dunes, or perhaps sea kayaking may be your thing. Then head up the fabled Skeleton coast and observe the thousands of Cape Fur seals at Cape Cross, quite a sight to behold. Continue inland to the frontiers of Damaraland home to prehistoric rock art and a petrified forest as well as the Damara ethnic people. Again there will be lots of optional activities to choose from and you may opt to head out in search of the largest land animals on earth, huge desert adapted elephants. The tour culminates at the salt pan of Etosha National Park, where the scattered watering holes provide a vital lifeline for nature making them wonderful places to view the wildlife. On this tour, some activities are included but the idea of this tour is for you to be able to travel the open expanses of Namibia revelling in the astonishing landscapes and being able to choose from many optional activities along the way.  The tour can either be done as a self drive holiday or accompanied with a driver/guide.",

      "description": "Windhoek - Mariental (Approximate driving time today: three hours) - Today we head for Mariental, a flourishing market town in the heart of Southern Namibia, administrative capital of the Hardap Region. Named by local Rhenish (German Lutheran) missionaries after Maria the wife of the area’s first colonial settler, Herman Brandt, Mariental was founded in 1912 as a railway stop between Windhoek and Keetmanshoop. Our lodge is a relaxed and down-to-earth stopover which offers a taste of the Kalahari, the desert that occupies vast tracts of eastern Namibia, southern Botswana and northern South Africa. In the late afternoon we take a sundowner drive through surrounding arid and semi–arid areas, brown sands and red dunes. Overnight at Kalahari Anib Lodge or similar. (BLD)"

      "description": "Dead Vlei and Sesriem Canyon - Sossusvlei is the oldest desert on earth, home to some of the strangest flora and fauna on the continent. Today there’s an early start as we plan on driving to some of the highest sand dunes in the world to catch the sun as it rises over a sea of red dunes, some up to 300m high. The first rays of the sun light up the dunes with a deep orange glow – a photographer's ‘golden hour’. It is a wild, beautiful and romantic spot, with sparse vegetation skirting the few water courses flowing in from the Tsauchab River. Here springbok and ostrich are often seen. Later, we explore the narrow, cool passageways of the Sesriem Canyon on foot. The canyon is small but very picturesque - many plants grow in the shade and shelter it offers, and its permanent water attracts several species of birds and animals. Sesriem means 'six thongs', referring to the six lengths of rawhide rope needed by early settlers to haul up a bucket of water. In the afternoon there’s time to relax before a sundowner dune drive in the Namib Desert. Overnight at Namib Desert Lodge or similar. (BLD)"

Continuing the short journey to Swakopmund, we’re surrounded by the Namib Desert on three sides, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. Culturally and architecturally, Swakopmund is strongly influenced by its German colonial legacy, examples of Germanic architecture characterizing the town. On arrival we will have short orientation tour and afterwards explore on foot, perhaps visiting the Swakopmund Museum, the National Marine Aquarium or the Crystal Gallery.

      "description": "Swakopmund - Damaraland (Approximate driving time today: four hours) - Today we aim to reach the rugged beauty of Damaraland. We stop en route to view prehistoric rock engravings at Twyfelfontein’s UNESCO World Heritage Site for the largest known concentration of Stone Age petroglyphs in Namibia - approximately 2,500. Nearby, we also visit a curious geological structure of perpendicular slabs of basalt known as the ‘Organ Pipes’. The town of Khorixas lies at the centre of Damaraland’s rough terrain and was the region’s capital prior to Namibia's independence. Most inhabitants here are from the Damara ethnic group. The town is close to a remarkable accumulation of enormous fossilized tree trunks, over 280 million years old, known as The Petrified Forest and declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007. Overnight at Damara Mopane Lodge or similar. (BLD)"

      "description": "Etosha National Park - Today we explore the park’s numerous waterholes and underground springs, each of which attracts large herds of animals, including springbok, zebra, wildebeest and giraffe. The park’s landscape varies from dense bush and wildlife-filed plains. However, at its heart is Etosha Pan, a silent grey-white salt pan almost 130km by 50km. Geologists believe the pan was formed some 12 million years ago from an immense inland lake about the size of Holland. Shrunk to its present size it’s a gigantic depression - flat, saline and silvery, a mysterious place of mirages and dust-laden images. Overnight at Etosha Safari Camp or similar. (BLD)"
