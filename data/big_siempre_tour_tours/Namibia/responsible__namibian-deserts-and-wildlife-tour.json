  "generalInfo": "Namibia is a land of extremes, huge dunes, hot deserts, dry pans, rugged coastline and some of the best wildlife in the whole world. These habitats are all very hot and dry and perfect habitat for reptiles. Namibia has a host of reptile life which can be readily seen with the right expert guides. This is the only tour dedicated to seeing reptiles in Namibia and is the best herpetology tour to this country available.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife safaris of Southern Africa including Namibia. Namibia is a vast country with some of the most photogenic and stunning scenery anywhere in the world. <br/><br/>Being home to one of the world’s largest national parks (Etosha National Park) and the world’s oldest desert (Namib Desert) the seemingly barren Namibian wilderness is alive with wildlife. This tour is an exploration around some of the most iconic and beautiful places in this wonderful country, looking for some of the most elusive yet incredible species, whilst staying in some of the most prestigious accommodation in the country.<br/><br/>Unlike many other safari destinations in Africa it is not just the wildlife that is mesmerising here, instead the landscape plays a major role in bringing the wildlife and the wilderness to life. Whether it is the colossal orange sand dunes of Sossusvlei or the eerie petrified trees of Deadvlei, the very moon like eroded hills and canyons north of Swakopmund or indeed the vast rugged terrain of Damarland and the white empty expanse of the Etosha Pan, there is incredible and unique landscapes all over Namibia.<br/><br/>Being mostly a desert environment, it is easy to think of the country as being devoid of life, certainly it is hard to believe that the country could boast the largest population of rhinos in the world (outside of protected parks), or large numbers of elephants, lions, leopards, cheetahs and other iconic African wildlife. But that is Namibia, a land of contradictions a land of extreme environments which has led to the evolution of wildlife that has come up with some incredible adaptations to survive. Including handstanding beetles, cartwheeling spiders, dancing lizards, sand-swimming lizards and sidewinding snakes among others. <br/><br/>On this trip it is some of these smaller and usually very elusive species that will be our targets, the amazing Namaqua chameleon and the stunning Peruginey's adder are just the tip of the Herpetological ice berg in Namibia. We will have expert help to find and photograph as many of these stunning species as possible. You will also have the unique chance to photograph reptiles in their natural environment with the help of local experts who run rescue centres for reptiles.<br/><br/>There are so many different places to visit in Namibia, this is itinerary hits all of the key destinations, however if you wish to visit other places we are experts are tailoring wildlife and cultural tours to Namibia to suit any requirement. All you have to do is to get in touch with your budget and your group size and where you would like to go and we will come back to you with an itinerary and quote for your perfect Namibian wildlife safari tour.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Windhoek. We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers and game drives. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Namibia (and elsewhere in Southern Africa). Your naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the Namibian wilderness, night safaris are available in Etosha, however they are only available with the park services and it is a first come first basis and so you will have to speak to your guide on arrival there and book places on these (this is not included). A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>There are reasons to visit Namibia at any time of year, however we prefer to visit in October – November where the temperatures are a little cooler and the wildlife plentiful. <br/>Namibia has more than 300 days of sunshine per year. It is situated at the southern edge of the tropics; the Tropic of Capricorn cuts the country about in half. The winter (June–August) is generally dry, both rainy seasons occur in summer, the small rainy season between September and November, the big one between February and April. Humidity is low, and average rainfall varies from almost zero in the coastal desert to more than 600mm in the Caprivi Strip. <br/>Weather and climate in the coastal area are dominated by the cold, north-flowing Benguela Current of the Atlantic Ocean which accounts for very low precipitation (&lt;50mm per year), frequent dense fog, and overall lower temperatures than in the rest of the country. In winter, occasionally a condition known as Berg wind or Oosweer occurs, a hot dry wind bloWing from the inland to the coast. As the area<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• This is the only dedicated herpetology tour to Namibia available, on this trip gain access to reptile rescue centres and have the help of local experts to find and photograph reptiles.<br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist guides as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it. We do our best to include as many wildlife activities as possible in all of our itineraries.<br/>• Depending on budget and interest we have a range of different accommodation packages to offer, from luxury top end lodges, national park safari lodges and camps which often offer unbelievable wildlife watching deep inside national parks as well as camping. A mobile camping safari of Namibia is very popular and all of your camping gear will be provided.<br/>• Spend all the daylight hours searching for wildlife and visiting various natural wonders and stunning landscapes.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our Namibian wildlife safaris a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Southern Africa so that we can try and find and observe some of the rarer and more elusive species. We have great itineraries and expertise in all Southern African countries (Namibia, South Africa, Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Mozambique) and can arrange trips to find some of the rarer species such as aardvarks, aardwolves, brown hyenas and black-footed cats among other species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour visit various locations within Namibia. We will start and end the trip in the capital Windhoek along the way you will visit Sossusvlei, Namib Desert around Swakopmund, Damaraland and Etosha.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from a vehicle and whilst there is some walking, most of the walking is over flat sand or rock. However you are welcome to walk up the iconic sand dunes in Sossusvlei if you wish. However even this is not too difficult and requires no special fitness level. The longest hike is to Deadvlei and this is around 2 hours there and back and the walk is mostly flat. The biggest consideration is the heat, it is very hot in the deserts of Namibia during the day.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 16 Years Old",

The sunrises and sunsets are spectacular here and the colours off the dunes make the entire place one of the most photographic in the world and if we are lucky enough to spot a sidewinder adder or even a black mamba against this backdrop you will get incredible photos and memories. We will return to the lodge for meals, whilst heading back into the desert after lunch for more wildlife watching and exploring the dunes."

All over the place here, the prehistoric waterways have carved out gorges and the granite koppies make an imposing environment for any wildlife. But despite that there is still wildlife here, populations of elephants, black rhinos, giraffes, ostriches and springbok survive here and trying to find them is where the excitement lies. Today will mostly be spent on the road travelling, but if we see anything interesting we will of course stop to check it out. If we arrive at the lodge in time we will have some wildlife watching on arrival."

Hopefully we can find one of the critically endangered black rhinos, or maybe a cheetah stalking springbok. In addition to the mammals here we will of course be keeping an eye out for the many lizards and snakes which bask on the granite and wait for the evening when they begin their hunt. All of your meals will be served in between wildlife watching excursions."

Being 22,260km2 and home to 110 reptile and 16 amphibian species as well as 114 mammals, 340 birds and amazingly 1 fish species! Dominated by huge salt pans which form part of the Kalahari Basin, during this time of the year the wildlife is congregated around the diminishing water holes. Today you will probably only have a short visit to the park after arriving at the lodge, this afternoon."
