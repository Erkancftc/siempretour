  "generalInfo": "Namibia is a land of geographical extremes encompassing vast areas of inhospitable desert, towering mountain ranges and unspoilt wilderness areas. It’s home to elephant, rhino, lion, giraffe, and a host of unique flora and fauna. <br/><br/>Whereas much of southern Namibia is made up of desert, the north is home to the rich farmland of Damaraland, fed mainly by the Okavango River, as well as the sub-tropical forest and mopane bush of Etosha National Park, one of the largest game viewing parks in Africa. <br/><br/>This Namibia self drive explores the best of the country’s north and south, taking advantage of good tarmac roads, which are straight and traffic free. You’ll experience the country's wildlife, landscapes, and culture from your own vehicle and at your own pace, staying at lodges working with local community and animal conservation projects. <br/><br/>See black rhino, ostrich, springbok, wild horses and desert adapted elephants in the vast expanses of Namibian wilderness. Marvel at the scenery around the dunes of Sossusvlei and explore the prehistoric rock paintings of the San (Bushmen) in the Twyfelfontein Conservancy.<br/><br/>Next stop is Ongava Game Reserve, where you’ll stay at a lodge on the southern boundary of Etosha National Park. The reserve acts as a buffer to Etosha, helping animals to move freely around the park without coming into contact with the surrounding environment. Finally you will stop in Okonjima, home to animal rehabilitation and research centre the AfriCat Foundation, where you’ll come into close contact with cheetah, leopard, and lion first hand. <br/><br/>Your route ends back in Windhoek where you’ll return your hire car before being transferred to the airport for your flight home.<br/><br/>This itinerary is tailor made and can be modified to add Fish River Canyon, Victoria Falls, Botswana or any of the remarkable highlights of the region. Ask your travel specialist for recommendations!",
