  "generalInfo": "Take a trip to some of Namibia’s most iconic destinations where you’ll find a stacked cast of varied wildlife and landscapes that are truly out of this world! Namibia’s a world-famous destination for both landscape and wildlife photography.  This country offers a motley patchwork of landscapes featuring mountain ranges, deserts, and waterfalls. It also has healthy populations of all of Africa’s most iconic wildlife. On this trip, you’ll get to experience all of it!<br/><br/>The itinerary for this tour covers a jam-packed roster of Namibia’s must-see destinations for photographers. You’ll explore Etosha National Park, witness the awe-inspiring Epupa and Ruacana Falls, and journey through the Brandberg Mountains before finding your way to the Skeleton Coast and taking in its iconic red dunes. Along this journey, you’ll get a solid mix of landscape and wildlife photography opportunities whilst receiving tips and tuition from your guides. Other highlights of the trip include prime conditions for astrophotography and the chance to encounter the semi-nomadic Himba people. You’ll take home a diverse portfolio of pics as well as a bank of new skills to improve your ability with a camera.  <br/><br/>There’s something special for wildlife enthusiasts on this tour too. Travelling through both Etosha National Park and the more desert-like Kaokoveld region, you’ll get a chance to spot all the Big Five but also get to see deserted-adapted species of giraffes, lions, and elephants too. This mix of subjects offers unique wildlife photography opportunities and the chance to take home a diverse range of photos. Along the way, you’ll also see a striking contrast in flora, an array of spectacular bird species, and great micro-photography opportunities with reptiles and insects. <br/><br/>The tour also includes a variety of game-viewing experiences, allowing you to approach by foot, safari vehicle, and boat. A highlight of the trip is a boat tour taken on the final day across Sandwich Harbour in Swakopmund. These waters have huge populations of pink-backed Pelicans and Flamingos, and a boat cruise lets you photograph these birds up close as they fly alongside the boat.<br/><br/>The possibility for landscape photography on this tour shouldn’t be overlooked either. Namibia is a treasure trove of exciting, striking environments, some of which are almost otherworldly. This tour covers a nice range of what the country has to offer. You’ll see rolling savannah in Etosha, rugged desertland in Kaokoveld, lush greenery along the Kunene River, the Brandberg mountain range, and red dunes of the Skeleton Coast. You’ll witness some true spectacles of nature. <br/><br/>Another great thing about this tour is the instructor-to-guide ratio. This trip's maximum group size is six and each trip has two guides, so there’s one guide for every three photographers. This means you can expect close guidance and even tailored tuition.",
