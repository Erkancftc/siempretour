  "generalInfo": "This two week Namibia safari holiday has been carefully crafted to take in coast and desert, wildlife and wilderness while offering you the choice between camping along the way, or staying in lodges and hotels. No matter which one you choose, the places you visit will have one thing in common. They are all stunning. Starting in Windhoek we see these dramatic landscapes almost immediately, heading south across the Namib-Naukluft Park, where the great Namib Desert spreads out in all directions. This part of the trip also includes a visit to the dunes of Sossusvlei, some of the highest in the world, with views across centuries-old camelthorn tree skeletons and seas of sand. <br/><br/>Journeying north again and following the coast, our first urban stop after the desert is the coastal town of Swakopmund, known for being Namibia's adventure capital. This is your free day, with optional activities such as dune boarding, skydiving and camel riding.<br/><br/>The inland deserts and mountains call once more, our next stop being in Damaraland, which is not only home to the county’s highest peak, Brandberg, but also desert elephants. There are plenty more of those to be found in the country’s most celebrated wildlife zone, Etosha National Park. The name translates as 'Great White Place', because of its vast white, salt encrusted Etosha Pan, a dry lakebed that takes up much of the park and attracts over 140 species of mammal. During the three days that we spend here, you have chances to see lions, wildebeest, zebra elephants, black and white rhinos and the endemic black-faced impala.<br/><br/>More spectacular wildlife experiences await on the last couple of days of this trip, before heading back to Windhoek. First, the Waterburg Plateau with hiking trails that take you to the top of this flat topped landscape with panoramic views, or you can take an optional game drive through the reserve that has protected the endangered white rhino. And last, but certainly not least, the AfriCat Foundation which is a sanctuary for carnivores. Seeing a cheetah on your last day in Namibia isn’t a bad finale to an amazing adventure. <br/><br/>",

      "description": "Begin your adventure at Arebbusch Lodge in Windhoek. Spend the afternoon exploring or relaxing, perhaps taking a dip in the pool or watching the many native birds that swoop overhead. Around 6pm, say hello to your tour leader and fellow travellers, when we gather as a group for the first time to get to know each other and learn more about the adventures ahead. Your tour leader then ensures a big Namibian welcome by arranging a group dinner. Want more time in Windhoek? Secure pre-tour hotel nights through your sales representative.

      "description": "Today we spend much of our time in the Namib Desert. Rising early, we catch the tallest dunes in the world in the best light and can climb one as the sun rises. We can then either walk to Hiddenvlei as a group (a round journey of 1hr 45min) or catch a 4×4 transfer (optional extra) to Deadvlei, where ancient acacia trees form an eerie desert scene. If we’re lucky, we may see gemsbok or ostrich among the dunes. In the afternoon, join a guide to see the cheetahs at the Namib Carnivore Conservation Centre; depending on time, we may go tomorrow morning. We then continue to our next camp approximately one-hour away. Driving: 124mi (200km); three hours Accommodation: Solitaire Guest Farm Campsite (or similar)"

      "description": "We begin our day with a short drive to Brandberg, where we enjoy a walk through a valley for approximately 90 minutes. Along the way, we view beautiful, granite formations and a variety of birdlife. The valley takes us to the White Lady rock painting which, along with several other small paintings and engravings, are thought to have been left by San hunter-gatherers at least 2,000 years ago (please note that if elephants walk into this area then it might be too dangerous to do the walk- in this case we will typically go on a game drive looking for elephants). After, we drive towards the Khorixas area, where we should pass various Himba and Herero women selling crafts from the roadside. We may also spot desert elephants and meerkats on the way.
