Formal campsites have hot and cold showers, laundry facilities &amp; telephones.4 nights guest house accommodation, twin bedrooms with en suite facilities on bed and breakfast basis. Meals - 13 breakfasts, 11 lunches and 9 dinners will be provided by the crew, prepared at the vehicle and eaten around the campfire. (3o f these breakfasts are provided by the guest houses). Transport - Due to Namibian gravel roads we mostly run this tour in custom-built Safari trucks with 12 seats; or (on 5% of tours) Mercedes Sprinter minibuses with 12 forward facing seats and air-conditioning. Limited participation - An essential part of your safari is some participation. From putting up your tent to packing the truck in the morning–it’s all part of your adventure. There are some long travel days which means early morning starts so we all need to get involved to make the day run efficiently. Your tour leaders will do all the meal preparation but we do ask the clients to help (on rotation) with the washing up<br/>",
