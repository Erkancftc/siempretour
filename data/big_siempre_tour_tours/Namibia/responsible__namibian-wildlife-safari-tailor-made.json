  "generalInfo": "Wonder at the giant sand dunes of Sossusvlei, find the bizarre animals of the Namib Desert, explore the vastness of Etosha on safari and traverse the rugged Damaraland on this Namibian Adventure<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife safaris of Southern Africa including Namibia. Namibia is a vast country with some of the most photogenic and stunning scenery anywhere in the world. Home to one of the world’s largest national parks and the world’s oldest desert the seemingly barren Namibian wilderness is alive with wildlife. This tour is an exploration around some of the most iconic and beautiful places in this wonderful country.<br/>Unlike many other safari destinations in Africa it is not just the wildlife that is mesmerising here, instead the landscape plays a major role in bringing the wildlife and the wilderness to life. Whether it is the colossal orange sand dunes of Sossusvlei or the eerie petrified trees of Deadvlei, the very moon like eroded hills and canyons north of Swakopmund or indeed the vast rugged terrain of Damarland and the white empty expanse of the Etosha Pan, there is incredible and unique landscapes all over Namibia.<br/>Being mostly a desert environment Namibia it is easy to think of the country as being devoid of life, certainly it is hard to believe that the country could boast the largest population of rhinos in the world (outside of protected parks), or large numbers of elephants, lions, leopards, cheetahs and other iconic African wildlife. But that is Namibia, a land of contradictions a land of extreme environments which has led to the evolution of wildlife that has come up with some incredible adaptations to survive. Including handstanding beetles, cartwheeling spiders, dancing lizards, sand-swimming lizards and sidewinding snakes among others. On this trip you will be taken to see some of the smallest but most bizarre inhabitants of the desert as well as enjoying many game drives in the presence of elephants, giraffes, lions, rhinos and other large African wildlife. Namibia is truly a unique destination and with the help of our expert naturalist guides, people with an intimate knowledge of the wildlife and habitats you will be visiting, we know you will be great hands when it comes to getting the most out of this Namibian safari. <br/>There are so many different places to visit in Namibia, this is itinerary hits all of the key destinations, however if you wish to visit other places we are experts are tailoring wildlife and cultural tours to Namibia to suit any requirement. All you have to do is to get in touch with your budget and your group size and where you would like to go and we will come back to you with an itinerary and quote for your perfect Namibian wildlife safari tour.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Windhoek and Swakopmund. We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers and game drives. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Namibia (and elsewhere in Southern Africa). Your naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the Namibian wilderness, night safaris are available in Etosha, however they are only available with the park services and it is a first come first basis and so you will have to speak to your guide on arrival there and book places on these (this is not included). A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>There are reasons to visit Namibia at any time of year, however we prefer to visit in October – November where the temperatures are a little cooler and the wildlife plentiful. <br/>Namibia has more than 300 days of sunshine per year. It is situated at the southern edge of the tropics; the Tropic of Capricorn cuts the country about in half. The winter (June–August) is generally dry, both rainy seasons occur in summer, the small rainy season between September and November, the big one between February and April. Humidity is low, and average rainfall varies from almost zero in the coastal desert to more than 600mm in the Caprivi Strip. <br/>Weather and climate in the coastal area are dominated by the cold, north-flowing Benguela Current of the Atlantic Ocean which accounts for very low precipitation (&lt;50mm per year), frequent dense fog, and overall lower temperatures than in the rest of the country. In winter, occasionally a condition known as Berg wind or Oosweer occurs, a hot dry wind blowing from the inland to the coast. As the area<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist guides as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it. We do our best to include as many wildlife activities as possible in all of our itineraries.<br/>• Depending on budget and interest we have a range of different accommodation packages to offer, from luxury top end lodges, national park safari lodges and camps which often offer unbelievable wildlife watching deep inside national parks as well as camping. A mobile camping safari of Namibia is very popular and all of your camping gear will be provided.<br/>• Spend all the daylight hours searching for wildlife and visiting various natural wonders and stunning landscapes.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our Namibian wildlife safaris a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Southern Africa so that we can try and find and observe some of the rarer and more elusive species. We have great itineraries and expertise in all Southern African countries (Namibia, South Africa, Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Mozambique) and can arrange trips to find some of the rarer species such as aardvarks, aardwolves, brown hyenas and black-footed cats among other species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour visit various locations within Namibia. We will start and end the trip in the capital Windhoek and then move westwards into the desert and the incredible Sossusvlei sand dunes, then the Namib Desert and the quaint coastal town of Swakopmund. From here we head inland through the rugged Damaraland to the wonderful Etosha National Park. This is a true exploration of Namibia and its major wildlife locations.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from a vehicle and whilst there is some walking, most of the walking is over flat sand or rock. However you are welcome to walk up the iconic sand dunes in Sossusvlei if you wish. However even this is not too difficult and requires no special fitness level. The longest hike is to Deadvlei and this is around 2 hours there and back and the walk is mostly flat. The biggest consideration is the heat, it is very hot in the deserts of Namibia during the day.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 12 Years Old",

      "description": "Damaraland / Twyfelfontein - This morning we will leave Swakopmund and head north along the world famous Skel¬eton Coast; so called from the large numbers of whale and seal bones that littered the beaches from the days of whaling and sealing. Nowadays there are ‘skeletons’ of many ships that have been shipwrecked here over the years. The first place we will visit along this road is the Cape Cross fur seal colony, this is the largest seal colony in Africa and also one of the few in the world that is located in a desert. It is bizarre to see around 210,000 seals in the desert. Continuing on we will inland and into the heart of Damaraland where the ranges of sweeping vistas or windswept dunes and rugged canyons with richly coloured volcanic rocks and extensive mountain ranges are as wild and remote as it gets in the modern world. The area around here is very delicate to over exploitation as most of the ground is covered in hundreds of species of lichen that when driven over or stood on can be damaged for decades with their slow growth rates. The lichen fields here change colour with the coastal fogs push inland and the li-chens catch the droplets and spring back to life for their dormant states in between the mists. If we have time this afternoon we will visit the Twyfelfontein area and the UNESCO World Heritage Site with over 2,500 rock carvings and painting made by the ancient bushmen who inhabited this for over 6,000 years. Don’t worry if we don’t make it here this afternoon because we will visit the site the following morning. The petroglyphs were made by the hunter-gatherers and then later by Khoikhoi herders, the rocks here have been used by both cultures as a place of worship and a site of shamanist rituals. The area is one of the most culturally and his¬torically important sites in the world and a reminder that this area was not always this barren and sparse as some of the carvings depict hippos, giraffes, antelopes and lions.

      "description": "Etosha National Park – This morning you will travel further into the heart of Namibia, once again the stunning geology of the country will take centre stage until you all of sudden start to see the horizon flatten down and vegetation become a little more prominent. It is now that we are near to Etosha. This is a huge park (over 22,000km2) and is one of Africa’s most im¬portant reserves with thousands of animals including many of Africa’s most iconic species includ¬ing lions, elephants, black rhino, giraffes, leopards, cheetahs, spotted hyenas, zebra and several species of antelope; the birdlife is also prolific here, with raptors being commonly seen. Today we will travel to Okaukuejo safari camp, just to get to the park we will be on game drive and then after arriving we will check in and then head out for an afternoon game drive.

      "description": "Okonjima Wildlife Reserve - We will depart from Etosha National Park after breakfast, arriving at Okonjima in time for lunch. This private lodge and reserve is the home of the wonderful Africat Foundation. The Africat foundation is a non-profit organisation committed to the long-term conservation and preservation of Namibia’s large carnivores, especially cheetahs and leopards. After checking in and lunch we will have an activity this afternoon. The activities we can choose from (and choose on the day) include either tracking a cheetah or leopard on foot in the reserve, or viewing the veterinary work undertaken by the foundation. Then this evening we will have our final dinner in Namibia in this wonderful lodge. Okonjima is one of the most relaxing and luxurious lodge in the whole of Africa and an ideal way to wind down and end a great safari of Namibia. By staying here we will also get an insight of the work being done in various places around Africa in terms of top predator conservation and research. The leopards, lions, cheetahs, hyenas and African wild dogs throughout the country are persecuted by farmers and other livestock owners and so projects such as Africat are of incredible importance and the benefits are being felt here with increasing numbers of predators and also a better understanding and appreciation of them and their part in the ecosystem by the local people. (breakfast and dinner are included)"
