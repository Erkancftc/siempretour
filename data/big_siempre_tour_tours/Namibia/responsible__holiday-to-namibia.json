As we progress the landscape changes dramatically from rolling hills to farmland, before reaching the arid, red sands of the Namib Desert. Arriving as the temperature is dropping we’ll have time to enjoy the facilities of our lodge, set within an area of dramatic rocky outcrops of massive granite boulders. Approx. 6.5 hours driving."

      "description": "Sossusvlei, Deadvlei and Sesriem Canyon: We have an early start to reach the iconic red dune fields of Sossusvlei this morning, arriving as the morning light illuminates the rolling hills. There is an opportunity to climb Dune 45 before the full heat of the day and enjoy a new perspective on the surrounding landscape from its peak. From here we take a (bumpy!) jeep drive to visit the dried-up clay pan of Dead Vlei which provides dramatic photo opportunities. Later, we visit Sesriem Canyon for a short walk through the stunning rock formations. Carved by the Tsauchab River, the canyon is about 30 meters deep and one of the only permanent water sources in the area. We return to our hotel where we can enjoy some time to relax and enjoy the facilities before dinner this evening."

Here we will take a wildlife cruise onto the lagoon to spot some of the creatures that thrive in the cold water. As well as an abundance of bird life we hope to spot whales and dolphins and we’ll pass close to the local seal colony. After an early buffet lunch aboard, and the chance to sample the local seafood we’ll head back to dry land and return to Swakopmund. The afternoon/evening will be spent at your leisure, with the chance to take part in many activities that are offered here or take it easy and explore the picturesque town.

After travelling north along the remote coastline, we cut inland to make our way to to the UNESCO World Heritage Site at Twyfelfontein. Here we’ll find one of the largest concentrations of Stone Age petroglyphs (rock engravings) anywhere in Africa, depicting various animals and hunting scenes. This area is home to a good variety of wildlife who have adapted to the arid climate and we hope to spot many of them on our journey. Today will be a long day with some poor road conditions, but with beautiful scenery to enjoy along the way. We have dinner on arrival at our lodge, where we will be spending the next two nights. Approx. 8.5 hours driving"

We leave early to ensure we arrive at Epupa by the middle of the afternoon - the most northerly point on our trip and close to the Angolan border. In the evening, approximately an hour before sunset, we visit Epupa Falls and then take a jeep ride to the top of one of the hills overlooking the waterfalls for a sundowner.

Here we will have a local Himba guide during our visit and find out more about how these semi-nomadic people live, work and worship. We can enjoy an informal Q&A with our guide, providing not only the opportunity for us to learn about their rich culture and customs but also providing an income for members of the community. We pick up useful supplies, such as maize meal, tea, sugar, coffee, cooking oil and yeast, before heading into one of the rural Himba villages to offer these gifts up in exchange for a mutually beneficial interaction and introduction to everyday life in this part of the country. After our visit we can enjoy some free time at the lodge to unwind and relax amongst this beautiful setting."

This afternoon we will enjoy an afternoon jeep safari. Because the region is so arid, the game congregates around the watering holes and we should have a chance of spotting 4 of the big 5, along with some of the 114 mammal species, 340 bird species, 110 reptile species and 16 amphibian species during our visit. We'll return to our lodge just outside the park for the evening."
