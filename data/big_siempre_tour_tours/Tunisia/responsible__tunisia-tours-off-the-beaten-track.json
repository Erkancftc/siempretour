  "generalInfo": "A popular beach holiday destination, Tunisia isn’t what springs to mind when it comes to off the beaten track travel, but there’s more on offer than just its Mediterranean coastline. Home to shady oak forests and a section of the Sahara, the landscapes of Africa’s northernmost country are varied and even otherworldly in places, comprising golden deserts, lush oases, brightly coloured salt flats and rugged mountains. <br/><br/>Inhabited by the ancient Berbers and settled by some of the world’s great civilisations, Tunisia is rich in history and we spend time exploring the Phoenician city of Carthage, once a powerful trading port, as well as the remains of its Roman towns and cities from extraordinary underground villas to hillside ruins. We explore the spiritual centre of Kairouan which houses one of the most important mosques in the country, visit the charming blue and white village of Sidi Bou Said, and discover vibrant medinas jam packed with history. <br/><br/>Further south we discover a more traditional way of life, away from the cities. Around Tozeur we explore isolated Berber villages in the mountains and then head into the mighty Sahara Desert to spend a night amongst the dunes. In the Dahar Mountains we see centuries old cave dwellings which are still home to local people, and visit the ancient fortified granaries of the Tatouine region, experiencing a side of Tunisia that few venture far enough to see.<br/><br/>Heading back north, we visit the island of Djerba – the legendary ‘land of the lotus eaters’ from Greek mythology – and the superbly preserved Roman amphitheatre at El Jem.<br/><br/>A trip that will challenge your preconceptions about this North African gem.",
