      "title": "Full day in Tunis. Visit the Bardo museum, explore the Sidi Bou Said district, renowned for its cobbled streets and al fresco cafes and visit ancient Carthage",
      "description": ": Following this morning's welcome meeting, we'll head to the recently reopened Bardo national museum. Housed in a grand palace, the Bardo is home to a rich collection of artefacts, with over 1000 mosaics and treasures collected through the ages from sites across Tunisia. We continue to Sidi Bou Said on the coast perched on a cliff, where scarlet bougainvillea cascade over the white and blue walls of the narrow streets, and colourful shops overflow with carpets, pottery and jewellery line the winding streets. We'll explore this picturesque village on foot and then head for lunch at a restaurant with panoramic views looking out onto the Gulf of Tunis. After lunch we drive to ancient Carthage, located a short distance from the Sidi Bou Said neighbourhood. Founded around 1000 BC, Carthage grew to be the most important and powerful trading centre on the Mediterranean. The mighty fleet of hundreds of armed ships was an efficient deterrent against invaders for many centuries. Its geographical situation as the gateway to Africa (today only six hours by boat from Sicily), meant that it was a crucial strategic post which the Romans fought hard to attain. After the third and final Punic war the Romans sacked Carthage in 146 BC, destroying much of the old town. Today many of the ruins date from the Roman period but we'll also see the two ancient Punic harbours, once the very foundation of Carthaginian prosperity as well as the Punic tophet, the Antonin baths, the amphitheatre, residential areas and the acropolis of Byrsa."

      "title": "Drive to Kairouan in northern Tunisia’s inland desert, visiting Dougga enroute, famed for its archaeological sites",
      "description": ": After breakfast we bid Tunis farewell, heading to Dougga and the Andalousian city of Testourand, one of the best preserved Roman archaeological sites in North Africa. The site itself sits within a fertile valley surrounded by olive groves. The main attraction is the imposing 3500 seat theatre built in the 2nd century, there are ruins from several periods in history some predating the Roman era with temples, well preserved streets and cisterns that were built to meet the ancient cities ever growing demand for water. Given how complete the site is, you really get a feel for how life must have been almost 2000 years ago. Please note there is very little shade in Dougga so it's worth being prepared with a hat and sun cream, the site is still being excavated, sturdy footwear is recommended. After lunch we continue driving south to Kairouan, the holiest city in Tunisia, which retains a strong spiritual feel. It is also the birthplace of great poets and doctors of religious law, echoing the traditional Islamic link between Art and Faith. We aim to get to Kairouan by 5pm in time to enjoy our hotel tonight. The Hotel La Kasbah in Kairouan blends traditional architecture with modern comfort. Located near historic sites, it offers spacious rooms, a relaxing courtyard and an outdoor pool all within very close proximity to the medina."

      "title": "Visit the impressive Great Mosque of Kairouan and the city's ancient medina. Continue to the desert oasis town of Tozeur",
      "description": ": This morning we take a sightseeing tour of Kairouan. We start by driving to the Aghlabid Pools and walking up to the stunning Abou Zomaa mosque followed by a visit to the Great Mosque of Kairouan, the 4th holiest Islamic centre after Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem. Originally constructed in the seventh century, the mosque has a myriad of columns and arabesque bas reliefs surrounding an immense marble courtyard. Heading through the imposing archway in the walled ramparts, we enter the labyrinth of the old medina and covered market. Here traditional crafts such as copper and silver engraving, carpet weaving and saddle making are carried out by skilled craftsmen. This is a good place to stop for a coffee scented with rose water or try a local delicacy 'makroudh'. They are small wheat cakes soaked in honey and stuffed with dates. Bidding Kairouan farewell, we will continue our journey south, travelling through vast olive tree plantations and passing through small villages where Tunisian rural life unfolds in much the same way as it has done for generations. Tozeur, our base for the next two nights, is an oasis town and is the capital of the south. In recent years Tozeur has become a busting tourist destination. During your free time here you may wish to visit a street market as this is the place to pick up some exotic bargains but you must be sure to barter!"

      "title": "View the salt flats at Chott El Jerid, continue to Douz to join a 4 WD safari to our desert camp",
      "description": ": This morning, we cross the vast 3400 square kilometre Chott-el-Jerid salt flats, the largest in the Sahara, along the way we visit an artesian well where fresh groundwater is forced to the surface under pressure from the sediment below. We continue the oasis town of Douz, breaking for lunch. Transferring to 4 WD vehicles, and taking just enough luggage for our one-night stay in the desert, we drive out into the vastness of the Sahara where we spend the night in a desert camp. Climb the sand dunes behind the camp or enjoy a sundowner as the sun sets over the dunes. This evening, enjoy a delicious dinner served under the magnificent night sky. With virtually no light pollution this is a great spot for star gazing, with quiet locations around the camp to enjoy the blanket of stars above. We'll stay in a camp with spacious well appointed twin share and single tents, ten of the tents have simple ensuite toilet attached, where we need more than ten tents, we will use additional tents with shared facilities. Blankets and pillows are provided. During the winter months, it can get cold in the desert so warm clothing is recommended. Dinner is included and there is a licensed bar that serves alcohol. There is no Wi-Fi signal at the camp, it's the perfect location to switch off, immersed in the tranquil setting amongst the sand dunes."

      "description": ": Departing our desert camp after breakfast, we drive in 4 WD's through the sand dunes and open plains of the desert, retracing a route back to Douz where we are reunited with our vehicle. Our destination today is Sfax, making a stop in the tiny stone village of Tamezret, perched on a hill with the pink and blue mountain of Djebel Tabaga in the distance. Matmata is our next stop with its distinctive 'invisible village' first recorded in the 4th century. Camouflaged by the sandy pockmarked landscape and situated within craters, you can find around 50 or so underground dwellings. Home to one of the oldest Berber tribes, many of the caves are still in use today. Circular pits with vertical walls have been dug out of the sandstone and a sunken courtyard created with tunnels cutting into the walls to form caves and rooms. This subterranean home is cool in the summer and warm in the winter. Continuing to the coastal town of Sfax, our hotel tonight is a modern resort style property. Dinner is included and there is a licensed bar that serves alcohol."

      "title": "Visit the Zaghouan Aqueduct. Return to Tunis to explore its ancient medina",
      "description": ": Departing Sousse after breakfast we return to Tunis, stopping off to see the Zaghouan Aqueduct enroute. The Zaghouan Aqueduct is an ancient Roman marvel built in the 2nd century AD to supply water to Carthage from the Zaghouan mountain springs. Spanning over 130 kilometres, it is one of the longest and best-preserved Roman aqueducts. Ingeniously engineered with bridges, tunnels, and siphons, it showcases Roman architectural and hydraulic expertise. Visitors today can explore its remains near the village of Oudna, gaining insight into Tunisia's rich Roman heritage and the importance of water management in antiquity. We continue our journey back to Tunis. As well as being a modern dynamic city, Tunis still retains its distinctive Arab flavour with colourful souks crammed with everything from crafts, household wares to spices and baklava. This morning we head out on foot on a walking tour of Tunis' historic medina, with its labyrinth of streets and alleyways in the heart of the old city. The medina contains over 700 monuments, mosques and palaces including the stunning Ez-Zitouna mosque which we view from the outside. The afternoon is left free to further explore Tunis in our own pace. As this is the last day of the trip there is the option to head out as a group for a farewell group meal."
