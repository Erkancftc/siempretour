  "generalInfo": "Embark on an unforgettable 8-day private journey from the spiritual heart of Tibet to the foot of the world’s highest mountain. This carefully crafted Lhasa to Everest Base Camp tour blends profound cultural immersion with awe-inspiring natural grandeur, designed for travelers seeking both adventure and meaning. Begin in Lhasa (3,650m), where you’ll explore the majestic Potala Palace—once home to the Dalai Lamas—and wander the sacred Barkhor Street alongside pilgrims. Visit Drepung and Sera monasteries to witness centuries-old Buddhist traditions, including the lively monks’ debates. As you acclimatize, the route unfolds through the stunning Tibetan plateau: picnic beside the turquoise waters of Yamdrok Lake, marvel at the Karola Glacier, and step into the daily life of a local farming family near Gyantse. In Shigatse, discover Tashilhunpo Monastery, seat of the Panchen Lama, before continuing toward the Himalayas. The climax arrives at Rongbuk Monastery—the world’s highest—where you’ll spend an evening under starlit skies gazing at Mount Everest’s north face. Wake before dawn to watch the first golden rays crown the summit, a moment of pure transcendence. Throughout the journey, travel in a comfortable private vehicle with large windows for panoramic views, stay in handpicked Tibetan-run lodgings, and benefit from the insights of knowledgeable local guides. Every element of this itinerary is thoughtfully paced to support safe altitude acclimatization while fostering genuine connections with people and place. More than just a trek to EBC, this is a pilgrimage across landscapes and cultures that have shaped Tibetan identity for millennia—a rare chance to experience the “Roof of the World” with depth, respect, and wonder.",
