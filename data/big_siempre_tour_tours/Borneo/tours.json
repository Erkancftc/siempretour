    "generalInfo": "Kuching - Semenggoh Wildlife Centre - Bako National Park - Kuching - Batang Ai - Kuching<br/><br/>Journey to the wild heart of Borneo on this exciting adventure. Sarawak may be less visited than than popular neighbouring state, Sabah. However, it is no less remarkable, encompassing many of the highlights of this incredibly diverse island. This is an excellent base to experience both the famous wildlife and dramatic scenery of the region, as well as the unique culture, food and towns. <br/><br/>Your trip begins in Kuching, capital of Sarawak. Named after the nations favourite pet cats, the city boasts a lovely waterfront, many Chinese temples, stunning mosques, bazaars, great food and traditional architecture.<br/><br/>A highlight of the trip lies just a stones throw from the town. Semenggoh Wildlife Centre is a leading player in the conservation of the exquisite, endangered Orangutan. The centre is home to semi-wild orangutans, many orphaned, injured and rescued from illegal captivity to be taught how to survive in the forest again.<br/><br/>Next, journey further into Sarawak to explore Bako national park, famous for a diverse monkey population, most notably the cheeky proboscis monkey. Enjoy a couple of nights immersed in the incredible soundscape of the jungle.<br/><br/>A truly unique element of this trip is a homestay with a local Iban tribe, deep into the Sarawak rainforest of Batang Ai. This is a once in a lifetime experience that includes a longtail boat trip, trekking, visiting colourful markets and learning first hand what life in the tribe is like. If you don't fancy the simple mattress and mozzie net in a traditional Iban longhouse (although the experience is fantastic!) we do have other options here- just ask your travel specialist. You may even see wild orangutans hanging about your home.<br/><br/>This week long adventure is the perfect way to visit the lesser known highlights of Malaysian Borneo on a schedule. And if you still have time to spare, why not couple with a Sabah itinerary for the best overview of the country?",

You’ll sleep in hammocks, tents and mountain huts, and feast on traditional cuisine. The destination is Mt. Kinabalu, the tallest mountain in the Malaysian archipelago, which you’ll climb in time to catch daybreak on the summit, and stunning views all the way down to the South China Sea. Heading back down afterwards, perhaps try the Via Ferrata on the mountain, and certainly don’t miss the soothing hot springs back at your accommodation.<br/><br/>Many tours might end on this accomplishment, but this trip goes far beyond. Explore a renowned wildlife reserve, where orang-utans, crocodiles and elephants are regularly seen, take a dawn river cruise as the proboscis monkeys come to life, and visit an orang-utan sanctuary in time for lunch.<br/><br/>Arriving back in Kota Kinabalu, you’ll have a day to recharge your batteries, doing as little or as much as you feel like. Some last-minute shopping and sightseeing perhaps, mountain biking, or just chilling by the hotel pool. <br/>",

We start, however, on Borneo, landing in Sandakan, but transferring immediately to Sepilok, the largest wildlife sanctuary of its kind in the world, thanks to its rescuing of injured or orphaned orangutans and then preparing them for life in the wild again. They do extraordinary work here, and along with the Sepilok Rainforest Discovery Centre, with its canopy walkway, it’s a wonderful introduction to wildlife and the jungles of Borneo. <br/><br/>From the sanctuary we move more deeply into the jungles, taking a cruise down the River Kinabatangan, home to pygmy elephants, primates and wonderful birdlife. Our last couple of days on Borneo are spent exploring some of its cultural heritage too, visiting the Sabah Tea Plantation at the foot of SE Asia’s highest mountain, Mt. Kinabalu, where we stay in a traditional Sabah longhouse.<br/><br/>The second half of our holiday is spent on the Malay Peninsula, flying into Kuala Lumpur, where we spend a couple of days later in the week taking a guided tour of all its wonderful sites. But first we transfer to Malacca, a former fishing village that is now a bustling multi-cultural city, but with colonial history and architecture, particularly in its UNESCO old centre. <br/><br/>We then take a train to another city of George Town, the capital of Penang region which is actually on an island. This is the artistic hub of Malaysia, but with a fusion of fine food, beach life, cultural festivals and art galleries, making it a wonderful place to spend time. And a very different world from the part of Malaysia where you started your trip.

    "generalInfo": "The name Borneo conjures up images of impenetrable jungles and exotic wildlife, which there is of course plenty of, but the island also has much more to offer. This itinerary explores the states of Sarawak and Sabah, in Malaysian Borneo, where you will discover minority cultures, sumptuous street food, magical caves, paradise islands and colourful wildlife. <br/><br/>Begin in Sarawak’s ‘Cat City’, Kuching, which is home to the island’s most diverse range of cuisine and the world’s highest concentration of cat statues. Meaning ‘cat’ in the mainland Malay language, Kuching is the regional capital and gateway for exploration of Sarawak. You will explore the city’s rich colonial history and ethnic diversity, as well as its rural outskirts, by bicycle. After this you will have time at leisure to explore the shops, cafes, markets and waterfront, all within easy walking distance from one another. <br/><br/>Next, head deeper into Sarawak to Batang Ai National Park, home to the indigenous Iban minority. Here you will visit a local community, join some of them during their daily activities and stay overnight in a longhouse. The next day you will trek into the forest and learn about the local flora before heading back towards Kuching. Spend the night in Sri Aman to break the journey and then visit the Semonggoh Wildlife Centre enroute back to the city. The centre rehabilitates and releases wildlife, such as orangutans, back into the forest.<br/><br/>The next stage of your adventure involves flying to Sarawak’s remote northeast, home to Mulu National Park. Here you’ll spend a couple of days exploring an array of limestone caves hidden in forested valleys, before flying yet further northeast into the state of Sabah. Your first port of call is Sepilok, home to yet another orangutan rehabilitation centre, in case you weren’t lucky enough to spot them in Sarawak, as well as the Sun Bear Conservation Centre. <br/><br/>From Sepilok you will continue overland to the Kinabatangan River, a protected area which many would argue is the best place in Malaysian Borneo to spot wildlife. Spend a couple of days here strolling along boardwalks, visiting oxbow lakes and scanning riverbanks for signs of life from inside your boat. The itinerary ends with a few nights on tropical Gaya Island, which has some beautiful white sandy beaches and is located next to a marine national park, which has excellent diving and snorkelling opportunities.",

These are linked by a walkway to the Sunbird Café Rooms complete with private balcony and hot water shower, a real luxury in the forest. Following lunch, visit the Lipad mud volcano which serves as a mineral salt lick for wildlife. After trekking through the jungle for twenty minutes, arrive at the elevated bare area of the mud volcano. Try to identify the multitude of animal footprints here. Those people adventurous enough can experiment with the effect of the volcanic mud, said to be responsible for a fine complexion. Walk up to the observation tower and admire the contrasting landscape of the volcanic area with the surrounding thick forest where a variety of birds are commonly sighted. You may see footprints of wild boars, elephants and deer. Tabin has seven mud volcanoes and salt springs with a high mineral content. This mud volcano is the size of a soccer-field.

    "generalInfo": "Explore the forests of Sabah, Borneo in search of the enigmatic clouded leopards as well as the many other rare species of mammals in Borneo.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in wildlife tours and expedition style wildlife trips for some of the world’s rarest species of mammals including Sunda clouded leopards, Sun bears, Flat-headed cats, Sunda leopard cats and Marbled cats on this particular tour. These trips are specialist and focus and we try very hard for all of our targets. This trip requires a good amount of spotlighting after dark, as many of our targeted species are nocturnal. <br/><br/>We have worked with local guides and scientists to develop the itinerary and using all known information about the species of mammals including rare mammals in Borneo we have developed systems and techniques to best find our main targets. <br/><br/>Borneo is a mecca for wildlife enthusiasts, species such as Bornean orangutan, Proboscis monkeys, ‘Pygmy’ elephants and 8 species of hornbill are all wonderful targets for anyone visiting Borneo for wildlife. However there is a vast wealth of wildlife to be found here. In particular the north-east state of Sabah is home to many wild and rugged reserves and parks that harbour populations of some of the world’s most elusive species.<br/>Among the most elusive and some of the most sought after are the nocturnal mammal species, Borneo has a host of rare and elusive nocturnal mammals including Sunda clouded leopard, Binturong, Sunda colugo, various species of civet, several species of slow loris and many other species. This tour is the first of its kind to target all of these species. Of course seeing many of these rarer animals is going to be very hard and require a great amount of luck, but this is the first and only tour that offers chances and dedicated time to try and see all of them in their various habitats, as well as a wealth of other mammal life in this wonderful region.<br/><br/>This tour will start in the fantastic forests of Tabin, here the combination of pristine forest and palm oil plantation (running along the border of the reserve) means there is a mix of wildlife and many species (which utilize the palm oil plantation) which are seen here easier than elsewhere. We will explore this reserve in full and have negotiated extra long night drives whilst here in order to make the most of the wonderful nocturnal species which are known from here.<br/><br/>We then move on to the longest river in Borneo the magnificent and mighty Kinabatangan River where we will try for the Flat-headed cat as well as some of Sabah’s incredible primates such as Bornean orangutans, proboscis monkeys and Sundiac silvered langurs.<br/><br/>Then we finish at the now fabled Deramakot Forest Reserve, this managed forest has good sized populations of all of many species of mammals, particular ones that are very elusive elsewhere. Whilst staying here we will become as nocturnal as many of our mammal targets and spend several hours every night looking for Sunda clouded leopards, various species of squirrel, civets, Sunda leopard cats, Philippine slow loris and Marbled cats.<br/>If you wish you can also add on a pre-tour extension which will head into the rugged Tawau Hills. This park is full of wonderful wildlife, much of which is not found in other areas visited on this tour, it is also a known location for just about the most elusive mammal in Borneo. The extremely rare and poorly understand Bay cat. A separate brochure can be sent with information about this can be sent out to you if you are interested.<br/><br/>Whilst our focus will be heavily on the rarer nocturnal species of mammals, it is impossible to travel and spend time in the forests of Borneo and not see various other species. As a result we hope to see more common animals like Proboscis monkey, Bornean orangutan, Bornean slow loris, Marooon langur, Sundiac silvered langur, Southern pig-tailed macaques, Long-tailed macaques, Asiatic elephants, Bearded pigs, Bornean Muller’s gibbons and many more species and then when out spotlighting we hope for other rarities such as Sunda pangolins, Banded linsangs, various Civet species, moonrats and Sunda stink-badgers (but these require as much luck as perseverance); not to mention hundreds of species of birds including up to 8 species of hornbills found here and rare birds such as Storm’s stork and some huge reptiles like Saltwater crocodiles, Reticulated pythons and Water monitors.<br/><br/>All in all we expect to see a wealth of life on this trip and we believe that no wildlife enthusiast will be disappointed, as with all wildlife (but particularly rare and elusive species) all we can do is get ourselves into the best place, at the best time and with the best people. We then put the time and effort into trying to see the wildlife and hope that the animals cooperate.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Sandakan. There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Sabah. Your naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, cruises, guided walks, park entrance fees and spotlighting fees where mentioned on the itinerary. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around (including around 7 hours of spotlighting per night when in Deramakot) and extra-long night safaris in Tabin - these have been specifically negotiated; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the Bornean forests. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>We recommend this tour is run at the end of the dry season, which in North East Borneo is August – September. However Borneo is notorious for rain and we expect rain throughout the year. Local climates are affected by the presence of mountain ranges throughout Malaysia, and climate can be divided into that of the highlands, the lowlands, and coastal regions. The coasts have a sunny climate, with temperatures ranging between 23-32°C (73.4-89.6°F), and rainfall ranging from 10-30cm (4-12in) a month. The lowlands have a similar temperature, but follow a more distinctive rainfall pattern and show very high humidity levels. The highlands are cooler and wetter, and display a greater temperature variation. A large amount of cloud cover is present over the highlands, which have humidity levels that do not fall below 75%.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it.<br/>• We will stay in a variety of accommodation when on this tour, from well established wildlife eco lodges to guest houses and chalets deep inside privately run forest reserves. <br/>• We will split our focus and activity depending on where we are and what we are looking for. For example in Deramakot, Tabin and Kinabatangan we will be spotlighting in the night. But we will also be focusing on daytime species in Tabin and Kinabatangan too, no other tour will offer as much time spent looking for wildlife in Borneo than this one.<br/>• We have specially negotiated extra-long night safaris in Tabin to further increase our chances of seeing nocturnal and rare species. <br/>• All the above reasons give this, our specialist tour for Borneo’s rarest wildlife including clouded leopards and other elusive mammal species a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Borneo so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the Sunda clouded leopard, Sunda leopard cat, flat-headed cat, marbled cat and bay cat and many more species. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Borneo at other times of year and focusing on other species such as otter civets and Hose’s civet and many other rare mammals of Borneo. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour visits 3 main areas in the province of Sabah in the north-eastern part of Malaysian Borneo. We will arrive into the town of Lahad Datu and fly out of Sandakan. In between we will visit Deramakot Forest Reserve, the Sakau region of the Kinabatangan River and also the Tabin Wildlife Reserve.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The majority of the wildlife activities will be done in a vehicle or boat and so there is no great level of physical fitness needed.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 Years Old",

        "description": "Lahad Datu / Tabin Wildlife Sanctuary - Today you will be collect from the airport in Ladah Datu and start our drive towards Tabin Wildlife Sanctuary. Once we get to the sanctuary we will check in, have lunch (depending on the time of everyone’s flights) and head out into the forest (the exact itinerary of our daytime activities is variable and may change but we will have a morning and afternoon excursion into the forest on each full day here); Today we may start with a guide walk with one of their expert local guides. Nestled within the rainforest beside the Lipad river, the resort is home to a surprising variety of birds, insects and small mammals, even right beside the buildings of the resort it is possible to see several species and discover the rich variety of jungle herbs, some endemic, used for generations by local folks for the treatment of various ailments. In the afternoon we are likely to visit the active Lipad mud volcano which provides a mineral salt lick for wildlife. After trekking through the rainforest for around 20 minutes, we arrive at the elevated bare area of the mud volcano which is frequented by wildlife (elephants, bearded pigs, sambar, muntjacs and other species) and birds. The adventurous among us can try the effects of the volcanic mud, said to be responsible for a fine complexion, by applying the mud to their skin. Trek back to the resort along elephant trail, which is a great way to experience the forest and spot elusive species that live in the dense forests here. We will have one pre dawn drive included over this couple of days as well. After dinner we will have our first extended night drive and try and find some of the nocturnal mammals which are abundant here. With luck it is possible for Sunda clouded leopards, flat-headed cats and sun bears here but it is more likely that we will find various flying squirrels, several species of civets, yellow-throated martens, Philippine slow loris as well as reptiles and amphibians."

        "description": "Kinabatangan River - This morning we will leave Tabin after breakfast and then depart towards the village of Sakau along the banks of the Kinabatangan River. On our arrival we will check in and then have lunch. Afterwards we will be taken on the river for our first river cruise / safari. The longest river in Sabah, Kinabatangan River measures 560 km from its headwaters in the Crocker Range of southwest Sabah to its outlet at the Sulu Sea on the East coast of Sabah and according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the Kinabatangan wildlife sanctuary is one of only two known places on Earth where 10 primate species can be found living wild. The enigmatic Bornean orangutan and the curious looking proboscis monkeys are the two most sought after primate species here however the ubiquitous long-tailed (or crab-eating) macaque is the most common. Other than the primates mammals are well represented here however most species are nocturnal or very elusive. The largest inhabitants are Borneo’s own endemic sub-species of Asiatic elephant (the Borneo pygmy elephant) which we will try to see and the incredibly rare and nearly mythical Sumatran rhino. Another fairly common and large inhabitant here is the largest reptile in the world, the saltwater crocodile. This part of the river traces through lowland forest and mangrove swamps near the coast provide sanctuary for them. With all these diversity going around, it is no wonder Kinabatangan wildlife sanctuary is the best destination to get close-up and discover its remarkable wildlife and fascinating habitats. Bird watchers usually find the Kinabatangan simply incredible while they spot incredible bird species from the famous Borneo's hornbills to the rare Storms storks. After our first trip this afternoon we will return to the camp for dinner and then after dark head out again in search of semi aquatic flat-headed cat. There are some tributaries and sections of the main river in which it may be possible to see flat-headed cats. We will have a spotlight and search the river banks, here we will probably see the glowing eyes of the crocodiles as they watch from the riverbanks and hopefully spot flat-headed cats and other elusive species such as otter civets. We will return to the camp for the night after a hopefully successful search."

        "description": "Gomatong Cave / Deramakot Forest Reserve - This morning we will depart after breakfast from the Kinabatangan River and travel to Gomantong Cave, this is one of the world’s most famous caves and was immortalised in the BBC’s Planet Earth series due to the enormous mountain of guano and the millions of cockroaches and other invertebrates that live there. The forests around the caves are home to many species of wildlife including orangutans, in fact wild orangutans can possibly be seen throughout the entire trip we are taking, so it is always worth keeping an eye out for them in all of the forests. The cave is some 90m high and full of wildlife, alongside the innumerable invertebrates including the odd looking long-legged centipedes there are four species of swiftlet (white-nest, black-nest, mossy-nest and white-bellied) and around 27 species of bats (mostly wrinkle-lipped bats which number around 2 million in the cave). The black-nest swiftlets are the species whose nests are collected and eaten as a delicacy in China and South East Asia. The nest harvests are done sustainably now and the method for collecting them involves the locals having to climb high up into the caves on a network of rickety ladders and ropes. The nearly self-sufficient ecosystem inside the cave is completed with predators including bat hawks and pythons that feed on the bats and swiftlets as they come and go from the caves. This 55,000 hectare reserve is home to many of Borneo’s large and iconic species including elephants, orangutans, Borneo gibbon, banteng and several elusive species which are seen here with more regularity than anywhere else in the world. It is these species which are the real highlight for us and our main targets when here. They are also largely nocturnal and so we will head out into the forest at night for extended drives. This is to maximise our chances of seeing the wonderful Sunda clouded leopard, sun bear and marbled cat, but along with these species several other rare species have been seen here such as Sunda colugo, Sunda pangolin, banded linsang among other incredible and rare species."

Although set in a remote primary rainforest it also manages to combine comfort, privacy and good food with high quality natural history interpretation making it an ideal property for wildlife enthusiasts. Depending on your enthusiasm, fitness and the weather, you can expect to do up to four activities in a day: one before and one after breakfast, one late afternoon followed by one in the evening (night walk). The lodge’s activities are flexible so you can request specific elements that you would like to include during your stay. Encounters with wildlife in their natural habitat are abundant within the trail network of the lodge (though not guaranteed). Highlights of your visit will include the canopy walkway, the ancient Kadazan-Dusun Tribal Burial Cliff and a perhaps a dip in the natural jacuzzi pool. After lunch, trek in one of the oldest remaining rainforests in the world and experience an exciting suspension walkway. Suspended 30-40 metres above the forest floor, the 300-metre long canopy walkway is a great place to see wildlife without having to crane your neck up to the treetops! This evening, weather permitting, embark upon a night drive in an open-air jeep to search out the nocturnal animals."

Trek to the Kadazandusun burial site, Coffin Cliff before proceeding to the view point for a bird's eye view of the Danum Valley and Borneo lowland rainforest area. It’s a 3km return trip, involving a 40 minute climb to a magnificent lookout point, but well worth it. Return to the lodge for lunch. This afternoon you have the option to head to the jacuzzi pool for a refreshing dip, located just 15 minutes from the lodge, or relax after your morning hike. Following lunch, embark upon a group trek along the Segama and East Trails in search of wildlife.

The park has some incredible statistics: it has more than 3,500 plant species, 8,000 types of fungi, and 170 orchid species. There are also 262 bird species, almost 300 butterfly species and many reptiles and mammals. Members of the Penan people also live within the park. They are a small population of nomadic forest dwellers who live as hunter-gatherers. There has been fierce international opposition to the Malaysian government who tried to settle them in permanent longhouses and indeed the Penan themselves have resisted. In 1994, they were granted an area of the forest where they could continue their traditional lifestyle. Although you are unlikely to meet these elusive people, you occasionally see their fishing shelters or areas in the forest where they have recently visited. This afternoon, relax in the park and listen to the weird and wonderful creatures that call it home or explore self-guided trails within the park. Those with a head for heights can try the optional canopy walkway. This 1,575ft (480m) high skywalk takes approximately two hours to complete.

    "placesVisited": "",
    "generalInfo": "Explore the forests of Sabah, Borneo in search of the enigmatic clouded leopards as well as the many other rare species of mammals in Borneo.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in wildlife tours and expedition style wildlife trips for some of the world’s rarest species of mammals including Sunda clouded leopards, Sun bears, Flat-headed cats, Sunda leopard cats and Marbled cats on this particular tour. These trips are specialist and focus and we try very hard for all of our targets. This trip requires a good amount of spotlighting after dark, as many of our targeted species are nocturnal. <br/><br/>We have worked with local guides and scientists to develop the itinerary and using all known information about the species of mammals including rare mammals in Borneo we have developed systems and techniques to best find our main targets. <br/><br/>Borneo is a mecca for wildlife enthusiasts, species such as Bornean orangutan, Proboscis monkeys, ‘Pygmy’ elephants and 8 species of hornbill are all wonderful targets for anyone visiting Borneo for wildlife. However there is a vast wealth of wildlife to be found here. In particular the north-east state of Sabah is home to many wild and rugged reserves and parks that harbour populations of some of the world’s most elusive species.<br/>Among the most elusive and some of the most sought after are the nocturnal mammal species, Borneo has a host of rare and elusive nocturnal mammals including Sunda clouded leopard, Binturong, Sunda colugo, various species of civet, several species of slow loris and many other species. This tour is the first of its kind to target all of these species. Of course seeing many of these rarer animals is going to be very hard and require a great amount of luck, but this is the first and only tour that offers chances and dedicated time to try and see all of them in their various habitats, as well as a wealth of other mammal life in this wonderful region.<br/>This tour will start in the fantastic forests of Tabin, here the combination of pristine forest and palm oil plantation (running along the border of the reserve) means there is a mix of wildlife and many species (which utilize the palm oil plantation) which are seen here easier than elsewhere. We will explore this reserve in full and have negotiated extra long night drives whilst here in order to make the most of the wonderful nocturnal species which are known from here.<br/>We then move on to the longest river in Borneo the magnificent and mighty Kinabatangan River where we will try for the Flat-headed cat as well as some of Sabah’s incredible primates such as Bornean orangutans, proboscis monkeys and Sundiac silvered langurs.<br/>Then we finish at the now fabled Deramakot Forest Reserve, this managed forest has good sized populations of all of many species of mammals, particular ones that are very elusive elsewhere. Whilst staying here we will become as nocturnal as many of our mammal targets and spend several hours every night looking for Sunda clouded leopards, various species of squirrel, civets, Sunda leopard cats, Philippine slow loris and Marbled cats.<br/>If you wish you can also add on a pre-tour extension which will head into the rugged Tawau Hills. This park is full of wonderful wildlife, much of which is not found in other areas visited on this tour, it is also a known location for just about the most elusive mammal in Borneo. The extremely rare and poorly understand Bay cat. A separate brochure can be sent with information about this can be sent out to you if you are interested.<br/>Whilst our focus will be heavily on the rarer nocturnal species of mammals, it is impossible to travel and spend time in the forests of Borneo and not see various other species. As a result we hope to see more common animals like Proboscis monkey, Bornean orangutan, Bornean slow loris, Marooon langur, Sundiac silvered langur, Southern pig-tailed macaques, Long-tailed macaques, Asiatic elephants, Bearded pigs, Bornean Muller’s gibbons and many more species and then when out spotlighting we hope for other rarities such as Sunda pangolins, Banded linsangs, various Civet species, moonrats and Sunda stink-badgers (but these require as much luck as perseverance); not to mention hundreds of species of birds including up to 8 species of hornbills found here and rare birds such as Storm’s stork and some huge reptiles like Saltwater crocodiles, Reticulated pythons and Water monitors.<br/>All in all we expect to see a wealth of life on this trip and we believe that no wildlife enthusiast will be disappointed, as with all wildlife (but particularly rare and elusive species) all we can do is get ourselves into the best place, at the best time and with the best people. We then put the time and effort into trying to see the wildlife and hope that the animals cooperate.<br/><br/>All you have to do is to get in touch with your budget and your group size and where you would like to go and we will come back to you with an itinerary and quote for your perfect Borneo Rare Mammals tour.<br/><br/>Group Tour Departure: 26th August - 9th September 2022<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Sandakan. There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Sabah. Your naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, cruises, guided walks, park entrance fees and spotlighting fees where mentioned on the itinerary. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around (including around 7 hours of spotlighting per night when in Deramakot) and extra-long night safaris in Tabin - these have been specifically negotiated; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the Bornean forests. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>We recommend this tour is run at the end of the dry season, which in North East Borneo is August – September. However Borneo is notorious for rain and we expect rain throughout the year. Local climates are affected by the presence of mountain ranges throughout Malaysia, and climate can be divided into that of the highlands, the lowlands, and coastal regions. The coasts have a sunny climate, with temperatures ranging between 23-32°C (73.4-89.6°F), and rainfall ranging from 10-30cm (4-12in) a month. The lowlands have a similar temperature, but follow a more distinctive rainfall pattern and show very high humidity levels. The highlands are cooler and wetter, and display a greater temperature variation. A large amount of cloud cover is present over the highlands, which have humidity levels that do not fall below 75%.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it.<br/>• We will stay in a variety of accommodation when on this tour, from well established wildlife eco lodges to guest houses and chalets deep inside privately run forest reserves. <br/>• We will split our focus and activity depending on where we are and what we are looking for. For example in Deramakot, Tabin and Kinabatangan we will be spotlighting in the night. But we will also be focusing on daytime species in Tabin and Kinabatangan too, no other tour will offer as much time spent looking for wildlife in Borneo than this one.<br/>• We have specially negotiated extra-long night safaris in Tabin to further increase our chances of seeing nocturnal and rare species. <br/>• All the above reasons give this, our specialist tour for Borneo’s rarest wildlife including clouded leopards and other elusive mammal species a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Borneo so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the Sunda clouded leopard, Sunda leopard cat, flat-headed cat, marbled cat and bay cat and many more species. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Borneo at other times of year and focusing on other species such as otter civets and Hose’s civet and many other rare mammals of Borneo. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour visits 3 main areas in the province of Sabah in the north-eastern part of Malaysian Borneo. We will arrive into the town of Lahad Datu and fly out of Sandakan. In between we will visit Deramakot Forest Reserve, the Sakau region of the Kinabatangan River and also the Tabin Wildlife Reserve.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The majority of the wildlife activities will be done in a vehicle or boat and so there is no great level of physical fitness needed.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 Years Old",

It is these species which are the real highlight for us and our main targets when here. They are also largely nocturnal and so we will head out into the forest at night for extended drives. This is to maximise our chances of seeing the wonderful Sunda clouded leopard, sun bear and marbled cat, but along with these species several other rare species have been seen here such as Sunda colugo, Sunda pangolin, banded linsang among other incredible and rare species."

        "description": "Kinabatangan River - This morning we will leave Deramakot after breakfast and then depart towards the village of Sakau along the banks of the Kinabatangan River. On our arrival we will check in and then have lunch. Afterwards we will be taken on the river for our first river cruise / safari. The longest river in Sabah, Kinabatangan River measures 560 km from its headwaters in the Crocker Range of southwest Sabah to its outlet at the Sulu Sea on the East coast of Sabah and according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the Kinabatangan wildlife sanctuary is one of only two known places on Earth where 10 primate species can be found living wild. The enigmatic Bornean orangutan and the curious looking proboscis monkeys are the two most sought after primate species here however the ubiquitous long-tailed (or crab-eating) macaque is the most common. Other than the primates mammals are well represented here however most species are nocturnal or very elusive. The largest inhabitants are Borneo’s own endemic sub-species of Asiatic elephant (the Borneo pygmy elephant) which we will try to see and the incredibly rare and nearly mythical Sumatran rhino. Another fairly common and large inhabitant here is the largest reptile in the world, the saltwater crocodile. This part of the river traces through lowland forest and mangrove swamps near the coast provide sanctuary for them. With all these diversity going around, it is no wonder Kinabatangan wildlife sanctuary is the best destination to get close-up and discover its remarkable wildlife and fascinating habitats. Bird watchers usually find the Kinabatangan simply incredible while they spot incredible bird species from the famous Borneo's hornbills to the rare Storms storks. After our first trip this afternoon we will return to the camp for dinner and then after dark head out again in search of semi aquatic flat-headed cat. There are some tributaries and sections of the main river in which it may be possible to see flat-headed cats. We will have a spotlight and search the river banks, here we will probably see the glowing eyes of the crocodiles as they watch from the riverbanks and hopefully spot flat-headed cats and other elusive species such as otter civets. We will return to the camp for the night after a hopefully successful search."

        "description": "Gomatong Cave / Tabin Wildlife Sanctuary - This morning we will depart after breakfast from the Kinabatangan River and travel to Gomantong Cave, this is one of the world’s most famous caves and was immortalised in the BBC’s Planet Earth series due to the enormous mountain of guano and the millions of cockroaches and other invertebrates that live there. The forests around the caves are home to many species of wildlife including orangutans, in fact wild orangutans can possibly be seen throughout the entire trip we are taking, so it is always worth keeping an eye out for them in all of the forests. The cave is some 90m high and full of wildlife, alongside the innumerable invertebrates including the odd looking long-legged centipedes there are four species of swiftlet (white-nest, black-nest, mossy-nest and white-bellied) and around 27 species of bats (mostly wrinkle-lipped bats which number around 2 million in the cave). The black-nest swiftlets are the species whose nests are collected and eaten as a delicacy in China and South East Asia. The nest harvests are done sustainably now and the method for collecting them involves the locals having to climb high up into the caves on a network of rickety ladders and ropes. The nearly self-sufficient ecosystem inside the cave is completed with predators including bat hawks and pythons that feed on the bats and swiftlets as they come and go from the caves. You will then continue on towards Tabin Wildlife Sanctuary. Once we get to the sanctuary we will check in, have lunch (depending on the time of everyone’s flights) and head out into the forest (the exact itinerary of our daytime activities is variable and may change but we will have a morning and afternoon excursion into the forest on each full day here); Today we may start with a guide walk with one of their expert local guides. Nestled within the rainforest beside the Lipad river, the resort is home to a surprising variety of birds, insects and small mammals, even right beside the buildings of the resort it is possible to see several species and discover the rich variety of jungle herbs, some endemic, used for generations by local folks for the treatment of various ailments. In the afternoon we are likely to visit the active Lipad mud volcano which provides a mineral salt lick for wildlife. After trekking through the rainforest for around 20 minutes, we arrive at the elevated bare area of the mud volcano which is frequented by wildlife (elephants, bearded pigs, sambar, muntjacs and other species) and birds. The adventurous among us can try the effects of the volcanic mud, said to be responsible for a fine complexion, by applying the mud to their skin. Trek back to the resort along elephant trail, which is a great way to experience the forest and spot elusive species that live in the dense forests here. We will have one pre dawn drive included over this couple of days as well. After dinner we will have our first extended night drive and try and find some of the nocturnal mammals which are abundant here. With luck it is possible for Sunda clouded leopards, flat-headed cats and sun bears here but it is more likely that we will find various flying squirrels, several species of civets, yellow-throated martens, Philippine slow loris as well as reptiles and amphibians."

    "generalInfo": "Secluded jungle, lush interior mountains, enchanting wildlife and intriguing tribal history. Kalimantan offers a side to Borneo that fewer people experience and we’re taking you out onto its rivers. The fearsome headhunting traditions and mysterious jungle creatures of this region, intrigued past explorers and are still enticing adventurous travellers to this exotic corner of the globe. The conservation efforts of the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation and the chance to see their rescued and rehabilitated orangutans is an emotionally uplifting yet sobering experience and one that cannot be missed. And, just as moving, is spotting these awe-inspiring creatures in the wild. <br/><br/>We start our journey in Tumbang Malahoi, where we are welcomed into the home of a Dayak Ngaju tribe. Moving into the forest, we look out for hornbills and wild orangutans whilst marvelling at the endemic vegetation of the region. Departing on our river cruise, we see the forest from a different perspective as we float by small villages before canoeing through the glittering black water lake and keeping our eyes peeled as we search for proboscis monkeys and Brahminy kites. Heading upstream along the Rungan River, we leave our beautifully crafted river boat for our motorised canoes which transport us to the orangutan pre-release islands managed by the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation. We learn all about their vital work and spend some time watching the orangutans before cruising to the tiny riverside village of Kanarakan, where we are welcomed with a performance from the elders of the Dayak Ngaju tribe. We wander the rubber fields, village and gardens and share stories over a traditional spiced coffee or herbal tea. Lake Tahai is the perfect spot for canoeing and early morning bird watching, whilst Sei Gohong is the next village on our route, where our education of traditional practises in Kalimantan continues when we meet the local medicine expert. <br/><br/>Our last few days are packed full of activities as we visit Samboja Lestari, the site of the first BOSF orangutan introduction programme. Whether it be leisurely nature walks, a hike deep into the rainforest or a trip with a local fisherman that takes your fancy, there is plenty on offer for everyone. The real highlight at Samboja though, is our visit to the orangutan island, a natural, semi-wild home for orangutans that cannot be released and the sun bear sanctuary. Rugged and unruly, Kalimantan translates to ‘River of Diamonds’, so what better way to explore this tropical wonderland, than via the river.",

    "placesVisited": "",
    "generalInfo": "Borneo is one of the world’s greatest wildlife watching destinations, a top 10 location for anyone with a vested interest in the natural world. Whether it is the incredible close relation to humans in the orangutan or the smaller than usual population of Asiatic elephants or even the wealth of birdlife, endemic reptiles and amphibians or the abundance of very rare mammals that hide by day and come out in the night; the island of Borneo is a treasure trove for any nature lover.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>Asian wildlife doesn't come much more iconic that the massive red 'man of the forest', otherwise known as the orangutan or the second largest land animal in the world the Asiatic elephant and both of these incredible and endangered animals are easily seen in Borneo. <br/><br/>But there is much more to Bornean wildlife than these two species, there are hundreds of species of birds including no less then 15 species of large and stunning hornbills, many endemic species such as Proboscis monkeys and some real wildlife rarities like Sunda clouded leopards and sun bears. <br/><br/>As well as the birds and mammals which are most well known internationally the island of Borneo also has a wealth of reptile and amphibian life, from the large Saltwater crocodile and reticulated python to tiny flying frogs which glide through the forests and it is not just the animals, the plant life in Borneo is also second to none. Carnivorous pitcher plants lie in wait for unsuspecting insects and the world's largest flower the rafflesia is also found only in Borneo.  <br/><br/>Some of these species are among the rarest in the world and with so much deforestation occurring throughout South East Asia there are fewer and fewer pockets of rainforest left each year. Some of these species are intensively studied and we have a very good chance of seeing them, some are not protected very well at all and so they will be harder to find, but over the last few years our network of guides throughout the country have been scouring the forests and reserves looking for new locations for ecotourism and hopefully sites for rare and endangered species. <br/><br/>In doing this we happened to come across a location which produces more sightings of incredible and highly targeted species than anywhere else in the world.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Sandakan. There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Sabah. Your  naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, cruises, guided walks, park entrance fees and spotlighting fees where mentioned on the itinerary. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around (including around 7 hours of spotlighting per night when in Deramakot) and extra-long night safaris in Tabin - these have been specifically negotiated; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the Bornean forests. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>We recommend this tour is run at the end of the dry season, which in North East Borneo is August – September. However Borneo is notorious for rain and we expect rain throughout the year. Local climates are affected by the presence of mountain ranges throughout Malaysia, and climate can be divided into that of the highlands, the lowlands, and coastal regions. The coasts have a sunny climate, with temperatures ranging between 23-32°C (73.4-89.6°F), and rainfall ranging from 10-30cm (4-12in) a month. The lowlands have a similar temperature, but follow a more distinctive rainfall pattern and show very high humidity levels. The highlands are cooler and wetter, and display a greater temperature variation. A large amount of cloud cover is present over the highlands, which have humidity levels that do not fall below 75%.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it.<br/>• We will stay in a variety of accommodation when on this tour, from well established wildlife eco lodges to guest houses and chalets deep inside privately run forest reserves. <br/>• We will split our focus and activity depending on where we are and what we are looking for. For example in Deramakot, Danum, Tabin and Kinabatangan we will be spotlighting in the night. But we will also be focusing on daytime species in Tabin, Danum and Kinabatangan too, no other tour will offer as much time spent looking for wildlife in Borneo than this one.<br/>• We have specially negotiated extra-long night safaris in Tabin to further increase our chances of seeing nocturnal and rare species. <br/>• All the above reasons give this, our specialist tour for Borneo’s rarest wildlife including clouded leopards and other elusive mammal species a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Borneo so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the Bornean orangutna, Asiatic elephant, Sunda clouded leopard, Sunda leopard cat, flat-headed cat, marbled cat and sun bear and many more species. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Borneo at other times of year and focusing on other species such as otter civets and Hose’s civet and many other rare mammals of Borneo. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour visits 4 main areas in the province of Sabah in the north-eastern part of Malaysian Borneo. We will arrive and depart from the town of Sandakan. In between we will visit Deramakot Forest Reserve, the Sakau region of the Kinabatangan River and also the famous Danum Valley and Tabin Wildlife Reserve.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The majority of the wildlife activities will be done in a vehicle or boat and so there is no great level of physical fitness needed.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 12 Years Old",

Here you will check in and then have lunch and then afterwards we will be taken on the river for our first river cruise / safari. The Kinabatangan wildlife sanctuary is one of only two known places on Earth where 10 primate species can be found living wild together. The enigmatic Bornean orangutan and the curious looking proboscis monkeys are the two most sought after primate species here however the ubiquitous long-tailed macaque is the most common. The largest inhabitants are Borneo’s own endemic sub-species of Asiatic elephant (the Borneo pygmy elephant) which we will try to see. Another fairly common and large inhabitant here is the largest reptile in the world, the saltwater crocodile. This part of the river traces through lowland forest and mangrove swamps near the coast provide sanctuary for them. Bird watchers usually find the Kinabatangan simply incredible while they spot incredible bird species from the famous Borneo’s hornbills to the rare Storms storks. We will also head out in the evening to try and find nocturnal species such as flat-headed cats. (dinner is the only meal included today)."

        "description": "Tabin Wildlife Sanctuary - Travelling & Wildlife Watching This morning we will depart after breakfast from the Kinabatangan River and travel to Gomantong Cave, this is one of the world’s most famous caves and was immortalised in the BBC’s Planet Earth series due to the enormous mountain of guano and the millions of cockroaches and other invertebrates that live there. The forests around the caves are home to many species of wildlife including orangutans. The cave is some 90m high and full of wildlife, alongside the innumerable invertebrates including the odd looking long-legged centipedes there are four species of swiftlet (white-nest, black-nest, mossy-nest and white-bellied) and around 27 species of bats (mostly wrinkle-lipped bats which number around 2 million in the cave). The nearly self-sufficient ecosystem inside the cave is completed with predators including bat hawks and pythons that feed on the bats and swiftlets as they come and go from the caves. From the caves we will stop at the town of Lahad Datu where we will meet our new driver and get into the vehicle owned by the Tabin Wildlife Sanctuary. Once we get to the sanctuary we will check in, have lunch and head out into the forest for a guide walk with one of their expert local guides. Nestled within the rainforest beside the Lipad river, the resort is home to a surprising variety of birds, insects and small mammals, even right beside the buildings of the resort it is possible to see several species and discover the rich variety of jungle herbs, some endemic, used for generations by local folks for the treatment of various ailments. In the afternoon we are likely to visit the active Lipad mud volcano which provides a mineral salt lick for wildlife. After trekking through the rainforest for around 20 minutes, we arrive at the elevated bare area of the mud volcano which is frequented by wildlife (elephants, bearded pigs, sambar, muntjacs and other species) and birds. The adventurous among us can try the effects of the volcanic mud, said to be responsible for a fine complexion, by applying the mud to their skin. Trek back to the resort along elephant trail, which is a great way to experience the forest and spot elusive species that live in the dense forests here. After dinner we will head out in a vehicle with our guide and a spotlight to see what animals are active along the roads running through the forest. This is a specially arranged extra long night drive, to increase our chances of seeing animals. It is possible for Sunda clouded leopards, flat-headed cats and sun bears here but it is more likely that we will find various flying squirrels, civets, yellow-throated martens, slow loris as well as reptiles and amphibians. There is a population of Sumatran rhinos here as well, although I think the last one was seen in the wild here in the 1980’s. (all meals included today)."

After breakfast we will leave for the town of Lahad Datu again and there meet our new driver and vehicle and head into the depths of pristine Danum Valley. Prior to 1995, Danum Valley Conservation Area (DVCA) was an informal protected area in the Ulu Segama Forest Reserve. It is a mixture of primary, undisturbed, predominantly lowland rainforest with an outstanding complement of Borneo flora and fauna. The forest is full of wildlife we will explore the park with one of the lodge’s expert guides, we will be in our own small group and will be able to focus on the species we want to target first. The forest has a network of trails and canopy walkways and watch towers. Like in other places we will head out into the forest in the morning, afternoon and then at night, we will have a combination of walks and drives. As well as many of the species that live in the other forests we have been to and will visit next we will hopefully see western tarsiers, otter civets and have good sightings of orangutans here. Once again like our other destinations we will come back to the lodge for our meals and rest in the middle of the day, but like elsewhere we are staying the wildlife and forest comes straight into the lodge grounds. There are many species of birds here and many of them are found in the grounds of the lodge. (all meals included today)."

This 55,000 hectare reserve is home to many of Borneo’s large and iconic species including elephants, orangutans, Borneo gibbon, banteng and several elusive species which are seen here with more regularity than anywhere else in the world. It is these species which are the real highlight for us and our main targets when here. They are also largely nocturnal and so we will head out into the forest at night for extended drives and hikes. This is to maximise our chances of seeing the wonderful Sunda clouded leopard, sun bear and marbled cat, but along with these species several other rare species have been seen here such as Sunda colugo, Sunda pangolin, banded linsang and the forest is also home to the rarest cat here the bay cat. As long as we are not too tired after a long journey to get here from Danum Valley we will head out after dinner to try and see our first nocturnal species in Deramakot.

The owner of this plantation saw that the monkeys were dying out because of the development and deforestation of their mangrove habitat and decided to keep his free from palm oil and set up small feeding stations to supplement the diet of the resident troop of proboscis monkeys and Sundaic silvered langurs. Since then the place has become popular with tourists as it is the only place where you can get very close to these species and the populations have increased well.

Along the way, we pass crystal-clear waterfalls and see dozens of fascinating plant species including rare ferns, orchids, and also numerous palms. Kubah has so many varieties that it is known as “The world of Palms.” Also prominent in the park is the carnivorous pitcher plant. Rest assured, the pitcher plant is harmless to us but remains a menace to small invertebrates, such as insects. Animals such as bearded pigs, mouse deer, squirrels, and black hornbills call this park home. Though sightings of wildlife are not guaranteed, the sight and scent of the tropical rainforest—which remains largely undisturbed—is a treat by itself! The impressive jungle trek ends at a clear jungle stream adjacent to the Matang Wildlife Center. Matang Wildlife Center is Sarawak’s main center for wildlife rehabilitation. The rescued animals being rehabilitated here include orangutans, sun bears, bearcats, civet cats, sambar deer, barking deer, porcupines, and crocodiles, all of which can be seen in spacious, natural enclosures. A large aviary houses a variety of hornbills, as well as Brahminy kites and sea eagles. We will stay overnight at the park accommodation.

    "generalInfo": "Explore the remote and poorly understood forests of Tawau Hills National Park in search of the some of the world's rarest wildlife including bay cat, Hose's civet and many more species.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in wildlife tours and expedition style wildlife trips for some of the world’s rarest species of mammals. These trips are specialist and focus and we try very hard for all of our targets. This trip requires a good amount of spotlighting after dark, as many of our targeted species are nocturnal. <br/><br/>We have worked with local guides and scientists to develop the itinerary and using all known information about the species of mammals including rare mammals in Borneo we have developed systems and techniques to best find our main targets. <br/><br/>Borneo is one of the world’s greatest wildlife watching destinations and despite the ongoing deforestation around the island for the palm oil plantations there are still many areas of wonderful wilderness left. Including places which are currently unknown to the wider world and several locations which are just coming to prominence now. Tawau Hills National Park is one of these newer places, for the last couple of years scientists, conservationists and researchers have been travelling here and have found a wealth of wildlife and recorded many species which were hereto unknown from this location. In fact our first group tour here (August 2018) was the first group of tourists to visit Tawau on a specific wildlife watching tour ever, we discovered 4 species of mammals which had not been recorded in the park before – including the wonderful Kayan slow loris.<br/><br/>What makes the Tawau hills so special is there rugged and pristine terrain, the hills have made sure that the large hard wood trees have remained free from logging for centuries and in fact the world’s tallest tropical tree in the world is known from here. These pristine forests are home to incredible wildlife and that is what we are here to see. There are several targeted species here but all will require a good amount of effort and luck. <br/><br/>One of the top potential species here is probably the rarest animal in Borneo, the extremely rare and poorly understand Bay cat. We had been in touch with the researchers of the cat species in Borneo and by using their expertise and resources we now know that the most reliable records (camera trap records) for the Bay cat, come from here. <br/><br/>Also in the forested hills here are some other species that are near mythical in their elusiveness, we will try for tufted ground squirrel as well as Hose’s civet whilst here, but all mammals are so little understood that seeing any of them will require a lot of luck.<br/><br/>We believe that by combining this itinerary with our longer Rare Mammals of Borneo tour you will get the best overview of Bornean wildlife (particularly mammals). For information on how to book both of these trips and combine them please contact us. <br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Tawau town. There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Sabah. Your naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all guided walks, wildlife stake outs, park entrance fees and spotlighting fees where mentioned on the itinerary. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around (including extra long night hikes. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>We recommend this tour is run at the end of the dry season, which in North East Borneo is August – September. However Borneo is notorious for rain and we expect rain throughout the year. Local climates are affected by the presence of mountain ranges throughout Malaysia, and climate can be divided into that of the highlands, the lowlands, and coastal regions. The coasts have a sunny climate, with temperatures ranging between 23-32°C (73.4-89.6°F), and rainfall ranging from 10-30cm (4-12in) a month. The lowlands have a similar temperature, but follow a more distinctive rainfall pattern and show very high humidity levels. The highlands are cooler and wetter, and display a greater temperature variation. A large amount of cloud cover is present over the highlands, which have humidity levels that do not fall below 75%.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it.<br/>• We will stay in a variety of accommodation when on this tour, from well established wildlife eco lodges to guest houses and chalets deep inside privately run forest reserves. <br/>• We will spend time during the day hiking and skating out clearings and areas overlooking streams or fruiting trees and at night spotlighting along the trails and rivers too.<br/>• Our guides are happy to take you out late at night in search of elusive and nocturnal wildlife.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our specialist tour for Borneo’s rarest wildlife including clouded leopards and other elusive mammal species a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Borneo so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the Sunda clouded leopard, Sunda leopard cat, flat-headed cat, marbled cat and bay cat and many more species. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Borneo at other times of year and focusing on other species such as otter civets and Hose’s civet and many other rare mammals of Borneo. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour visits the forested hills of the Tawau Hills National Park. The entry and exit points of these trip is the town of Tawau, you can also link this trip up with our longer Borneo wildlife holiday, which would mean a difference in the start or finish location of this trip. <br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>All of this trip is based on foot, some of the hills and trails are very tough and there is a 10km hike uphill to get to the accommodation in the forest. We have porters to take the majority of luggage, but there is a still a good level of fitness required.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 Years Old",

However it is more likely that we will not have time to do this and so we will spend the night down in the lowlands and in the evening / night have a night walk around the gardens here which have results in Malay civets, Sunda colugos and a wealth of frogs, snakes and other wildlife after dark. Whether the main hike up the hills (which is a 10km hike up through the dense forest to the accommodation) is today or first thing tomorrow; we recommend keeping an eye out for wildlife and bearded pigs, Bornean Muller’s gibbons and various species of birds can be seen on the hike up. For these reasons it is best to do this in the morning, when wildlife is most active. When you reach the top you will rest and settle in before having a night walk around the trails here to see if you can spotlighting some wildlife. (dinner only included today)."
