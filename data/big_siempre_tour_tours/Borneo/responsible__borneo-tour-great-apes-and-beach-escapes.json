      "description": "Visit Sepilok Orangutan Centre & travel to the Kinabatangan River: This morning you’ll be picked up from your hotel and transferred to the airport for a short 45-minute flight to Sandakan. Borneo is famous for its orangutans, and there’s no better place to learn about them than the Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre. You’ll visit as part of a small group, with a knowledgeable guide on hand to answer your questions about these fascinating, shaggy-haired residents. At feeding time, you’ll watch from a safe distance, yet still feel very close to the orangutans. You’ll also visit the nearby Sun Bear Sanctuary to see these rare and endangered bears up close. After Sepilok, you’ll continue by boat along the Kinabatangan River, Sabah’s longest river and one of the best places in Borneo for wildlife spotting. The riverbanks are teeming with life, from monkeys and monitor lizards to crocodiles, sun bears and a huge variety of tropical birds. With a bit of luck, you might even spot wild pygmy elephants. For the next two nights, you’ll stay at a charming wooden lodge right on the river’s edge. After some time to settle in, you’ll head out on your first late-afternoon wildlife cruise, watching the jungle come alive as the sun begins to set. Dinner is back at the lodge, followed by a peaceful night falling asleep to the sounds of the rainforest around you."

      "description": "Wildlife spotting on the Kinabatangan River: You’ll likely wake to the sounds of gibbons and hornbills, as they tend to start the day early. After all, you’ll be doing the same, heading out on your first river cruise as the jungle slowly comes to life. You’ll glide towards a nearby lake, keeping an eye on the banks as animals stir around the water’s edge. Back at the lodge, breakfast is served before you have some time to relax on the veranda or head out on a gentle nature walk to nearby caves. As the afternoon fades, you’ll head out on your final jungle cruise, making the most of one last chance to spot Borneo’s unique wildlife as the sun sets. You’ll return to the lodge for another peaceful night, falling asleep once more to the sounds of the rainforest."

      "description": "Castaway Beach on Lankayan Island: Today you’ll be transferred to the jetty for your boat journey to Lankayan Island. The crossing takes around 90 minutes and usually departs at about 10am. Tucked away in the Sulu Sea just north of Sandakan, Lankayan feels wonderfully remote and is the perfect place to slow the pace after your time in Borneo. Spend the next few days doing as much, or as little as you like. Relax on the white sandy beach, swim in the clear turquoise water or head out snorkelling straight from shore. Lankayan is also an important nesting site for sea turtles, and if you’re lucky, you may even see baby turtles being released into the sea. You’ll stay in a beachfront bungalow with the sand just steps away. All meals are included and served in the island’s restaurant, set on a beautiful open-air wooden terrace, an easy, laid-back way to enjoy island life."
