  "generalInfo": "You would struggle to find a better introduction to Malaysia and Borneo than this two-week tour that traces a journey from the street food stalls of Kuala Lumpur to the rainforest of Kota Kinabalu, via the UNESCO World Heritage Sites of Melaka and Penang.<br/><br/>Travelling at a pleasantly relaxed pace, this West Malaysia small group tour is packed with immersive and memorable experiences. <br/><br/>You’ll take an afternoon rickshaw ride in Melaka, a fantastic way to absorb everyday street scenes. On Penang you’ll take the funicular railway up to the fragrant botanical gardens of George Town, and enjoy a hands-on cookery lesson at the famous Tropical Spice Garden. While in Sabah you'll join an island hopping and snorkelling boat trip through Tunku Abdul Rahman Marine Park. <br/><br/>And in Malaysian Borneo, you’ll never forget a visit to the orangutan sanctuary at Sepilok in Malaysian Borneo, as well as to the nearby sun bear sanctuary. These wonderful creatures are threatened by poaching and habitat loss, and your visit directly helps with their conservation as well as giving you an understanding of the threats they face.<br/><br/>The lush tropical rainforest of Borneo’s Sabah state is the setting for the final few nights, as you explore by boat and on foot in search of colourful flora and fauna. Proboscis monkeys, crocodiles, pygmy elephants and a host of rare birds call this dense and atmospheric forest home, expert nature guides can show you where to look and explain their behaviours.<br/><br/>Easily combined with hiking Mount Kinabalu, a stay in a remote rainforest lodge, or a few days of taking it easy on Gaya Island, this tour will leave you feeling that you’ve seen the very best of Malaysia. And throughout, there are manifold opportunities to meet local people and learn about their lives, as well as diving into one of the most flavoursome cuisines in Southeast Asia.",
