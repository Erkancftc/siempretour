      "title": "Kota Kinabalu.",
      "description": "Selamat datang! Welcome to Borneo, Malaysia. Your adventure begins in Kota Kinabalu with a welcome meeting at 6 pm. If you arrive early, maybe immerse yourself in the history of the city at the Sabah State Museum. You can also visit the Mari Mari Cultural Village or explore the islands off Kota Kinabalu – excellent for swimming and snorkelling. Tonight, perhaps head out with your group for a welcome dinner – your leader will have the best recommendations for local food and drinks."

      "title": "Dusun Village.",
      "description": "Travel by minivan to a Dusun village that sits in the shadow of Mt Kinabalu – the highest mountain between the Himalayas and New Guinea – and enjoy a welcome lunch in your homestay with your hosts before visiting a local vegetable farm. Learn about planting and harvesting seasonal produce and then take some of these fresh vegetables home for dinner – a proper farm-to-table experience. Tonight, enjoy a special village cultural performance."
    },
    {
      "dayNumber": 3,
      "title": "Dusun Village.",
      "description": "Start your day by walking to the local vegetable market in Kundasang with your leader. Located in the heart of the community, this market showcases an array of freshly harvested produce, from locally grown vegetables to unique regional seasonal fruits like tarap and rambutan. You'll also find local snacks, wild honey and traditional Borneo crafts. Take the opportunity to chat with vendors to learn about the local produce and how it’s used in traditional Sabah cuisine. The afternoon is yours to enjoy at your leisure – perhaps visit Poring Hot Springs to relax in the open-air baths before heading back to your homestay."

      "description": "Eat a good breakfast this morning and say goodbye to your friends in the village as it’s time to drive to Timpohon Gate to begin your trek up Mt Kinabalu. It’s no small feat – prepare for an uphill trail made of steep steps that vary considerably in size – but along the way you can take in the remarkable variety of plant life, including about 1000 species of orchid and the carnivorous pitcher plant (yes, really). After covering 6 km (approximately 4 to 6 hours), spend the night at a hostel near Laban Rata, located at 3,272m (10,735 ft) above sea level. Rest up for the final ascent (very!) early tomorrow morning."

      "title": "Kinabalu National Park.",
      "description": "Rise at around 2 am this morning to continue your trek – it’s tough, but the sunrise at the summit will be well worth it. At the top, take in the jungles of Borneo in one direction and the South China Sea in the other. After a well-deserved rest and plenty of pictures, return to Laban Rata for breakfast. Then, get started on the descent which can take between 3 - 6 hours. This evening, enjoy your overnight stay at a hostel within Kinabalu National Park."

      "title": "Kinabatangan River.",
      "description": "Journey by private bus into the steamy rainforest to Bilit – a small village on the banks of the Kinabatangan River – and then take a short boat ride to the comfortable jungle lodge where you’ll spend the night. Located on the riverbanks, the lodge is a brilliant place to spot wildlife. For even better spotting, head out on a sunset boat ride and look out for macaques, orangutan, proboscis monkeys and pygmy elephants. End your day by searching for nocturnal wildlife like civets, owls and the rare slow loris on a night walk."

      "title": "Kinabatangan River.",
      "description": "Embark on another boat safari early this morning – different species come out at different times, so keep your eyes peeled! After breakfast, join the in-house guide for an insightful journey into the historical Kinabatangan community, which thrived long before tourism developed in the area. Explore traditional practices and craftsmanship and actively engage in the crafting of traditional fish traps. This hands-on experience provides a profound understanding of the local culture and heritage, fostering a deeper appreciation for their sustainable way of life. Then, head back on the boat for another river excursion in the afternoon."

      "title": "Sepilok.",
      "description": "Say goodbye to your jungle lodge after breakfast and hit the road in a private minivan to a guesthouse located near the Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre. Established to help reintroduce these wonderful creatures back into the wild after a life of domestication or being orphaned, this sanctuary offers a unique opportunity to witness conservation in action. From the viewing platform, watch and photograph the orangutans as they swing into view onto the feeding platform. Observe young orangutans as they learn how to climb a specially constructed jungle gym in a new nursery. To see more of Borneo’s creatures, there’s the option to visit the Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Center. Here, rescued sun bears, many of whom have endured years of mistreatment, are given a second chance at life. Learn about the rehabilitation process and how they are reintroduced back into the wild. You can also opt to visit the Rainforest Discovery Centre, where you can roam the treetop walkways while you learn more about the flora and birdlife of Borneo."

      "title": "Turtle Island.",
      "description": "This morning, transfer to Sandakan to leave your large bags at the hotel and walk with your overnight bag to a nearby jetty. Travel by speedboat, past small fishing villages and bamboo fish traps, to Turtle Island Marine Park. In the afternoon, there will be some time for swimming, snorkelling or lazing about on the beach. In the evening, you’ll join an expert local ranger and a select group of visitors to watch giant green turtles coming ashore to lay their eggs under the moonlight. Watch the rangers as they release protected hatchlings and guide them in their frantic dash to the ocean. This is a moving experience that will stay with you long after your trip is over!"

      "title": "Sandakan.",
      "description": "After breakfast, return to the mainland and walk back to your hotel. Today is free to explore Sandakan as you wish – perhaps you’ll call into Agnes Keith House, the restored home of an American writer best known for her accounts of life in Borneo during WW1. Or you could visit the Sandakan War Memorial, built on the site of a Japanese Prisoners of War camp. Learn about the tragic Sandakan Death Marches, when 2400 prisoners of war were forced to walk through the jungles of Borneo and only six survived. Another great option is St Michaels & All Angels Church, a rare stone building in Sabah that managed to avoid major damage in the war."
