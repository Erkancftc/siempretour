  "generalInfo": "Explore the remote and poorly understood forests of Tawau Hills National Park in search of the some of the world's rarest wildlife including bay cat, Hose's civet and many more species.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in wildlife tours and expedition style wildlife trips for some of the world’s rarest species of mammals. These trips are specialist and focus and we try very hard for all of our targets. This trip requires a good amount of spotlighting after dark, as many of our targeted species are nocturnal. <br/><br/>We have worked with local guides and scientists to develop the itinerary and using all known information about the species of mammals including rare mammals in Borneo we have developed systems and techniques to best find our main targets. <br/><br/>Borneo is one of the world’s greatest wildlife watching destinations and despite the ongoing deforestation around the island for the palm oil plantations there are still many areas of wonderful wilderness left. Including places which are currently unknown to the wider world and several locations which are just coming to prominence now. Tawau Hills National Park is one of these newer places, for the last couple of years scientists, conservationists and researchers have been travelling here and have found a wealth of wildlife and recorded many species which were hereto unknown from this location. In fact our first group tour here (August 2018) was the first group of tourists to visit Tawau on a specific wildlife watching tour ever, we discovered 4 species of mammals which had not been recorded in the park before – including the wonderful Kayan slow loris.<br/><br/>What makes the Tawau hills so special is there rugged and pristine terrain, the hills have made sure that the large hard wood trees have remained free from logging for centuries and in fact the world’s tallest tropical tree in the world is known from here. These pristine forests are home to incredible wildlife and that is what we are here to see. There are several targeted species here but all will require a good amount of effort and luck. <br/><br/>One of the top potential species here is probably the rarest animal in Borneo, the extremely rare and poorly understand Bay cat. We had been in touch with the researchers of the cat species in Borneo and by using their expertise and resources we now know that the most reliable records (camera trap records) for the Bay cat, come from here. <br/><br/>Also in the forested hills here are some other species that are near mythical in their elusiveness, we will try for tufted ground squirrel as well as Hose’s civet whilst here, but all mammals are so little understood that seeing any of them will require a lot of luck.<br/><br/>We believe that by combining this itinerary with our longer Rare Mammals of Borneo tour you will get the best overview of Bornean wildlife (particularly mammals). For information on how to book both of these trips and combine them please contact us. <br/><br/>Group Tour Departure: 23rd August - 28th August 2025.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Tawau town. There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Sabah. Your naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all guided walks, wildlife stake outs, park entrance fees and spotlighting fees where mentioned on the itinerary. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around (including extra long night hikes. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>We recommend this tour is run at the end of the dry season, which in North East Borneo is August – September. However Borneo is notorious for rain and we expect rain throughout the year. Local climates are affected by the presence of mountain ranges throughout Malaysia, and climate can be divided into that of the highlands, the lowlands, and coastal regions. The coasts have a sunny climate, with temperatures ranging between 23-32°C (73.4-89.6°F), and rainfall ranging from 10-30cm (4-12in) a month. The lowlands have a similar temperature, but follow a more distinctive rainfall pattern and show very high humidity levels. The highlands are cooler and wetter, and display a greater temperature variation. A large amount of cloud cover is present over the highlands, which have humidity levels that do not fall below 75%.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it.<br/>• We will stay in a variety of accommodation when on this tour, from well established wildlife eco lodges to guest houses and chalets deep inside privately run forest reserves. <br/>• We will spend time during the day hiking and skating out clearings and areas overlooking streams or fruiting trees and at night spotlighting along the trails and rivers too.<br/>• Our guides are happy to take you out late at night in search of elusive and nocturnal wildlife.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our specialist tour for Borneo’s rarest wildlife including clouded leopards and other elusive mammal species a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Borneo so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the Sunda clouded leopard, Sunda leopard cat, flat-headed cat, marbled cat and bay cat and many more species. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Borneo at other times of year and focusing on other species such as otter civets and Hose’s civet and many other rare mammals of Borneo. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour visits the forested hills of the Tawau Hills National Park. The entry and exit points of these trip is the town of Tawau, you can also link this trip up with our longer Borneo wildlife holiday, which would mean a difference in the start or finish location of this trip. <br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>All of this trip is based on foot, some of the hills and trails are very tough and there is a 10km hike uphill to get to the accommodation in the forest. We have porters to take the majority of luggage, but there is a still a good level of fitness required.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 Years Old",

If we have time we will arrive at the lowland station check into the accommodation before spending the afternoon and night having a night walk around the gardens here which have results in Malay civets, Sunda colugos and a wealth of frogs, snakes and other wildlife after dark. The next few days will be spent looking for fruiting fig trees in the park which act as major gathering points for a wealth of wildlife such as bearded pigs, Bornean Muller’s gibbons and various species of birds can be seen on the hike up. (dinner only included today)."
