  "generalInfo": "For such close neighbours, Guatemala and Belize are two countries with astonishing contrasts. A tailormade family holiday combining the two will be packed with variety and have a terrific amount to offer adventurous families. <br/><br/>From the volcano-fringed banks of Lake Atitlan to the exquisitely carved facades of historic colonial Antigua, via the world-famous market at Chichicastenango crammed with vibrant textiles, and on to the steamy jungle surrounding Tikal, Guatemala has it all. One day you could be bargaining for jewellery, the next kayaking and hiking, or even making ‘volcano pizza’ on the lava fields of Pacaya Volcano. The Mayan complex at Tikal is completely unforgettable, especially when coupled with the guide’s gory stories about human sacrifices and set against the backdrop of the dense jungle and the calls of the howler monkeys. <br/><br/>Belize boasts the world’s second largest barrier reef (after Australia), and most people will want to get under the sea at some point during their visit. The swimming, snorkelling, and diving opportunities here are world-class and the beaches are a paradise. Combine the dazzling white sand with the colourful marine life and you won’t want to leave. <br/><br/>If you prefer to stick to dry land, you won’t be disappointed by the richness of wildlife in the rainforests, and the mysterious temple complex at Lamanai. Keep your eyes (and ears) open for monkeys, tropical birds, and bright lizards through the dense foliage. <br/><br/>Our holidays are individually tailored for you and your family, so we will discuss the finer details with you and adapt each itinerary according to your timeframe, number of people, age of children, preferences, and budget. <br/><br/>A combo tour of Guatemala and Belize is a winning formula, and your adventures here will remain in your memory for many years to come.",

      "description": "ANTIGUA: Kick off your trip with a guided walking tour around Antigua. The town is impossibly pretty, filled with brightly coloured houses and cobbled streets and surrounded by volcanoes. You’ll navigate through tiny alleyways, coming up for air in open plazas lined with exquisitely carved facades, the very epitome of faded grandeur. The indigenous market has a huge array of fabulous souvenirs, from vibrant tapestries to skilful textiles, you’ll be totally spoilt for choice as you haggle with sellers in traditional dress. The main challenge will not be over-filling your bags so early in the trip! The evening is free – find a good viewpoint and marvel at Fuego’s frequent eruptions from a distance."

Following a narrow trail uphill through woodland and scree, you’ll enjoy superb views of the crater and lava flows. Your guide knows where all the ‘hot spots’ are – we recommend toasting marshmallows or maybe even cooking pizza in the lava! Afterwards, return to Antigua for a free afternoon."

      "description": "CHICHICASTENANGO – LAKE ATITLAN: Make an early start this morning to get over to the world famous Chichicastenango market (Thursdays and Sundays). Witnessing the market in full swing is a great Central American experience, held in a small town crammed with adobe houses and cobbled streets, attracting thousands from all over Guatemala. Every corner you turn reveals more sellers and the sheer quantity of things for sale is mind-blowing, including wooden masks, embroidery, jewellery, pottery, fruit, incense, bags, candles… and so much more. Afterwards, move on to Lake Atitlan and the small town of Panajachel, from where you continue to your lake-front hotel. One of our favourite spots in Central America, the views of the lake and surrounding volcanic hills are completely breath-taking."

      "description": "LAKE ATITLAN: Immerse yourself in your beautiful surroundings with an active morning. Start off with a kayak trip on the lake to the indigenous village of San Marcos, from where a gentle 2-hour hike brings you back along the shore to your hotel. Chill out this afternoon; perhaps grab a cold drink and relax in a hammock, keeping your eyes open for the hummingbirds flitting around. If you’d like to do something more, a short hike along a Mayan trail takes you to a neighbouring village, or you can cool off with a swim in the lake next to the hotel."

This afternoon you’ll explore the complex with a guide. This is Central America’s most impressive ruin; not only are the buildings absolutely outstanding, but it’s in the middle of dense jungle and teeming with wildlife such as toucans, monkeys, coatis and minibeasts like colourful centipedes and vivid butterflies. The guide will keep children engaged with gruesome tales of human sacrifice – this is Horrible Histories come to life!"

      "description": "YAXHA – SAN IGNACIO: This morning you’ll explore another Mayan site, much less known and little-visited compared to Tikal. The temples at Yaxha are truly atmospheric, still being used for traditional rituals and not even fully excavated. A visit here offers a tantalizing snapshot of the past. Afterwards, cross the border into Belize; your base for the next three nights is a jungle lodge deep in the rainforest above the Macal River. In the heart of Belize’s Cayo District, this is the perfect base for many of Belize’s most exciting adventure activities."

Perhaps go tubing on the Macal River, passing Mayan villages and tropical rainforest. Keep your eyes open for giant iguanas high up in the branches and cool off in the clear waters of the jungle river. Other options include visiting the fabulous ruins of Xunantunich, horse-riding through the rainforest, or many other guided hiking or canoeing excursions. The nearby town of San Ignacio also has various possibilities such as a cacao workshop or the Green Iguana Sanctuary"

      "description": "SAN IGNACIO – ACTUN TUNICHIL MUKNAL: Today, adventurous families who are up for a bit of a challenge can head deep into Actun Tunichil Muknal Cave. Starting with a jungle hike into Tapir Mountain Nature Reserve, you’ll dip into the river for a short swim to enter the cave itself, accompanied by a local specialist guide. Following a tunnel through the water and navigating a maze of rocks, clambering over boulders, and squeezing through passageways, you’ll continue deeper into the cave system. As you go, your guide will point out rock formations, and eventually you’ll reach the Mayan burial chamber complete with calcified remains (including a centuries-old Maya Princess), ceremonial vessels, and various Mayan artefacts. An unforgettable experience."

      "description": "CAYE CAULKER: You’ll transfer to Belize City today and take the water taxi to Caye Caulker, just off the coast. Enjoy some well-deserved chill-out time; the rest of the day is free for you to start to explore the island. Caye Caulker is only 8km from end to end, an idyllic barefoot place filled with rustic souvenir stands, weather-beaten clapboard houses, and small art galleries. Forget travelling by car – there are none here! The roads are all unpaved and the locals get around by bike, golf cart, or on foot. The simple eateries here offer local home-cooked seafood lunches; you’ll be spoilt for choice so check what the catch of the day is. You’ve arrived right next to the Belize Barrier Reef, home to some of the best snorkelling and scuba diving in the world."

Simply relax and wander around, stopping for the occasional cold drink of bowl of ceviche, or pre-book a snorkelling or diving excursion off the coast. Our most popular snorkelling excursion is a half-day trip to Hol Chan and Shark Ray Alley. Hol Chan is the location of a natural break in the barrier reef that’s home to a superb array of brightly coloured marine life and coral garden. Further along, you’ll come to Shark Ray Alley; the shallow waters here have a large population of (harmless) nurse sharks as well as many rays and sea turtles."
