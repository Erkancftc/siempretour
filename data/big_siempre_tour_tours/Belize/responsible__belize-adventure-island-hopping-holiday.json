      "description": "ARRIVAL IN BELIZE - On arrival at Belize City International Airport, you will be met and privately transferred by road to the Cayo District, a drive of around 2 hours. Rugged and remote, the Cayo District is a vast stretch of highland rainforests, cattle ranches, and pinelands. Located in western Belize and bordering Guatemala's El Petén region, explore the great outdoors on foot, by horse, or via kayak, raft, or canoe. Belize's oldest and largest national park - Mountain Pine Ridge Forest Reserve - offers caves to explore, cool rivers for swimming, and a seemingly endless forest that is home to myriad tropical birds. The real hub of the district is San Ignacio, a small town featuring rustic, colonial-era streets, an eclectic mix of restaurants and shops and a lively weekly market."

      "description": "SAIL TO GOFF'S CAYE & BANNISTER: Sail to Goff’s Caye – one of our favourite islands because it reminds us why postcards were invented. This 2-acre island sits right on the barrier reef so you can snorkel straight from the shore, or simply relax in the water on the sandbar. Sail up to Bannister Bogue, a mangrove collection of islands that are home to manatees, dolphins, multiple bird species and other marine life. Manatees, which are also known as ‘sea cows’ are gentle, slow moving, plant-eating herbivores and their closest living relatives are elephants and aardvarks. They can grow over 13 feet in length and weigh up to 3,500 pounds. Despite being an endangered species, manatees are present in the waters of Belize and can be seen throughout the year. (Please note it is not possible to swim with the Manatees and seeing them is not guaranteed)."
