  "generalInfo": "For such a small country, Belize is hard to beat when it comes to the outdoors, jungle, beach, wildlife, and ancient ruins. Less well-known than its famous neighbours (Costa Rica and Mexico), Belize has a terrific amount to offer adventurous families. <br/><br/>Boasting the world’s second largest barrier reef (after Australia) most people will want to get under the sea at some point during their visit. The swimming, snorkelling, and diving opportunities here are world-class and the beaches are a paradise. Combine the dazzling white sand with the colourful marine life and you won’t want to leave. <br/><br/>If you prefer to stick to dry land, you won’t be disappointed by the richness of wildlife in the rainforests, and the mysterious temple complex at Lamanai. Keep your eyes (and ears) open for howler monkeys, tropical birds, and bright lizards through the dense foliage. <br/><br/>Our holidays are individually tailored for you and your family, so we will discuss the finer details with you and adapt each itinerary according to your timeframe, number of people, age of children, preferences, and budget. <br/><br/>Belize is Central America’s best-kept secret and will remain in your memory for many years to come.",

      "description": "BELIZE CITY – LAMANAI: After you arrive in Belize City you’ll be met and transferred to your jungle lodge, by road and boat. This will be your base for the next few nights, immersed in the steamy jungle, taking boat trips, and searching for wildlife. Tonight, you could start off your adventure by heading out on a thrilling nocturnal walking safari. Will you encounter noisy howler monkeys, spy some iguanas, or even catch a glimpse of the elusive jaguar?"

      "description": "LAMANAI: This is the first of two full days at your jungle lodge. The lodge includes a couple of activities per night stayed, so you can choose what you’d like to do. One of our favourites is to rise early and take a dawn walk through the misty jungle. As the forest awakens, your specialist guide will ensure you don’t miss a thing. You’ll also have the opportunity today to visit the 3,000-year-old Mayan ruins at Lamanai, using your imagination to glimpse how this ancient civilisation lived, deep in the jungle."

      "description": "LAMANAI: Discuss with your lodge naturalist what you’d like to do on this, your second full day. Perhaps opt for another early morning and this time head out across the lagoon in a canoe to explore Dawson’s Creek and its tributaries. Wildlife spotted in this area includes manatees, otters, crocodiles, and endemic parrots. Later, a great option is to follow the ‘Maya Medicine Trail’ on foot through the jungle with a guide. It’s fascinating to know about the local remedies, some of which have been used for centuries by Belize’s indigenous population. This evening, consider a sunset cocktail cruise, or even a torchlight safari by river safari boat in search of Morelet’s crocodile (optional)."

      "description": "LAMANAI – CAYE CAULKER: You’ll return to Belize City today and take the water taxi to Caye Caulker, just off the coast. Enjoy some well-deserved chill-out time; the rest of the day is free for you to start to explore the island. Caye Caulker is only 8km from end to end, an idyllic barefoot place filled with rustic souvenir stands, weather-beaten clapboard houses, and small art galleries. Forget travelling by car – there are none here! The roads are all unpaved and the locals get around by bike, golf cart, or on foot. The simple eateries here offer local home-cooked seafood lunches; you’ll be spoilt for choice so check what the catch of the day is. You’ve arrived right next to the Belize Barrier Reef, home to some of the best snorkelling and scuba diving in the world."

Simply relax and wander around, stopping for the occasional cold drink of bowl of ceviche, or pre-book a snorkelling or diving excursion off the coast. Our most popular snorkelling excursion is a half-day trip to Hol Chan and Shark Ray Alley. Hol Chan is the location of a natural break in the barrier reef that’s home to a superb array of brightly coloured marine life and coral garden. Further along, you’ll come to Shark Ray Alley; the shallow waters here have a large population of (harmless) nurse sharks as well as many rays and sea turtles."

      "description": "CAYE CAULKER – SAN IGNACIO: With a fresh appetite for adventure after your relaxing downtime, today you’ll return to the mainland by water taxi and continue to San Ignacio. Set on the banks of the Macal River, in the heart of Belize’s Cayo District, this is the perfect base for many of Belize’s most exciting adventure activities. Your home here will be a lodge in the middle of lush rainforest. Activities available this afternoon will depend on where you are staying. You can follow a short hiking trail through the jungle, or perhaps enjoy a canoe trip down the Macal River."

      "description": "SAN IGNACIO – ACTUN TUNICHIL MUKNAL: Today, adventurous families who are up for a bit of a challenge can head deep into Actun Tunichil Muknal Cave. Starting with a jungle hike into Tapir Mountain Nature Reserve, you’ll dip into the river for a short swim to enter the cave itself, accompanied by a local specialist guide. Following a tunnel through the water and navigating a maze of rocks, clambering over boulders, and squeezing through passageways, you’ll continue deeper into the cave system. As you go, your guide will point out rock formations, and eventually you’ll reach the Mayan burial chamber complete with calcified remains (including a centuries-old Maya Princess), ceremonial vessels, and various Mayan artefacts. An unforgettable experience."

Perhaps go tubing on the Macal River, passing Mayan villages and tropical rainforest. Keep your eyes open for giant iguanas high up in the branches and cool off in the clear waters of the jungle river. Other options include visiting the fabulous ruins of Xunantunich, horse-riding through the rainforest, or many other guided hiking or canoeing excursions. The nearby town of San Ignacio also has various possibilities such as a cacao workshop or the Green Iguana Sanctuary."

      "description": "SAN IGNACIO – PLACENCIA: After breakfast today you’ll continue to Placencia, a narrow, 25-kilometre-long peninsula that runs alongside the mainland. If you’re interested, we can include a stop en-route at St Herman’s Cave in Blue Hole National Park. If you’re looking for spectacular turquoise beaches, you’ve found them. Placencia is a slender ribbon of land with a lagoon on one side and the Caribbean on the other – gorgeous views all round. The main hub for visitors is Placencia Village. You’ll be drawn there by the relaxed vibe, and the mix of dive shops, restaurants, bars, and expat and Creole locals. Just offshore, the diving, snorkelling, and sailing are superb. If you prefer to stay above water, you can also explore the nearby mangroves and deserted cayes by kayak."
