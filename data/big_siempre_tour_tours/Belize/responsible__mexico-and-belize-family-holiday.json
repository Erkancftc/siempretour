  "generalInfo": "For such close neighbours, Mexico and Belize are two countries with astonishing contrasts. A tailormade family holiday combining the two will be packed with variety and have a terrific amount to offer adventurous families. <br/><br/>Mexico is the most fabulous family destination, with its melting pot of experiences and cultures. The Yucatan Peninsula is the main focal point for active families. Think ancient civilisations, jungles, colonial cities, white-sand beaches, cenotes, waterfalls, flamingos, turtles, and gorgeous hacienda accommodation. <br/><br/>Belize boasts the world’s second largest barrier reef (after Australia), and most people will want to get under the sea at some point during their visit. The swimming, snorkelling, and diving opportunities here are world-class and the beaches are a paradise. Combine the dazzling white sand with the colourful marine life and you won’t want to leave. <br/><br/>If you prefer to stick to dry land, you won’t be disappointed by the richness of wildlife in the rainforests, and mysterious temple complexes. Keep your eyes (and ears) open for monkeys, tropical birds, and bright lizards through the dense foliage. Are you brave enough to join a thrilling night walk? See who dares turn off their torch the longest!<br/><br/>Our holidays are individually tailored for you and your family, so we will discuss the finer details with you and adapt each itinerary according to your timeframe, number of people, age of children, preferences, and budget. <br/><br/>A combo tour of Mexico and Belize is a winning formula, and your adventures here will remain in your memory for many years to come.",

      "description": "CANCUN – PUNTA LAGUNA - VALLADOLID: Leave the coast behind you today as you head inland. A perfect stop on today’s journey is the Punta Laguna Nature Reserve. You can choose your exact package when you get there, but we recommend a guided jungle hike (watch out for the spider monkeys and giant insects!), a zipline across the lake, and a paddle by kayak to truly soak up the atmosphere. The visit culminates in an abseil into the crystal-clear water of a cenote, an underground cavern, before climbing out on a 30m rope ladder. End your day in the lovely colonial city of Valladolid, your base for the next two nights."

      "description": "CHICHEN ITZA: Beat the rush to Chichen Itza this morning by getting there early. This is (quite rightly) the most famous site on the Yucatan and the vast ruins here will impress even the most grudging young sightseers. The ancient complex is dominated by the Temple of Kukulkan, and you can keep the kids engaged by telling them some of the stories of human sacrifice and gore at the Skull Wall – real-life Horrible Histories! After your visit, return to Valladolid for the night."

      "description": "RURAL HACIENDA: Today you’ll move on, and your home for the next two nights will be a hacienda in the countryside outside Merida. There are several of these in Mexico and they were typically built as second homes by rich sisal barons, in the middle of their plantations. We can suggest one to suit your budget - some are more extravagantly luxurious than others – but they all give you a glimpse into plantation life while surrounded by beautiful grounds."

      "description": "RURAL HACIENDA: A relaxed day today, as you decide whether to simply relax at your hacienda or make a visit to the sisal plantation at Sotuta de Peon. A tour here will take you back in time to the colonial period, the machinery is immaculately preserved, and you’ll be able to see how everything worked back at that time. A highlight for the children will be a ride on the traditional plantation transport, a wooden carriage on wheels, pulled along by a mule. The ride takes you to an underground cenote where you can cool off in the water."

Bacalar has a picture-perfect location on the edge of the Lagoon of Seven Colours. Take in the spectacular views as you settle in this evening."

      "description": "BACALAR: Today you have a full free day to make the most of the lake. A boat ride out on the lake is a great way to see the colour change as the depth of the water varies. In the shallows, the colour is a vivid turquoise, and in the deepest areas it’s so deep it’s almost black. Stop in the most picturesque spots for a swim, or paddle under your own steam by kayak or SUP if you’re feeling active."

      "description": "BACALAR – CAYE CAULKER: You’ll be crossing the border into Belize today, as you drive to Chetumal and take the public ferry to Caye Caulker, not far off the Belizean coast. Enjoy some well-deserved chill-out time; the rest of the day is free for you to start to explore the island. Caye Caulker is only 8km from end to end, an idyllic barefoot place filled with rustic souvenir stands, weather-beaten clapboard houses, and small art galleries. Forget travelling by car – there are none here! The roads are all unpaved and the locals get around by bike, golf cart, or on foot. The simple eateries here offer local home-cooked seafood lunches; you’ll be spoilt for choice so check what the catch of the day is. You’ve arrived right next to the Belize Barrier Reef, home to some of the best snorkelling and scuba diving in the world."

      "description": "CAYE CAULKER: Today enjoy a completely free day. Simply relax and wander around, stopping for the occasional cold drink of bowl of ceviche, or pre-book a snorkelling or diving excursion off the coast. Our most popular snorkelling excursion is a half-day trip to Hol Chan and Shark Ray Alley. Hol Chan is the location of a natural break in the barrier reef that’s home to a superb array of brightly coloured marine life and coral garden. Visibility is normally superb, and this is an unforgettable experience. Further along, you’ll come to Shark Ray Alley; the shallow waters here have a large population of (harmless) nurse sharks as well as many rays and sea turtles."

      "description": "SAN IGNACIO – ACTUN TUNICHIL MUKNAL: Today, adventurous families who are up for a bit of a challenge can head deep into Actun Tunichil Muknal Cave. Starting with a jungle hike into Tapir Mountain Nature Reserve, you’ll dip into the river for a short swim to enter the cave itself, accompanied by a local specialist guide. Following a tunnel through the water and navigating a maze of rocks, clambering over boulders, and squeezing through passageways, you’ll continue deeper into the cave system. As you go, your guide will point out rock formations, and eventually you’ll reach the Mayan burial chamber complete with calcified remains (including a centuries-old Maya Princess), ceremonial vessels, and various Mayan artefacts. An unforgettable experience."

      "description": "SAN IGNACIO: Today is left free so you can decide between the many activities on offer here. Perhaps go tubing on the Macal River, passing Mayan villages and tropical rainforest. Keep your eyes open for giant iguanas high up in the branches and cool off in the clear waters of the jungle river. Other options include visiting the fabulous ruins of Xunantunich, horse-riding through the rainforest, or many other guided hiking or canoeing excursions. The nearby town of San Ignacio also has various possibilities such as a cacao workshop or the Green Iguana Sanctuary."

If you’d like a stop, consider Belize Zoo, a non-profit educational organisation, wildlife rescue and rehabilitation facility. Considerable effort has been made to conserve Belize’s natural environment here, and the animals are able to disperse themselves into the dense, natural vegetation, separated by gravel trails."
