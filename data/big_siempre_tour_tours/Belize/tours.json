Your adventure begins in Playa del Carmen – it’s recommended that you book a couple of extra days here to chill on the coast and explore at your own pace before the trip starts. You’ll have a welcome meeting with your local leader and fellow travellers at 6 pm at your hotel. If you arrive early, maybe go snorkelling or cycling, or simply stroll along the sandy playa (beach). Tonight, head out with your group leader for an included dinner at a local taquisa for a selection of delicious tacos – maybe order one with freshly caught fish! To improve your lingo, your group leader will run an informal Spanish lesson between bites, so that you can understand your burritos from your banos."

See how this walled city of ruins clings to a clifftop overlooking the ocean. Grab some cool photos before heading down to the beach for an optional swim with the ruins towering over you.

Maybe you’d like to explore Dos Ojos (two eyes) – one of the area's most famous cenotes (natural sinkholes), this pair of connected caves is an underwater world full of stalagmites and stalactites. Tonight, maybe you’ll explore the vibrant nightlife of Tulum with your fellow travellers – check out a DJ set at a beach club or enjoy a live band."

Arrive in San Ignacio – a lively town that makes a solid base for exploring the surrounding fast-flowing rivers, waterfalls and Mayan ruins.

You might take a day tour to the Mountain Pine Ridge Forest Reserve to visit waterfalls and swimming holes or float down the Macal River in canoes or tubes. If you prefer a slower pace, maybe take a trip to Xunantunich – an impressive ancient Maya city. Getting to the site is half the fun, as you'll need to take a hand-cranked ferry down the river.

If you're into salsa dancing – or if you'd just like to learn some moves – Antigua is the place to be! Many dancing schools offer hourly lessons, so maybe sign up and get moving.

The number one stop for any chocoholic should be the ChocoMuseo, where you can get a chocolate history lesson and, more excitingly, participate in a chocolate-making workshop. For those more interested in the other famous Central American bean, you can go on a coffee tour, visit the plantations, do some tastings and buy some beans to take home.

Belize's oldest and largest national park - Mountain Pine Ridge Forest Reserve - offers caves to explore, cool rivers for swimming, and a seemingly endless forest that is home to myriad tropical birds. The real hub of the district is San Ignacio, a small town featuring rustic, colonial-era streets, an eclectic mix of restaurants and shops and a lively weekly market."

Here there is a vast, bustling market, and you can wander the labyrinthine streets lined with textiles, clothes and tapestries of striking colour and extraordinary intricacy, as well as extravagant hand-carved masks and good-quality leather goods. Local farmers also bring an array of fruit and vegetables from the surrounding villages, which they both barter and sell. Later in the day continue onto Lake Atitlán (1 hour), one of the most captivating in the world, its beauty eulogised by poets and travellers. On a sunny day, the closely forested volcanic cones are reflected in cobalt waters. Traditional villages and indigenous agricultural settlements skirt its fertile shores, each with its own character and identity, its own dialect and often a unique costume still worn by the proud inhabitants."

Here you can surround yourself in the mysteries of the ancient ruins in the heart of the jungle. Further up the river, Orange Walk Town is known as \"Sugar City\" reflecting this farming region's robust sugar cane industry."

We'll return to the lodge for breakfast and then set off to the New River for a boat ride upstream to the 2000-year-old jungle ruins of Lamanai. Water birds are abundant in the ancient rainforest, and we might be able to spot crocodiles lurking on the riverbank. Lamanai, the original name of these Maya ruins, means 'Submerged Crocodile,' which helps to explain the numerous carved crocodile representations at the site. The ruins are located some distance off the beaten track and are still not reconstructed or cleared. We'll approach on foot, following well-marked trails. The surrounding rainforest, with its thick canopy of huge trees and humid atmosphere, adds an air of mystery to the scattered and overgrown relics.

Less well-known than its famous neighbours (Costa Rica and Mexico), Belize has a terrific amount to offer adventurous families. <br/><br/>Boasting the world’s second largest barrier reef (after Australia) most people will want to get under the sea at some point during their visit. The swimming, snorkelling, and diving opportunities here are world-class and the beaches are a paradise. Combine the dazzling white sand with the colourful marine life and you won’t want to leave. <br/><br/>If you prefer to stick to dry land, you won’t be disappointed by the richness of wildlife in the rainforests, and the mysterious temple complex at Lamanai. Keep your eyes (and ears) open for howler monkeys, tropical birds, and bright lizards through the dense foliage. <br/><br/>Our holidays are individually tailored for you and your family, so we will discuss the finer details with you and adapt each itinerary according to your timeframe, number of people, age of children, preferences, and budget. <br/><br/>Belize is Central America’s best-kept secret and will remain in your memory for many years to come.",

A tour with a local guide introduces you to some of the city’s finest colonial buildings and churches. There is also an included excursion to Las Isletas, a 365 island archipelago, formed 20,000 years ago when the Mombacho volcano erupted, hurling its top half into Lake Nicaragua in giant masses of rock, ash and lava.

You are based in the comfort of a secluded lodge on Lake Petén. Later in the afternoon you may investigate the extensive grounds of a nature reserve adjacent to the hotel, including the jungle-clad areas on the shore of Lake Petén, where crocodiles have been spotted lurking in the shallows, and you might come across the elegant wild deer grazing in the shade.

Today's city tour ends at the museum, and you can opt to spend more time exploring or head back to the centre with our tour leader. Please note, our walk will cover around 10 kilometres/6 miles, including time at the museum, so comfortable shoes are recommended."

        "description": ": Our destination today is Teotihuacan, a mysterious complex of pyramid ruins, abandoned 13 centuries ago. En route, we'll make a stop at the Basilica de Guadalupe, an important pilgrimage site for Mexicans which has a miraculous story to tell (our tour leader will fill us in). Moving on to the Teotihuacan Pyramids, we'll take some time to explore. Once the largest city in the Americas, with 100,000 inhabitants, its influence swept through Middle America and Maya craftsmen borrowed its decorative motifs and building designs. Centuries later, the Aztecs came to call Teotihuacan 'the Place of the Gods', giving you a hint at its importance. After our visit, we'll have lunch nearby (not included) and we might have time to discover the ancient uses of agave and obsidian in a workshop and craft shop nearby. In the afternoon, we'll head back to Mexico City and, if you'd like to, there'll be the chance to climb the Torre Latinoamericana this evening - one of the tallest buildings in the city, with a panoramic viewing platform that gives views across the downtown and beyond."

The drive will take around eight hours, but we'll make several stops along the way. During the latter half of our journey, we'll be treated to beautiful views out to the Sierra Madre Mountains and the cactus-covered landscape. Arriving in Oaxaca in the later afternoon, we'll get our bearings with an orientation tour. It's a captivating city with vibrant colours and charming architecture at every turn. The pedestrian street that leads up to the ornate Santo Domingo church is lined with shops, cafes, restaurants, and small artisanal markets, while the Zocalo is a social hub for local families, street vendors and entertainers come evening. Why not get a taste of local life and take a seat in one of the terrace restaurants overlooking the hubbub?"

        "description": ": As with many of Mexico's colonial cities, Oaxaca was built in the 16th century using stones from ancient civilisations in the surrounding areas. Today, we'll visit Monte Alban which was built by the Zapotec people who flourished here over 1,500 years ago. This complex of temples, pyramids and enigmatic rock carvings was built on top of a hill (so expect some steep inclines and stairs on our walk). The expansive views over the Sierra Madre and the fertile valley are well worth the effort. Unlike sites like Teotihuacan, Monte Alban was lived in until the arrival of the conquistadors, as the Mixtec civilisation took over from the Zapotecs and continued its use. This afternoon, we'll have free time to explore Oaxaca. Take a walk through the historic centre and soak in the colourful buildings, dip into one of the markets to pick up souvenirs or delve further into the history of the city at one of the museums. The Museum of Cultures of Oaxaca, next to the Santo Domingo Church, is one of the best in town, housing treasures from Monte Alban within the building of an ex-convent (opening hours vary over public holidays)."

Our first port of call is a 2,000-year-old swamp cypress tree in Santa Maria del Tule, close to Oaxaca. The tree has a circumference of 54 metres and has the shortest trunk of any in the world. Next, we'll head to the small town of Teotitlan del Valle, a region where it's more common to hear the Zapotec language than Spanish. Here, weaving has been a local technique since ancient times, and we'll see how the craftsmen make fine works of art. We'll continue to the ancient Mixtec site of Mitla, where we'll have an explanation of the ruins. Finally, we'll journey on to Tehuantepec, a convenient stopping point on our journey to San Cristobal. Note, our drive time today is ten hours, including stops."

The canyon is a unique rift measuring 41 kilometres long and up to 1000 metres deep, cut by the Rio Grijalva. This is the spot where, in the 16th century, 1000 Chiapa indigenous people committed suicide rather than submit to Spanish rule. We'll take a trip on a speed boat to fully appreciate the towering gorge, before driving for two hours up a scenic mountain road to San Cristóbal de las Casas. At 2,210 metres above sea level, it can get cold at night, a sharp contrast to the heat of Tehuantepec."

Today, we'll be visiting San Juan Chamula and Zinacantan, indigenous villages close to San Cristobal that practise an interesting blend of Catholicism and traditional Maya beliefs. This area is famous for its bright textiles and weavings in intricate designs. You might like to pick up souvenirs here during our free time this afternoon. Much like Oaxaca, San Cristobal is a charming town to explore on foot and also has its fair share of museums. The Na Bolom, House of the Jaguar, is dedicated to the preservation of the Lacandón tribe and displays many of their artefacts, while the Textiles Centre is a superb showcase of the weaving traditions found both in Chiapas as well as the rest of Mexico and Central America. There are also museums dedicated to amber and jade, that not only display historical pieces but also give an understanding of the importance of these materials to the ancient civilisations."

Once the choking forest was cleared, the ruins revealed the tomb of the high priest Pakal, his body adorned with a marvellous jade death mask - one of the most prized relics of the Maya culture, discovered only in 1952.

Initially settled in about 600 BC, Tikal was abandoned by its rulers around 890 AD and totally deserted a hundred years later. The city covered an area of 16 square kilometres. Re-discovered in 1848, only a few of its great temples and pyramids have been excavated. The site is extensive, so we include a guided tour in the morning followed by free time to let you explore.

        "description": "ANTIGUA (B) Following breakfast you will be met for walking tour in Antigua La Antigua (the old one), former colonial capital of the Kingdom of Guatemala, combines 17th and 18th century buildings and ruins with all the modern conveniences discerning travelers desire. The city was established as Santiago (St James) in 1543 after a mudslide destroyed the former capital. Santiago’s history was punctuated by massive earthquakes, followed by rebuilding and reparation, until the earthquake of Santa Marta in 1773 prompted a move to the present capital in Guatemala City. Declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979, Antigua exudes a unique atmosphere of history, intrigue and surprise. Resting in a fertile valley at 1530 m and surrounded by hills and volcanoes, Antigua’s climate is likened to ‘eternal spring’ Central Park, also known as the Plaza Real, Plaza de Armas or parque central, this was the center of government, commerce and society and formed the center of the original street grid system. Its gardens and mermaid fountain make it a pleasant place to watch the Guatemalans at work and play. On the south side is the Palace of the Captain-General, home to the governor and his family, the soldiers and their horses, offices for employees, and the Royal Mint. On the north side is the Ayuntamiento (City Hall), built in 1740, its solid construction and graceful arches continue in daily use. Along the west, formerly ‘bakers row’, are banks, cafés, bookstores etc. Gracing the east side is the Cathedral, inaugurated in 1680 and destroyed in 1773. The front portion has been restored and is currently in use while the rest, which can be visited, lies in ruins. Church and Convent of Santa Clara, stark and imposing from the street, the beautiful baroque façade of the church can only be admired from within the convent complex. Then, you will return back to Antigua. Overnight at Meson de Maria or similar (deluxe room)"

Walk among giant pyramids towering over 200 feet at dawn to feel the magical vibration of Tikal and its historic splendor. Listen to the jungle sounds of exotic birds, monkeys and small mammals and feel the humid jungle air on your skin as the Maya inhabitants of this site felt it 2000 years ago. Immerse yourself in the jungle at dawn for an early morning tour through the archaeological site to experience the jungle come alive as it wakes up at sunrise, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get in touch with nature and marvel at the majestic pyramids hidden away in the jungle. This magical ancient city is teeming with native flora and fauna. If you are lucky you may be able to spot a jaguar walking leisurely through the park, although large numbers of visitors have caused the wildlife to move further into the jungle away from the noise. Howler monkeys here are famous for their loud growling sounds which may surprise you from a tree top overhead. Keep an eye out for colorful birds throughout the park such as toucan, parrots, eagles and quetzals. Tucked away in the vast Peten Region that covers 222 square miles of lush jungle in the northwest corner of Guatemala lie the ruins of the most magnificent archaeological site and important Maya citadel in Mesoamerica. Tikal National Park, declared as a UN World Heritage Site in 1979, is the largest excavated archaeological site on the American continents and is one of the most important natural reserves of Central America. It is known that Tikal, meaning “Place of Voices” in Maya, was one of the most powerful cities of their era covering more than 16 square kilometers and dominating other tribes in the surrounding region as well as interacting with neighboring cultures as far as Teotihuacan in the Valle de Mexico. The site was estimated to house between 10,000 - 90,000 inhabitants before being abruptly abandoned over 1000 years ago. *If you prefer, you can purchase your entrance tickets at any Banrural bank in Flores the day before the tour to avoid waiting in line."

The home stay will give you a genuine insight into the everyday lives of a local family during your trip by staying one or more more nights with a family from the Kakchiquel Indigenous group in San Jorge La Laguna. Maya Experience Home Stays has started this home stay program in the village to give something back to the communities around Lake Atitlan, and also to give you a very genuine experience of living with a Maya local family to experience their culture and customs. This experience is very new to the village and families who welcome foreigners into their homes. As a responsible traveler, we as guests must be aware of and sensitive to the culture by behaving respectfully during our time with the family and in the village. Although shy at first, the villagers are very friendly and welcoming people. Make sure you ask permission to take photos of the people in the village since the Mayan community commonly believes a photograph will steal their soul. You will most likely find the housing situation in San Jorge La Laguna rather basic but the reason for partcipating in this home stay is to enjoy a real insight into Guatemala, so you can experience the culture firsthand and interact with the local community on a personal basis. We hope that you enjoy this very unique experience. A small gift for the family would be a nice gesture of appreciation for the family welcoming you into their home. Cooking or kitchen materials such as pasta, rice, sugar, fruit, vegetables or kitchen utensils are very much appreciated ($3 USD per person approx). Other materials from your home country or children's books (coloring, basic English, workbooks, almanacs) would be a great addition to the family library."

        "description": "Panajachel - Antigua, Guatemala: Maya Homestay Experience 2D/1N with Maya Communities Lake Tour - Day 2 of 2 Boat Tour of Lake Atitlan with visits to indigenous villages. Return to Panajachel (B) You will have all the instructions on how to go from the Homestay to the meeting point. Then, you will hop in a boat for a tour of Lake Atitlan and a visit to its colorful indigenous villages. The word \"atitlan\" is translated from Maya as \"the place where the rainbow gets its colors\" and accordingly you will understand why so many people have been drawn to this magical lake for hundreds of years. Panajachel alone is an 800 year old town home to mostly Cachikel Maya and an increasing number foreigners from every corner of the globe, all coming together to soak up a piece of that serenity and originality that this place provides. You'll visit the following villages: San Pedro La Laguna, much like Panajachel has a large population of bohemian tourists and ex-pats, however the indigenous people of the town still preserve their original ways of life and wear traditional dress, remain very conservative and practice the same style of subsistence agriculture that their ancestors practiced years ago. Just outside of town coffee crops are cultivated on the mountain side and hard working farmers hike up and back on a daily basis to tend to their crops. Walk uphill towards the town center (away from the docks) and you will see a whole different side to this popular lakeside village. Santiago Atitlán is the largest of the communities around the lake with a population of over 32,000, 95% of which are indigenous Tz’utujils. Traditionally, it is fishing and farming town; it is also known for the manufacture of cayucos, wooden canoes. Directly from the dock, the main street leads visitors up to the main square where there is a vibrant and very lively indoor/outdoor marketplace where street hawkers target \"gringos\" as they wander by looking for good deals on original locally made souvenirs. Santiago is also home to a very interesting Maya/Catholic sacred statue called Maximon (also known as San Simon by the Spanish and Rilaj Maam by the Maya). All Guatemalan people worship this deity and go to him to ask for blessings or give offerings. During \"Semana Santa\" (Holy Week) in March/April, the statue is paraded around town and celebrations are held to worship this Guatemalan god. If you can, catch a glimpse of this interesting and very unique local custom. San Antonio Palopo is one of the most interesting villages around lake Atitlan and the best place to really get an idea for how these traditional indigenous towns used to feel. Walking through the village one can see people wearing intricately designed \"huipiles\" (woven tunics) and women weaving fabric made of wool and cotton. Take in the views of this tranquil town and imagine what the villagers' peaceful life is like living in adobe houses with tin roofs, farming and selling souvenirs to make a living. This is one of the best places to purchase a \"huipil\" traditional hand-woven tunic knowing that the profits are going straight to the villagers. You will be dropped off back in Panajachel when the tour is finished. Panajachel to Antigua Type: Shuttle Time: 12:00, 16:00 Duration: 2.5 Hours Transfer from Panajachel to Antigua You will be picked up at your accommodation/meeting point for your shuttle transfer to Antigua, where you’ll be dropped off at your next accommodation/meeting point."

Starting on Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula, you can chill out after your journey in Playa del Carmen, ready to take on the cultural wonders of Tulum, the first Maya archaeological site on our trip. <br/><br/>Belize also has a fine mix of coast and ancient culture, and we spend a couple of days on Caye Caulker where you are left to enjoy beach life at your own pace, with everything on hand from snorkelling to manatee spotting.  Inland Belize is also wonderful to explore, as you will discover in San Ignacio, where we discover greener, more mountainous landscapes as well as the mix of Maya and Garifuna cultures. <br/><br/>We spend the rest of our trip in Guatemala, nine days in all, taking in a wonderful array of both culture and nature in this stunning country. Every day offers something completely different, such as Tikal National Park with the ancient Maya city at its heart, the contemporary Maya culture in Chichicastenango , the world famous Lake Atitlan and its capital of Antigua.<br/><br/>We build plenty of free time into our trips, and guests can choose to opt for additional activities if they wish, according to their budgets and interests. We stay in small, locally owned hotels, where friendliness makes up for frills, but where you will gain a sense of Central American life. We also don’t include most meals on this trip, so you can budget for food in a way that suits you best. There is certainly no shortage of fine food in these three countries, whether it is street or gastronomic.",

You’ll be transferred to nearby Playa del Carmen where you’ll spend two nights in a cosy, central hotel with a pool perfect for a refreshing dip. It may not be ‘authentic Mexico’ but it’s a good place to acclimatise to the tropical heat, and to meet our local partners to run through the adventure ahead. There are plenty of shops, bars and restaurants here, and miles of soft sandy beaches to relax on. You’ll then make your way to the bus station in Playa del Carmen where you’ll then board the bus to Chichen Itza. The journey takes about 3 hours."

        "description": "Over the next few days, you’ll journey from the Caribbean coast across the Yucatan peninsula to Campeche, on the Gulf of Mexico. Your first stop is the ancient city of Chichen Itza – a spellbinding look back into the past, and a peek into the life of Mayan civilisation. Your hotel is a pleasant hacienda not far from the site, where you can while away the afternoon beside the pool, before getting up early the next morning to visit these amazing ruins before the crowds or the heat gets too intense. Next, you’ll travel by bus to the city of Merida, around 3 hours away. You’ll be spending 2 nights in this charming colonial gem, with its host of great eateries, bars, markets and live music. On your second day in the city, you’ll be picked up after breakfast for a trip to explore one of Yucatan’s natural wonders, cenotes. These are natural pits or sinkholes which have appeared, creating an underground grotto which provides an unforgettable spot for swimming. The next morning, you’ll take the bus for around 3 hours to Campeche – a former pirate city on the Gulf of Mexico, with a UNESCO listed walled centre packed with colonial buildings and narrow streets. Your hotel is within the old centre, close to the major historical sites, as well as some great bars and restaurants. There’s nothing planned for your time here, so you can explore at will and enjoy this final stop on your journey across the Yucatan. You’ll then make your way to the bus station in Campeche where you’ll then board the bus to Palenque. The journey will take about 6 hours."

The town itself is fairly unremarkable, but it’s within reach of something which is really quite remarkable. The following morning you’ll be taken to the nearby Palenque Mayan ruins, surrounded by thick jungle, widely considered some of the best in Mexico. You’ll have time to explore these spectacular ruins at your own pace, before you head to the nearby Roberto Barrios waterfall where you can cool off before heading back to relax at your hotel. Next up you’ll head to the bus station and travel from Palenque to San Cristobal. The journey today will take around 5.5 hours."

The Chamulans are a fiercely independent Tzotzil group and together with a local guide, you’ll learn about the rituals and inhabitants and really get to understand the culture of the Tzotzil Indians. After making your way to the bus station, you’ll take the bus from San Cristobal to the border where you’ll switch to a minivan for the scenic journey to Lake Atitlan.

Today, their descendants, known collectively as the Maya, number well over 6 million individuals, speak more than twenty-eight surviving Mayan languages, and reside in nearly the same area as their ancestors. Mesoamerica was one of six cradles of civilization worldwide. The Mesoamerican area gave rise to a series of cultural developments that included complex societies, agriculture, cities, monumental architecture, writing, and calendrical systems. The set of traits shared by Mesoamerican cultures also included astronomical knowledge, blood and human sacrifice, and a cosmovision that viewed the world as divided into four divisions aligned with the cardinal directions, each with different attributes, and a three-way division of the world into the celestial realm, the earth, and the underworld.<br/><br/>Travel the Ruta Maya solo, with friends, your family or in a escorted group travel with tourleader.

The zoo encompasses 29 acres and houses approximately 48 different species. Gravel trails lead through the forest landscape, separating the enclosures of the animals. Each animal at the zoo is native to Belize. The kids spot a tapir, a pig-shaped mammal with a prehensile snout, resembling a short elephant trunk. A tapir can grow more than six and a half feet long and weigh up to 700 pounds. The zoo instituted the “Problem Jaguar” program in 2003 to help reduce the number of hunted animals. The successful rehabilitation program has also led to the welcomed rescue of Junior Buddy, who was raised mostly by the zoo staff. His friendly disposition towards people has provided the zoo with a new experience for visitors. Junior Buddy’s story helps locals understand the importance of grazing space for jaguars, along with the rekindling awe in children for wild animals and the forests of Belize.

After breakfast, you meet your guide on the pier for your half-day snorkel tour.

Back on the boat, your guide passes out oranges to eat that helps get the taste of seawater out of your mouth. He explains the history of the Shark Ray Alley, and how fishermen used to throw the trimmings over their boats, attracting sharks. Once there the kids are excited but scared to enter the water. Large rays swim near the seafloor. Their bodies flap like wings in the current. Nurse sharks hover near the boats reaching for food. They can grow to over 10 feet long. They use a sucking method of eating to catch their prey, using short influxes of water. They are not dangerous to people, but their proximity still causes your heart to beat ravenously.

Visitors take their stand-up paddleboards out onto the shallow, clear water, splashing against the current. An American expat teaches yoga on a rooftop overlooking the water. The island is more tranquil, with slow moving cyclists and golf carts along the narrow, sporadic roads. The northernmost section of the island was declared a forest reserve in 1998, encompassing 100 acres. Mangrove warblers and tricolored herons linger on the upper branches. Black mangrove trees grow along the shores of the shallow water. The root system supports the delicate ecosystem for both the sea and the island. Fish feed on the roots. Sponges and anemones cling to the submerged sections of the trees. Coconut palms dangle lush fruit above the beach. For a challenging but excellent view of the reserve, the family takes a kayak tour.

A red tip and orange sides make the toucan’s bill stand out from the surrounding foliage. Extensive trails run like veins through the jungle allowing for hikes spanning an hour to multiple days. Victoria Peak, the highest mountain in Belize, rises to 3,675 feet above sea level and looms above the sanctuary. Your guide points out fresh jaguar tracks in the ground. Although you find signs of recent activity, jaguars are masters of stealth. The leaves rustle around the tall lowland evergreen trees. Your heart pounds with excitement and fear as you wonder if a jaguar will jump out of the brush. Instead, you find a paca, a large rodent with stripes and dots on its back. It resembles a large, shorthaired guinea pig. A paca can grow up to 20 inches in length and with a cone-shaped body. They feed on fallen fruits from fallen trees and the underbrush.

The architectural feat causes the entire family to stop in awe. The visitor center provides a stunning view from the ridge looking out to the southern coastal plains. The white stones demarcating the road disappear beneath the jungle canopy. You walk among the terraces and hill slopes the Mayan utilized to create platforms and outline the plazas. Archeologists excavated three tombs in the residential area, connoting the site as the Plaza of the Royal Tombs. The kids want to run around the ball court located at the midpoint of the city. Two mounds frame a sunken rectangular court. Although the no one knows the rules of the game, the movement of the ball represented the sun, moon, and other astronomical bodies."

        "description": "The morning on Placencia always feels tranquil and inviting. You wake up as eager as the kids to see what adventure the new day brings. Today you make your way to Laughing Bird Caye, an island 11 miles off the Placencia coast. The national park spreads across nearly two acres, named for the laughing gull that breeds on the island. When the gull calls out, it sounds like a chortle. When you arrive on the island shores, you find pelicans roosting on the thatched-roof huts. White sand spreads across the beaches. Coconut trees tower above the inland walkways. Mangrove roots sprawl into the saltwater providing a balanced ecosystem where fish feed and anemones cling to the sturdy submerged sections of the tree. The park is divided into three zones: the recreational zone, buffer zone, and the preservation zone. Your guide provides a presentation of the park by way of a brief introduction. You and the family step into your kayaks and follow your guide along the crystal clear, tepid water. The nearby Barrier Reef ensures a gentle current around the mini-atoll. Water splashes into your vessel when you paddle. The pristine beauty of Belize radiates both above and below the water, from the parrotfish around the coral to the green heron soaring near the treetops."

The water continues to beckon to the family with its reflective surface and inviting temperature. The colors of the Barrier Reef glint beneath the water’s surface. The sunlight can penetrate the clear sea more than 200 feet deep. You make your way to Gladden Split, a unique environment where whale sharks swim near large schools of fish. Your guide explains that divers and snorkelers are required to maintain a distance of 10 feet at all times. You venture into the turquoise water in search of the mammoth creatures. The shark can grow to more than 40 feet long, holding the record as the largest non-mammalian vertebrate in the animal kingdom. When clarity at Gladden Spit is good, you can see between 33 and 98 feet in front of you. The outline of the whale shark forms in the distance. Its grand size is unmistakable."

Their calls consist of monosyllabic whistles and hoots. At breakfast, you sit beneath the thatched-roof open to the natural beauty surrounding the property. You and your partner indulge in an organic meal cooked by a celebrated chef, accompanied by a freshly brewed cup of coffee. After breakfast, you meet your guide at the stables. A number of horses roam freely across the property, rounded up only when guests wish to enjoy time along the trails on horseback. You and your partner saddle-up and make your way along a tranquil, secluded trail to the Mayan site of Xunantunich. You trot through broadleaf forest finding traces of howler monkeys along the way. Your guide points to the discarded shells of tree nuts on the forest floor. You arrive at Xunantunich, which means Stone Woman in the Yucatec Maya language, and dismount your horse. The core of the site encompasses nearly 3230 square feet. More than 26 temples and palaces surround a total of six plazas. El Castillo stands at the heart of the main plaza. It was erected in 800 AD and stands 130 feet tall. It is one of the tallest buildings in Belize. The pyramid stands beneath a series of terraces. Friezes depict the birth of a god connected to the royal family, along with various versions of creation, including the tree of life. Your guide explains that the tree is significant because the roots touch the underworld, the stump remains on earth, and the branches reach to the heavens. You and your partner find shared splendor in the mythology and history of the ancient site."

You follow the trail to a stairway leading you through the forest. Birds twitter in the treetops, but the landscape is otherwise quiet creating the feeling of privacy. A bright, sapphire blue glows through the foliage. Sunlight beams through the treetop and reflects off the water’s surface, making the pool look more like glass. Blue-crowned marmots take reprieve on the vines. Their colorful tail feathers dangle like tassels. The sinkhole was formed after an underground limestone cave collapsed. The surface water is located approximately 100 feet below the surrounding jungle. The pool drops another 25 feet into the underground cave system. You and your partner dip your toes into the water first. The subterranean temperature contrasts the warm forest providing a refreshing, sensual touch."

You and your partner step into a canoe and make your way along the quiet, emerald waters.

Vines from the growing trees wrap around the textured cliff. The sunlight fades. You turn on your headlamps to see the width of the cavern and its cathedral-like qualities. The air is cool. When you touch the walls, you find the slick surface as cold as the temperature. Stalactites drip down to head level. You and your partner weave around them. You can hear water dripping into the subterranean river. Your guide points to Mayan pottery shards almost overtaken by the earth. The cave travels nearly 21,000 feet through the mountain.

Offerings of maize, flowers, and small liquor bottles wrapped in cornhusks speckle the church floor as candles glow in specific patterns along stone platforms filling the gallery. The deep connection with Maya culture embodies the edifice and the traditions connected to the church. On Thursdays and Sundays the town erupts with activity from the bustling marketplace. The main plaza and avenues connecting to the square fills with vendors selling handcrafted goods. Guatemalans from across the country come to buy, sell, or even barter wares. Tin stalls stand beside makeshift wooden stands. Handmade wooden masks depict Maya deities and familiar animal figures. Hand-woven garments, from blouses to tunics, have embroidered flowers and depict small celebratory scenes. The colors of the clothing match the vibrancy of the market. The family gains a unique introduction to the culture of the highlands and the continued connection to tradition."

        "description": "Lake Atitlan is an isolated region in the Guatemalan Highlands. Encompassing 50 square miles, and reaching a maximum depth of 1,115 feet, it is the deepest lake in Central America. Rugged ridgelines and towering volcanoes separate the 12 indigenous villages from one another. The water sparkles azure in the rising sunlight. After breakfast, the family reaches the marina where boats drift in the lake’s wake and boards the boat. The kids are eager to visit the towns situated around the lakeside, and the breeze carries the aroma of freshwater. Wildflowers blossom across the lakeshores adding pastel colors to the emerald trees; fishermen paddle across the water in traditional dugout canoes. In San Juan La Laguna, you will find a village with close ties to its Mayan roots. Most of the village speaks Tz’utujil, one of the 23 Mayan dialects recognized in Guatemala. Your guide leads you through the winding streets to the Women’s Weaving Cooperative. Sit with the women who take pride in their work, as they pass down their trade to a new generation of weavers. Follow through the cooperative to learn the traditional dying methods and weaving techniques used by Mayan for generations. After your tour, hike through the coffee fields above the village to a lookout point providing views to San Pedro Volcano."

Your private transfer meets you at baggage claim at Mundo Maya International Airport and takes you to Ixpanpajul Nature Park. The kids marvel at the hanging bridges and twisting paths meandering through the canopy. You have a look at the dense vegetation of the jungle, which allows the family to get in close contact with the trees, branches, and vibrant birdlife. The six bridges rise more than 320 feet above the forest floor. Orchids bloom in the treetops. Hummingbirds flutter around blossoming flowers. The family has a clear view of the meandering jungle when the canopy opens. For the afternoon, your private transfer escorts the family to your accommodation at Tikal National Park. Your guide will meet you at the visitor center to provide an overview of your tour, and point out the remarkable size of the Mayan city on the scaled diagram. The park encompasses more than six square miles with approximately 3,000 Maya structures. The city flourished around the 8th century AD and continues to inspire visitors from around the world as it rises out of the dense forest. Two acropolises border the Great Plaza; Temples I and II face each other on separate edges of the square. Climb to the top of Temple II, known as the Temple of Masks. Weathered friezes flank the central stairway and provide the temple with its name. 12 main temples decorate the North Acropolis, first erected around the year 100 BC. Your guide leads the family beneath the forest canopy, pointing out the mixture of preserved artifacts, discovered structures, and temples still covered with jungle brush. As the sun begins to set, howler monkeys call out beneath the trees; their rugged cries echo against the stone pyramids. Climb to the top of the tallest pyramid, Pyramid IV, which rises more than 200 feet above the forest floor, and take in the sunset with your family."

Your private transfer meets the family at your hotel and leads you along the highway to the Belize border. Sporadic villages with grazing cows and clucking chickens line the road to the border. You notice the difference in Belize with towns sprouting along the road leading to the confluence of the Macal and Mopan River before you stop for a thrilling adventure in Belize. The family once again ascends to the treetops, this time ready to make way up to the forest floor on a series of nine zip lines spread across 15 platforms. Travel up to 2,900 feet across the jungle as the wind blows against your body. Imagine that this must be what a bird feels like as the emerald leaves become a streak of greenery passing you by. The kids shriek with delight, once more imitating the howler monkeys from Tikal. When the zip line tour finishes, step back into the van and travel along the Hummingbird Highway to Placencia. The highway is nearly 54 miles long and is the only major roadway connecting east and west Belize. The Maya Mountains run along the horizon. Orange, lime, and banana orchards grow near the road; narrow bridges cross the meandering streams. When you reach Placencia Peninsula, you already feel relaxed as you see the Caribbean Sea splashing against the eastern beaches and the tranquil lagoon to the west lapping at the shore."

At Laughing Bird Caye, hop off the boat and into the sea. Put on your goggles and snorkel, following your guide along the reef in search of an impressive variety of marine life. The water feels comfortable on your skin. Move easily with the current as angelfish zip around the branching arms of the coral. A large barracuda swims close to the kids; an occasional nurse shark passes beneath your feet swimming closer to the seafloor. The Great Belize Barrier Reef is the second largest unbroken reef in the world, behind the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. Sea fans sprout from the sand and wave in the moving water; conch shells provide an entire habitat for tiny sea creatures. The kids marvel at the entire world living beneath the surface of the sea.

When the heat begins to fade, the howler monkeys call to one another once again. Return to the boat, and make your way back to the mouth of the river.

After breakfast, make your way along the Hummingbird Highway, a scenic drive through the Maya Mountains. The aroma of citrus emanates from the orange and lime groves. Your driver points out the banana trees growing alongside the highway. A specific mountaintop resembles a large face, earning it the name “The Sleeping Giant.” Arrive at the traditional Garifuna town of Dangriga, located at the mouth of the North Stann Creek River.

Your escort meets you on the opposite side to continue your journey to the coveted grounds of Tikal, taking you deeper into the jungle. Goats and cows graze on the undulating hills encircling small towns as you pass sporadic waterways sparkling in the sunlight. You stop at the entrance gate Tikal. Signs tell visitors to watch out for snakes, jaguars, and wild turkeys as the guard checks your ticket into the park. Suddenly, you realize that you are standing in an area holding ten square miles of Mayan ruins. The limestone jungle allowed the trees and brush to swallow the abandoned former massive city due to its fast- growing vegetation. Your guide points out a tarantula clinging to a tree as a group of coati, animals similar to raccoons, roam through the lush grass in search of food. Sporadic steles rise out of the ground, edging thick stone staircases. The scale of the city comes clear in the Great Plaza, where Temples I and II face each other from across the square. Temple I, known as the Great Jaguar Temple, was erected in the 8th century AD and stands 154 feet tall. A large collection of human and animal bones, along with jade and shell ornaments, was discovered inside the tomb in the 1960s. The steep incline draws attention to the three-roomed structure, and the roof comb crowning the edifice. You have seen the iconic large central stairway leading to the pyramid plateau in photos, but the photos do not do the pyramids’ grandeur justice."

The aroma of fresh, decadent coffee drifts out of the favored cafes; indulgent chocolate displays fill the Chocolate Museum. Demonstrations provide visitors with tricks and techniques on how to utilize the various flavors of the chocolate in numerous dishes. Visit the Santo Domingo del Cerro Cultural Park for an exclusive look at the contemporary highland culture of Guatemala. The park contains sculpture galleries and murals dedicated to the works of Efrain Recinos, the Picasso of Guatemala. Recinos designed whimsical pieces that told stories of Guatemala’s history and blended heritage with the contemporary world.

A small museum exhibits the history and artistry of backstrap loom weaving. Demonstrations provide insight into the full process of weaving, from spinning the cotton fibers to producing a finished textile. A local artisan, using traditional weaving and dying methods and native to Santiago, made each product on display in the shop. The association helps pass down the traditions of weaving from generation to generation, along with ensuring a safe and friendly working environment for women and girls in the region. Friars erected the Colegio de San Jeronimo in the 18th century. The king of Spain took over the edifice and decreed it a Royal Customs House. Today, the site acts as an open-air museum; an octagonal fountain stands at the heart of the cloister. Occasional cultural performances enhance the beauty of the structure and showcase its connection to the greater city. The country is filled with incredible culture and a deep connection to its heritage, whether Pre-Columbian or Spanish. Outside of Lago Atitlan, the remnants of Kaqchikel’s 15th-century capital stand in a serene park-like setting in an area known as Iximché. Pilgrims from around Guatemala come to pay homage to the ceremonial site where more than 160 structures have been uncovered and mapped. The Great Palace I was a residential complex with three separate phases of construction. The first edifice covered 5,400 square feet and formed the core of the palace with four long single rooms encircling a courtyard. After your exploration of Atitlan and its surroundings you return to Antigua for the evening.

Laid-back and low-rise, the small town has preserved the atmosphere you would expect from a Caribbean island, even if it is connected to the mainland by a slither of white beach. Walk down to the beach to find warm, shallow waters, this part of the Caribbean almost like a lagoon. There is some good snorkeling to try just offshore, along with the option to try out scuba diving. Other than that, these days are all about your family being together in a beautiful location. If relaxation is not your family’s style, there is plenty of adventure to find in the nearby forests. Take a safari down Monkey River, continuing the verdant impressions of Belize’s wildlife. Soak up the sights and smells of Laughing Bird Caye National Park, where the rainforest meets the Caribbean and a morning snorkel is followed by an afternoon of bird watching. Your guide can accompany you to Hopkins, an energetic city that provides unique cultural encounters, and when a day of adventure is over, you can return to a mile of white beach and the sound of the waves."

The hotel stands amid an organic coffee plantation with an infinity pool looking out over exotic gardens. Despite being less than an hour from San Jose, it will feel like an entirely different landscape completely. Birds sing the evening lullaby and a volcano dots the horizon while fragrant smells sweep past the terrace, and you will be immersed in the cloud forest atmosphere. Today has the longest travel time on the itinerary, so after arriving in Central Valley, you are likely to relax on the outdoor deck, listening and watching the forest."

Your guide will help you create an itinerary for these couple of days, organizing the activities and transfers based on what you are interested in. Go kayaking along the river, or you can mountain bike or horseback riding to complement your hiking, with a superb range of trails to choose from. Cross hanging bridges and zip through the canopy on a small-group tour, an adrenalin activity that’s loved by teenagers. Canyoning is a new option, though not for younger children, while bird watching and the hot springs are perennial favorites.

Your guide leads you through the cobblestone streets to view the living history, thriving city, and remaining cracks of Antigua’s past. In Plaza Mayor groups of schoolchildren bask in the shade near the trickling water of the central fountain. The Arco de Santa Catalina reaches across 5a Avenida Norte, north of Plaza Mayor. The structure was erected in the 17th century to allow nuns to pass between the separate convents without being seen. A striking yellow building with trimmed plaster latticework and thick, short walls marks the Iglesia y Convento de Nuestra Senora de la Merced. The walls that helped the structure withstand earthquakes through the centuries are celebrated on the last Thursday of the month as a bell rings through the city. A candlelit procession starts and ends in the church, which is the only part of the edifice still in use today.

A mural stretches more than 600 feet to decorate the walls along the southern road leading into the city. The panels allude to Mayan culture, heritage, and visions of a hopeful future. The streets fill with fresh vegetables, freshwater fish, and goods from around the highlands. The entire town comes out to scour the stalls in search of kitchenware or textiles, fragrant chilies or hand-woven baskets. The scent of freshly baked bread overtakes the aroma of pineapple and papaya. Continue to the Pre-Columbian site of Iximche, a Mayan city abandoned in the 16th-century. The lush vegetation has overtaken much of the ruins. However, the core of the city has been excavated, surrounded on three sides by ravine walls.

A group of guards marks the entrance of the treasured archeological site as signs inform visitors to watch out for animals, from deer to snakes, and even jaguars. As the sun begins to rise over the jungle landscape howler monkeys, call out from their protected space high in the branches.

Wild iguanas wander along the footpaths and perch on high handrails. The zoo encompasses 29 acres and continues its mission of protecting injured, orphaned, and endangered animals endemic to the region.

The elusive jaguar keeps to the underbrush in the heat of the day, but your guide points out fresh tracks near the tree bases. The region boasts up to 300 recorded bird species and brocket deer graze on the underbrush, relishing the sunlight pouring through the trees."

        "description": "In the morning, listen once more for the endless birdlife filling the trees of your jungle lodge. The aroma of fresh cooked Johnnycakes, typical Belizean bread made of flour and coconut milk, drifts out of the restaurant kitchen. Your private transfer meets you at the hotel lobby and escorts you to the border of Belize and Guatemala. In Belize, restaurants, schools, and town-life ran alongside the road. In Guatemala, lush grass, rolling hills, and sporadic structures follow the road as cows graze in the tall blades of grassland. Chickens run beneath the elevated homes and roost in the shade. You see intermittent restaurants along the roadside with women patting corn dough flat and cooking the dough on an open grill until it turns into a fresh, hot tortilla. Arrive at Tikal National Park and check-in to your hotel; your guide meets you in the lobby and leads you to the entrance of the archaeological site. Tikal is much larger than Caracol and was constantly at war with the powers of Caracol. Large stucco masks decorate the sides of structures, and on Temple 33, you can make out the square face with rounded ears sticking out of the side and large, angular nose. A north and south acropolis border the Great Plaza. The magnificence of Temples I and II rise on opposite sides of the square facing each other. Your guide claps his hands to show how the Maya utilized sound; the king could stand atop a pyramid, and his voice would carry to everyone listening below. Temple I stands 154 feet tall, around 20 feet taller than the Sky Palace in Caracol. Archaeologists discovered the king’s tomb facing north, filled with jade, pearls, seashells, and a bone ornament depicting mythical animals rowing the man to the underworld."

After breakfast, make your way to the island of Flores, attached to the town of Santa Elena by an arched bridge. The island sits in Lake Petén Itza; the water laps against the promenade walls that surround the town. Taxi-boats travel to and from the surrounding shores bringing locals from nearby villages. The lake covers more than 24,000 acres and carries with a particular Mayan mystique. Step onto a private boat and explore the second largest lake in Guatemala. Your guide leads you across the water for a smooth exploration of the lake’s shores and provides a history of the lake and the villages around the water, including Flores. A Mayan city had been built on the island before the Spanish arrival, the Spanish raised the village in the 16th century and built the colonial structures visible today."

The jungles of Guatemalan and Belize have provided examples splendor and excitement, boldness and delicateness. Your private transfer meets you at your hotel ready to escort you to Maya Mundo International Airport for your flight home.

Start today in a canoe, paddling towards life along the banks. Monkey troops stop to watch you pass, vultures circle overhead, and you may spot the prints of large land mammals. By moving silently and effortlessly, your canoe safari gets you incredibly close to life along the riverbanks. After the canoe, you will continue on foot, specifically looking for the reserve’s exceptionally varied birdlife. You will be immersed in the rainforest, so feel the adventure and expect to come across a selection of land mammals as well. Wildlife encounters continue at the lodge, perhaps with the sound of a howler monkey when eating lunch, as Red-lored parrots fly past. When dusk descends, you can head out on a nighttime safari drive with a battery-powered golf cart to travel quietly through the trees. The big cats are most active at night, the cloak of darkness ideal for a hunt. A nighttime drive is the best opportunity to come across jaguar, margay, puma, and ocelot, with the guide using a spotlight to find the shimmering eyes of nocturnal fauna. Spectacular owls and northern potoos are other rare sightings, complementing the surreal smells and sounds of the landscape."

You can take in the views from the High Temple and listen to the tales that accompany the ruins. Much of the site is yet to be excavated, and all of it is dominated by jungle, creating the impression of a Maya world that is far from the rest of the world.

Once the capital of Guatemala, until a devastating earthquake left its indelible mark in the 1700s, the well-preserved buildings carry centuries-old scars in forms of dilapidated columns and fractured ceilings that contrast with the lavish constructions of Spanish wealth. Your flight lands at La Aurora International Airport in Guatemala City and as you descend you notice the natural beauty of the surrounding volcanic peaks that enclose the cityscape. The skyscrapers in the heart of the city rise to meet the summits of the surrounding peaks but fail to reach the height of the natural, towering mountains. Your private transfer meets you at baggage claim to escort you to the colonial streets outside of Guatemala City. The car winds through the hills on the scenic drive as lush trees climb the hillside. Tiny local restaurants built on outcrops offer a panorama of the city below, framed by the undulating landscape on the horizon. The cobblestone streets of Antigua welcome you as pastel painted buildings line the road, topped with tiled roofs. Hidden courtyards provide open spaces to the former mansions and current businesses and vines streak across the walls. Fountains trickle into stone pools and in the summer, the breeze blows across the water and with refreshing mist that carries through the halls. After settling into your hotel, make your way to the Chocolate Museum located on Calle del Arco, near the Arc of Santa Catalina. The aroma of rich chocolate fills the entrance, and your instructor will offer you a taste of tea, coffee, and cocoa nibs. Your introduction to the city comes by way of a chocolate lesson, as you learn the process of cultivation, fermentation, drying, and even roasting the beans before consumption. Your instructor teaches you the proper way to grind the nibs and mix in the grounds to prepare the decadent hot chocolate."

The aroma of freshly made tortillas overtakes the rich scent of roasted coffee beans as your guide meets you in the hotel lobby to show you the beauty of Antigua in the early light. The Spanish founded the city in 1543 and housed the capital of the Kingdom of Guatemala until the Santa Marta Earthquake. The cobblestone streets lead you to the vibrant ambiance of the Plaza de Armas. The Saint Joseph Cathedral crowns the shady square that overlooks the trees and vivacious central fountain. The Captain General Palace was erected in the 1550s. An arcade of arches supports the entire structure as the edifice once housed the government and military officials and created a luxurious ambiance for the family and friends of the staff. Part of the structure collapsed during an earthquake in the 1970s, and the restored structure captures the wealth and prestige of the city’s former glory. The town of Ciudad Vieja is located along the Escuintla Road; the Spanish founded the city as the first capital of Guatemala in 1527 before Volcan Agua released a flood of water from its crater."

The bright colors of fresh fruit, from papaya to lychee, foretell of the spectacular hues of the day to come. Leave Antigua behind for the town of Chichicastenango and travel along the Pan-American Highway, which stretches 19,000 miles from Alaska in America down to Ushuaia in Argentina. Take the winding road nearly 60 miles before reaching the town, and if it’s a Thursday or Sunday, the streets erupt with the activity of the local market. The scent of smoky incense traverses the streets to add mystique to the already thriving ambiance. Guatemalans from around the countryside arrive to barter, buy, and sell handmade goods and produce, along with toys and pottery. Different dialects echo through the air as the scent of incense disappears beneath an aroma of fragrant chicken and grilled corn. The town housed the largest trading center in pre-Columbian times, and the tradition continues today. Vendors showcase hand-carved wooden masks and musical instruments. Iridescent textiles dangle from the sides of makeshift stalls. The colors guide your eyes to the mural running alongside the town hall wall dedicated the victims of the civil war. Symbols of the Popol Vuh, a book compiled by Maya nobility, tell the story of the village life and legend."

Boats crisscross the water to take villagers from one remote settlement to another and converge at the contemporary town of Panajachel. Your guide leads you to a boat at the docks for a tour of the villages that span the remote lake in the Guatemalan Highlands. The boat docks at the pier of Santiago, an inlet between volcanoes Toliman and San Pedro. The roots of the indigenous community run deep as women wear purple-striped skirts and traditional embroidered tunics known as huipiles . Embroidered birds and flowers decorate the garments. Men build boats and set the half-shaped vessels along the shoreline. Visit the parish church erected by Franciscan monks in the 16th century; a plaque inside the entrance commemorates Father Stanly Francis Rother. Wooden statues of saints line the church walls as local women weave clothing for the statues and dress them once a year. The three colonial altarpieces symbolize the volcanoes around town; local mythology casts the altarpieces as guardians that protect Santiago from the volcano’s fury. The central piece represents the Mayan interpretation of a scared mountain with two fraternity members reaching a sacred cave. After your tour, return to Panajachel and make your way to Antigua for the evening."

Your private transfer will greet you upon your arrival and escort you to the famous Mayan ruins at Tikal. A tropical jungle surrounds the plazas, and ancient edifices as the city covers an area greater than six square miles and includes 3,000 structures. Wild turkeys graze around the base of a half-covered pyramid; the limestone landscape regenerates the lush vegetation quickly that once overtook the entire cityscape. Stela 4 depicts a mixture of Maya and Teotihuacan qualities and include entities from both cultures. The king stands with the Underworld Jaguar God, along with the Mexican Tlaloc. A simplified version of the Teotihuacan War Serpent adorns the king’s helmet. In the Great Plaza, Temple I and Temple II face each other. Temple I rises to a height of 154 feet above the plaza floor. Royal palace grounds flank the edges of the square on one side with a second acropolis framing the plaza on the opposite side. The pyramid was erected in the 8th-century AD and formerly held a frieze of the enthroned king. Archeologists discovered a large tomb with human and animal bone tubes, along with jade and shell ornaments."

The monkeys’ call can be heard from as far away as three miles. A small arched bridge connects the island of Flores to the city of Santa Elena; cross the bridge and listen to the calm waters of Lake Petén Itza lap against the walls encircle the promenade. At Mundo Maya International Airport, board your flight to Belize City, Belize. Before the plane lands, look out the window to see the mixture of lush jungle canopy and turquoise Caribbean Sea. Board your connecting flight from Philip S.W. Goldson International Airport to San Pedro Town Airport in Ambergris Caye. The short flight feels more like a scenic trip than a transfer as the turquoise water fills your view and spreads into cobalt hues along the horizon. Intermittent islands divide the blanket of glistening water. Your private transfer will meet you at baggage claim and escort you to a luxurious resort that overlooks the white sand beach of Ambergris Caye. The remainder of the day is yours to indulge in the seaside atmosphere of Belizean, Caribbean life. In the evening, make your way to a nearby restaurant for a taste of traditional cuisine.

        "description": "In the morning, the streets of San Pedro are quiet and relaxing. A small coffee shop at the southern edge of town emits an enticing aroma of freshly baked cinnamon buns. The sugary, herbaceous quality blends perfectly with the slightly salty sea air. After breakfast, make your way to the end of the resort’s jetty to meet your boat. Stand atop the wooden planks and see directly down to the seafloor in the crystal clear water. Board your boat and make your way to Hol Chan, the first of two snorkeling stops. The site is Mayan and stands for “Little Channel.” The natural break in the Great Belize Barrier Reef, the largest reef in the Western Hemisphere, ranges in depth from three to 30 feet. An extensive coral garden sprouts from the sandy floor as sea fans wave in the gentle current to push the fringes of the soft coral back and forth. Large conch shells look like boulders in the water, and the sea feels refreshing and welcoming around you. Follow your guide through the wonderment of the reef in search of schools of fish and the graceful manta rays. Yellow damselfish, which glow iridescent blues with a fluorescent neon tail, swim between the coral limbs. Your guide points at a drifting shell as a hawksbill turtle swims past. White lines along its fins look as if its skin were made of tiles as the average hawksbill grows to around three feet in length and weighs 180 pounds. Your second stop takes you to Shark Ray Alley, where fishermen used to throw unused bits and unwanted scraps into the water to draw attention from sharks and rays. Jump into the water, steer clear of the chum and come close enough to the group of nurse sharks to touch them."

Rainbow-hued kites catch the gusts and carry kitesurfers off of the wakes and into the air. After breakfast, the day is yours to indulge in the variety of wonders available on and around the island. Relax on a lounge chair at your resort and listen to the waves or indulge in a soothing massage as you overlook the sea. Venture to the nearby island of Caye Caulker and stroll through town or opt to kayak along the barrier reef. Choose to take part in another adventure or make your way to the famous Great Blue Hole. An atoll surrounds the deep blue circle that spans 984 feet across and reaches a depth of more than 400 feet. What was once a cave collapsed on itself to form the shape you now find. Limestone ledges at different depths drip with stalactites as sergeant major fish swim around the encircling reef. Their white coloration and yellow top, along with the black vertical stripes, stands out in the water’s blue. The mystique of the Great Blue Hole emanates from limestone and fish, coral and stalactites, merging two distinct worlds of land and sea."

This is ideal for wildlife sightings and presents an opportunity for your divemaster to follow unusual species. As the week continues, you will soon discover why Turneffe is the most spectacular and biodiverse of Belize’s atolls."

This is a place where big fish spawn and different species congregate during different months of the year. This abundance of new life attracts even bigger hunters, particularly sharks. This will be a dive that is designed to follow the action. The dive schedule for this week will not be set in stone. With a 15-dive package, you will pick and choose from more than 30 different dive sites, and your divemasters will have the final say based on local conditions. There are so many sites to choose from, so if there is a strong surge from the west, you can easily switch to the eastern side of the atoll."

You will experience Belize’s iconic attraction and one of the bucket-list dive sites that Jacques Cousteau helped present to the world. The Great Blue Hole is a surreal gap in the earth’s crust where the water is an eerie hue. Marine life is limited here, and many divers emerge disappointed because they expect a reef-style experience. After two days of reef diving there, you will really appreciate the Great Blue Hole as a subterranean world of caverns, stalactites, and stalagmites. You can take a boat to Lighthouse Reef in the morning and dive the Great Blue Hole."

With one dive, you can only see so much, but with a week, you will see more than you could have ever imagined. You will venture to Blackbird Caye for high-quality wall diving.

This towering monument epitomizes the Maya experience in Belize. First, take a hand-cranked ferry to cross the Mopan River, and then hike through the trees for almost 30 minutes. Only now does the city appear, a huge pyramid surging out from a clearing in the trees. A 10-meter stucco frieze covers the facade, constructed 1,100 years ago at a time when much of the Maya world was falling apart.

        "description": "Caracol is deep in the rainforest and accessed along a dirt road that is closed to anyone without permits. You will weave through the trees before approaching the city’s outskirts and then continue on foot through a site of baffling scale. This city covers a space that is far larger than modern Belize City and was home to over 180,000 people at its peak. It was the most powerful of all the region’s cities, a political kingpin that fought against or allied with others in Central America. In particular, Caracol overthrew Tikal’s warlords in the Snake Kingdom wars, and you will spend the whole day in Caracol, and you could probably spend an entire week and still not see everything. Moss-covered plazas appear in rainforest openings as monkey troops swing above the trail as you walk to pyramids. Intricate stelae are admired along with excavations that detail the sheer size of the city. An innovative reservoir system remains intact and still carries water into the city, some 1,500 years after it was finished. Keep exploring, and you cannot miss the sky palace, a towering pyramid that contains three temples and four palaces. Ascend the steps, and you stand on top of this pyramid, which remains the tallest building in the whole of Belize. While Maya pyramids may be even taller in neighboring Mexico and Guatemala, none are as bulbous and visually inspiring as this sky palace, the centerpiece of an epic lost city in the jungle."

A local takes you on a tour of the Gulisi Garifuna Museum, narrating a history that is proud and poignant. After lunch, you will continue south for an afternoon on white beaches, a quiet interlude to all the history and archaeology. Complete your journey by crossing a river and returning to the jungle, where your lodge has a location like the others within a nature reserve that teems with wildlife. Check-in and head out on one of the walking trails, or sit back on the balcony and arouse different senses."

        "description": "Jungle engulfed, the Maya Mountains set the scene on this final archaeological day in Belize. Stone terraces stand beneath the canopy as javelins of light pierce through to illuminate the intricate facades. Carved stone monuments further celebrate the artisanal style of the Maya, including an 11-meter stelae that still stands tall. You will visit two sites today beginning with Lubaantun. Lubaantun was a ceremonial center, constructed completely without mortar, a style that is distinctive in southern Belize. Nearby Nim Li Punit is also from the Late Classic Period, and you will immediately see how it gets its name as a stone-carved flowing headdress dominates one of the monoliths, with Nim Li Punit translating as “Big Hat” in English. These two sites provide the fitting culmination to everything that has gone before, a mix of captivating stories, newly excavated finds, and the innovation of the Maya."

The nearby city of San Ignacio has a vibrant center with a gracious, inviting atmosphere filled with bustling markets, and locals spanning the Belizean cultural spectrum from Maya to Mestizos, Garifuna to free-spirit expatriates. A private transfer greets you at the airport upon your arrival and helps with your bags. Cows graze in the undulating hills beyond the tree line. Howler monkeys hide in the canopy.

Water from the infinity pool spills into a small pond. The trickling sound echoes across the walkway, leading to the thatched-roof restaurant for breakfast. The sound imitates the nearby river rushing along the banks, outlining the property. After breakfast, you meet your guide near the lobby, ready to share in the adventure of a waterfall cave expedition. Travel along a portion of the Hummingbird Highway, the most beautiful road in Belize. The lush jungle trees overtake the foothills and mountains. The aroma of oranges and limes emanates from the citrus groves along the highway. You reach the trailhead and trek to the mouth of a cave winding hundreds of feet under the limestone mountain. You and your partner put on helmets equipped with headlamps before venturing into the depths of the cavern. The sound of rushing water echoes off of the limestone walls. The rugged texture of the cave turns smooth the closer you come to the reverberating hums of the river. The water meanders through the cave, trundling down into natural pools along six separate waterfalls. Crystal formations sparkle in the passing light. On your way out of the caves, you and your partner jump without fear into the natural pools, splashing with the cascades.

You and your partner indulge in the seclusion of your accommodation and the private view from your deck. An iguana scampers across the grass in the early light. Its impressive size can reach a total of six feet long, including its hardy tail. In the trees, you spot a collared aracari, a type of toucan with a brightly marked bill. Yellow and red plumage shine along the bird’s chest resembling licking flames against its black back. After breakfast, you meet your guide for an excursion to the Mayan city of Xunantunich. You can choose to follow the trails leading to the historic site or drive in a private car. A hand-cranked ferry takes you across the Mopan River. The city sits on a leveled hilltop. Archeologists believe the city’s genesis as a village began around 1000 BC. The architecture you see before you dates around the 7th century AD. Around Plaza A-3, you find outlines of the former residential palace, an area designated to the ruling family. El Castillo, a pyramid rising 130 feet tall, making it the second largest structure in the country, edges the south end of Plaza A-1. The friezes depict the birth and formation of distinct gods correlated with the royal family. Your guide encourages you and your partner to climb to the top of El Castillo. You have a 360-degree view of Xunantunich and the stucco frieze encircling the building. From the top of the pyramid, you and your partner have the best view in Belize.

Your guide greets you at the welcome area and escorts you once again along the Hummingbird Highway to the trailheads at Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary. The preserve encompasses 200 square miles of protected land, and is located in the eastern Maya Mountains. Animals are most active in the early mornings due to the cool temperature. Howler monkeys call out to one another in the canopy. Their rugged hollering sounds Jurassic. Their calls can be heard from up to three miles away. An estimated 50 jaguars, along with an exciting array of other animals, bird, and botanical life, make their home in the sanctuary. On the trail, you quickly spot a brock deer grazing on leaves and fruits. Their stout bodies emphasize their large ears. Later on the trail, you find fresh jaguar tracks leading into the jungle brush. The leaves rustle and your heart jumps into your throat wondering if a jaguar will soon leap over the bushes. Instead your guide points into the tree where a scarlet macaw nibbles on shoots. Their long, red tail feathers resemble streamers."

When scuba diving, you can swim down to see the cave walls, peering through the dark blue water until the limestone columns light up your view. It resembles an upside-down forest but instead of trees, you find stalactites. When venturing into the deep, your search turns from marine life to the sparse cave system, decorated with fascinating geological formations. You and your partner witness the grand architecture of a natural cathedral sunk beneath the sea."
