Hol Chan Marine Reserve, Mayan for “little channel”, is a stunning groove through the beautiful coral reef. It is protected as a marine sanctuary and plays host to a dazzling array of tropical fish. Shark Ray Alley is an area where fishermen used to empty their nets into the sea, attracting large families of Nursing sharks. Once fishing stopped in the area, tourism came to the rescue and now you can swim up close and personal with friendly nurse sharks and stingrays. (B/L)"
