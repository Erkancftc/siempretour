    "generalInfo": "During this twelve day Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia holiday, you will dip in and out of great capitals, Cold War history and even the coast. Starting in Estonia’s capital of Tallinn, where the medieval walled old town is a hub of Estonian contemporary and ancient culture. Followed closely by Tartu, a fascinating Hanseatic city dating back to the 11th century.  In between these two towns, and as with all the stops on this tri-nation holiday, wilderness is never too far away and here in Estonia, we take time in Lahemaa National Park where the terrain varies from empty beaches to ancient moss covered pine forests that feel untouched by time or human intervention. <br/><br/>Moving south into Latvia, we’ll enjoy the cultural gems of Cecis, a beautiful medieval a town located in the Central Vidzeme uplands where the castle and cobbled streets are a delight to wander around. Wandering is also a theme in the nearby Gauja National Park, where we will have a guided tour through this unusual red and yellow sandstone river valley carved up with cliffs and caves, including the famous Gutmanis caves. A magical world under an hour from Riga, Latvia’s art nouveau inspired capital and UNESCO World Heritage Site. <br/><br/>The last country on this Baltic journey is Lithuania, with your visit starting in Klaipeda, an ancient port town with fine castle ruins and historic traditional houses. There is more coast to be explored on the stunning 98km long Curonian Peninsula, a dune covered spit that is so beautiful and unique it has merited UNESCO World Heritage Status. More UNESCO Heritage highlights await on the final day of the holiday, this time in Lithuania’s capital, Vilnius, with many different cultural influences over the centuries. A guided tour here will help unravel its history. <br/><br/>",
