      "title": "Ronda.",
      "description": "Leave Granada behind and travel by train and private transport to the Andalucian hills and the whitewashed town of Ronda. A landscape of green forests and white limestone mountains, Ronda is the birthplace of bullfighting in Spain and was a favourite of Hemmingway and Orson Welles. The highlight of the town is the Puente Nuevo (New Bridge) – one of the most photographed structures in the country. Built in 1751, it bridges the 100-m-deep gorge that splits the town in two. You can walk across it, stopping to peer over a drop from one of its balconies. Check out the old Moorish town on one side, home to many historic buildings including the House of the Moorish King, and the newer El Mercadillo on the other side. East of the town are well-preserved Arab Baths and, of course, the famous Plaza de Toros. Tonight, maybe watch the sunset over the city."

Maybe spend your evening San Jacinto, the bustling main street of the Triana quarter, and discover the interesting food on offer. As Seville is the tapas capital of Spain, be sure to sample some of the tasty bites in one of the city's many tapas bars."
