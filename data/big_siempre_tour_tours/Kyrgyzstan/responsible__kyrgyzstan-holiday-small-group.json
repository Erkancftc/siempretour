  "generalInfo": "With its alpine peaks, primal forests, pristine lakes and vast steppe, it’s no understatement to say that Kyrgyzstan is one of the most beautiful countries in the world, yet it remains refreshingly undiscovered. Spanning two weeks, this small group tour of Kyrgyzstan departing from the capital, Bishkek, aims to show you exactly what you’ve been missing.<br/><br/>You’ll cross dramatic mountain passes to reach the stunning Sary Chelek Nature Reserve, a UNESCO-protected biosphere where you’ll walk between two of its six turquoise lakes amid beautiful vistas. Head south, then, to Arslanbob. This famously picturesque Uzbek village near an ancient walnut forest that was a favourite of Alexander the Great, and is now the world’s largest source of walnuts. <br/><br/>From Arslanbob you’ll travel through the interior of Kyrgyzstan, over mountains to a spectacular lake, Son Kul, and a night spent in a yurt at a shepherds’ camp. An idyllic location, the lake is surrounded by fantastic hiking terrain which you can enjoy before moving on to Tash Rabat, an ancient Silk Road caravanserai, and then another yurt camp, this time by some refreshing hot springs.<br/><br/>Before returning to Bishkek, one of the most memorable days of the tour begins with a display of traditional eagle hunting, then a marvellous hike through the foothills of Tien Shan to Bokenbaevo. This Kyrgyzstan tour is packed with cultural immersion, exhilarating trekking and above all scenery that will make your rub your eyes in disbelief.<br/>",

      "description": "Bishkek - Chychkan Gorge: Leaving the capital today, it is not long before we get into the mountain scenery for which Kyrgyzstan is so rightly famed. Our route will take us over two mountain passes - the dramatic Tuu Ashuu (3586m) and the Ala Bel (3184m) which in Kyrgyz means “colourful pass”. As we travel through the Suusamyr Valley we will make several stops for some short acclimatisation walks and opportunities hopefully to meet some of the nomads who are often found here in the summer. We should be able to see their traditional yurts; observe mare milking and see how they control their huge flocks of sheep. This is a great introduction to the life of the nomadic shepherd. Upon arrival at Chychkan Gorge there should be time to explore some of the surrounding area. Driving distance 250km, 5 hours approx."

This is one of Kyrgyzstan’s least visited but most striking locations. Centred around a spectacular lake, which sits at an altitude of 1873m, Sary Chelek is almost alpine in appearance and provides some of the finest scenery in Central Asia.

      "description": "Arslanbob: Today we will have the whole day to explore on foot the surrounds of Arslanbob and to see its famous walnut forests, as well as some of the waterfalls and streams which dot the region. The walnut forests are believed to pre-date the 11th century and may even date back to the times of Alexander the Great. In fact legend has it that Alexander brought back large quantities of the nuts from Central Asia, but had to give them up once he reached Greece as payment to the boatmen who transported his troops. While this may just be the stuff of legend, what is certainly true is that Central Asian walnuts regularly formed part of the goods that were transported along the Silk Road, branches of which ran close to Arslanbob. Those preferring a less active day can take shorter walks and relax amidst the beautiful scenery of this small village.Approx. 4-5 hours walk, 10 km, altitude from 1600 to 1800 m.
