  "generalInfo": "The World Nomad Games, held every two years in Central Asia, is one of our most exciting and sought-after festival holidays. Spend three full days at the games among crowds of spectators as you watch thrilling events of wrestling, archery, horse racing, falconry and polo, with some amazing feats of skill involved. The opening ceremony is one of the don’t-miss highlights, as competitors on horseback, in traditional dress and bearing their national flags, enter the arena to ecstatic applause.<br/><br/>Your introduction to this spectacular event is our 2026 World Nomad Games tour, which is organised by true experts in cultural holidays of this type. Join a fully escorted small group (maximum size just 12 people) to stay around Lake Issyk-Kul,, from where you can easily head up into the nearby hills which are covered in yurts. You can wander the events, browse stalls selling food, handicrafts and clothing and watch music performances. You can also meet and get talking to nomadic peoples from around Asia: Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, Mongolia and more. <br/><br/>Tickets, accommodation and transportation in Kyrgyzstan are all arranged for you. There really is no better way to experience the World Nomad Games than with a knowledgeable organiser who can put the entire thing together, serve as support in case anything goes wrong and, through the use of local guides, also provide commentary and background information on what you’re witnessing.<br/><br/>Following the games, your group will travel further into Kyrgyzstan, via the ancient caravanserai of Tash Rabat, which lies on the Silk Road, and Song-Kol Lake. Staying in yurts run by nomadic herding communities is another great opportunity to learn about nomadic life but from an entirely different, more peaceful perspective. <br/>",

      "description": "SUNDAY 30TH AUGUST 2026 - ARRIVE IN BISHKEK Most international airlines arrive into Bishkek early in the morning. Upon landing, you will be transferred to your hotel to check in - early-check ins with breakfast are included. You have the morning to rest after your travel. At 12pm, you will meet your guide and embark on a walking tour of Bishkek. The capital of Kyrgyzstan, also known as the ‘White City’ – so called because many of the government buildings in Soviet times were built from the beautiful, locally mined white marble - is a fascinating city with vast plazas and dramatic monuments from the Soviet Era. Our local tour guide will give us a welcome introduction to both the city and the history of the country, followed by dinner in one of the most well-known tea houses in the city, complete with traditional live music and dancing."

      "description": "TUESDAY 1ST SEPTEMBER 2026 - WORLD NOMAD GAMES Day for World Nomad Games. Drive to the northern shore of Issyk-Kul, a saline lake 113miles long. In the Kyrgyz language, the name means ‘warm lake’, as, despite the ring of snow capped mountains surrounding it, it never freezes due to the salt content. Our homestay is near the shores of the glistening lake – so large that its turquoise waters often look like the Mediterranean. Heading into the hills we will discover the 'yurt city' which has sprung up for the games - hosting contestants and spectators alike from all across Central Asia and the world, as well as the stadium located in the northern shore of Lake Issyk-Kul. Day for World Nomad Games. Sports include: Horse racing Kok-Boru (polo) Wrestling Archery Falconry There will also be many music and cultural exhibitions on display."

      "description": "THURSDAY 3RD SEPTEMBER 2026 - TASHRABAT CARAVANSERAI We have some more distance to cover today (346km/6 hours) to head into the more remote parts of the country, so after breakfast, we drive south, down alongside the rising snow-capped Tian Shan Mountains. Our destination is the ancient Caravanserai of Tashrabat, which lies on the ancient Silk Road, only two days travel from the Chinese border. We break our journey in the remote village Acha-Kayindy to enjoy lunch and... a felt show. After a leg stretch and bite to eat at a local family's home, we continue on (3hrs) to reach Tashrabat in the afternoon. A 'caravanserai' is a roadside inn with, typically, a central courtyard for travellers in the desert regions of Asia. The Caravanserai of Tashrabat was just such a place: it's easy to imagine the traders and travellers of old stopping in this place to rest when journeying between the countries of Central Asia. The thick stone walls of the buildings of Tashrabat still stand and endure the elements, almost lost in the vast open plains surrounding them. Believed to have been used by traders since the 1400s, it is likely that there was a Christian monastery here as early as the 900s. We will stay in the yurt camp and explore the Caravanserai itself, imagining how traders throughout history would have holed up to protect themselves from bandits or bad weather on this lucrative but perilous trade route. Tonight we are treated to a fantastic dinner prepared by the lodge. Yurts sleep 2 - 4 people: single accommodation is not available. Shower and toilet facilities will be shared. Electricity and mobile connection is not available - do not expect wifi either!"

      "description": "FRIDAY 4TH SEPTEMBER 2026 - OPTIONAL: CHATYR KOL LAKE A mix of riding (additional cost for optional activity) and walking is the ideal way for us to travel up the winding valley trails to the top of a high pass (4000m), where, weather permitting, we will have an incredible view of Chatyr-Kol (Lake). It is a there & back route, and we have all day to enjoy it, so there is no rush - we will be travelling at a leisurely pace with plenty of time for photo stops. We suggest riding the flatter sections to and from the base of the climb (14km total), and then hiking (8km with 950m ascent). Riding will be suitable for beginner riders also. If you would rather, you can just stay and explore the foothills around the Caravanserai, but the views are absolutely worth it if you are even a teeny bit tempted! We stay at the Caravanserai yurt camp for a second night tonight."

      "description": "SATURDAY 5TH SEPTEMBER 2026 - SON KOL LAKE We will take the winding road up into the very centre of Kyrgyzstan’s hidden plateau (249km), to the majestic Song-Kol (“last lake” in Kyrgyz), in the Naryn Province, up at 3016m. It is probably - at the very least, arguably - the most picturesque lake in the country. It is a popular ground for nomadic shepherds who bring their flocks here in the summer months. Wildlife is diverse and the experience of nature, pristine. We will stay in a beautiful traditional nomad yurt camp on the southern shore, with the family who run it, play with the innumerable children, and sample the delicious local cuisine. Yurts sleep 2 - 4 people: single accommodation is not available. Shower and toilet facilities will be shared. No mobile signal. Electricity is from 18:00 until 22:00."

Choose to hike, horse ride (for a small fee), grab a book or do nothing apart from breathe in the clean air and revel in the wilderness! It really is an amazing place just to spend time. Lucky visitors may see deer, foxes, marmots, Marco Polo sheep, birds of prey, or even leopards and wolves on the plains. Rest under a never-ending sky, viewing incredible sunrises and sunsets, not to mention impeccable views of the Milky Way in clear skies. Take the golden opportunity to spend time with the local people in ours and other yurt camps dotted along the shores. We stay a second night in Son-Kol yurt camp."

We pause for lunch at the house of a family in Kochkor before continuing onto the capital. Some will miss the simplicity of the Yurt life... others will look forward to returning to some home comforts... The journey starts where it began, and we enjoy a group meal together in the city, celebrating a memorable journey together."
