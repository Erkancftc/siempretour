  "generalInfo": "Join this small group holiday in Sierra Leone and you’ll get to explore the country’s little-visited forts, wildlife areas and beaches with few other foreign visitors in sight. The country is once again welcoming intrepid travellers to experience its beautiful landscapes and vibrant cultural traditions.<br/><br/>After time spent getting to know the lively capital Freetown, you’ll head to Bunce Island for a sobering visit to the country’s former slave fort. Then you’ll visit the Tacugama Chimpanzee Sanctuary, a lush slice of forest near Freetown that’s dedicated to rescuing and rehabilitating endangered primates. <br/><br/>A few days on a tiny but beautiful tropical island comes next. The Banana Islands sit just off the Freetown Peninsula and are home to clear waters, sandy beaches, friendly fishing villages, and a few old colonial relics. Your final stop is the Tiwai Island Wildlife Sanctuary, a unique rainforest island home to diverse plant, animal and bird life, where you can camp under the trees and awaken to the calls of monkeys and hornbills in the surrounding trees.",

      "description": "Bunce Island – Tasso Island - Freetown - This morning we head to Bunce Island. The island was established as a major slave trading fortress and castle in 1670 and is located approximately 20 miles upriver in the Freetown Harbour on the Sierra Leone River. Bunce Island is a powerful experience for anyone interested in the history of the country and the slave trade. We then visit Tasso Island before heading back to Freetown. In Freetown, we take a short tour of the peninsula beaches, arguably the best in the sub-region. Stop at Lakka, Hamilton and River Number 2, before an early dinner at one of the beaches. You will then be transferred to your hotel. Overnight at Country Lodge Hotel, Cole Street Guesthouse or similar. (B)"
