  "generalInfo": "This Galapagos Islands vacation is flexible and fits your schedule and budget.  Depart any day you want year round, and choose a four-eight-day itinerary option. It’s perfect for couples, families and small groups! You travel from island to island by speed boat and stay in idyllic beach or waterfront hotels on two islands.  You see all the classic Galapagos wildlife and enjoy a variety of activities including snorkeling, walking and hiking. Trips are led by Galapagos National Park Service certified guides as well as a local tour leader.  <br/><br/>You may not like the idea of being wedded to a cruise boat for a week and this is an excellent alternative.  Fact is that for years the only way to explore the Galapagos Islands was by traveling on a yacht or cruise ship that carried from ten to a hundred people. Today you have a choice and on this trip we connect the islands with speed boats that travel much faster than the larger yachts and cruise ships. Our “Flexible Galapagos” trip is the most seamless of these adventures.   We have been operating tours in the Galapagos since 2005 and are very pleased to bring you this exclusive and alternative Galapagos tour.<br/><br/>Highlights of this Galapagos Islands vacation include learning in-depth about the Galapagos ecosystems as you walk and explore the islands; a hike to the still-active Sierra Negra volcano on the island of Isabela and; amazing wildlife interactions. You watch blue-footed boobies fly and dive; see marine iguanas slumber along or jump into the water and; observe brown pelicans fishing and being challenged by frigate birds for their food. You also swim and play with frolicking young sea lions. At the end of each activity-filled day, gaze upon spectacular sunsets and soak in the magical web of life that is the Galapagos.<br/><br/>There are four small towns on the Galapagos and about 20,000 people living in the islands. On this land-based tour you fully explore this dimension of the Galapagos ecosystem. You stay in small hotels run by local people, dine in local restaurants, travel by various forms of local transport and in the end gain a much fuller understanding and appreciation for life and evolution in the islands.  This tour represents the best in sustainable tourism to the Galapagos because of the many and varied local services it supports.  While a very small percentage of the fees paid for traditional cruise programs stay in the islands, this land-based Galapagos Islands tour leaves a significant economic impact.  There is also a much smaller contribution to the planet’s carbon emissions as little time is spent traveling by boat and much more time is spent walking and exploring under your own power.",

Wander alongside these immense creatures as they munch on their greens while learning about their unique lifestyle. We will then visit a lava tunnel to discover the powerful volcanic forces that have shaped the archipelago. In the mid-afternoon, we’ll check into our lodgings in Puerto Ayora, the busiest settlement in the Galapagos Islands.

      "description": "Santa Cruz + Isabela Today begins with a visit to the white sands of Tortuga Bay where you can spot lava lizards, marine iguanas, and blue-footed boobies. You can relax on the mangrove- fringed beaches, wander through the cacti forest, or enjoy a swim alongside the friendly baby sharks. There is also the opportunity to go boogie boarding or surfing but please advise your guide in advance if you’re interested in these activities. We’ll spend as long as you like at Tortuga Bay before returning to Puerto Ayora to visit the Charles Darwin Research Station. It offers a fascinating insight into the conservation work being done on the islands, as well as being home to giant tortoises at all stages of growth. Aside from seeing unhatched eggs and centenarian adults, you can observe playful babies in action. After lunch, we’ll jump on a boat to the largest island in the Galapagos, Isabela, and begin our exploration with a stroll through Puerto Villamil. In the evening, we’ll watch as the sun sets over the Pacific Ocean from a nearby beach before returning to town for dinner. Accommodations: Hotel Albermarle or Casa de Marita. Meals Included: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner."

      "description": "Isabela - After breakfast, we’ll embark on a hike up one of the Galapagos’ most active volcanoes, Sierra Negra. Marvel at its surreal landscapes while keeping an eye out for vermillion flycatchers and rare short-eared owls. After reaching the caldera, we’ll hike around the rim and continue through the lunar-like landscapes that lead to Volcan Chico. From here, there are panoramic views across the north of Isabela Island. In the early afternoon, we will return to Puerto Villamil where you’ll have a choice of activities at your disposal. You can go kayaking to spot sea lions, Galapagos penguins, and frigate birds on the surrounding shores or rent a bike to visit the historic Wall of Tears built by Isabela’s former inmates. Dinner is at a restaurant of your choice in Puerto Villamil, with your guide always available for recommendations. Accommodations: Hotel Albermarle or Casa de Marita. Meals Included: Breakfast, lunch."

      "description": "Isabela + San Cristobal - We’ll begin the day with an easy walk to spot pink flamingos feeding in the shallow waters of a mangrove-fringed lagoon. Our path leads to Isabela’s Giant Tortoise Breeding Center, which plays an important role in bringing the island’s reptiles back from the brink of extinction. It’s another wonderful opportunity to see Galapagos giant tortoises at various stages of growth and learn what it takes to return them to the wild. In the afternoon, we’ll board a flight to San Cristobal, the easternmost of the Galapagos Islands. Our first destination is La Loberia, which is famed for its sea lions who frolic in and out of the surrounding waters. If you desire, you can hop in to swim alongside them. Dinner is at a restaurant of your choice in Puerto Baquerizo Moreno. Accommodations: Hotel Casa Blanca. Meals Included: Breakfast, lunch."

      "description": "San Cristobal - Your final full day in the Galapagos Islands begins with a visit to Kicker Rock, which is also known as “Leon Dormido” after its resemblance to a sleeping lion. You’ll have the opportunity to snorkel in a narrow channel formed by two volcanic rocks where sea turtles, spotted eagle rays and a variety of tropical fish congregate. Galapagos and hammerhead sharks are also occasionally spotted here while the islands’ rocky terrain provides a nesting site for blue-footed boobies and frigate birds. Our boat will continue to a white sandy beach where we’ll relax over lunch before another optional snorkeling session. We’ll return to town by late afternoon, just in time for a sunset cocktail or a short bike exploration before our farewell dinner at an alfresco restaurant. Accommodations: Hotel Casa Blanca. Meals Included: Breakfast, lunch."
