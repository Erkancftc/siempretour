      "description": "This morning, we take a guided tour of the Old Town. Quito is the second-highest capital in the world, standing at 9,350ft (2,850m) on the western cordillera of the Andes. It is one of the smaller and more attractive of the colonial capitals in South America. Due to the altitude, you are advised to take it easy at first and drink plenty of water. After, you may wish to join an optional excursion to the equator, which is just 40 minutes’ drive north of Quito. Here, you visit the fun – and interactive – Intiñan Equator Museum, which explores indigenous culture and traditions, as well as unique phenomena related to the geographic location. Your tour leader ensures a big Ecuadorian welcome by arranging a group dinner tonight.

      "description": "Rise early (leaving the hotel around 5am with a box breakfast) as we transfer to Quito Airport for our flight to San Cristóbal in the Galapagos via Guayaquil. Your Galapagos tour leader (an official naturalist guide) takes you from the airport to the hotel for check-in and our first briefing about our time in the archipelago. We have time to explore the town and enjoy a restaurant lunch, before picking up our snorkelling equipment and, if you’d like, renting wetsuits. After this, we visit to La Lobería, a wonderful beach surrounded by mangroves, volcanic rocks and sea lion colonies. It’s a perfect spot to snorkel, relax on the sands, or have a short walk along the shore. Accommodation: Hotel Paraiso Insular (or similar)"

      "description": "Travel (40 minutes) by small motorboat to León Dormido (also known as Kicker Rock), an impressive lava tuff formation. Several species of nesting seabirds reside here, including masked boobies. We can snorkel and, with any luck, spot eagle rays, Galapagos turtles, hammerhead sharks and a great variety of fish. Continue by boat, enjoying lunch en route, to one of three white-sand beaches for a walk: Playa Ochoa, Playa Manglecito or Cerro Brujo. Playa Ochoa is an expanse of white sand dominated by a large sea lion colony and is home to many birds and marine iguanas. Playa Manglecito offers both the opportunity to visit a white-sand beach and a mangrove area. Cerro Brujo is in a volcanic zone, has abundant vegetation and is home to sea lions, marine iguanas and many birds. Accommodation: Hotel Paraiso Insular (or similar)"

A one-hour walk brings us to the fringe of El Junco Lake, one of the few permanent freshwater lakes in the Galapagos, where frigatebirds often bathe nearby. The highlands offer panoramic views across the smaller islands lapped by the Pacific. After, we visit a reserve where Galapagos giant tortoises roam free. After lunch at a local restaurant, we can visit La Loberia, a sea lion nursery, the perfect place to unwind and snorkel, surrounded by sea lions and marine iguanas.

      "description": "A three-hour navigation by motorboat takes us to Floreana, one of the first islands to be inhabited in the Galapagos, yet still relatively untouched by development – don’t expect to see many restaurants or shops! En route, we may see whales, dolphins and sea birds. After lunch at one of the few local restaurants, we visit the highlands and see lava caves once used by pirates and a large enclosure of Galapagos giant tortoises. Accommodation: Lava Lodge (or similar)"

      "description": "After an early breakfast, we go on a walk to discover the black volcanic beaches, which are home to red iguanas and sea lion colonies. There is also time to snorkel this morning (please note, the visit to this beach might be done in the late afternoon on Day 6 on some departures). Just before midday, we navigate to Isabela. This afternoon, we walk (2.5mi/4km) to the Wall of Tears, a reminder of Isabela’s very different past when the island was used as a penal colony. Between 1946 and 1959, convicts were forced to build this wall from huge lava blocks simply as a form of punishment, which, combined with the harsh conditions, led to many deaths. After this sobering visit, we hike back to the town through mangroves, wetlands and along sandy beaches. This is one of the best places on the islands to view migratory birds, including Wilson’s phalaropes, blue-winged teals and, if we’re very lucky, ospreys. This region has also seen the reintroduction of Galapagos giant tortoises and we are likely to encounter several on our walk. Accommodation: San Vicente Hotel (or similar)"

      "description": "It’s our toughest hiking day, but one that’s worth the effort as we tackle trails on the active shield volcano of Sierra Negra. Our five to six-hour adventure takes us across stark, lava-strewn highlands punctuated by miconia shrubs and other vegetation. The otherworldly landscapes are incredible, and we pass many volcanic features along the way, where we can observe fumaroles and a variety of lava formations. To keep us fuelled, we’re provided with a box lunch. Accommodation: San Vicente Hotel (or similar)"

We start with a 30-minute walk around the tunnels formed here by volcanic activity, before getting into the water, where we have a chance to swim with sea turtles, manta rays, marine iguanas and even penguins.

A 40-minute walk takes us around the islet and back to the boat again, before we jump into the water for a snorkel! The afternoon is free for swimming, snorkelling, walking or just relaxing on one of the beaches around Puerto Villamil. Accommodation: San Vicente Hotel (or similar)"

      "description": "Following breakfast at our hotel, we navigate by motorboat (2hr 30min) to Santa Cruz. Arriving, we have the option of visiting the Charles Darwin Research Station, which is home to the headquarters of the Charles Darwin Foundation. This is the main research hub on the islands and scientists come from around the world to study the flora and fauna here. After our visit, we have lunch at a local restaurant. Our destination this afternoon is Tortuga Bay, a long stretch of white sand. The trail leading to the beach is paved and takes between 45 minutes and one hour, with the chance to see Galapagos finches and lizards. The beach itself is scattered with marine iguanas, who lay among the clusters of black rocks or stroll along the sand. In the water, turtles can sometimes be seen. Swimming is not recommended here due to strong currents. After a relaxing afternoon, we hike the same route back towards the main town of Puerto Ayora where our hotel is located.

      "description": "Visit either Bartolomé Island, South Plaza Island or North Seymour (depending on national park restrictions). South Plaza has a remarkable vegetation of succulents and cacti that provide a unique habitat for land iguanas. The iguanas form small colonies at the base of the tall opuntia cacti, waiting for their flowers and dead pads to fall to the ground so they can feed. The island rocks are home to swallowtail gulls, shearwaters and sea lions. North Seymour is a flat, boulder-strewn island and a major nesting site for frigatebirds. It’s also a good place to see blue-footed boobies performing courtship rituals and sea lions playing in the powerful surf. Bartolomé is a spectacular scene of dramatic lava cones, clear seas and affords perhaps the most famous view of the Galapagos Islands, looking across the red cinder cones to the recent black lava fields on James Island. If possible, we snorkel today where the water is calm, and enjoy lunch on the boat.
