The whole family can enjoy watching an all-star cast of birds, reptiles and mammals in their natural environment as they feed, doze and play around the mountains and coastline of Isla San Cristobal and Isla Santa Cruz. <br/><br/>There are too many incredible creatures to mention, but highlights include majestic giant tortoises, Galapagos crabs, marine iguanas, frigate birds, whales, dolphins and sharks. You could also choose to get up close and personal under the water by snorkelling with playful sea lions. <br/><br/>On this trip you’ll be joined by likeminded families from across the world. An experienced guide will lead your trip and help both the adults and the kids make the most of the experience. No physical preparation is necessary and all activities will be within reach of each member of the family. <br/>",
