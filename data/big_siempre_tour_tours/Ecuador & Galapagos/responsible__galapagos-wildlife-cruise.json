  "generalInfo": "Going on a cruise is a great way to explore the 19 islands of the Galápagos and the surrounding marine reserve. Our Galapagos cruises offer you a decent room and a great view on all the islands. The cruises will bring you to all the highlights of the most popular islands and they will send a professional guide with you. The advantage of going on a cruise is that you are able to visit remote and unreachable places like the western northern uninhabited islands, the western part of Isabela or islands like Rabida and Egas Port. Those are the most biodiverse regions of the Galapagos, where you can possibly see Killer whales, Galapagos Penguins, Hammerhead sharks and four different sea lion species in one place. When you go home, you will know everything about the evolution, the volcanoes and about all the animals. You will visit all the beautiful cliffs, beaches and volcanoes. You will meat the giant tortoises and other animals and sea creatures on these islands, which inspired Charles Darwin to his evolution theory.<br/><br/>By going on a cruise, you will visit two spots a day, you will get 3 meals a day and, depending on the service, also drinks.<br/>There are about 50 independent cruise boats on the Galápagos, so there is a boat available for each budget and there are different service levels. We can offer you different types of cruises.<br/><br/>There are four types of classes; Tourist, Tourist Superior, Luxe and First class.  If you are interested in one specific boat please contact us!<br/><br/>The main differences between the boat classes are the guides (on Luxe and First class boats usually guides with a degree in biology or geography), the common spaces on board (on Luxe and First class boats sometimes have living room, sun deck, tv room or jacuzzi), on Tourist and Tourist Superior class boats there are mainly cabins with bunkbeds available and on Luxe and First class boats the cabins are bigger and there is space for a queen or sometimes even king size bed. At some First class boats the cabins even have a private balcony available. All boats we offer do have their private bathroom per room (2 people) but the quality and duration of hot water and the size and facilities of the bathroom depend strongly on the class.",
