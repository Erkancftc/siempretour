      "description": "Depart Quito at 7am for a 3-hour journey north west of Quito down the outer slopes of the Andes through beautiful cloud forest to the shores of the river. The Río Toachi is a fantastic introduction to the rivers of Ecuador. Flowing off the coastal side of the Andes it has some of the longest navigable sections of white-water in the country. Combine this with the sights and sounds of the forest environment we pass through and you are guaranteed a day to remember. Before setting off on our rafting experience you will be fitted with life jackets and helmets, given a comprehensive safety briefing and be trained in the paddling techniques needed to navigate your way down the river. The rafting activity takes around 3 hours. During the trip we’ll stop by the side of the river for a delicious picnic lunch. At the end of the day you will be dropped off in the local town of Mindo. Overnight in El Monte Lodge, Mindo with 3 meals included."

      "description": "This morning you depart Quito at 7am and head towards the Antisana Ecological Reserve. The stunning snow-capped Antisana Volcano is Ecuador’s fourth highest and is one of the best places in Ecuador for spotting the endangered Andean Condor. The mountain biking activity begins at La Mica Lake (4000m) located within the ecological reserve. Our route of around 30km brings us through the beautiful Andean paramos of this region. The first 7km of the ride are mainly flat before a 2km climb up to the mountain pass. From here we can enjoy a fantastic downhill ride through the changing Andean landscapes before arriving at the entrance to the park, where the ride ends. Box lunch is served en-route and there is a back up vehicle with the group at all times. In the afternoon return to Quito and the hotel (B,L)"
