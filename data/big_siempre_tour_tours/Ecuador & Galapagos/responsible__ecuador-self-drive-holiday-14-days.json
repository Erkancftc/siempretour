You are provided with a car, usually a Suzuki Grand Vitara SZ or similar, and, as Ecuador travel experts, we offer you a list of “hidden treasures”, including restaurants, animal rescue centres and local artisans. But ultimately, where and how often you stop, as well as where you eat, is all up to you.<br/><br/>The route proposed takes in many of Ecuador’s highlights, from cities and cultural experiences to magnificent landscapes and wildlife. From the capital city Quito to the colourful houses in the port city of Guayaquil, you’ll enjoy the many views from the beautiful haciendas and eco-lodges you stay in along the way. Or, if you prefer a different route or alternative arrangements, we can customise a travel plan to suit you.",
