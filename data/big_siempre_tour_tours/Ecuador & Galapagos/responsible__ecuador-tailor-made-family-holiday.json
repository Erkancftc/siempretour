  "generalInfo": "This two-week itinerary has been carefully crafted to create the perfect, tailor-made holiday itinerary for families and mixed generational groups. It captures some of the most exciting aspects of Ecuador’s cloud forest, Andean landscapes and people, and, of course, the Galapagos Islands. Ecuador is a haven for adventure, wildlife watching and cultural wonders. It is also a very small country, making holidays very accessible for families who don’t want too much time on the road. Within a few days you can travel from the UNESCO World heritage capital Quito, meet people from fascinating indigenous communities, haggle at a market,  and walk and swim in the cloud forest.<br/><br/>And then there is the whole other world of the Galapagos Islands, in the water and on land. Swim with sea lions or sea turtles and get up close to iguanas and giant tortoises - just part of the extraordinary wildlife and fun, from dawn until dusk. Water features heavily on the mainland, too - in Ecuador’s mountain rivers and waterfalls. The itinerary is tailor made and so we can adapt it to suit your family’s needs and interests, whether they want more adrenalin filled adventure, or tranquil wildlife watching. Ecuador and the Galapagos holidays really do offer it all, and even though there is so much to do in two weeks, you will never feel rushed. This is family time after all.<br/>",

      "description": "Quito tour, afternoon Teleferiqo (B) Your journey begins with a visit to the capital of Ecuador. It is located at 2,850 metres above sea level, at the slopes of the Pichincha volcano and nestled in a green Andean valley. Quito, one of the oldest cities in South America, is also one of the few cities that has preserved numerous monuments and artistic treasures of the Spanish colonial period.The colonial centre of the city was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1978. We begin the tour with a walk through the narrow streets to visit some of America's oldest and most beautiful churches such as El Sagrario and La Compañia and the famous plazas of Santo Domingo, La Merced and San Francisco. Today you explore the beautiful historical centre of Quito with its wonderful squares and picturesque churches. We have lunch at a local restaurant and in the afternoon will take the teleferico up to a viewpoint on the slopes of Pichincha volcano. The views from up here are wonderful and the kids will enjoy the adventure. There is even a small amusement park at its base. Return to our hotel"

The species were brought here to conduct a captive breeding program with the aim of repopulating areas that have been adversely affected in the past. Drop off at your hotel, evening free to explore the town and eat in one of the local restaurants. NOTE: We can tailor make a Galapagos Islands itinerary if you wish for different activities/islands)."
