  "generalInfo": "Ecuador has an embarrassment of riches when it comes to natural wonders and indigenous cultures and this itinerary will showcase the very best of each. Explore the three main habitats on mainland Ecuador: the cloud forest, high Andes and of course the Amazon jungle, where you will also spend time with Amazonian communities that have chosen tourism over the money they could make selling their land to oil companies. This is the very best of one of Latin America's true gems.",
