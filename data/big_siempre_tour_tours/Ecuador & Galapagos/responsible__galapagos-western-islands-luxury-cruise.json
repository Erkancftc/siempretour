      "description": "(Isabela Island - Urbina Bay & Tagus Cove) AM: Urbina Bay, Isabela Island. Urbina Bay is located at the base of Alcedo Volcano on Isabela’s west coast. This area experienced a significant geological uplift in 1954, which stranded marine life. The site offers excellent snorkeling opportunities and features a 3,200-meter trail composed of sand, pumice, lava, coral, and coastal vegetation. During your visit, look for iguana burrows, and while snorkeling, you may swim alongside penguins and observe red and blue lobsters. Here, you might also see Darwin’s finches and land iguanas, which are notably larger than those found on South Plaza Island. Giant Tortoises also roam the area. The vegetation includes chamomile, Rosewood, and Darwin’s cotton flowers, all endemic to the Galapagos. PM: Tagus Cove, Isabela Island. Tagus Cove, located west of Darwin Volcano, was a favored spot for pirates and whalers; it is possible to observe pirate graffiti from the 1800s in a cave. The area is known for its volcanic rocks, including “lapilli” (small spherical rocks). The trail, which presents a small challenge, leads to a lookout point above Darwin Lake and the bay below. Along the trail, you can spot finches and mockingbirds. This is also a very good site for snorkeling and sea kayaking, and a colony of flightless cormorants resides here.

      "description": "(Santiago Island - Espumilla Beach & Puerto Egas) AM: Espumilla Beach and Bucaneer Cove, Santiago Island. Espumilla Beach is located on Santiago Island’s northern coast, within James Bay. This site features a very picturesque coastline, displaying erosion and unique formations sculpted by the action of the sea. Explore the palo santo forest and mangroves, and observe nesting baby sea turtles in the sand dunes, as well as a Flamingo colony in the coastal lagoon. The vegetation here varies within short distances, from dry to humid, showcasing the damage caused by introduced species like feral goats, which have since been eradicated. Key wildlife includes sea lions and fur seals, marine turtles, marine iguanas, oystercatchers, herons (great blue heron), and various other sea birds. You can also spot land birds such as the Galapagos dove, Darwin’s finches, and hawks. Snorkeling is possible from the soft beach, whose name \"Espumilla\" (foam) comes from a typical Ecuadorian Andes dessert. Marine life here includes playful sea lions, white-tipped reef sharks, sea turtles, manta rays, and numerous reef fish. PM: Puerto Egas, Santiago Island. Puerto Egas features a black beach composed of volcanic tuff deposits, creating a vibrant contrast between the dark minerals and the red sally-lightfoot crabs scattered across the rocks. This site was historically used for salt extraction but operations ceased due to low prices on the continent, with remnants of the abandoned infrastructure still visible. The trail passes a sea lion colony and leads to a playful grotto where fur seals (smaller than sea lions) swim and play in the tidal pools. Snorkeling here allows encounters with marine iguanas, playful sea lions, and other diverse marine life. Meals: Breakfast / Lunch / Dinner"

      "description": "(Rabida Island & Chinese Hat) Rábida Island is distinctive for its red rocks and sand. The volcanic material here is porous and changes color due to oxidation. A short trail leads to a lagoon where you can observe land birds and a colony of flamingos. It is interesting to watch pelicans diving for fish. The red beach contrasts beautifully with the surrounding green vegetation. Snorkeling here is considered among the best, as you swim along the coastline and playful sea lions often join you. You may spot moray eels, small sharks, starfish, and many colorful fish. PM: Chinese Hat Chinese Hat is a small islet situated off Santiago Island’s southeastern tip. This recent volcanic cone strikingly resembles a Chinese hat. Exploration includes walking through lava formations and observing sea lion colonies, lava lizards, marine iguanas, and Galapagos penguins. This island is characterized by colorful contrasts, with red vessuvium flowers, sally lightfoot crabs, and the orange beaks of American oystercatchers providing a beautiful visual contrast against the pahoehoe lava fields and lava cacti. It is also an excellent spot for deep water snorkeling; the channel formed between Sombrero Chino and Santiago Island creates a protected area with calm turquoise waters, yet deep enough to attract white-tipped reef sharks that rest in small caves below. You can also observe stingrays, parrotfish, Galapagos penguins, marine turtles, and with luck, dolphins and the rare visit of whale sharks. Meals: Breakfast / Lunch / Dinner"
