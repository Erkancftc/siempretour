    "generalInfo": "You will be in Lowland Amazon rainforest for almost half of this trip, in an area of south eastern Ecuador, close to the border with Peru. There are no roads into the area,  so we will take a private charter flight over a vast horizon of unbroken Amazon forest, landing in indigenous owned lands where oil companies have never been permitted to drill. Here we will switch into a rhythm of life dictated by the Achuar people who live here - learning about their culture, whilst exploring the flora and fauna on foot &amp; over water.<br/><br/>Of Amazon wildlife we can hope to see, monkeys are some of the most visible, ranging from the world's noisiest, the Red Howler Monkey, to the very smallest: the Pygmy Marmoset. Elusive jaguars, puma, tapir, giant river otters, peccary, capybara, agoutis, tamanduas, and more all exist here too; as do Pink River Dolphins, spectacled &amp; black caiman. More than 530 species of bird have been recorded here.<br/><br/>We incorporate an optional overnight Amazon camping adventure and wilderness kayaking in search of wildlife.<br/><br/>Cloud Forest of the Tropical Andes<br/><br/>Several parts of the world are sometimes referred to as the most diverse; but for the record, the Tropical Andes is the most diverse area of our planet. On this trip, we will explore the Western Pacific-facing cloud forest in greatest detail. We will be in an area of incredibly dramatic scenery called the Choco-Andean Rainforest Corridor - an ever-growing conservation area which one of our partner charities, Rainforest Concern, has been one of the most active in creating. The forest is filled with hummingbirds and other avian species. We will make a special effort to see South America's answer to the Bird of Paradise: the Andean Cock-of-the-Rock; sitting in wait at leks where the bright red-orange males perform elaborate mating displays<br/><br/>Choco-Andean Rainforest Concern Conservation Corridor Ecuador<br/><br/>Of mammals, we might be lucky enough to see evidence of Spectacled Bears, Tayra and the world's most recently discovered mammal: the Olinguito.<br/><br/>Cloud forest gives rise to an explosion of flora, including orchids, moss-laden trees and carboniferous tree ferns. Walking along the edges of the Andes, we will find the forest canopy above and beneath us; and spread spectacularly across mountains and deep valleys to the horizon. The volume of life encapsulated within a single view is breath-taking.<br/><br/>Avenue of Volcanoes<br/><br/>Between Quito, the Amazon and Choco-Andean cloud forest, we will travel through and stay in the alto plano (high plains), dwarfed by the highest volcanic peaks in the world. How many peaks we see will depend upon cloud cover, but here are some of the volcanoes we will pass will be:<br/><br/>Cotopaxi Volcano - Ecuador's second highest mountain reaching 5,897m<br/><br/>Chimborazo - now dormant, is Ecuador's highest peak at 6,263m<br/><br/>Antisana Volcano<br/><br/>Tungurahua Volcano",

If cloud cover is favourable, we can hope to see Cotopaxi, Chimborazo and Tungurahua. If we do, we will certainly stop to admire. From the alto plano we will descend the eastern slopes of the Andes and stop at a traditional farm for some local foods and to take a look at ancient weaving still taking place in the area. From this, the Salasaca area, we will drive to the a place on Amazon tributary, the Rio Pastaza, where the smaller Rio Verde joins it at a dramatic waterfall. From here we will continue past Puyo, on the edge of the Amazon Basin. We will stay in a small hotel with lovely gardens and some great local food knocked up by our host Sofia."

Please Note: in going to such as remote part of the Amazon, we are at the mercy of the elements. If there is excessive rain then we will have to delay until the skies are sufficiently clear ro fly. We might be delayed both in flying to the Amazon and in getting back - by as much as 24 hours. We will have to adapt if this is the case. Once we do take off, we will fly 160 km and 50 minutes Amazon as pristine as it should be. The wide meandering Rio Pastaza will be seen beneath us, with tributaries of all sizes feeding black waters into those delivered laden with material carried down from the Andes. Once we land, we will meet with our Achuar hosts, boarding a motor canoe which will carry us 20 minutes to our lodge. We will settle in and take lunch, after which we will head out on a walk which will first describe the local ecology; and then quieten down as we seek out wildlife. Cicadas and Screaming Piha birds will become familiar daytime sounds. When Red Howler Monkeys begin to sing, we will know that darkness isn't far away - something which descends quickly on the Equator. After dinner, we will get to know our Achuar hosts - a chance to share thoughts about your visit, the Amazon and wider world."

        "description": "Achuar culture and beliefs are based around dreams and visions. The Achuar begin each day early, 3 - 4am, drinking wayus tea. Wayus is from a native plant, Ilex guayusa, which is part of the Holly genus - high in caffeine with positive antioxidant properties. The Achuar drink wayus early in the morning, whilst sharing their dreams - something you can join them for this morning. As daylight begins to appear, we will head out onto the Rio Pastaza, in search of macaws, parrots and other birds which sometimes descend en masse onto a section of river bank to top up on minerals. Dawn is one of the most active times of the day for wildlife, so we will be sure to make use of opportunities first thing each day in the Amazon. We will have breakfast at around 8am, before heading out to an Achuar village to learn about local medicinal plants. There is plenty of insect noise during the middle of the day, but less potential for mammals. You are also likely to feel somewhat tired by this time, so lunch with a rest afterwards is likely to be welcome. You will be able to walk in the near vicinity and gaze at the river too - if you are lucky, perhaps making sight of pink river dolphins. Mid-afternoon, we will head out in search of wildlife again on the river. You can remain in a slow motor canoe, or propel yourself by kayak. After dinner, we will head out on a night walk in search of all things great and small. We will conduct further night walks, so if you are tired after an early start, you might prefer to explore by night on a later occasion."

Breakfast will be at 8am, after which we will take time to learn more about Achuar culture, beliefs and how they are dealing with challenges posed by the modern world. Achuar land rights are such that the Ecuadorian Government does not own rights it can sell to prospectors for oil and minerals. Thus far, the Achuar have refused access to oil and mining. They have had the opportunity to see some of the damage these activities have inflicted on areas to the north and south and prefer to develop through ecotourism and other means. The following plan can be adapted for you if you prefer not to camp overnight on a raised platform, deep in Amazon wilderness. After lunch, we will get into a motor canoe and head to our camping area, set up and take an early dinner. We will then head out in search of wildlife, returning just before dark."

We will only fly when it is safe to do so. After flying almost an hour over Amazon wilderness, we will head by road north up into the Andes, to an area of thermally heated springs at Papallacta. Here we will stay at a hotel and spa with views (subject to cloud cover) of the glacial peaks of Antisana Volcano. Here you can relax as you wish, at the highest altitude you will have reached so far, sleeping at 3,500 meters above sea level. There are nature trails close by and spa treatments are available.

From here, we will pack your bags onto mules whilst we walk about 2 hours uphill to a community owned lodge. We will go at a slow pace, watching for birdlife as we go. The temperature will reduce as we walk; the sound of insects will subside; and the types of plant around you will change. Your views will also become ever more impressive as you gaze over some of the best preserved cloud forests of western Ecuador. You will be able to settle into your room before lunch and a briefing about the area. This is one of the main locations that trip leader, Ralph, used to work for Rainforest Concern. Either side of lunch, it's worth gazing at the views and stopping to observe and photograph dozens of hummingbirds. In the afternoon we will go for a walk, soaking up views; looking for evidence of mammals such as Tayra and Spectacled Bears; and looking in detail at the huge variety of flora which surrounds us."

    "generalInfo": "Ecuador is well known as a wildlife destination, with habitats such as the Amazon, Cloud Forest and of course the Galapagos Islands there is something for every wildlife enthusiast in Ecuador. However one habitat that is often overlooked are the high altitude grasslands and forests of the Andes. This tour explores these ecosystems in search of a wealth of rare and elusive species.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of South American wildlife watching safari holidays, including various options for Ecuador. But unlike many Ecuadorean wildlife holidays this one doesn't focus on birdlife or the Galapagos (extensions for birding, Amazon or Galapagos are all available in request) but instead focuses on mammals and in particular mammals of the Andean mountains.<br/><br/>The major targets for this trip are two of South America's largest mammals, the enigmatic Andean (or spectacled) bear and the very rare mountain tapir. These inhabitants are often seen in the paramo (grasslands) at the higher altitudes of the Andes. In this relatively sparse ecosystem there is a huge amount of life and with good local guides, perseverance, specialist equipment (including thermal imaging scopes) we hope to find animals such as Andean fox, northern pudu, colocolo, Andean rabbits etc. <br/><br/>This trip also heads into the slightly lower down cloud forests which fringe the valleys around the paramo grasslands. Here we look for specialist species which inhabit only this narrow strip of habitat such as olinguito, Andean white-eared opossum, mountain coati as well as other species such as northern oncilla, kinkajou and tayra. <br/><br/>All in all we believe this is a unique tour, a trip that will delight anyone wishing to see some of the world's rarest and most elusive species of mammals. <br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Quito. There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Ecuador and particularly the Andean and cloud forest habitats. Your naturalist escort is an expert in mammals and their conservation and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. We also bring some specialist equipment such as high powered telescopes, thermal imaging scopes and sound equipment which all give us chances to see rare species.<br/><br/>The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, river safaris, spotlighting, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the park. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>We recommend the shoulder seasons of the cold winter (wet) season and the hotter drier (dry) season. So we recommend (and run group tours) in February and then again in November annually. <br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• Our local Ecuadorean guides have a good relationship with the park officials and local guides because of this we get a heads up when animals are sighted and this can guide us in where to focus and thus increasing our chances of seeing our targeted species.<br/>• We have special access to lodges and resorts where wildlife can be seen, we do not have to be staying at these lodges, our expert guides have good relationships with the management and so we can visit many places for different wildlife.<br/>• Visit the park morning and afternoon as well as having the chance to stay inside the park for nocturnal drives and spotlighting for nocturnal mammals.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our wildlife and mammal watching tours of Ecuador a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout South America so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the Andean bears, mountain tapirs, Northern pudus, Northern oncillas, Olinguitos and many more species. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Ecuador at other times of year and focusing on other species such as hummingbirds, Amazonian species and of course the Galapagos Islands and many species throughout this incredible country. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>The entrance and exit point of this trip is Quito and we do not necessarily travel very far from the capital as we head into the Andes and cloud forests. Our main areas are Bellavist and Caymabe-Coca National Park.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from a vehicle. There is some hiking, however in general the hiking is easy (unless you choose to hike longer trails in Bellavista - which is hilly) and usually around 200-300m away from the vehicle. So no physical fitness for hiking or anything like that is needed. This is a very easy trip to undertake.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 15 Years Old<br/><br/>Picture Credits:<br/>Alex Popovkin, Bahia, Brazil from Brazil, via Wikimedia Commons<br/>By Groumfy69 - Own work,",

We will collect everyone from the airport or hotels in Quito this morning and then drive the couple of hours or so to the western slope of the Andes and the wonderful little private reserve of Bellavista. After checking in we will hike around some of their trails, most of the species we will be looking for here are nocturnal or at least crepuscular but we will try and find red-tailed squirrels and maybe a western mountain coati foraging around. But once the sun begins to fall behind the trees and hills the mammals start to come out, we will then spend time at the banana feeding station. It is here that they regularly get visits from kinakajous, Andean white-eared opossums and of course the olinguito. It is around here that during the early mornings you can also sometimes see tayra and western mountain coati. Then after dinner we will hit the road for some spotlighting around the winding mountain roads surrounding the lodge. (Dinner only today)"

There are several bear territories along the highway and we will be looking for the tell-tale signs of bear activity. Our local guide is very knowledgeable about the bears and where they like to forage and with his help we will hopefully see a bear before even getting to our lodge today. After arriving in Pamballacta we will check in and then (depending on the time) drive in the afternoon up into the paramo and once again scanning for bears as well as mountain tapir. Also around here and possible are Andean rabbits, Andean fox, Andean white-tailed deer and northern pudu. Some are easier to see than others, but we will spend time looking for each species.

We'll spend a whole day snorkeling and exploring the stunning marine life around Kicker Rock, where sharks and rays swim, before continuing on to the island of Santa Cruz. And it's here, on the Santa Cruz Highlands, that you'll meet the famous Giant Galapagos Tortoises. <br/><br/>We then transfer to Isabela island, where we visit the colourful residents of the Flamingo Lagoon. Isabela is also the site of Los Tuneles, a sea sanctuary considered as one of the world's best spots for snorkeling. Lava flows have produced unique geological formations creating the ideal habitat for a wide variety of marine species. We'll also enjoy a kayak excursion of Puerto Villamil Bay.",

    "generalInfo": "This trip is a chance to see the Galapagos Islands and the culture and nature of mainland Ecuador. After the excitement of condors and volcanoes on mainland Ecuador there’s a chance to chill with iguanas, follow lumbering tortoises, and spot blue footed boobies in the unique Galapagos Islands. Unlike many Galapagos trips, which are on board boats, your tour will take place on land, mainly on Isla Isabela and Isla Santa Cruz, offering an unusual perspective of the islands. Your group will contain no more than 15 people, travelling by boat and bus, with a few optional hikes. <br/><br/>Start in Quito, Ecuador’s capital, with its UNESCO World Heritage centre, before heading into the lush high-altitude countryside of Cotopaxi National Park and on to Otavalo, a market town set among sacred mountains. In the large indigenous market at Otavalo, you’ll have a fantastic chance to engage with locals, and admire their beautiful handicrafts. Crossing the equator via the Quitsato Equator Monument, you’ll return to Quito and then head to the Galapagos Islands.<br/><br/>On the island of Santa Cruz in the Galapagos you may see giant tortoises. On Isabela you’ll have encounters with iguanas and volcanoes, and enjoy a spot of snorkelling. Depart for the smaller islands and you’ll see the famous birdlife: including beloved species like blue footed boobies and diminutive Galapagos penguins. At the end of the trip you’ll make a pilgrimage to the Charles Darwin Research Station – the research facility which started it all, where the wonders of the Galapagos Islands are preserved for future generations. <br/>",

        "description": ": Our tour starts today in Tumbaco, a quiet rural neighbourhood of Quito located around 20 minutes from the airport and 45 minutes from the downtown city centre. Ecuador's mountain capital is the second highest in Latin America at 2,850 metres. It lies in a narrow valley at the foot of the Pichincha volcano. Arriving in the city by air is quite spectacular as you approach over snow-capped mountains and extinct volcanoes - we highly recommend booking a window seat! Due to the number of evening flights into Quito, our tour leader plans to hold a welcome meeting on the morning of day two and will leave a message in reception with details on timings and everything else that you'll need for the day. There are no activities planned today, so you're free to arrive in Quito at any time. If you'd like an airport transfer today, you'll need to arrive into Quito's Mariscal Sucre International Airport (UIO), approximately a 20-minute drive from our hotel. If you miss the meeting, our tour leader will inform you of any essential information as soon as you catch up. Our hotel in Tumbaco is a tranquil property. If your flight arrives earlier in the day, we recommend resting here and acclimatising to the altitude before the trip begins. It's approximately a 45-minute drive into downtown Quito, and the hotel can help to organise taxi transport for you if you'd like to head out and explore the city."

This area is a real introduction into the Andean landscapes and culture that make Ecuador so special. On the outskirts, just before we reach the town, we'll visit Parque Condor, a rescue centre for injured condors, with the opportunity to witness these marvellous birds up close. After arriving to Otavalo and eating lunch at a local restaurant, we'll continue this afternoon to the village of Peguche, which is famed for its local families who make and play panpipes - a quintessentially Andean tradition. We'll learn how the panpipes are made and listen to the experts play."

We'll walk on a segment of the trail that goes around the lake (an easy walk of approximately 90 minutes) - along the way, we'll try to spot the King of the Andes - the wide-winged condors that soar high above the valleys in graceful flight. Returning towards Otavalo, we stop at a neighbouring indigenous community, diving deep into their day-to-day activities, customs and way of life. This sharing of rural life is what makes Otavalo come alive, and we'll get a taste of this over a home-cooked lunch - seasonal food will be on the menu, which could be a traditional locro de papa (potato and cheese soup), fritada (fried chunks of pork served with all types of corn), yucca or quinoa served with meat and vegetables. The afternoon is at your leisure. You might like to spend some time discovering the local market. The Otavalenos are a dignified and assured people, proudly displaying their cultural traditions and ancient heritage through their handmade leather goods, wood carvings and weavings. After exploring the market, the visual majesty of the setting and the colourful dress of the local communities make Otavalo a great place to sip a hot chocolate and watch the world pass by."

We'll also cross over the equator line and stop to commemorate this at the Quitsato Equator Monument. Continuing our journey, we drop several thousand feet on a beautiful drive to reach the village of Mindo. Much of this cloud forest area has been set aside as a nature reserve, playing home to over 400 species of bird, as well as some amazing flowers and plant life, beautiful waterfalls and pristine forest. In the afternoon we'll visit one of the region's chocolate producers. Ecuador is famous for its chocolate and here you'll learn about every stage of the process from bean to bar.

One of our first stops is at a hummingbird garden, catching some of the iridescent colours of the many hummingbird species that feed here. We'll then go deeper into the mountains towards the Mindo-Nambillo reserve, and take a 'tarabita' (cable car) up the mountainside, getting a birds-eye view of the forest. The ride ends at a trailhead, and there are several walking possibilities here. One 20-30 minute walk takes us to a series of waterfalls, culminating in one of the area's largest drops - the Nambillo Waterfall. The longest trail takes about one hour from the trailhead to La Reina waterfall. The paths are well-maintained, predominantly downhill towards the falls but with a steeper uphill on the return. Our tour leader will decide based on the weather conditions and how you're all feeling - along the way we'll see if we can spot butterflies, orchids, bromeliads and, of course, birds.

We'll have some time free this afternoon. You might like to visit one of the city's many museums or discover the Old Town at your own pace.

Our destination is Cotopaxi National Park - just a two-hour drive from Quito, and home to Ecuador's second-highest volcano. Cotopaxi is a classic volcanic cone, snow-covered and rising an imposing 5,897 metres from the valley floor. Hopes of seeing the cone in its full glory are always high, but to manage expectations, it's important to mention that the peak is often covered by a puff of cloud! We won't let this detract from our visit - while we come for the splendour of the volcano, we'll stay for the magnificent, bleak scenery of the paramo (the high-altitude Andean grasslands). We'll take time to walk around the Limpiopungo Lagoon, an easy 90-minute hike, taking us around a shallow glacial lake that's a haven for waterfowl, hummingbirds and unexpected migratory species such as the Andean Gull and the Andean Lapwing, as well as wild horses. We'll return to our first hotel in Tumbaco this evening."

        "description": ": The Galapagos are an isolated chain of volcanic islands supporting a distinct and unique flora and fauna, including prehistoric creatures found nowhere else on earth. Of the extraordinary animals to be found in the Galapagos many are reptiles, such as the giant tortoise, land iguana and three species of non-poisonous snake. There are also several species of turtle, which come ashore to mate. Up to three quarters of a million seabirds flock to the islands, including a third of the world's blue-footed boobies, frigate birds, pelicans, cormorants, albatross and petrels. Of all the animals in this unique landscape, perhaps the most out-of-place is the penguin. Only 35 centimetres tall, the Galapagos Penguin can be seen swimming among tropical mangroves. Offshore it is common to see dolphins, sea lions and fur seals playing in the water. The Galapagos National Park charges a visitor fee, payable on arrival, which funds park maintenance and supervision in the Galapagos, as well as ecological study, conservation and infrastructure development in Ecuador's other national parks. Entry fees and the funds they generate for the national park system are among measures taken by the Ecuadorian government to protect its natural heritage. Today we fly to the island of Santa Cruz, the second largest island in the Galapagos. It also boasts the most varied of the islands' vegetation zones. We visit 'Los Gemelos', two volcanic depressions that give us a deeper understanding of the formation of the islands, as well as passing through the evergreen highlands, where we will have the chance to see the iconic giant tortoises. In the afternoon we're at leisure to discover the island's main town, Puerto Ayora."

An idyllic paradise of white sand beaches and swaying palms, it's home to the second largest caldera on earth and the highest point in the archipelago. We'll base ourselves here, in the small town of Puerto Villamil on the southern coast. On arrival we'll visit the Arnaldo Tupiza breeding centre, where we'll discover the history of the famous Galapagos tortoise, including the centre's ambitious aim to restore their numbers and release them back onto the islands. We'll take the 1.5 kilometre/0.9 mile walk back to Puerto Villamil, via the Tunel del Estero (one of the island's lava tunnels), and two of the island's beaches, where we may see marine iguanas lounging about, sally lightfoot crabs on the rocky shoreline, or herons and lava gulls."

Today we start by taking a walk up the Sierra Negra Volcano, an immense 12-kilometre/7.5-mile-wide mass that dominates the southern half of the island. The walk up to the top is three hours, presenting us with some spectacular panoramic views of the Pacific, and across to the neighbouring islands. In the afternoon, we plan to snorkel at Concha y Perla and spot some of the many marine species that the Galapagos have to offer - sea lion, iguana, turtle, ray and a diverse array of reef species might be sighted, varying throughout the year depending on the tides, the weather and the season.

In the water, turtles, Galapagos penguins and sea lions may be spotted swimming around. The wildlife's complete acceptance of our presence is a testament to the incredible diversity and unique quality of the Galapagos Islands.

We may see sea lions playing in the water just off shore, land or marine iguanas strolling around, magnificent red-throated frigate birds, blue footed boobies, swallow-tail gulls or Galapagos penguins. After exploring on land, we will also do some snorkelling at one of the nearby sites. This boat trip may include people not travelling with Explore.

    "generalInfo": "This unique tour explores both the mainland of Ecuador (the cloud forests and Amazon) and the Galapagos Islands in search of some of the countries wonderful reptile and amphibian species. <br/><br/>During this specialist herpetological photography tour you will be in expert hands of our expert wildlife biologists and award-winning wildlife photographers who have discovered, described some of the species we aim to see and have written all of the books on the subject.<br/><br/>This trip will have you travelling into the mysterious cloud-forests of Mindo and the Choco and on into the lush rainforests of the Amazon in search of some of the 1,050 plus species of reptiles and amphibians known from Ecuador. <br/><br/>After visiting the cloud forests and Amazon on the Ecuadorian mainland and hopefully finding and photographing at least 100 different species of reptiles and amphibians you will have an immersive and action-packed seven-day adventure on the storied and breathtaking Galapagos Islands.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>Throughout the itinerary you'll be accompanied by expert full time guides, often including: professional herpetologists and wildlife photographers, English speaking local naturalists and a local driver for all transfers. Being in the company of a naturalist is the best way to learn more about rainforest ecology and animal behaviour and will help you identify different species and interpret behaviours. <br/>Each location and habitat visited on this tour is unique and home to a set of wildlife different from the next. <br/>Some of the wildlife targeted is very specific to certain regions, some of the frogs, vipers and anoles are known from only one valley or patch of cloud forest and there is such an incredible diversity that anyone interested in amphibians and reptiles will have an incredible time looking for, finding and photographing some of the world's rarest species.<br/>Ecuador is home to one of the highest concentrations of life and one of the highest biodiversities in the world. We aim to see as many species as possible and provide a great overview of the wildlife and ecosystems of Ecuador and  on this specialist wildlife photography holiday.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner where mentioned). There will be filtered or boiled water available for each guest each day. We have our own private AC vehicles with an excellent driver for all vehicular transfers. You will have a local cultural and naturalist guides. The guides have spent years in Ecuador and know the places and wildlife and cultural monuments and sites intimately. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. In the Galapagos snrokelling equipment will be provided by the boat. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>We choose the northern hemipshere spring as a good time for this itinerary, however there is never really a bad time of year as the locations are on the equator and so the weather is fairly constant.  <br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced herpetologists, wildlife photographers, local naturalist or guides as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• Your specialist herpetologists guides are world renown and have discovered and described many new species (including some of which we will see) and have also written most of the books and field guides on Ecuadorean herpetafauna.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it.<br/>• When in the Galapagos Islands the boat will provide snorkelling equipment and their own expert naturalist onboard will work with your herping guides. <br/>• This specific wildlife tour is one of the few in the world that explores remote and wilderness areas of Ecuador in the company of expert guides.<br/>• We provide camera traps for you to set up and you are free to use any and all of the photographs and videos that this camera trap gets during your stay.  <br/>• All the above reasons give this, our unique Ecuador&amp; Galapagos Herping Photo Holiday a great success rate of seeing rare wildlife. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Ecuador which explore other areas and focus on other species such as scuba diving in the Galapagos and more specific birding holidays as well as many other species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/> <br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour visits a number of sights including the cloud forests and the upper Amazon rainforest. The locations within the cloud forest and Amazon are largely secret as they are study sites and home to some of the rarest species in the country. From the mainland you will fly to the iconic and famous Galapagos Islands archipelago. You will visit several of the islands as you look for the endemic reptile life here. <br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The fitness level required for our Ecuador herping photo tour is not too high, all wildlife is seen from walking and there are some hills (especially in the cloud forest), we recommend people are used to walking for 2-3 hours in the wet, humid and hot conditions. There is optional (but highly recommended) snorkelling on the Galapagos Islands also.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.

Mindo is a bioregion of the Choco or Andean cloud forest. The drive will take you out of Quito valley and onto the western slopes of the Andes and into the diverse and incredible cloud forests. After around 2 hours you will arrive at the lodge and then after settling in you will be taken to try and find your first species of the trip. There are many areas around Mindo cloud forest which can be explored and you will be taken to the best places for the targeted species tonight. The locations vary from sightings to sightings and tonight you will be mostly looking for glassfrogs, rainfrogs and anoles. his region houses the greatest number of glassfrog species in the world, and the second greatest number of rainfrogs. There are good chances to photograph the elusive Pinocchio Anole (Anolis proboscis), the Ornate Rainfrog (Pristimantis ornatissimus) and the Mutable Rainfrog (Pristimantis mutabilis). Vipers are rare, but beautiful and, most of them, cloudforest endemics so we will keep an eye open for these too. The Pinocchio anole is one of the most incredible species of lizard in the world with an enormous nose horn, the ornate rainfrog is a stunningly patterned frog and the mutable rainfrog is recently described and is to date the only known amphibian to rapidly change its body shape and skin texture in response to the need to be camouflaged. Tonight is just a quick stop over in Mindo as you will be travelling further on tomorrow, but you will be back in Mindo later in the trip so rest assured that if any of the targeted species allude you tonight you will have other chances to see them later.

Your destination today will be the Canande Reserve; this reserve is located in the rich and diverse Choco habitat. The reserve itself protects a fragment of lowland rainforest which is under threat from fragmentation by intensive agriculture (such as oil palm plantations) and timber extraction. The reserve is home to endangered mammals such as jaguars, howler, spider and capuchin monkeys as well as Baird’s tapirs and around 30 near threatened or restricted range species of birds including the globally threatened plumbeous forest-falcon, great-green macaw, ochraceous attila, long-wattled umbrellabird, scarlet-breasted dacnis and grey-backed hawk; but of course it will be some of the diverse reptiles and amphibians in the reserve that we will be looking for today.

Mindo is a typical cloud forest habitat where the general feel is moist, cool, green and lush. The rainy season is from January until May, with a lot of the precipitation in the form of mist and also rain. Luckily the rain is pretty predictable during this time and starts at about 14:00 daily and continues for a few hours giving us plenty of time to schedule our day activities around this. Because of the higher altitude, Cloud Forests are always cooler than the lowland rainforests. The highest temperatures in Mindo are around 26-27oC and the low at night is around 13oC and this is consistent all year round. Because of the moisture and coolness (that slows evaporation), cloud forests are very green and lush. This unique climate allows loads of epiphytes, plants that live on other plants, to grow almost out of control. There are mosses on the trunks of trees, orchids between the mosses, ferns growing on branches, algae covering leaves, much more so than in rain forests. In Mindo there is a distinct dry season for about 7 months (June through December) when rain is scarce and sporadic, but moisture levels are still maintained by mists that condense on the side of mountains. While mammal species are difficult to see, over time various species have been spotted including, Central American agouti, ocelot, margay, red brocket deer, paca, tayra, Andean coati, three-toed sloth, and white-fronted capuchins. There is also a high diversity of reptiles, amphibians, butterflies and other insects. (all of your meals are included today)."

Protected since 1989 and being the ancestral home of the indigenous Huaorani people the vast park is some 9,820km2 and home to still two uncontacted tribes, the Tagaeri and Taromenane. But along with these indigenous people the park is home to a world record number of amphibians (over 150 species), there are also over 120 species of recorded reptiles which means that despite covering just 0.15% of the Amazon by area it is home to over a third of all the herps known from the rainforest.

You select the Amazon lodge that suits you best, in the Andes you can either explore the crafts and markets of Otavalo, the wonderful scenery of Cotopaxi, or the natural world of an Andean cloud forest. Then you select the boat of your choice for the Galapagos Islands. We can help you to decide if you are not sure. <br/><br/>Featured activities on this trip include: walking, jungle treks, horse riding (optional), cruising and wildlife watching. <br/><br/>Best time to go:<br/>Ecuador's weather varies little throughout the year, but there are large variations around the country, primarily due to differences in altitude. In the Andes, June to September are generally drier and clearer than the rest of the year (6-7 hours of sunshine as opposed to 5-6 hours at other times). At other times, a typical sierra day would start with a sunny clear morning, clouding over later in the afternoon perhaps with some rain. Cloud and rain are created by the mountains, so can vary widely as you move around them. There is little difference in temperature around the year. In the Amazon, warm temperatures and high levels of humidity are the norm. It rains too (hence the rainforest), but not as much as you might think. You would be unlucky to lose more than half a day to rain in a 4 day visit - but it does happen. The Galapagos Islands are an all year round destination.",

    "generalInfo": "See the Amazon, the Andes, and then the Galapagos Islands – this adventure through Ecuador takes three weeks and it’s a private guided tour, so you can get the very best bespoke experience.<br/><br/>It's hard to say where Ecuador’s biggest hitters are – on one hand, there’s Cotopaxi, the Andes, and the Amazon – massive wild areas on the mainland. Then there are the unique Galapagos islands with its weird and wonderful little miracles of nature. On this trip you see both.This holiday includes a drive from the Andes to the Amazon – a big and adventurous distance to cover on a holiday – and not something everyone can say they’ve done! Once you’re there, you’ll get plenty of time up in the Amazon, on boat cruises and visiting local communities. <br/><br/>You’ll visit the cities of Quito and Cuenca, so you can take in the architecture of the capital and third largest city, and meet and chat with craftspeople. You’ll spend time at a cloud forest lodge near the Mindo Cloud Forest, where you can experience the forest on a nature walk with a local guide, or in your swimsuit, whilst you bathe in the natural pool at the bottom of a waterfall.  <br/><br/>Once you reach the Galapagos, stay in the heart of a giant tortoise reserve, then step on board your boat, where an on-board naturalist will help you explore archipelago islands. Kayaking trips, volcano hikes and snorkelling trips on Isabela Island help you get even closer to nature – look out for penguins and playful sea lions.    <br/><br/>What makes it luxury? You’ll stay in boutique lodges, and can opt for a boutique cruise once you reach the Galapagos. The holiday can be tailored to your needs – need an extra day? Passionate about birdlife? Everything can be reworked for your interests. This trip contains internal flights to reach the Galapagos islands, but every effort has been made to design it with minimal unnecessary flights. <br/>",

We fully believe that by participating in this trip you will encounter more species of herps and be able to get closer than ever before to them.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>Throughout the itinerary you'll be accompanied by expert full time guides, often including: professional herpetologists and wildlife photographers, English speaking local naturalists and a local driver for all transfers. Being in the company of a naturalist guide is the best way to learn more about rainforest ecology and animal behaviour and will help you identify different species and interpret behaviours. <br/>Each location and habitat visited on this tour is unique and home to a set of wildlife different from the next. <br/>Some of the wildlife targeted is very specific to certain regions, some of the frogs, vipers and anoles are known from only one valley or patch of cloud forest and there is such an incredible diversity that anyone interested in amphibians and reptiles will have an incredible time looking for, finding and photographing some of the world's rarest species.<br/>Ecuador is home to one of the highest concentrations of life and one of the highest biodiversities in the world. We aim to see as many species as possible and provide a great overview of the wildlife and ecosystems of Ecuador and  on this specialist wildlife photography holiday.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner where mentioned). There will be filtered or boiled water available for each guest each day. We have our own private AC vehicles with an excellent driver for all vehicular transfers. You will have a local cultural and naturalist guides. The guides have spent years in Ecuador and know the places and wildlife and cultural monuments and sites intimately. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>We choose the northern hemipshere spring as a good time for this itinerary, however there is never really a bad time of year as the locations are on the equator and so the weather is fairly constant.  <br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced herpetologists, wildlife photographers, local naturalist or guides as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• Your specialist herpetologists guides are world renown and have discovered and described many new species (including some of which we will see) and have also written most of the books and field guides on Ecuadorean herpetafauna.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it.<br/>• This specific wildlife tour is one of the few in the world that explores remote and wilderness areas of Ecuador in the company of expert guides.<br/>• We provide camera traps for you to set up and you are free to use any and all of the photographs and videos that this camera trap gets during your stay.  <br/>• All the above reasons give this, our unique Ecuador Herping Photo Holiday a great success rate of seeing rare wildlife. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of Ecuador which explore other areas and focus on other species such as scuba diving in the Galapagos and more specific birding holidays as well as many other species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/> <br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour visits a number of sights including the cloud forests and the upper Amazon rainforest. The locations within the cloud forest and Amazon are largely secret as they are study sites and home to some of the rarest species in the country.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The fitness level required for our Ecuador herping photo tour is not too high, all wildlife is seen from walking and there are some hills (especially in the cloud forest), we recommend people are used to walking for 2-3 hours in the wet, humid and hot conditions. <br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking. We can also include specialist equipment on request such as camera traps, infrared cameras, thermal imaging equipment and spotlights. .<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 15 Years Old<br/><br/>Photo Credits:<br/>Javier Ábalos from Valencia, España<br/>Pavel Kirillov from St.Petersburg, Russia<br/>Fernando Flores<br/>Renato Augusto Martins<br/>Bernard DUPONT from FRANCE<br/>Sebastian Lotzkat<br/>Cocodrilo del orinoco<br/>A.

Mindo is a bioregion of the Choco or Andean cloud forest. The drive will take you out of Quito valley and onto the western slopes of the Andes and into the diverse and incredible cloud forests. After around 2 hours you will arrive at the lodge and then after settling in you will be taken to try and find your first species of the trip. There are many areas around Mindo cloud forest which can be explored and you will be taken to the best places for the targeted species tonight. The locations vary from sightings to sightings and tonight you will be mostly looking for glassfrogs, rainfrogs and anoles. his region houses the greatest number of glassfrog species in the world, and the second greatest number of rainfrogs. There are good chances to photograph the elusive Pinocchio Anole (Anolis proboscis), the Ornate Rainfrog (Pristimantis ornatissimus) and the Mutable Rainfrog (Pristimantis mutabilis). Vipers are rare, but beautiful and, most of them, cloudforest endemics so we will keep an eye open for these too. The Pinocchio anole is one of the most incredible species of lizard in the world with an enormous nose horn, the ornate rainfrog is a stunningly patterned frog and the mutable rainfrog is recently described and is to date the only known amphibian to rapidly change its body shape and skin texture in response to the need to be camouflaged. Tonight is just a quick stop over in Mindo as you will be travelling further on tomorrow, but you will be back in Mindo later in the trip so rest assured that if any of the targeted species allude you tonight you will have other chances to see them later.

The reserve is home to endangered mammals such as jaguars, howler, spider and capuchin monkeys as well as Baird’s tapirs and around 30 near threatened or restricted range species of birds including the globally threatened plumbeous forest-falcon, great-green macaw, ochraceous attila, long-wattled umbrellabird, scarlet-breasted dacnis and grey-backed hawk; but of course it will be some of the diverse reptiles and amphibians in the reserve that we will be looking for today. This afternoon you will have the chance to walk around some of the reserve and then after dark you would be looking for species of vipers, treefrogs and glassfrogs. Today will be a shorter version of what you will be doing for the next two full days. You will have your meals at the lodge or packed lunches in the field, depending on where you are heading and what the day to day situation dictates. (all of your meals will be included today)"

        "description": "Mindo - Travelling & Wildlife Watching This morning you will be taken from Canande Reserve in the Choco and transferred back the 3-4 hours to Mindo as with your last time here, today you will spend the evening (after checking in, resting and having dinner) on a nocturnal hike looking for nocturnal herps to photograph. Mindo is a typical cloud forest habitat where the general feel is moist, cool, green and lush. The rainy season is from January until May, with a lot of the precipitation in the form of mist and also rain. Luckily the rain is pretty predictable during this time and starts at about 14:00 daily and continues for a few hours giving us plenty of time to schedule our day activities around this. Because of the higher altitude, Cloud Forests are always cooler than the lowland rainforests. The highest temperatures in Mindo are around 26-27oC and the low at night is around 13oC and this is consistent all year round. Because of the moisture and coolness (that slows evaporation), cloud forests are very green and lush. This unique climate allows loads of epiphytes, plants that live on other plants, to grow almost out of control. There are mosses on the trunks of trees, orchids between the mosses, ferns growing on branches, algae covering leaves, much more so than in rain forests. In Mindo there is a distinct dry season for about 7 months (June through December) when rain is scarce and sporadic, but moisture levels are still maintained by mists that condense on the side of mountains. While mammal species are difficult to see, over time various species have been spotted including, Central American agouti, ocelot, margay, red brocket deer, paca, tayra, Andean coati, three-toed sloth, and white-fronted capuchins. There is also a high diversity of reptiles, amphibians, butterflies and other insects. (all of your meals are included today)."

On arrival in Coca city you will take a motorised canoe down and deep into Amazon and into Yasuni National Park and onto your accommodation at the wonderful Yasuni Scientific Station. Protected since 1989 and being the ancestral home of the indigenous Huaorani people the vast park is some 9,820km2 and home to still two uncontacted tribes, the Tagaeri and Taromenane. But along with these indigenous people the park is home to a world record number of amphibians (over 150 species), there are also over 120 species of recorded reptiles which means that despite covering just 0.15% of the Amazon by area it is home to over a third of all the herps known from the rainforest. There are also over 380 species of fish, nearly 600 species of birds and over 100 species of mammals; as well as countless invertebrates and over 4,000 species of vascular plants.

If you are travelling all this way to see the Galapagos, it is more than worth spending a week exploring the incredible Andean landscapes and rich, Quichua culture before jetting west for an island cruise. This Ecuador highlands tour and Galapagos cruise combines both seamlessly, as part of a guided, small group tour. Ecuador is one of South America’s smallest countries, surrounded by veritable giants, but its biodiversity is astonishing, and makes a delightful snow-capped contrast to the Galapagos’s dark volcanoes.<br/><br/>Your journey begins in the UNESCO-rated capital of Quito, brimming with beautifully preserved colonial architecture and the bustle of Quichua life. Travel up to the equator, just a few kilometres to the north, to stand with one foot on each hemisphere. You’ll then travel south through the Avenue of the Volcanoes, passing giants such as Cotopaxi and Chimborazo, before embarking on the exhilarating Devil’s Nose train ride along a series of sharp switchbacks as you descend into a lush valley. A private bus takes you further south still, to Cuenca – another UNESCO World Heritage Site, where 16th century colonial architecture combines with 15th century Inca stonework, and the odd llama strolls around town.<br/><br/>Your next stop is the sprawling port city of Guayaquil, from where your flight to the Galapagos will depart. The next week is spent aboard a comfortable motor yacht as you cruise around this incredible archipelago, disembarking usually twice a day to get up close to the landscapes and wildlife. Encounter giant tortoises, trek around volcanoes, snorkel with sea lions and meet the most northerly penguins in the world during what is sure to be one of the most memorable weeks of your life.",

The architecture bears all the hallmarks of Inca construction, with some fine mortar-less stonework and typical trapezoidal niches and doorways. Archaeologists believe that the main structure, known as The Temple of the Sun, was used for religious and ceremonial purposes. Today, however, it simply provides welcome shade for grazing llamas and the occasional tourist.

It is a spectacular drive that truly contrasts the scenery in this small country, as you pass from Andean villages to banana plantations. On the way we stop at the Las Cajas National Park. Beautiful trails pass through this rugged, high-altitude wilderness of grasslands, jagged hills and glacial lagoons. You will be sure to pass herds of serene, grazing llama, and perhaps spot a spectacled bear, a puma or a tigrillo (relative of the ocelot), all of which inhabit the area, as do many species of bird, including the Andean condor and, at the other end of the scale, the tiny hummingbird. Guayaquil, Ecuador’s largest city, is situated on the banks of the River Guayas, and has gone through something of a transformation in the last few years. The expanse of waterfront has been made into an outdoor architectural showpiece, and restoration work has taken place along the city’s main thoroughfare and in the historical neighbourhood of Las Peñas. Time permitting, you can take a walk from the frenetic, noisy open market at La Bahia, and past the colonial naval shipyard to the Malecón (the waterfront promenade), Guayaquil’s crowning jewel. Stroll past tropical gardens, markets and street cafés, and head to Santa Ana Hill and Las Peñas, a district of brightly-coloured wooden houses and ramshackle streets dating back to the 16th century."

The Galápagos Islands emerged 6 million years ago after a spate of volcanic activity, and have become home to unique animal and plant species. The islands were the inspiration for Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution, which formed the basis for his revolutionary book ‘The Origin of Species’, published in 1859.Although geologically these islands are constantly on the move, they remain suspended in time, with giant tortoises, iguanas, penguins, numerous bird species and a wealth of rare flora all thriving there. For many, the fascinating and unique wildlife and natural beauty of the islands are matched by the thrill of being at sea. Find a spot on deck as you make your way through the ocean, trailed by flocks of birds and playful dolphins. The boats are relatively small, creating an informal atmosphere, and the service is of a high standard; the crew is attentive and the food very good. Cabins with en suite facilities are compact but comfortable for your six nights on board. There are common bar / lounge areas as well as a sun decks.

There are normally two landings a day, which will usually include chances to snorkel, on which you are accompanied by your guide in search of the different wildlife that inhabits the islands. Below is a summary of the islands that you visit on this journey, and the animals and birds that can be found on each of them. Santa Cruz (Indefatigable): This island has the largest human population of the five inhabited islands. Some 4,000 residents are distributed between the cattle farming communities in the lush highlands and the coastal town of Puerto Ayora, which is mainly dominated by tourism. The Charles Darwin Research Station here is staffed by international scientists conducting biological research and conservation projects. Fernandina (Narborough): The island is one of the world’s most active and impressive volcanoes, having erupted at least 10 times in the last 150 years. The lava fields offer a ‘land without time’ landscape and the island is home to a huge colony of marine iguanas, flightless cormorants and some penguins. Isabela (Albemarle): The largest island in the archipelago, it has 5 volcanoes forming a chain down its spine. The most famous sites are situated on the western side, such as the impressive and spectacular inlets of Vincente Roca, with its high cliffs, lava formations and wonderful marine life. Urbina Bay offers an impressive array of birdlife including finches, warblers and mockingbirds, whilst Elizabeth Bay lined with mangroves is home to turtles and rays. James (Santiago): The island is one of black rocks and little shade, and the western coast is pitted with lava pools and caves which are home to a wealth of marine life. You may well see herons and oyster catchers as well as Galápagos fur seals playing in the deep, cool water pools, and marine iguanas grazing on algae beds alongside colourful Sally Lightfoot crabs. Rabida Island (Jervis) is unique because the red colour of the rocks and sand. The volcanic material in this island is very porous and external factors as rain, salt water and sea breeze have acted as an oxidizing agent. A short walk along a trail lead us to a coastal lagoon behind the beach permits the observation of land birds as finches, doves, yellow warblers and mocking birds. At the lagoon there is a colony of flamingos."

They have built this into a grassroots community tourism project by welcoming visitors to the village with walks on the trails around the remote community, a visit to their small 'Museum of Llamas', and of course the chance to be surrounded by these wonderful animals in their natural habitat.

Starting in Quito's colonial centre, where narrow cobblestone streets are lined with whitewashed walls. This is said to be the best preserved colonial centre in all of South America, and the United Nations declared Quito as the first capital city with protected world heritage status. Walking through the Main Plaza, the Government Palace will be pointed out, La Compañia and some of the most important Baroque-style churches built around the 16th and 17th centuries, including the grand San Francisco Monastery. Walk up La Ronda Street whilst learning about traditional work in Quito all the way to the Panecillo. From the hill that dominates the south of the city, admire the famous statue of Our Lady of the Panecillo and enjoy spectacular views of Quito. After a spot of lunch, get ready for afternoon tea in the form of locally grown chocolate. Ecuador's unique equatorial climate provides the perfect environment for growing the world's finest cocoa - Cacao Arriba. Cocoa has been revered in Latin America for over 5,000 years, and the Spanish explorers adored it so much they called it the 'Food of the Gods'."

It captures some of the most exciting aspects of Ecuador’s cloud forest, Andean landscapes and people, and, of course, the Galapagos Islands. Ecuador is a haven for adventure, wildlife watching and cultural wonders. It is also a very small country, making holidays very accessible for families who don’t want too much time on the road. Within a few days you can travel from the UNESCO World heritage capital Quito, meet people from fascinating indigenous communities, haggle at a market,  and walk and swim in the cloud forest.<br/><br/>And then there is the whole other world of the Galapagos Islands, in the water and on land. Swim with sea lions or sea turtles and get up close to iguanas and giant tortoises - just part of the extraordinary wildlife and fun, from dawn until dusk. Water features heavily on the mainland, too - in Ecuador’s mountain rivers and waterfalls. The itinerary is tailor made and so we can adapt it to suit your family’s needs and interests, whether they want more adrenalin filled adventure, or tranquil wildlife watching. Ecuador and the Galapagos holidays really do offer it all, and even though there is so much to do in two weeks, you will never feel rushed. This is family time after all.<br/>",

It is located at 2,850 metres above sea level, at the slopes of the Pichincha volcano and nestled in a green Andean valley. Quito, one of the oldest cities in South America, is also one of the few cities that has preserved numerous monuments and artistic treasures of the Spanish colonial period.The colonial centre of the city was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1978. We begin the tour with a walk through the narrow streets to visit some of America's oldest and most beautiful churches such as El Sagrario and La Compañia and the famous plazas of Santo Domingo, La Merced and San Francisco. Today you explore the beautiful historical centre of Quito with its wonderful squares and picturesque churches. We have lunch at a local restaurant and in the afternoon will take the teleferico up to a viewpoint on the slopes of Pichincha volcano. The views from up here are wonderful and the kids will enjoy the adventure. There is even a small amusement park at its base. Return to our hotel"

    "generalInfo": "Travel into the depths of the Amazonian Rainforest in Ecuador and come face to face with giant otters, river dolphins, dozens of monkeys and possibly the elusive jaguar. This wildlife tour is definitely going to be one to remember.<br/><br/>Throughout the itinerary suggested below you'll be accompanied by expert full time guides, often including: English speaking local guides and a local driver for all transfers. Being in the company of a naturalist guide is the best way to learn more about rainforest ecology and animal behaviour and will help you identify different species and interpret behaviours. For example there are very subtle differences between some of the small primate species, such as marmosets, and many people see mixed foraging groups of primates without ever knowing the difference.<br/><br/>Ecuador is home to one of the highest concentrations of life and one of the highest biodiversities in the world. Wildlife rich Andean cloud forests and Amazon rainforest are literally teeming with life and different species. The numbers of animals and plants in Ecuador is truly mind blowing, with over half of all South American birds and twice as many species that live in Europe; there are also more mammals per-square-metre than anywhere else on earth. <br/><br/>During the proposed itinerary below (which can be amended and tailored to suit your ideal requirements) you will be taken to three of the best wildlife watching lodges in the world, two in the famous Amazon rainforest and one in the stunning cloud forest. The main focus of this tour will be tracking some of the more elusive mammals, such as: spectacled bears, giant otters, Brazilian tapirs, dozens of primate species and maybe even a puma, jaguar, ocelot or jaguarondi. <br/><br/>The outlined itinerary below can be undertaken at any time of the year. The climate in Ecuador is remarkably stable (being right on the equator) however we recommend the months from August to November as spectacled bears come out of hiding to take advantage of fruiting trees.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/>There is a fair amount of walking involved in this tour, but it is all on pathways and not excessively taxing. There are no strenuous activities included and guests can decide on how much or how little they wish to commit to.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; but as a rule of thumb we recommend you bring along your own binoculars or spotting scope (although scopes are not great in the dense rainforest) as well as appropriate clothing; which should be everything from swimming gear and light and airy hot weather clothing to warm underwear and waterproofs for the cloud forests. The nights up in the cloud forests can be chilly so a fleece, long trousers and woolly hat are a good idea. Comfortable walking shoes are a must. Insect repellent is needed. Any medication, books or other items of a personal nature is of course up to you to bring along. Oh and please bring plenty of memory cards or film for your camera. Also do not forget sun cream, sun hat and sun glasses as the sun can be very strong here during the day. <br/><br/>Minimum age: 18 Years old",

    "generalInfo": "This Galapagos Islands vacation is flexible and fits your schedule and budget.  Depart any day you want year round, and choose a four-eight-day itinerary option. It’s perfect for couples, families and small groups! You travel from island to island by speed boat and stay in idyllic beach or waterfront hotels on two islands.  You see all the classic Galapagos wildlife and enjoy a variety of activities including snorkeling, walking and hiking. Trips are led by Galapagos National Park Service certified guides as well as a local tour leader.  <br/><br/>You may not like the idea of being wedded to a cruise boat for a week and this is an excellent alternative.  Fact is that for years the only way to explore the Galapagos Islands was by traveling on a yacht or cruise ship that carried from ten to a hundred people. Today you have a choice and on this trip we connect the islands with speed boats that travel much faster than the larger yachts and cruise ships. Our “Flexible Galapagos” trip is the most seamless of these adventures.   We have been operating tours in the Galapagos since 2005 and are very pleased to bring you this exclusive and alternative Galapagos tour.<br/><br/>Highlights of this Galapagos Islands vacation include learning in-depth about the Galapagos ecosystems as you walk and explore the islands; a hike to the still-active Sierra Negra volcano on the island of Isabela and; amazing wildlife interactions. You watch blue-footed boobies fly and dive; see marine iguanas slumber along or jump into the water and; observe brown pelicans fishing and being challenged by frigate birds for their food. You also swim and play with frolicking young sea lions. At the end of each activity-filled day, gaze upon spectacular sunsets and soak in the magical web of life that is the Galapagos.<br/><br/>There are four small towns on the Galapagos and about 20,000 people living in the islands. On this land-based tour you fully explore this dimension of the Galapagos ecosystem. You stay in small hotels run by local people, dine in local restaurants, travel by various forms of local transport and in the end gain a much fuller understanding and appreciation for life and evolution in the islands.  This tour represents the best in sustainable tourism to the Galapagos because of the many and varied local services it supports.  While a very small percentage of the fees paid for traditional cruise programs stay in the islands, this land-based Galapagos Islands tour leaves a significant economic impact.  There is also a much smaller contribution to the planet’s carbon emissions as little time is spent traveling by boat and much more time is spent walking and exploring under your own power.",

        "description": "Spend 5-7 days cruising the Galapagos Islands and exploring some of the main sites or more remote locations. Some of the highlights: Fernandina is the third largest island in the archipelago and has a single visitor site: Punta Espinoza located at the nor theastern tip of the island. Marine iguanas conglomerate in larger groups than in any other island. They bask around in the sand, swim near the shore and sometime block the way at the landing dock. Among the unique species found here, is the Flightless Cormorant. This bird had to adjust its way of survival and perfection its skills of finding food in the ocean. Their wings, tails and feet progressively adapted for swimming. To see these birds, is to witness evolution happening right in front of you. Tagus Cove (Isabela) A tour along the cliffs in a zodiac will give the visitors a good chance to see the Galapagos penguin, the flightless cormorant and other sea birds. From the landing dock it is about a 30 minute hike along the trail up to the top of the cliff from where you can view Darwin Lake, an uplifted ultra-saline lake saltier than the sea. You can also see several volcanoes from this location. Look carefully at the graffiti on the surrounding cliffs of the cove, it has been written by pirates, whalers and buccaneers in past centuries. Rabida After a wet landing on the remarkable red beach of Rábida, there are two short guided walks. Iron oxide particles give rocks and sand their reddish color. The beach wall has a shallow lagoon fringed with green; This oasis is the most fertile spot on the otherwise barren islet, which is covered in palo santo trees. The salty lagoon attracts all kinds of waterfowl, including pintails and sometimes red flamingos. Many species of songbirds hide and breed among the evergreen foliage of the surrounding mangroves. One of the most outstanding attractions is the important breeding colony of brown pelicans, the only pelicans in the world that dive. Las Bachas Beach (Santa Cruz) These two small beaches are located to the west of Black Turtle Cove, in Santa Cruz. Its sand consists of decomposed corals, which makes it white and soft. This makes it a favorite nesting site for sea turtles. Behind one of the beaches there are small lagoons, where flamingos and other shore birds, such as Galapagos gulls and lapwings, can be seen from time to time. On the second beach, which is the widest, you can explore the remains of two abandoned warships. In World War II, these were left behind by the US, as the island of Baltra was used as a strategic point for the protection of the Panama Canal. The name Las Bachas originated at this time, since the word with which the North Americans called these two boats, “barges”, was difficult for the local inhabitants to pronounce and they ended up making it Spanish. Eden Islet El Eden is a paradisiacal tuff cone islet, just off the west coast of Santa Cruz (between Whale Bay and Dragon Hill). This morning we will disembark to the appropriately named Eden Islet. On its coast you will observe land iguanas and sea lions soaking up the sun, as well as seabirds feeding in the nearby mangrove forests. It is a perfect location for swimming activities, as the clear and calm waters will allow you to snorkel along tropical fish, rays, and two species of sharks. Alternatively, a kayak ride would be a memorable experience. Dragon Hill (Santa Cruz) The visitor site at Dragon Hill has been open for visits since 1993. This site is located in north-western Santa Cruz Island and consists of a trail that lead to a hyper-saline lagoon behind the beach, frequented by flamingos, pintail ducks and other species of birds. This site has been re populated with land iguanas from Seymour, Isabela and Santa Cruz islands. There is a short walk to the Hill, which offers a beautiful view of the bay."

Our local, expert and very knowledgeable guides enrich your Galapagos Islands holiday while you hike in the mountains, swim with sea lions and have an intimate encounter with this magical ecosystem.<br/><br/>Most Galapagos Islands tours are cruise-based, carrying from 10 to 100 people. This Galapagos tour, the only of its kind, allows our small groups to visit sites off the main tourist routes. And you travel in the most environmentally-friendly way imaginable - your own power. We walk and sea kayak where other more intrusive travel couldn't take us and our reward is not only what we see, but also the pleasure we have in getting there. Working closely with local fishermen, we access places that very, very few others visit.  As well, we hike to the interior of the islands and a highlight is climbing to the rim of a recently active volcano.  While most trips are comprised of adults, we also offer some family-specific departures of this Galapagos Islands tour.<br/><br/>This unique tour also provides a holistic view of the Galapagos ecosystems including the human element that is very much a part of the landscape.  There are roughly 20,000 people living in the Galapagos Islands, concentrated primarily in four towns.  Because we stay in small, local hotels, eat our meals at local restaurants (except during the time we are camping), use local transport and services and buy all our supplies in the islands, this trip represents the best in responsible, sustainable tourism to the Galapagos.  While less than 8% of the fees you pay on a typical cruise program stay in the Galapagos, on this tour well over 30% is spent directly in the islands.  Your carbon footprint is also significantly less as you are not chugging around in a boat, but rather, exploring under human power – paddling, hiking and swimming.  <br/><br/>The Galapagos Islands are one of a few places on earth that allow for such intimate contact with a dazzling array of wildlife.  You travel with a small 12-person group to visit sites that are not on the main tourist routes, leaving the crowds of visitors and well-worn paths behind to enjoy the peace of walking, snorkeling and paddling your way through this island paradise. <br/><br/>This Galapagos Island trip was featured in the New York Times Travel Section January 8, 2006 where you can find the article entitled \"Galapagos Unbound\" by Tim Neville.  While the original itinerary has been modified somewhat since that time, the essence of the adventure has not changed. Our expert local guides work alongside Park Service certified guides to bring you a superlative Galapagos multisport adventure.  Our local guides are fully bilingual and work hard to assure you that you are experiencing the best the Galapagos has to offer.  There simply is no more authentic and intimate way to experience a Galapagos Islands tour than on this itinerary.",

Back in Puerto Ayora, you’ll have free time to choose your own lunch spot—your guide will recommend some excellent local options. In the afternoon, we board a water taxi to Isabela Island, the largest and one of the least developed islands in the archipelago. Known for its abundant wildlife—marine iguanas, flamingos, penguins, and giant tortoises—Isabela offers a more remote and tranquil atmosphere. Upon arrival, our representative will assist with the hotel transfer and suggest places to dine. The rest of the evening is yours to enjoy—perhaps a beach walk or watching the sunset over the Pacific. Overnight: Hotel Cormorant or similar Meals: Breakfast"

        "description": "Isabela: Biking the Wetlands – Wall of Tears – Tintoreras After breakfast, we head out on a guided bike ride along a dedicated route showcasing Isabela’s diverse landscapes and ecosystems. Throughout the morning, you’ll cycle, take short walks, and stop at key points highlighting local history, wildlife, and conservation projects. We begin in the Wetlands, a network of mangroves, lagoons, and swamps that support flamingos, herons, finches, and many other species. Your guide will explain why this region is vital for island biodiversity. Next, we visit the Wall of Tears, a somber historical site dating to Isabela’s time as a penal colony. Your guide will recount the stories connected to this difficult period. We continue to Playa del Amor, known for its rugged lava formations and large population of marine iguanas. These unique reptiles often bask on the rocks or swim for algae. A highlight of the morning is the Tortoise Breeding Centre, where conservation efforts aim to protect and restore the tortoise population. You’ll observe tortoises of different ages and learn about the ongoing work to safeguard the species. After lunch in Puerto Villamil, we take a short trip to Tintoreras Islet, a volcanic outcrop surrounded by clear water. Named for the white-tip reef sharks that rest in the channels, this area is rich in marine life. Snorkelling here may bring you close to penguins, sea turtles, sea lions, schools of fish, and feeding marine iguanas. Non-snorkellers can enjoy scenic views and excellent photography opportunities.

        "description": "Isabela: Sierra Negra Volcano Trek This morning, we head into the highlands for a hike to the immense Sierra Negra caldera—one of the largest in the world at nearly six miles across. The round-trip hike is about 10 miles, offering wide, open views and a close look at volcanic formations shaped by past eruptions. As we walk along the rim, you will see the lava fields left by the 2018 eruption. On clear days, the scenery extends across Isabela, including toward Elizabeth Bay, known for its mangrove forests and rich marine life. Birdlife is abundant, with chances to spot vermilion flycatchers, finches, and perhaps a Galapagos hawk. After the trek, you’ll have time to unwind, enjoy the sunset, or visit nearby spots like Concha Perla—a lovely place for a swim or quiet relaxation by the water.

        "description": "Isabela: Los Tuneles and El Finado – Wine Tasting Today we visit Los Tuneles, one of the Galapagos’ most unique snorkelling destinations. Lava flows have created arches, tunnels, and sheltered pools, forming a haven for marine life. During the boat journey, your guide will describe how these formations emerged and the ecosystems they support. On foot, we’ll explore the volcanic arches and look for nesting blue-footed boobies—if we’re lucky, we might witness their courtship dance. Snorkelling here is exceptional. You may encounter: • White-tip reef sharks resting in the tunnels • Sea turtles gliding through the channels • Eagle rays sweeping across the sandy bottom • Reef fish such as parrotfish and damselfish • Playful sea lions After lunch on board, we continue to El Finado, another sheltered snorkelling site known for manta rays, stingrays, octopus, starfish, and shimmering schools of fish. For non-snorkellers, the volcanic views from the boat are equally impressive. As the day concludes, we gather for an Ecuadorian wine-tasting social hour—a relaxed way to share stories before heading into town for dinner.

During two snorkelling sessions, you may spot sea turtles, rays, sea lions, white-tip reef sharks, colourful reef fish, and—if luck is on your side—hammerhead sharks. Afterwards, we head to a peaceful white-sand beach for relaxation, followed by a freshly prepared lunch on board. In the afternoon, we return to town for a cultural activity: a hands-on cooking class with a local fishing family.

    "generalInfo": "Prepare for a unique 17-day adventure, big on ancient sights and breathtaking beauty, as you travel in a small group from the bustle of Quito, visiting the Galapagos Islands, before soaking up the history of the Incas in and around Cuzco. Travelling by plane, train and both private and public bus, this is a full and fascinating introduction to Peru and Ecuador.<br/><br/>You start in Ecuador’s spirited capital, Quito, one of South America’s most attractive cities, sitting at an altitude of 2,850m with a view of Volcan Pichincha on the horizon. Beautiful colonial style buildings and the nooks and crannies of the Old Town unfold on a guided walking tour. From Quito, head to the extraordinary Galapagos, staying on three different islands to fully explore the region. You’ll hike, kayak and snorkel to get close to the wildlife, from sea lions, manta rays and turtles, to the iconic giant tortoises. Next, fly to Lima in Peru, wandering its Spanish-style streets and feasting on tasty fish ceviche in one of its many cafes, before flying to Cuzco where you’ll visit the Chocolate Museum – try the hot chocolate made from local cacao beans.<br/><br/>A bus journey takes you through the Sacred Valley, where maize crops grow on terraces carved into its sides, before hiking the Classic Inca Trail or Inca Quarry Trail towards Machu Picchu (it’s also possible to reach this ancient site via train and bus). This beautifully preserved citadel was built around 1440 AD. A guided tour explains its key features, but you’ll have lots of time to roam at leisure, too, snapping memorable photos and savouring this remarkable place, before heading back to Cuzco and home. <br/>",

        "description": "Depending on the travel arrangements you made before the trip, during the next four days you’ll be either hiking the Inca Trail (Route 1), hiking the Quarry Trail (Route 2) or staying in Cusco for two days before taking the train to Aguas Calientes (Route 3). All routes visit Machu Picchu. While away from Cusco, the bulk of your luggage will be stored at your hotel. If you’re hiking the Inca Trail or the Quarry Trail, the evening before you leave you'll receive a small duffle bag to carry your clothes in for the next four days (5 kg maximum). Your team of porters will carry these bags for you, together with the food and equipment for the trail. You won't have access to these items until the end of each day, as the porters will always be ahead of the group. If you’re travelling to Aguas Calientes by train, you'll be able to leave most of your luggage at the hotel in Cusco and travel with only a small bag for the overnight stay in Aguas Calientes. Route 1 Inca Trail Today, travel by minivan to the 82 km marker and meet your crew of local porters, your cook and your guide. Your first day will include uphill trekking to the campsite, which sits at 3100 m above sea level. On the way, you’ll see the Inca sites of Ollantaytambo, Huillca Raccay and Llactapata, as well as incredible views of snow-capped Veronica Peak. In the evening, unwind at the campsite with a nourishing meal prepared by your cook. Route 2 Quarry Trail Make an early start today and drive to Choquequilla, a small ceremonial place where Incas worshipped the moon. From here, you’ll head to the small community near Qory Song’o (Golden Heart) hill, where you’ll climb to the top for the incredible views of the Soqma Perolniyoc, Pachar and Huarocondo valleys. There are also several sacred tombs in the area, protected by the locals, which you can explore with your leader and even see some of the original structures crafted from wood and leather. These remains have never been seen by travellers before, so you can be a part of this exclusive experience. Carry on to the Perolniyoc Cascade lookout, where you can stop for some snacks and photos. Arrive at the campsite, 3700 m above sea level, around lunchtime. After, set off to explore the Q'orimarca archaeological site, which once served as a checkpoint to the Incas. Route 3 Cusco After spending the night in Ollantaytambo, take a short drive to the town of Pisac. Pisac is well known for its market. Here you’ll have the opportunity to shop for souvenirs and perhaps try some local empanadas. Arrive back at Cusco in the afternoon, where your leader can take you to San Pedro Market, where you have the option to buy some local favourites for a picnic tomorrow or enjoy having some free time. Perhaps head out for dinner– your leader will have plenty of local recommendations."

The group will then descend to the campsite in the Pacaymayo Valley at 3650 m. Route 2 Quarry Trail This is the most challenging and rewarding day of the hike. A 3-hour walk takes you to the top of the first pass of Puccaqasa, about 4370 m high. After enjoying the picturesque views of the valley, it’s a short walk before stopping for lunch. After, make the 2-hour hike to Kuychicassa, the highest pass of the trek at 4450 m. From here, descend to the sacred site that the Incas called Intipunku. This is a sun gate, where the sun will stream through at particular times of the year and there are views of the Nevado Veronica mountain year-round. Head to the campsite, only a stone’s throw away and at 3600 m. Route 3 Cusco Today, take a taxi to Tambomachay, an archaeological site just outside of Cusco.

Our ocean (sit on top) kayaks come in doubles or singles, and life jackets are provided. A support boat will escort us throughout our water activities to ensure safety and to provide water, snacks and towels between activities. From the Itabaca Channel we head up to the Santa Cruz highlands to a private reserve that borders the National Park, where we can see the famous Giant Tortoises roaming in the wild.

We have the whole day to explore the Isabela highlands, and we start by hiking up to the crater of the massive Sierra Negra volcano, and then onward to the rim of the Volcan Chico. This fascinating walk usually begins with some morning fog and drizzle, which sometimes persists in the shadow of the volcano, adding to its mysterious character. Despite the drizzle, we may see Galapagos Hawks, finches, flycatchers and Short Eared Owls en route. When we reach the rim of the Sierra Negra crater, the second largest in the world after the Ngorongoro in Tanzania, we will see the reward for our efforts. The crater is so large, and the views so expansive, photos can’t do it justice, but bring your binoculars and camera anyway! Later, as we head towards Volcan Chico, we may get the feeling we are walking on Mars due to the alien landscape. And while the land appears to be utterly desolate, a closer look will reveal small lizards scurrying about among the rocks. From the crater’s rim, we will enjoy more amazing views along with lava tubes and fumaroles. After Volcan Chico and its extreme landscape, we will be able to relax in the shade of a lovely “jaboncillo” tree, and enjoy our box lunch while taking in the spectacular and expansive views over the central and northern parts of the Island.

Today we take an early morning public speed boat back to Santa Cruz and then transfer by land to Baltra in order to take out flight back to mainland. Local flight back to Guayaquil/Quito Included: breakfast, English speaking assistance, transportation, local flight WE WILL LOOK AT CONNECTING FLIGHTS TO PERU (NOT INCLUDED)-you may require another night on the mainlamd! Volcanic eruptions created all the Galapagos Islands, and you will have a chance to see this geologic process first-hand as we explore Isabela, one of the archipelago’s youngest and most volcanically active islands. We have the whole day to explore the Isabela highlands, and we start by hiking up to the crater of the massive Sierra Negra volcano, and then onward to the rim of the Volcan Chico. This fascinating walk usually begins with some morning fog and drizzle, which sometimes persists in the shadow of the volcano, adding to its mysterious character. Despite the drizzle, we may see Galapagos Hawks, finches, flycatchers and Short Eared Owls en route. When we reach the rim of the Sierra Negra crater, the second largest in the world after the Ngorongoro in Tanzania, we will see the reward for our efforts. The crater is so large, and the views so expansive, photos can’t do it justice, but bring your binoculars and camera anyway! Later, as we head towards Volcan Chico, we may get the feeling we are walking on Mars due to the alien landscape. And while the land appears to be utterly desolate, a closer look will reveal small lizards scurrying about among the rocks. From the crater’s rim, we will enjoy more amazing views along with lava tubes and fumaroles. After Volcan Chico and its extreme landscape, we will be able to relax in the shade of a lovely “jaboncillo” tree, and enjoy our box lunch while taking in the spectacular and expansive views over the central and northern parts of the Island. In the distance, we will be able to see Fernandina, Pinzon and Santa Cruz Islands. We then head back down to complete our day of hiking (16 kilometers / 9,94 miles in total) and relax on the beaches of Puerto Villamil.

In World War II, these were left behind by the US, as the island of Baltra was used as a strategic point for the protection of the Panama Canal. The name Las Bachas originated at this time, since the word with which the North Americans called these two boats, “barges”, was difficult for the local inhabitants to pronounce and they ended up making it Spanish. Transfer to Baltra Airport (GPS) for your flight back to Quito where you will be met and transferred to the Wyndham Hotel at Quito Airport for the night."

There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>We choose September - November as a good time for this itinerary, this is due to the weather being drier during this time of year than the northern hemisphere summer. However as this trip is based along the equator the weather is fairly consistent all year around. <br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced local naturalist or guides as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• Our local Galapagos expert guide is provided and will stay with you on the boat throughout your Galapagos cruise.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it.<br/>• This specific wildlife tour is one of the few in the world that explores remote and wilderness areas of Ecuador in the company of expert guides.<br/>• We provide camera traps for you to set up and you are free to use any and all of the photographs and videos that this camera trap gets during your stay.  <br/>• All the above reasons give this, our unique Ecuador &amp; Galapagos Wildlife Holiday a great success rate of seeing rare wildlife.

We will have a vehicle nearby when in the Andes. The altitude can take some getting used to at first and the heat and humidity in the Amazon also. When in the Galapagos we include lots of snorkelling and so a experience snorkelling is advised. <br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.

From our dry landing, walk to a brackish, lagoon spotting lagoon birds such as stilts, pintail ducks, sandpipers, sanderlings and flamingos. Further inland, the trail offers a beautiful view of the bay and the western area of the archipelago. This area is a nesting site for land iguanas, which is constantly monitored and assisted by the Charles Darwin Research Station. The arid-zone vegetation makes for an ideal place to see Darwin's finches, Galapagos mockingbirds, the endemic Galapagos flycatcher and yellow warblers. The path can be challenging but it will be worth it for a spectacular view of the bay. Estimated travel time/distance: Bahia Sullivan to Cerro Dragon: 1.40 hours (17 nautical miles) Cerro Dragon to Black Turtle Cove :50 minutes (8 nautical miles)"

    "generalInfo": "This Galapagos and Ecuador holiday is a tailor made trip, where you chat with Ecuadorian experts to create the perfect itinerary for you. One that takes in the marine and mountain wonders of the country as well as its tropical rainforest ones. One of the wonderful aspects of travelling in Ecuador is that it is actually a relatively small country and yet boasts some of the most biodiverse landscapes imaginable. These include the tropical coastal region and Galapagos Islands, the volcanic highlands and Ecuadorian Amazon rainforest. <br/><br/>The twelve day itinerary below is just a suggestion of one that covers this wide variety of landscapes including a small ship cruise in the Galapagos. Starting in the capital city of Quito, take some time to enjoy not only its colonial and indigenous heritage but also to marvel at the snow capped mountains that envelop it.  <br/><br/>Your next stop is the Ecuadorian Amazon, which you access by plane from Quito, followed by a motorised canoe journey down the river to Sacha Lodge. Transported to what feels like another world, you can take part in an array of activities here, many of which are community led. These include bird watching, trekking, visiting a cacao farmer, meeting a local shaman or spending time learning about your Kichwa hosts. It is interesting to note that ‘Kichwa’ translates as “the coming together of people for the greater good”, and you will definitely feel this ethos in the welcome given by local people here. <br/><br/>In contrast, the next few days are in the Galapagos Islands, after taking a two hour flight from Quito. <br/>The Galapagos Islands' reputation as one of the world's most magnificent nature and wildlife experiences is wholly justified. You will explore the archipelago on board a small ship cruise, taking trips out to various islands and being guided by an expert naturalist guide. We can discuss the islands to visit in more detail when we work on your itinerary. Whichever you choose, you won’t be short of flora and fauna, highlights including marine iguanas, the Galapagos tortoise, frigatebirds and maybe even whales and dolphins. <br/>",

In the crystal-clear ocean, whales can sometimes be spotted if the conditions are right. Afternoon: Suarez Point (Española) Huge ocean waves crash onto the southern basaltic cliffs of Suarez Point, forming a spectacular blowhole, where the water sprays high into the air (depending on the season, the tide and how strongly the sea breeze pushes the waves). Take time for a meditative break on this peace-inducing viewpoint. This rocky area is also home to the most impressive and diverse collection of seabirds in the archipelago. Depending on the season, you can admire the endangered Galapagos albatross, blue-footed and nazca boobies, swallow-tailed gulls, red-billed tropicbirds and more.

        "description": "Morning: Cormorant Point and Champion Islet (Floreana) The peninsula of Cormorant Point forms the extreme north cape of Floreana; at the landing beach, you will be welcomed by a small colony of Galapagos sea lions. The green sand on this beach contains a high percentage of glassy olivine crystals, which were blown out by the surrounding tuff cones. The ‘flour sand’ beach on the southern side of the peninsula is made up of even finer white coral sand, which feels very smooth on the feet. Parrotfish have pulverised it, grinding the skeletons of living coral; you can even spot stingrays hiding in the sandy seabed here. During the first months of the year, Pacific green turtles come ashore to bury their eggs. Devil’s Crown offers one of the best snorkelling spots in the Galapagos due to the coral reef in its centre, which attracts a lot of marine life. Here you can spot Galapagos penguins, sea lions, sea turtles, many different colourful fish and even dolphins. The current can be a bit strong sometimes, so it should not be attempted by novice swimmers. Afternoon: Post Office Bay and Baroness Viewpoint (Floreana) In the 18th century, the crew of a whaling ship placed a wooden barrel at Post Office Bay. Letters put inside were collected and delivered by sailors returning home. There was no postage fee and, surprisingly, this mailbox honour system is still in use today. Although letters are no longer from sailors to their loved ones, tourists leave thousands of them today and many still reach their destination. You can also relax on the beach, where, in addition to Galapagos sea lions, Pacific green turtles and golden rays, you may see Galapagos penguins. This is the only place in the southeastern archipelago where penguins reside. You can also climb the small basaltic cone of Baroness Lookout and enjoy the paradisiacal coastline views. This viewpoint was the favourite spot of one of Floreana's first settlers, the eccentric baroness and self-proclaimed Empress of the Galapagos, Eloisa von Wagner, who even built her house a few metres further back. There will be a long navigation at the end of the day, so we recommend you take medication for seasickness. Accommodation: Solaris"

The desolate, sprawling fields seem to be mostly lifeless; but this island, which is particularly popular among photographers, still has a lot to offer. Green sea turtles burrow in the small white-sand beach, where you can also find crabs, blue herons and oystercatchers. Afternoon: Bartolomé The beautiful volcanic islet of Bartolomé is among the youngest of the islands and, on a geological scale, was just recently born out of the fire. Although it looks lifeless at first sight, Bartolomé has some of the wildest landscapes and best panoramas in the entire archipelago. To enjoy an idyllic view of Pinnacle Bay, climb the stairs to the viewpoint on top of the island (375ft/114m). You enter a dramatic world of (extinguished) spatter cones, craters, and lightweight lava droplets once spewed out by fiery fountains. The summit trail is also ideal for witnessing how pioneer vegetation, such as lava cactus, struggles to take root in the bare virgin lava fields. Accommodation: Solaris"

The crystal-clear water allows you to spot groups of whitetip reef sharks, blacktip reef sharks, hammerhead sharks, gold rays, and spotted eagle rays.

There is also time to snorkel this morning (please note, the visit to this beach might be done in the late afternoon on Day 6 on some departures). Just before midday, we navigate to Isabela. This afternoon, we walk (2.5mi/4km) to the Wall of Tears, a reminder of Isabela’s very different past when the island was used as a penal colony. Between 1946 and 1959, convicts were forced to build this wall from huge lava blocks simply as a form of punishment, which, combined with the harsh conditions, led to many deaths. After this sobering visit, we hike back to the town through mangroves, wetlands and along sandy beaches. This is one of the best places on the islands to view migratory birds, including Wilson’s phalaropes, blue-winged teals and, if we’re very lucky, ospreys. This region has also seen the reintroduction of Galapagos giant tortoises and we are likely to encounter several on our walk. Accommodation: San Vicente Hotel (or similar)"

The iguanas form small colonies at the base of the tall opuntia cacti, waiting for their flowers and dead pads to fall to the ground so they can feed. The island rocks are home to swallowtail gulls, shearwaters and sea lions. North Seymour is a flat, boulder-strewn island and a major nesting site for frigatebirds. It’s also a good place to see blue-footed boobies performing courtship rituals and sea lions playing in the powerful surf. Bartolomé is a spectacular scene of dramatic lava cones, clear seas and affords perhaps the most famous view of the Galapagos Islands, looking across the red cinder cones to the recent black lava fields on James Island.

This 1.5-km trail crosses volcanic terrain and typically takes about two hours at a leisurely pace. The path leads to one of Genovesa Island’s most remarkable bird sanctuaries, where red-footed and masked boobies nest closely together. In the natural cliff cavities, you may observe storm petrels and their main predator, the short-eared owl. The dramatic coastline can be admired both from the trail and during a comfortable panga ride, where fur seals may be seen resting on the rocks. Note: This is one of only five locations in the archipelago where red-footed boobies nest, making it a particularly significant destination for wildlife enthusiasts. PM: Darwin Bay Darwin Bay was formed when the island’s crater collapsed below sea level. A wet landing brings you to a pristine white coral sand beach. The island is a prime birdwatching destination, offering sightings of red-footed and masked boobies, wandering tattlers, lava gulls, sandpipers, yellow- and black-crowned lava herons, and yellowfinches. Following the trail, you can observe red-footed boobies nesting in the mangroves. Birdwatching opportunities also include sharp-billed finches, large cactus and ground finches, Galapagos doves, and swallow-tailed gulls. Tide pools along the trail host shorebirds and marine birds such as night herons, while playful sea lions can often be seen nearby. Darwin Bay is also excellent for snorkeling, where you may encounter small reef sharks, sea turtles, and hundreds of colorful fish. Sea kayaking is available for those wishing to explore the bay from the water. Meals: Breakfast / Lunch / Dinner"

Despite its modest size, it is home to some of the archipelago’s most fascinating species. The land iguanas on Plazas are smaller than their relatives on other islands. Throughout the island, you may also encounter several hybrid iguanas—offspring of a male marine iguana and a female land iguana. These unique creatures are easily recognizable by their black and gray coloring, combining the crest of a land iguana with the face and tail of a marine iguana. The island’s abundant iguana population is supported by the plentiful prickly pear cacti, their favorite food. Nesting swallow-tailed gulls can be seen among the cliffs, along with other seabirds such as Audubon’s shearwaters, red-billed boobies, frigatebirds, and brown pelicans. PM: Santa Fe Located in the southeast of the archipelago, Santa Fe was formed by tectonic uplift rather than volcanic activity, giving it mostly flat terrain. Some theories suggest it may be the oldest island in the Galapagos. Santa Fe is home to several endemic species, including the Galapagos hawk, Galapagos snake, Galapagos mockingbird, rice rats, and one of the archipelago’s two land iguana species. After disembarking in its clear, inviting waters, you will be near one of the numerous sea lion colonies. Along the trail, observe saltbush bushes and massive prickly pear cacti, whose impressive size is characteristic of oceanic islands. The island also offers excellent snorkeling opportunities, where you may swim alongside playful sea lions and colorful tropical fish. Meals: Breakfast / Lunch / Dinner"

We ride through woodlands, and wind our way around the patchwork fields of quinoa, potatoes, maize, lupins and tree tomato orchards. There are magnificent views of the jagged Mojanda summit as we cross the slopes of the sacred Imbabura volcano — the focus of many pre-Inca legends. Nearing our stay for the night, a 17th-century hacienda, we pass avocadoes, papaya, passionfruit and, riding into the Hacienda courtyard, graced with bougainvillea, the hummingbirds zoom past us enroute to the agapanthus. A blast of dazzling Andean colour is provided on a visit to the famous Otavalo market. Riding time: 5-6 hours riding"

Climbing out the valley onto the plains, we pick up the pace and, following agave-lined sandy tracks, ride through a landscape frequently described by guests as the most picturesque they have ever seen. Dramatic views of the hanging valleys and rocky ridges as we descend to lush meadows below passing ladies in traditional dress embroidering intricate blouses as they watch their flocks. We stop to see the pre-Inca earthworks dotted around this valley -one of the first highland areas settled, also often pausing in awe at the sight of a mighty Andean condor soaring overhead. Afternoon drive to a very comfortable country hotel located at the trail head of the next part of our ride. Jacuzzi & sauna at this very comfortable lodge.

Alongside the gurgling river, the abundance of lush vegetation is quite surprising: montane bamboo, ferns and native trees dripping with orchids and bromelias. The birds such as woodpeckers and hummingbirds are wonderful to see, the vultures a little unnerving! As we leave the micro-climate of the river valley, extensive views open up before us. Surrounded by four Andean peaks, part of the Avenue of Volcanoes, we ride towards the iconic Cotopaxi Volcano. Riding onto rough grasslands in the Sincholagua foothills there is a good chance of seeing more Andean Condors as well as eagles, hawks, falcons and harriers. At the northern border of the Cotopaxi National Park we arrive at a modern hacienda, often greeted by the llamas. This idyllic location, with remarkable views of the marvellous Andean landscape encircling us, is dominated by the perfectly conical shape of the snow-capped Cotopaxi Volcano. It will be our base for two nights. Riding time: 6 hours"

The horses enjoy the open spaces but have such a calm temperament that they settle into a rhythm without trying to rush. Several herds of wild horses inhabit the park and to ride alongside these long-maned horses galloping freely across the rugged terrain is a unique experience. Part of this ride follows the main Inca highway which linked Quito with Cusco, Peru, then we turn eastwards to follow the Inca route leading down to the Amazon. We pause to visit the remains of an Inca fort before continuing on through the gently undulating grassy hills, passing drumlins and moraine, crossing lahas and old lava flows before returning to the Hacienda via a canyon. We return to the same hacienda. Riding time: 6 hours"

Riding up through the native grasslands in order to reach the scree slopes and cross over into the Avenue of the Volcanoes, we leave the national park. We often meet local horsemen (chagras) checking their cattle, quite a sight, with their colourful ponchos, thick goatskin chaps and intricately plaited bridles. Their stirrups are enclosed, like clogs, and often carved into an animal head. Their lassos seem impossibly long to be useful – but very necessary when working with their very feisty bulls: they lasso the animal then get as far away as possible. We leave the horses and are driven to a historic hacienda with large gardens, close to Quito airport for dinner and overnight. Riding time: 6-7 hours, 2hr drive"

    "generalInfo": "Machu Picchu and the Galapagos are rightly two of South America's highlights and regularly exceed expectations. This itinerary is designed for those who wish to see both of these highlights but may be restricted to just two weeks travel time.<br/><br/>You'll begin in Cuzco. As the capital of the vast Inca empire and their ‘navel of the world’, Cuzco was a remarkable city, reputedly built in the shape of a puma, full of magnificent stone palaces and temples decorated with gold. Modern-day Cuzco is a proud, beautiful and lively city with a vibrant art scene, excellent museums and fine restaurants.<br/><br/>Next, make your way through the Sacred Valley. This winding and fertile valley between Pisac and Ollantaytambo was at the spiritual and commercial heart of the Inca empire. There are numerous ways to explore this region whether by taking it in on foot or visiting the people who have called this area home for centuries.<br/><br/>At last you will reach the crown jewel of the Inca Empire, Machu Picchu. Aside from a few llamas grazing the grassy terraces, and a viscacha (a rabbit-like rodent) or two snuggling in the empty window holes, the ruins are unadorned and devoid of any living presence (other than humans of course, all the relics found there are displayed in a museum in Cuzco). Arrive there in the early morning, and you’ll see how the morning cloud gradually disperses into wisps, revealing the buildings and terracing layer by layer.<br/><br/>When you're time delving into Peru's past concludes you will switch gears and begin making your way towards the wildlife Eden that is the Galapagos. The Galapagos Islands' reputation as one of the world's most magnificent nature and wildlife experiences is wholly justified. You will explore the archipelago on board a small ship cruise, taking trips out to various islands and being guided by an expert naturalist guide. We can discuss the islands to visit in more detail when we work on your itinerary. Whichever you choose, you won’t be short of flora and fauna, highlights including marine iguanas, the Galapagos tortoise, frigatebirds and maybe even whales and dolphins.",

Your tour leader will take care of all the logistics, with specialist guides joining you along the way to share the secrets of Peru and Ecuador’s most impressive cultural and natural highlights.<br/><br/>Internal flights ensure you cover more ground in less time, as you are whisked down to Cuzco from Lima, to start your trip at the heart of the Inca Empire. Here, immaculately crafted stone walls stand side by side with baroque colonial churches and contemporary bars and cafes – a wonderful insight into ancient and modern Andean culture. Travel deeper into the mountains and further back in time with explorations of ruins such as Pisac and Sacsayhuamán – taking the train to Machu Picchu for the grand finale. From here you’ll venture down to Lake Titicaca, ringed by snowy Andean peaks, and where you can take a tour to the floating Uros Islands, woven from reeds.<br/><br/>The next set of islands have somewhat more solid foundations: the volcanic Galapagos, reached via a flight from Lima via Guayaquil in Ecuador. You’ll have five days to explore this fascinating archipelago while living onboard a comfortable motor yacht with en suite cabins.

The drive passes through or close to several of the villages and temple fortresses which pepper the valley. The Pisac complex, set high above and visible from the eponymous colonial village you will visit, is built on terraces carved into the steep hillsides. The engineering and preservation are unrivalled. From the flat valley floor this intricate hillside rises up like a green staircase to the heavens. Continue along this picturesque, patchwork valley to the temple of Ollantaytambo. The snow-frosted Andean cordillera forms a stunning backdrop. Ollantaytambo, sitting strategically at the gateway to the Amazon basin, was never captured by the Spanish conquistadors, but the inhabitants decided that the settlement was too vulnerable and would eventually fail, and so they abandoned it. The fortress, the colonial grid plan and the Inca foundations are still intact and there are wonderful views down over the sloping hillsides and into the fertile valley. Spend the night in the tranquil valley."

As the river Urubamba enters its narrow gorge between thickly-forested granite hills, there is room only for a single track, which hugs the right bank and passes through hamlets that are no more than a collection of shacks beside the railway. Close to the foot of the mountain on a saddle of which the citadel was built is the bustling village of Machu Picchu (formerly known as Aguas Calientes), dedicated to serving the many visitors with artisan markets, bars and restaurants. The majestic ruined city, reclaimed from tropical cloud forest, is reached by minibus up a sinuous road, or on foot up a near vertical rocky path. The American explorer Hiram Bingham discovered it in 1911, by which time it was completely buried beneath jungle vegetation. It is perhaps the ruins’ location, on a ridge spur amid forested peaks and above a roaring river canyon, that most ignites the imagination. You will have a guided tour of the ruins. Fancy hiking some of the Inca Trail without interrupting your tour?

After reaching the highest point of the journey, the bus crosses the altiplano, a large, windswept plain punctuated by occasional market towns, where bowler-hatted women tend their herds of llamas and alpacas. The vast, indigo Lake Titicaca – almost an inland sea – sits on the Peruvian-Bolivian border, and the fish-laden waters and surrounding fertile soil are the lifeblood of the subsistence farming communities clustered in scores of adobe villages along the water’s edge.

During severe storms, the islands may break up into smaller islets. Once devoted to fishing, the inhabitants now earn their living mainly through selling handicrafts to tourists and, while this is a unique experience, it has the air of a living museum. In the afternoon, there’s a guided excursion to the Chullpas at Sillustani, towering stone tombs said to be the burial site of the ancient Hatun Colla chiefs.

Ecuador’s largest city is situated on the banks of the Río Guayas, and has gone through something of a transition in the last few years. The expanse of waterfront has been made into an outdoor architectural showpiece, and restoration work has taken place along the city’s main thoroughfare and in the historical neighbourhood of Las Peñas. A city tour will take you from the frenetic open-air market at La Bahia, and past the colonial naval shipyard to the Malecón (the waterfront promenade), Guayaquil’s crowning jewel. Stroll past tropical gardens, bustling markets and cafés, and head to Santa Ana Hill and Las Peñas, a district of brightly-coloured wooden houses and ramshackle streets dating back to the 16th century. The local guide will accompany you to dinner (not included) before dropping you back at the hotel."

        "description": "Transfer to the airport for your flight to the Galápagos Islands (2 hrs) where you will embark on the motor yacht for your 5 day cruise around the archipelago. Once you’ve paid your national park entrance fee, your naturalist guide will be waiting to take you to the quayside. The Galápagos Islands emerged in the Pacific Ocean six million years ago following a spate of volcanic activity and, isolated from the continental mainland, have become home to unique animal and plant species. The islands were the inspiration for Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution, which formed the basis for his revolutionary book ‘The Origin of the Species’, published in 1859. Without fear of humans, they are sufficiently trusting to allow you to approach them and observe them up close. Although geologically constantly on the move, these islands remain suspended in time, with a wealth of rare fauna and flora all thriving there. For many, the fascinating and unique wildlife and natural beauty of the islands are matched by the thrill of being at sea. Find a spot on deck as you make your way through the ocean, often trailed by flocks of birds and playful dolphins. The boats are relatively small, creating an informal atmosphere. The service is of high quality; the crew are attentive and the food delicious. Cabins with en suite facilities are compact but comfortable for your 4 nights on board. There is a common bar/lounge area as well as a sun deck. Beach towels are provided, and basic snorkelling equipment is available and wetsuits can be hired."

There are normally two landings a day to seek out the different wildlife that inhabits the islands. Below is a summary of the animals and birds that can be found on each of the islands that you visit on this journey. There will also be the opportunity to snorkel both from the islands and the boat itself, and 2 kayaks are also available for use by passengers. Bartolomé Island is a small, uninhabited islet in the Galápagos, known for its striking volcanic landscape and the iconic Pinnacle Rock. Visitors enjoy panoramic views, encounters with penguins and sea lions, and excellent snorkelling in clear, wildlife-rich waters. North Seymour Island is a flat, rocky island in the Galápagos, known for its abundant wildlife and vibrant bird colonies. Visitors can observe blue-footed boobies, frigatebirds, and land iguanas up close, along with sea lions and marine iguanas along the coast. Mosquera Islet is a small, sandy islet located between Baltra and North Seymour in the Galápagos Islands. It’s a great spot to observe sea lions, shorebirds, and occasional lava gulls. Genovesa Island is a remote and wildlife-rich destination in the northern Galápagos. Formed from a volcanic caldera, it features dramatic cliffs, a sunken crater bay, and two main visitor sites—Prince Philip’s Steps and Darwin Bay. The island is a haven for birdwatchers, with large colonies of red-footed boobies, Nazca boobies, frigatebirds, and storm petrels. South Plaza Island is a small but ecologically rich islet off the eastern coast of Santa Cruz in the Galápagos. It’s home to large colonies of land iguanas, sea lions, and nesting swallow-tailed gulls. Santa Fe Island is one of the oldest islands in the Galápagos, known for its scenic bay, turquoise waters, and unique wildlife. It’s home to the Santa Fe land iguana, found nowhere else. Also visit the David Rodriguez Tortoise Centre in San Cristobal at the end of your trip. For 2027 the islands visited will remain largely the same but please speak to one of our travel consultants for details."

    "generalInfo": "If you’re going to see South America, why not see multiple countries? Neighbours Peru and Ecuador present an Andean feast of culture and landscapes, and you can spend some time on the Galapagos Islands afterwards. <br/><br/>This trip is so adventurous, it takes you into the Andes twice – once in search of Machu Picchu, and again for trekking around Cotopaxi or Otavalo. In these dramatic landscapes – cloud forests, high mountain, lush valleys, you’ll find plenty of opportunities for fun activities – such as mountain biking, horse riding, trekking and ziplining.  <br/><br/>After arriving in Lima, Peru you go straight into the Amazon for three days in a jungle lodge, from which you can venture out on foot and by canoe, in search of wildlife. From here you transfer to the Sacred Valley where you’ll spend a day with the Misminay Community, learning about their traditional crafts and practices, before perhaps a spot of mountain biking in the surrounding mountains. You can’t visit the Sacred Valley without seeing Machu Picchu, and you’ll get a day exploring – the ruins of this Inca city have one of the most stunning settings in the world. After a day in Cusco, it’s time to cross over to Ecuador.<br/><br/>Your introduction to Ecuador starts with its capital, Quito, but before long you’re off out in nature again, this time in the Mindo cloud forests. Ecuador also has its fair share of the Andes, and so you can decide whether you want to trek near Cotopaxi, the snow-capped volcano, or visit the town of Otovalo in the mountains, a place where the main draw is the market, which is full of beautiful crafts made by the Otovalo people. <br/><br/>From mainland Ecuador it’s a short flight to the Galapagos Islands. Famous for their amazing nature encounters, these islands can be explored in many ways, depending on your interest – whether by cruise, island hopping or beach hotel, you’ll be able to experience unforgettable wildlife in near-pristine settings. <br/><br/>This holiday focuses on connecting you to the communities that you visit – whether spending a day with Indigenous Peoples in the Sacred Valley, or spending time among craftspeople in Otovalo, this trip focuses your money directly into local areas, where it will protect the land and traditions – hopefully for many visits to come. <br/>",

There are no activities planned today, so you're free to arrive in Cusco at any time. If you'd like an airport transfer today, you'll need to arrive into Alejandro Velasco Astete International Airport (CUZ), which is around a 15-minute drive from our hotel. If you miss the welcome meeting, our tour leader will inform you of any essential information as soon as you catch up.

Navigating the narrow streets of the old city, we reach the aqueduct of Sapantiana, a hidden engineering marvel only known by locals. This aqueduct directs us to arty San Blas, where coffee shops converge with traditional artisan's workshops, we explore the cobbled calles, venturing inside the studios to marvel at the local craftsmanship. Entering the main Plaza de Armas of Cusco, the focal point of the city, we're welcomed by the baristas of Three Monkeys Coffee who serve us the finest Peruvian beans. Revived, we'll continue walking, gazing upon the Qoricancha complex, once the Inca's most sacred site dedicated to the Sun God. Our final destination is Mercado de Wanchaq, a truly local affair jammed with rows of colourful stalls and filled with the aromas of seasonal fruit. Slurping freshly pressed juice we witness the sellers hawking their wares before returning to the hotel. The walking tour covers approximately 4 kilometres/2.5 miles, expected to take around four to five hours.

After a visit to the terraces, we'll drive to nearby Maras - this small, colonial town has a stunning location encircled by the Andean mountains, and we'll have a lunch stop here. Before we continue our drive to Ollantaytambo, we'll take a panoramic view of the Maras salt pans. This enormous collection of dramatic terraces is a shock of white in the valley.

Temples, stairways, palaces and gabled stone dwellings are scattered everywhere, testifying to the energy and ingenuity of the builders. Built in the mid-15th century by Pachacuti, the city was thought to have been a major agricultural centre for the Incan Empire and its inaccessibility seems to have preserved it from the looters of the intervening years, resulting in the remarkably well-preserved ruins that we see today.

Of the extraordinary animals to be found in the Galapagos, many are reptiles, such as the giant tortoise, land iguana and three species of non-poisonous snakes. There are also several species of turtle, which come ashore to mate. Up to three-quarters of a million seabirds flock to the islands, including a third of the world's blue-footed boobies, frigate birds, pelicans, cormorants, albatross and petrels. Of all the animals in this unique landscape, perhaps the most out-of-place is the penguin. Only 35 centimetres tall, the Galapagos Penguin can be seen swimming among tropical mangroves. Offshore it is common to see dolphins, sea lions and fur seals playing in the water. The Galapagos National Park charges a visitor fee, payable on arrival, which funds park maintenance and supervision in the Galapagos, as well as ecological study, conservation and infrastructure development in Ecuador's other national parks. Entry fees and the funds they generate for the national park system are among the measures taken by the Ecuadorian government to protect its natural heritage. Today we fly to the island of Santa Cruz, the second-largest island in the Galapagos. It also boasts the most varied of the islands' vegetation zones. We visit 'Los Gemelos', two volcanic depressions that give us a deeper understanding of the formation of the islands, as well as passing through the evergreen highlands, where we will have the chance to see the iconic giant tortoises.

Then go off the beaten path and discover the sights, sounds, and smells of Ecuador´s capital on a tour that takes you to visit to a traditional food market. To end our visit in the old town, it is time for our chocolate experience! Ecuador’s unique equatorial climate provides the perfect environment for growing the world’s finest cocoa - Cacao Arriba. Our chocolate experience starts with the history of cocoa in Ecuador, followed by a chocolate tasting. After your tour of Quito, make the 45 minute journey northwest to the equatorial line, where we will walk the rim of the extinct Pululahua volcanic crater. After lunch, visit the “Intiñan Museum” located right on the Equator. Here you will have the chance to plant your feet in two hemispheres at the same time!

Check in to your cabin then check out the seascape from the upper deck, where 360 degrees of archipelago views reveal snippets of old volcanic islands. With a capacity of just 20, this yacht ensures discreet personal service and spacious facilities. A whole world of evolutionary wildlife waits, and it starts at Lobos Island, which translates to Sea Lion Island. Hundreds of the jolly characters frolic on the rocks and many waddle over to say a curious hello. Some grunt and huff, others bask serenely in the sun, and a couple of gargantuan males chase each other around the sand. Lobos Island is a perfect introduction to the intimacy of the Galapagos experience. Yours is the only group on the islet, meaning near-exclusive access to the sea lion antics. Get close. Get even closer. You're not watching it all from a distant platform; you're standing just a few meters away from their playful waddling. You're close enough to touch. But this isn't a zoo. So resist the urge and allow the million years of evolution to continue unadulterated. From Lobos, you cruise to Kicker Rock, a famed site for hammerhead sharks and a tropical underwater world. Here you snorkel beneath the surface and enjoy the very rare opportunity to see pelagic giants so close to shore. Look across and there's a sea turtle. Look down and there are the evocative silhouettes of a hammerhead school."

The blue-footed variety is the most elegant, with snippets of azure feathers and a bright beak complimenting their feet. Red-footed boobies are the most striking, their seductive colors mingling across the rocks. Then there are Nazca boobies; loud, bossy, and resplendently white. This is one of the world's rarest bird sites, and you walk just meters from the breeding ground. After lunch and a relaxing few hours back on the yacht, the afternoon is spent at the archipelago's finest beach: Cerro Brujo. Egrets, great blue herons, and sea lions share the white sand, giving plenty of space to enjoy if you want to slumber on the beach. Or take a dip out into the turquoise, and savor the marine world."

Each excursion brings something different on this all-inclusive tour. Today you're at Post Office Bay, discovering the tales of early whalers and remote postal systems. Cruise through a series of channels dotted with seabirds and spend the afternoon at the salt-water lagoon of Punta Cormorant. Flamingos bring their shocking pink to a green-olivine beach while extinct volcanoes peak above the water line.

At times it's a chaotic hub of activity, with such diverse predators feasting at a remote site only accessible by boat. Like each day on this all-inclusive cruise, you enjoy a leisurely breakfast on the yacht before a fully-guided morning excursion. The heat of the day means downtime in the itinerary, a chance to relax on the yacht. Enjoy your three-course lunch, and look out for migratory whales. Now the afternoon excursion takes you to shades of surreal color on Bartolome Island. A collage of reds welcomes you to this extinct volcano, blurring into orange, yellow, and even green leftovers from a million years of evolution. A trail of stairs leads you to the island's summit and the most famous of Galapagos photos. In one frame there are the swirling reds of the island, the white of the beach, the blue of the ocean, and the protruding black of Pinnacle Rock. Then to provide a focal point, you spot a Galapagos penguin jumping off the cliffs. After the hike, you have a couple of hours to enjoy the beach, snorkel with the penguins, and admire the barren beauty of this remote island."

The yacht traveled through the night to Genovesa, the northernmost of the islands that visitors are allowed to walk on. Resounding cries guide you onto the cliffs, some two million birds squawking from above as they battle for space on the crowded breeding ground. There are red-footed boobies, swallow-tailed gulls, storm petrels, short-eared lava owls, and Galapagos doves. Then the bizarre throat-sacks of magnificent frigates grab your attention; thousands of these males inflate their crimson chests and stand with pride, ever hopeful of impressing the females that soar overhead. But with so many birds, you need to be extravagantly bright to stand out. Spend today at two distinct sites on Genovesa, immersed in this sublime show of colorful chaos. The numbers are staggering, and it still doesn't seem real when you have stood amongst it all."

Iconic calderas emerge from the shadows as the morning takes hold. While a Galapagos cruise offers continual outdoor adventure, remember that it's also a serene tour across uninhabited Pacific islands. This morning's excursion takes you to Espumilla Beach, where marine iguanas and sally-lightfoot crabs compete along the rocks and hundreds of seabirds perch above a beach of red sand. Few places are as exquisitely extraordinary, the endemic reptiles sneezing out salt and a flurry of wings flying past the sand. Visiting James Bay in the afternoon, you see more curious creatures, including rare lava lizards that extend their tongue to catch flies that hover around sea lions. Both today's landing sites offer snorkeling and it will only be you and the other 19 passengers on the boat that have access to this endemic wonder."

Magnificent frigates are abundant on North Seymour, their red chests vibrantly out on display just meters from your camera. Blue-footed boobies hop around to attract mates, huge land iguanas sit curiously and patiently, while the grunts of sea lions echo across the rugged walking trail. Then in the afternoon, the reptiles get even bigger as you explore the highlands of Santa Cruz. Grazing upon the grass are 500-pound giant tortoises, elegantly plodding around with the odd blade of grass hanging from their mouths. Vermillion flycatchers and Darwin's finches flutter above their shells while the tweets of mockingbirds grace the rim of two volcanic sinkholes. Each Galapagos region is different and you need at least ten days to discover the breadth of the archipelago. In the north and the east, you've explored dramatic islands, home to prolific numbers of specific species. Central islands like North Seymour and Santa Cruz are more varied, showcasing the diversity on display. But that doesn't mean any lack of abundance. There are over 5,000 giant tortoises grazing in the highlands, plus thousands of boobies and frigates on the remote cliffs of North Seymour. Scale blends into intimacy, as you get close, almost-impossibly close. On these remote windswept islands, you can hear the gentle feet of blue-footed boobies as they hop in search of a mate."

They stand over the Pacific, iconic towers to be glimpsed whenever you turn your head away from the sea lions. Today you hike to the rim of Sierra Negra Volcano, the world's second largest caldera and a hissing spitting pit of fire that has regularly erupted over the years. It's an evocative interpretation of volcanic power, fulfilling all the reveries associated with hiking around an active rim. From Sierra Negra, the descending trail takes you through the sublime lava flows of Volcan Chico; wisps and tubes tumble down the slopes, and there's a real sense of the earth's eruptive power. But keep walking. Within the crater's shadow, you find the gracious shells of giant tortoises, the gentle creatures grazing within eyeshot of the two craters.

Your final all-inclusive day takes you along the western fringes of Isabela Island in a small boat. Galapagos penguins dot the cliffs, and then they clump together in larger groups, waddling and watching as you slowly cruise past. Stop beside the cliffs and you admire the interaction. Two penguins are mating, a few others are diving into the blue, while many curiously wobble on the edge of the lava flows. After a picnic lunch, you continue to Los Tuneles, a surreal lava arch that stands isolated in the Pacific. Sea lions have made the arch their home while dozens of pelagic fish can be seen just beneath the water's surface. Snorkel here and you encounter the giants of this environment, including reef sharks, manta rays, and the elegant flapping of sea turtles. Sea lions are also incredibly entertaining when you're in the water, especially if you indulge them with a somersault or two.

Snow-capped peaks rise above you while the valley below twists and turns towards volcanic cones. With so much adventure to come, today is about lounging around and settling into the country.

        "description": "Visiting the Amazon always provides a memorable journey. Leave Quito and first drive through the Avenue of the Volcanoes, the series of iconic cones standing above ancient haciendas and tiny villages. Now Banos in the Amazonian lowlands, its streets surrounded by slithers of cloud forest and lush shades of green. Then Shell (named after the oil company), where you take a light aircraft above the trees. The Amazon extends in every direction, thick stretches of forest that now rescind as you land in Quehueri'ono. Huaorani locals meet you at the landing strip, and you head downstream in a dugout canoe taking you deeper into the jungle, hundreds of miles away from any road. Strange birds call from the nearby trees: a kiskadee, a yellow-rumped caciques, another endemic flutter of wings that grabs your attention. Ecuador is home to over 1600 different bird species and today's are just the start as you slowly meander down the Shiripuno River, thick jungle overhanging the water and mysterious calls echoing across the landscape. Arrive at your intimate accommodations and an indigenous guide takes you on a hike through the nearby forest, allowing you to learn about the basics of the environment and Huaorani culture. Then check into your room and take a moment to enjoy the view, a hundred shades of green flooding the area in memorable color. Electricity is provided by solar and the lodge blends into the environment by using local materials."

You'll learn how to use a blowgun, work a machete, forage for fruit, build a jungle shelter, and which insects can be on the dinner menu. For many centuries, these people have lived hand in hand with their environment, picking only what they need from the forest's bounty. Continue walking to a viewpoint with a serene view of the canopy before having lunch in a local community, with a bowl of chucula (a sweet banana based drink) to wash it down. Returning to the lodge is via canoe, another great chance to admire the birds and wildlife that occupy this area."

Like always, you move via a mixture of hiking and dugout canoe, traveling the same trails as the Huaorani. After lunch, paddle downstream to Cocha Pequena, a lake that's filled with iconic species like anacondas and caimans. Endemic birds and squirrel monkeys shout from above while many exotic creatures arrive to feast on the lake's mineral-rich clay. Stopping at a saltlick on the return to the lodge is also a great opportunity to see normally nocturnal animals, including owls, frogs, kinkajous, and strange insects."

Spend the day exploring the forest with local guides, learning about the history and myths that make up so much of local culture. Stories and smiles are shared as you hang out with people who only became known to the wider world in the 1950's. Tonight you don't return to the lodge but continue to another Huaorani village, Nenquepare, where the night is spent in a comfortable camp.

In the afternoon, there's a tinge of shock as the trees give away, and the ugly Auca Road springs up. Rainforest and deforestation are sharply contrasted as your guides provide 40 years of history lessons. That's how long oil companies have been “exploring” Huaorani territory and the day provides a fascinating illustration of how the Amazon is threatened.

Your hotel is part of this heritage, a 16th century building that's been redeveloped to showcase the opulence of yesteryear. A local guide shows you the city on a walking tour; marvel at churches laced in gold leaf, admire palaces that overlook grand plazas, stand beneath Moorish domes, and explore churches that blend a succession of styles.

        "description": "The Amazon is an ancient land, some 50 million years of natural history underpinning its thick interior. By contrast, the Galapagos is a baby, just four million years of age and still erupting with volcanic menace. These are not lush islands filled with food. They're stark and sometimes desolate, home to only the most specialist of flora and fauna. After flying to the Galapagos, a drive across Santa Cruz Island gives you an idea of this specialism. Forests of daisies cover the grass, the plants rising almost five meters in height. Giant tortoises also occupy the grass, some of the males weighing over 550 lbs. They meander across the green, slowly eating their way across the island. But in harsher times, they could go 12 months without food or water. You spend the afternoon in the company of these special tortoises before boarding your small luxury yacht. Spacious ensuite cabins occupy the second deck while a large lounge bar area and restaurant fill most of the lower deck. Three meals a day are included, and the chef regularly concocts some nibbles and drinks whenever you return from excursions. The upper deck is ideal for lazing away afternoons, either in the jacuzzi or one of the sun loungers. There's always an exceptional view from here, whether it's whales in the Pacific Ocean, a starry night sky, or cliffs covered with endemic birds. After checking into your cabin, enjoy a welcome cocktail with the crew then dinner on board. Consider reading other travelers' Galapagos cruise reviews and see for yourself why they repeatedly return to Zicasso for premier Galapagos cruise experiences."

After a morning hike, you can choose to snorkel or tour the bay in a glass-bottom boat, with reef sharks and rays among the characters inhabiting the pristine reefs. After lunch, you explore Punta Cormorant, a tiny islet that offers the best snorkeling on any of the Southern Galapagos Islands. Turtles appear from the deep abyss, rays lie camouflaged in the sand, and a rainbow of colorful fish slowly feast on the coral. You can also choose to explore by glass-bottom boat."

A huge harem of sea lions is already basking in the sun, the females twisting their necks to inspect your arrival. One humongous male rules with an aggressive disposition, chasing off other males that come to sneak a glimpse at his women. Espanola is the oldest of the Galapagos Islands, and its bountiful cliffs provide a haven for a myriad of remarkable bird species. Blue-footed boobies nest, albatrosses display their mammoth wings, and hawks soar above Darwin's finches. And like everything Galapagos, you enjoy the theater at astonishing proximity. Stand beside fluffy baby boobies, watch hawks dive onto endemic marine iguanas, and return the gaze of an inquisitive sea lion. You'll spend the morning with a land excursion on the island at Punta Suarez, before enjoying a sumptuous buffet lunch on board. Land at the Gardener Bay beach in the afternoon and spend your hours relaxing with the sea lions or snorkeling from the shore. You can also kayak around the bay or take a dinghy ride, both exceptional opportunities to spot both marine and bird life.

The distinctive feet of red-footed boobies gently guard precious eggs. Nazca boobies provide the contrast, their color provided by impressive chest feathers. Not to be outdone, magnificent frigate birds posture for dramatic effect, presenting their fiery red chests to the swooping females. Swallow-tailed gulls and storm petrels continue the journey through unique birds, both species also unflustered by your arrival. The afternoon is spent on another outstanding coral-sand beach. Pelicans, marine iguanas, and coastal birds all surround the beach, keeping you company as you enjoy the sun. But the major attraction is the chance to snorkel from the shore.

Early reptiles arrived here riding the trunks of felled trees while marine life descended into the underwater bounty. The next day, when you fly to Galapagos from Quito and you will immediately feel this ancient volcanic history where the landscape is laced with flora that comes straight from the surreal. You cross Santa Cruz by road, past strange geological sinkholes, and endemic daisies that rise five meters high. After lunch, the domed shells of tortoises will occupy the afternoon. When you step gently on the grass, their elongated necks maintain an inquisitive stance. But step too hard and their heads will disappear into shells. Hundreds of them slowly mow the grass, and there's lots of opportunity for photos with the largest of all tortoise species. Later in the afternoon, you will continue to Puerto Ayora and board your classic Galapagos yacht. Enjoy a welcome drink in the lounge bar, check into your spacious cabin, and then watch the sun go down from the open, upper lounge. With a capacity of 40 guests, the yacht is large enough to provide a comfortable journey between islands as well as offer a choice of activities at each island visited.

An hour later, you admire them on land, a whole harem of blubbery comedy flopping around the beach. Camouflaged and silent, the Santa Fe land iguana will be your next unusual sight. The large lizards bask beneath prickly-pear cactuses as they cover the trail. To complete your exploration of Santa Fe, you can choose to either snorkel through the bay or tour it with a glass-bottomed boat. Expect lots of sea lions regardless of your choice, along with a tropical menagerie of fish. Early afternoons onboard are a chance to relax and doze off on the deck. Blue ocean merges with blue sky as you cruise through the archipelago. Enormous seabirds randomly grace the journey and there will always be a chance to spot whales or dolphins in the deep ocean waters. The afternoon's visit will be to South Plaza Island, where scarlet succulents juxtapose with yellow-gray land iguanas and more playful sea lion colonies.

Nazca boobies perform mating dances just meters from the trail while you must be careful not to step on any marine iguanas. There are very few predators on the Galapagos Islands, so these extremely rare birds are not fearful. They don't fly from view and you will appreciate them and their nesting sights from just six feet away. After the land excursion, you will explore the water, again choosing from snorkeling or a glass-bottom boat tour. The afternoon provides a similar marine opportunity at the Las Bachas site on Santa Cruz Island. White-tipped reef sharks and turtles can be spotted at both sights, and you'll never tire of swimming with sea lions.

Accompanying the bizarre landscapes is an equally strange character, the tiny Galapagos penguin. Mating on lava cliffs and jumping from eroded overhangs, these diminutive characters are yet another endemic sight on your cruise. Snorkeling is highly recommended here, as reef sharks and rays accompany the penguins in the water. Across the water, your afternoon excursion will be Sullivan Bay on James Island, where each meter of the landscape is marked by ethereal volcanic carvings. Virtually nothing grows here, but you can spot how the lava is gradually eroding into soil that will host the next generation of endemic species, many centuries from now.

The Plaza de Armas emanates an aroma of fresh Peruvian coffee that mixes with the damp, antique stones of the bubbling fountain. Your time to explore Cusco will come, however today you will venture outside of Cusco’s urban center, past the large, structured monoliths of Fort of Sacsayhuaman, and into the fertile green of the Sacred Valley. There are many villages and historical sights within the Sacred Valley, which are often one and the same. Your visit to Moray goes beyond the Andean colors of the clothing and the quintessential structure of their town, and into the archaeological complex created by a system of grand, overlapping terraced platforms. The circular tiers look like a large amphitheater in the shape of a giant bowl, rather than a sophisticated agricultural structure. The weather shifts from cool to warm as you descend the terraces, each tier containing its own microclimate. The grass is soft beneath your feet. The morning dew has lifted from the earth. The beauty of the Sacred Valley continues with a visit to the Maras saltpans. The saltpans resemble varied sized bowls built into and terraced up the hillside. As you reach closer to the pans you realize how great the hillside and the terraces are. The pans are fed from a natural spring filled with saltwater. The saltpans remind you of Miraflores and the salty, sweet scent of the ocean. The water eventually evaporates from the pans due to the salt content and the arid mountain air, leaving the salt naturally in place. The saltwater lingers in the air. The abundant hillsides of the valley shimmer beyond the terraces. Your grand journey through Peru and Ecuador is still just beginning."

        "description": "The sun radiates over the morning dew that stretches along the grass of the valley. Venture out into the wondrous history of the valley to see the sensational Ollantaytambo. The village contains some of the oldest continuously occupied buildings in South American, where stone doorways are layered with trapezoidal archways to help keep the structure cool in the summer and warm in the winter. The ruins of Ollantaytambo tower over the village along the mountainside, where the Incas kept their stronghold of resistance over Spanish colonization. The scent of crisp sugar spills onto the cobblestone streets as you make your way to the tiered ruins. The terraces run along a vast stretch of the mountainside divided by a single set of stairs. From the bottom, the terraced mountain looks as though it could have been a temple itself. At the top of the structure, you can see the village and the valley below along with the smooth stone remnants of the temple. Arrive in Pisac where the Incan ruins are divided into four separate areas along the hillsides. The gentle hike to the temple ruins sit along the citadel giving a panoramic view of the surrounding valley. Walk through the large stones that have grown coarse with time. The mountains curve and cut through the view while the brick remains of Inti Wantana continues to shine red in the afternoon. One of the most famous aspects of Pisac is the market, where the colors of the Andes explode within stalls and along the walkways. Varieties of corn, from red, to yellow, to blue, share space with vibrant sweet potatoes and squash. Textiles, from blankets to purses, brighten the day with patterns and designs. The Market is vibrant, filled with Andean life, from the colors to the perfume of the vegetables, to the scent of fried bread, and the tang of rotisserie chicken. The grandeur of Peru ranges from its opulent past to its colorful present."

Roll along the rushing waters of the Urubamba River as it carves through the Sacred Valley slowly digging a deeper gorge. Arrive at the footsteps of the entrance to the Lost City where you find stone steps winding up the citadel. Your fingers graze the rocky surface as you climb the stairs, the stone rough against your skin. The stairs undulate between steep and shallow, finally giving way to flat land where you find you have made it to the top of the plateau and with it the view of the rising Lost City of Machu Picchu. The stone facades rise above the terraces as the blue sky opens up above you. The Temple of the Three Windows sits at the highest point, the stairs looking almost too steep to climb until you notice a different set next to the tiers that take you to the top of the city. Temple of the Three Windows sits close to the uppermost point of the city, with its three windows large and square from inside, but small and rectangular from the outside. The position of the windows is meant to capture the sun at the moment it rises. The clouds drift through the city and the wonders of the day recede back into your memory as you make your way out of Machu Picchu for the night."

Once at the top of the Sun Gate you can look down on the city of Machu Picchu and realize that this is the view you from which you know the city, the structures shining in the morning light with Huayna Picchu standing tall against the sky in the background. It is a perfect postcard of Machu Picchu of your image of the Lost City. The remaining stone pillars of the temple frame the city for you, with slabs set around the base of the temple meant for seating.

The scent of fresh empanadas floats through the streets as you venture to see the beautiful colonial homes that decorate La Ronda or Juan de Dios Morales. Built out of adobe and around an enclosed patio, the houses are adorned with traditional balconies. The city is boisterous as the night rolls in, the colonial homes gilded in the evening light.

The Mitad del Mundo means “The Equator,” and is a short ride outside of Quito. A large monument, along with a marking, is meant to indicate the exact location of the equator as it runs through Ecuador. The monument is a tall, rectangular structure that towers over the flatland, adorned with a ball resting at its peak. However, the true center of the world is within the Museo Inti Nan. A sign within the museum indicates when you are standing at the true center of the earth. The air in the museum is cool and inviting. The musk of knowledge and history wraps around the room. You can bear witness to the Corollas effect and watch a guide pour water over a globe; the water will run straight over the equator. The shock and awe come when the liquid begins to rotate clockwise over the south of the equator and anti-clockwise over the north of the equator, conflicting with its own spin. Various other exhibits are on display within the equatorial museum that fill the halls with laughter, including activities such as balancing an egg on the head of a nail and a demonstration of how difficult it can be to walk a straight line while situated along the center of the earth. Return to Quito and see the wonderful architecture and life of Old Town. The streets are perfumed with cinnamon and sugar. The church bells from the cathedral ring through the square. The central plaza sits at the heart of the neighborhood bordered by the Government Palace. The Palace is an iridescent white and stretches through the square with tinged columns and high arches.

Make your way to the airport where you will venture across the waters off of the coast of Ecuador and arrive in the stunning Galapagos Islands. You will board your boat in the mid-afternoon and ready yourself for a three-night cruise around the islands, visiting the unique beauty and sensational diversity of each island. Arrive at the island of Santa Cruz, a dormant volcano with the second-largest landmass and the largest population of people of any of the Galapagos, mostly situated in Puerto Ayora. The island is around 380 square miles and has twin holes within its center formed by a collapse of a magma chamber. The water sparkles a clear blue. The scent of the ocean is never far away, even within the thriving forests at the center of the island. The volcanic soil brings vibrant flowers and trees, which in turn bring the magnificent wildlife that lingers along the water’s edge. The sea laps along the beaches giving a rhythmic lull to the day. Along the beach, you will visit the Tortoise Reserve within the village of Santa Rosa. The reptiles are separated like small boulders within the plush grass of the highlands. If you get too close the gentle sound of the breeze will be replaced by an awkward hiss. The hiss expels excess air giving the tortoise space to pull in their legs to protect themselves from perceived threats. Along the expanse of the island, you will discover the wonders of the lava caves that dig into the island’s terrain, the edges rough and craggy. The scent of the volcano is long gone from the island and replaced with damp earth and the ocean. The topography looks like a valley on the moon, the foliage replaced by rugged stones, but the exploration is sensational as you discover clear water riding against a stoic rock that once was raging magma."

Disembark along the shore of San Cristobal to experience Frigatebird Hill. The two-mile lava trail stretches around Darwin Bay where Great Frigatebirds glide over the water. Their wingspan opens into the air like a bat while their protruding chest colors their bodies with white or bright red plumage. The bay is perfumed with the minty scent of dry acacia trees and Galapagos cotton. Out along the calm blue water of the bay, you can see the tall monolith of Kicker Rock sticking out of the water. Kicker Rock slopes into the sky from the surface of the water and changes colors with the shifting sun. The monolith teems with bird-life as you have the ability to kick beneath the glassy sea and snorkel or scuba dive to see the life beneath the waves. The water is calm and warm around you. The birds are as lively in the sky as the fish are active in the ocean. Two towers of the rock rise from the ocean floor as the site of an old volcanic eruption eroded by thousands of years of waves and wind enthrall you. Hammerhead sharks drift around the monoliths in swift calculated motion as the world beneath the waves become rainbow-colored with the expansive shades of tropical fish. The blue-footed booby nests at the nearby Island of Lobos, give you the ability to see the birds that inspired Darwin’s theories.

You can see the sand that sits at the bottom of the sea as you wade deeper in. Within the trees, you hear the rustling of turtles. Venture out onto the boat with the cool wind rushing through your hair. The sun kisses your cheeks as you arrive at La Loberia, where sea lions sunbathe on the sand. The vibrant blue water crashes against the beach giving a pulsating life to the area, a change from the serenity of Playa Mansa. The sea lions bark and purr against the whitewater of the rushing waves. Surfers cut sharply along the crashing breaks. The water sprays into the air, gently but fully. Take a grand cruise through the Canal de Amor and come to the wondrous Playa de Los Perros. The canal is lined with sharp and jagged rocks jutting above the water. Within the warm green glow of the water you can watch reef sharks swim along the sandy bottom. You can also find the unique marine iguanas, found only in the Galapagos. They nap on the warmth of lava rocks, their black and gray skin helping them soak up the sun. Watch as they wade into the water, able to dive over 30 feet beneath the surface, using their tail like a crocodile to help propel themselves forward. The sea crashes against the rocks and one last iguana sits in the sun, the spray falling over his skin and remnants of a smile creep across his mouth."

Land at Baltra Airport and you head by yacht to North Seymour, a tiny island that epitomizes the Galapagos's birding appeal. Thousands of blue-footed boobies cover a nesting ground, none of them flustered by your presence. Males hop on slightly elevated rocks, the shade of their feet essential to the chances of finding a mate. On the walking trail, you also see blue feet guarding eggs and chicks awaiting their parents' return. Equally resplendent in a search for a mate are magnificent and great frigates. They inflate their vivid heart-shaped throat sacks and stand on rugged branches, aiming to be bigger and brighter than the competition that floods North Seymour with color. Further doses of intricate detail come from the land iguanas that dot the trail, dozens of them waiting silently for you to pass. After spending the afternoon on North Seymour, you're transferred via yacht to the southern side of Santa Cruz Island and your luxury lodge along the coast.

You spend the afternoon at Punta Pitt, another of the Galapagos's unique destinations. Only here can you admire all three booby species together.

Then come the noisy Nazca boobies, squawking and pushing their way to the finest nesting sites. Flightless chicks are tenderly cared for while colorful feet serenely guard white eggs. But when the parents fly off, the bossy larger chick pushes its sibling from the nest. It's never quiet here, the noise of birds complemented by the rumbustious shouts of bachelor sea lions, and the colorful wings accompanied by scaly marine iguanas. For bird lovers, this is an unmissable Galapagos destination, predominantly for the intimacy of the experience.

Thousands of them line the cliffs with many more soaring off across the ocean below. April to December is breeding season when the vast majority of the world's population can be found here. Beaks meet, and a cacophony of squawks accompany their flamboyant five-day mating dance. You'll see couples at different stages of this show, from those tentatively coming together to those preparing a nest with adorable tenderness. Sea lions welcome you to this wildlife spot, and you spot numerous Galapagos hawks and Galapagos doves on the walk across the island. Vibrant Espanola lava lizards wait beside the sea lions, picking off pesky insects in another of nature's displays. Then before the albatross breeding ground you walk past the nesting sites of blue-footed and Nazca boobies, the latter's aggression providing piercing cries to the scene.

Flights to the islands only leave from two cities, and this one also happens to be the first-ever UNESCO World Heritage Site. Starting in Quito inserts two days of culture and colonial architecture into a deluxe itinerary. You'll be picked up at the airport and transferred to a luxury hotel located in the old city's central square. This building was the home of one of Spain's first conquistadors, and it's been recently revamped to reflect colonial pomp and indulgence. The Presidential Palace is next door, cute cafes line the square, and there are elegant views onto the domes of Quito's old churches. The rest of the day is at leisure, and the hotel's restaurant is one of the best in the city."

This 48-capacity vessel combines the space of a larger cruise with the intimacy of a small boat. Check into your suite and then check out the views from the sundeck, where whales and dolphins are often seen accompanying the boat's journey. There's a jacuzzi for relaxing and stargazing, a superb restaurant bringing out snacks as well as meals, and an open bar where you meet with the crew for a welcome drink. After the boat gently cruises away from Baltra, you spend the afternoon at North Seymour, an island that's always alive with the antics of nesting seabirds. Magnificent frigate birds inflate their red throat-sacks in the hope of attracting a mate, pointing their vibrant crimson to the sky with proud abandon. Blue-footed boobies hop around, and you're close enough to listen to each blue step on the volcanic ground. Nazca boobies are even louder, their raucous tweets ensuring they get prime nesting space. Then there are the land iguanas that wait silently and patiently on the hiking trail. Spend a few hours exploring the island then return to the yacht where cocktails are served, and sunset colors light up the sky."

In the afternoon, you travel into the lush Galapagos highlands, where the brilliant vermilion flycatcher flutters around Scalesia trees. A little further through the hills lie two volcanic sinkholes mystically shrouded in forest, looking as if they are entrances into a strange netherworld. Take the iconic photos and continue the journey through Santa Cruz's highlights. Step onto carpets of green in the highlands and you step onto the grazing grounds of giant tortoises. Hundreds of them slowly plod around, their 550-pound frames ambling around the grass with unhurried grace. However, not all of these tortoises are peaceful. One large male tries to bite the neck of another in a bid for the lushest grass, while another huffs loudly and retreats into his shell.

Along the way, you can stop at Chucuito village to stroll around the colonial town and the Temple of Inca Uyo. While the temple is famous for the number of fertility sculptures that populate the grounds, you can find a gem of personal space at a secluded corner of Lake Titicaca. The village is close to Puno in miles but will feel like a world away when you relax in the main plaza between the two charming colonial churches."

Bishop's palaces have been elegantly converted into spaces for shops and restaurants while the central monument to independence reflects that the city remembers but also moves forward. You'll be greeted at the airport and transferred to a boutique hotel in the heart of the old city, one that's built into a remodeled 16th-century building.

Snow glistens on their distant crater peaks while lush green valleys tumble down from the slopes beneath your feet. Descend into the city where you're guided around the integral central sights. Explore a cathedral that marries the Moorish facade with the neoclassical design. Cross the courtyard of the Presidential Palace, five centuries of history etched into its curves and domes. Enter La Compania and you're blinded by gold, every square inch glistening with gold leaf in the seminal church of South America. If you've visited other colonial South American cities you might start noticing some similarities – it was Quito's school of religious art that influenced the whole continent. This is a two to three-hour city walking tour that culminates in lunch on San Francisco Square. The afternoon is at your leisure."

Return to the lodge for breakfast before heading into Mindo to see more shocks of color. Visit a butterfly farm and hold out patient fingers for some of the hundreds of butterflies to land on. Then wander through a garden of over 100 flowering orchids, both endemic and international species cultivated in a unique garden.

This is perhaps the archipelago's most impressive island for experiencing the mating and breeding of iconic sea birds. Male magnificent frigates puff up their scarlet throat sacks, expanding them into dazzling appeals for a mate. Thousands of blue-footed boobies guard white eggs just meters from the trail. Marine iguanas cover the shore while giant land iguanas sit patiently on the higher slopes. Then there's the mass dive-bombing of pelicans and the courtship dances of two booby species. It's hard to imagine a more memorable introduction to the Galapagos. After exploring the island you sail across the Itabaca Channel, then drive across Santa Cruz Island by road to the hotel. Staying in a hotel and enjoying a land-based itinerary is ideal for those who want more privacy and freedom on a tour. Guided daily excursions unveil the wildlife sites yet there's also some stunning places that can be visited locally without a guide. A short walk from the hotel brings wonderful snorkeling, sea lions, and the antics of many seabirds. Like today, some excursions are by yacht, but the distance traveled in water is limited to aid those without the best of sea legs.

Take a walk through the rocky terrain to find the Santa Fe iguana, a large prehistoric-looking reptile that's endemic to the island. Hawks often circle overhead while the world's only cactus trees rise like sentinels across the old volcanic lava. After the day exploration, you can rest on the beach before enjoying some excellent snorkeling from the boat in a calm bay that dances with the colors of the tropics.

Along the windswept cliffs of South Plaza, you're greeted by bright red sally lightfoot crabs and the squawking of swallow-tailed gulls. Wander past red-billed tropic birds and masked boobies, then watch your step because yellow land iguanas blend perfectly into the ground. It's common to find them lounging around in the middle of the walking trail. Bachelor sea lions continue today's revelation of bizarre scenes, the males barging and grunting as they test their attempts at superiority. Following the walk, you can immerse yourself underwater and snorkel from the shore at Punta Carrion. Rather than iguanas, you must look closely for the camouflage of small rays, the stealthy characters hidden on the sandy bottom. It's another easy snorkel that allows you to encounter marine life that would normally only be seen when diving."

In most places it feels like you're walking on Mars, rogue lava tubes and tunnels spilling out across the island. Of all the 13 islands, Bartolome is the one that truly reveals the volcanic undercurrent that created the archipelago. You find Galapagos penguins jumping on the red rock, tiny little characters that waddle along precarious cliffs that dive past snorkelers in the water. One second they're beside you, the next second they've darted away at a phenomenal speed. While this is the most distant of sites to the hotel, you'll first cross Santa Cruz by land to minimize the distance traveled in the yacht.

As you descend into small caves, you find groups of white-tip reef sharks clustering together, perfectly still on the bottom then darting off in multiple directions. Get closer and a series of nudibranchs shimmer around the periphery, their hypnotic colors drawing you in until a hammerhead swims past. Schools of grunts and other large fish are always spotted here as are the unusual Galapagos garden eels. Then there're manta rays and eagle rays as you float on the current.

For all the diverse wonder beneath the surface, it's hammerhead sharks that are at the center of this diving experience. Schools circle the site, often 30 or 40 hammerheads swimming together. They're not distant silhouettes; these hammerheads are inquisitive, and you'll enjoy lots of close-up encounters with these iconic characters. It's a dive experience that's difficult to replicate anywhere else on the planet. The first dive takes you cruising along the sandy bottom beside the reef with a strong current taking you across the underwater pinnacle. Then the second dive brings more intimate encounters with the hammerheads. While this is perhaps the most revered and popular dive site in the Galapagos, strict national park regulations ensure that it's never overcrowded, and other groups don't distract from the experience.

But approach these giants gently and there's something bewitching about watching them slowly march across the green. Mockingbirds and Darwin's finches tweet from elevated branches while some giant tortoises break the harmony with their slow, ponderous fights for a mate. One bites the other's shell, and the two compete at an indelibly slow pace. Return to the hotel for lunch and the afternoon is at your leisure. The small town of Puerto Ayora is within walking distance and an opportunity to see the urban side of the archipelago.

Prickly pear cactuses rise from the rugged ground, and perched patiently below are endemic Santa Fe Iguanas, waiting for days on end for a piece of fruit to finally fall.

One minute the penguins are there, but then they disappear in a flurry of black and white, off on their sporadic fishing missions. Come out of the water and a walking trail takes you to the summit of the island, with lava tunnels and tubes spidering out in all directions. Shades of red mingle on the surface, clear indicators of the island's volcanic uprising.

        "description": "Flights to the Galapagos depart early in the morning so an overnight stay in Quito is unavoidable. But this is no tedious layover. You're greeted at the airport and transferred to a hotel in a 17th-century heritage building. You're in the heart of old Quito, the first ever World Heritage site and a delightful world of ancient terraces and palaces. Spend the afternoon slowly exploring; relax at early 16th-century squares, wander through golden churches, and sip coffee or beer in the courtyards once owned by conquistadores. Quito is an elegant and gentle introduction to any vacation and more than just a stopover on route to the Galapagos."

        "description": "Fly over the archipelago and it's hard to contain the excitement. While there are many islands and islets beneath the wingtips, the overall impression is of empty ocean space. Land in San Cristobal and you're transferred directly to your liveaboard boat. This 16-passenger boat has air-conditioned cabins and a spacious deck for relaxing after your dives. Meals are served in a decorated restaurant and there's always a place to escape to if you're looking for privacy. Meet the crew and have lunch on board before your first dive. Many Galapagos dive sites are reserved for advanced divers. Strong swirling currents and 30-meter depths mean this isn't a place for beginners. The first dive is from the shore at Isla Lobos and will reach nine meters. It's a chance to check whether you're happy with the equipment and revisit any skills if it's been awhile since your last dive. The dive masters will ensure you are all caught up, and will assist in buddying you with another diver for the trip. Consider reading more about your Galapagos tour operators who strive to make every dive unique and breathtakingly amazing. Sea turtles swim past, large schools of fish pick at eclectic coral, and there's usually a first sighting of reef sharks. Return to the boat where dinner is served and you enjoy the first night of dramatic starry skies."

Cruise along a reef wall and these rays wait patiently on the ocean floor, occasionally darting away with trademark precision. Today's two dives introduce you to the huge diversity of the marine world here. Rays are joined by dozens of strange tropical fish, eels hide beneath large boulders, and there's even a few sea lions cruising the depths. You'll get first glimpses of different shark species and encounter gargantuan schools of pelagic fish. After two morning dives, you spend the afternoon on North Seymour Island, where vast colonies of blue-footed boobies and magnificent frigates seek out mates. Walk slowly and silently and you'll see the males vividly posturing, either displaying their bright feet or inflated throat sacks. Back on board you depart for the far Northern Islands, an overnight journey of around 16 hours."

        "description": "This liveaboard itinerary is centered around four days on Wolf and Darwin Islands. These two islands are the pinnacle of Galapagos diving, and it's impossible not be wowed by the abundance of huge marine creatures. Schools of hammerhead sharks are a norm, sometimes over 50 of them circling and swirling together. Galapagos sharks cruise through the reefs and large dolphin pods often grace their feeding grounds. Sea turtles are so plentiful they blend into the landscape while different ray species compete for your attention. And then there are the gigantic whale sharks swimming past to steal the limelight. You don't even need to be in the water. Dolphin pods and sea lions regularly poke their heads from the water just meters from the boat. Enjoy four dives around Wolf Island. Morning dives go deep, with hammerheads, silky sharks, and eagle rays the most enchanting of highlights. Then an afternoon and night dive showcase the completely diversity of the area, like mammoth mantas silhouetted below, octopi arriving from the depths, and red-lipped batfish. Day five offers two more dives here and there's never a dull moment. With so many sharks and rays, every minute seems to come from a Jacques Cousteau documentary. The visuals can be outrageous and all the dreams of Galapagos diving come to fruition. Peruvian grunts, jacks, wahoo, amberstripe scad, and it's not just a few of them; these sites explode with life and there's always a shark charging through the melee. Return to the boat and continue the cruise north, where you dock overnight besides Darwin Island."

        "description": "Huge hammerhead schools dominate Darwin Island and it's always an intimate encounter, their indelible frames cruising just meters away. As you drift along there's a series of Galapagos sharks and eagle rays keeping you entertained. Silky sharks meander and the distant swimming grace of a juvenile whale shark. But there's much more than these revered highlights. Butterflyfish and anglefish swarm in large numbers, as do a menagerie of damsels, wrasses, and anthias. Hawkish and parrotfish keep you occupied and the proximity to dolphins is enough to make your heart sing. You can enjoy four dives on day six and three on day seven, most of them strong drift dives around the wall. At some sites, you sail along and watch the parade, while at the Darwin Theatre you can explore a plateau that's packed with variety. Inquisitive turtles pass by and large numbers of garden eels poke their heads from hidden burrows. Everything from vivid shapes in the foreground to the distant mass of another shark below, the action never stops. Over the course of these dives you appreciate why the Galapagos Islands are so revered. So much of this ocean is protected and has never been fished, meaning the evolution of abundance hasn't been interrupted. And with three ocean currents converging, you encounter a diversity that's difficult to replicate elsewhere on the planet."

Down in the depths of Cousin's Rock, it's also hard to miss spotted eagle rays and large barracuda schools. But this site also allows you to inspect the macro of Galapagos life. Diminutive sea horses float past octopi and bizarre nudibranch hide amongst forests of sea fans and red sponges. The dive experience becomes interactive as sea lions enter the water, the playful creatures somersaulting as they chase salema fish. After the northern islands, today brings two easy dives and a chance to add more diversity to the long list of species that have been spotted. After Cousin's Rock, you'll cruise to Santa Cruz and spend the afternoon on land. Visit the Charles Darwin Research Station and explore the shops of Puerto Ayora."

Stark cliffs give way to expanses of deciduous forest and carpets of mowed grass. Giant tortoises fill these highlands, their 140-year old shells making a slow march across the lavish landscape. Like the sea turtles of the ocean, you're not just encountering a few giant tortoises. There's hundreds of them plodding around. Some try to bite necks as they assert dominance; youngsters meander through the reeds, and females escape the clutches of domineering males. Spend the day in these highlands, standing amongst a canvas of tortoise shells and gazing down on the green slopes of San Cristobal. Return to the lodge by mid-afternoon where there's ample time to relax at the beach or in the spacious grounds."

        "description": "Punta Pitt is one of the archipelago's most famous wildlife sites. Red-footed boobies hop on raised rocks, those with the most vibrant feet winning the attention of females. Nazca booby chicks stand curiously in small nests, their fluffy-white plumage resplendent in the morning sun. Also dancing around are blue-footed boobies, their feet complimented by blue beaks and a slither of blue feathers. Nowhere else in the world can you see these three species together. As the males give off an air of invincibility, seeking to impress the females. The females inspect feet and wait for the males to guide them to a nesting site. They wait, they ponder, and then flutter onwards to another outrageous pair of hopping feet. Much like the Galapagos dive sites there's an intimacy to the wildlife experience on land. You're standing on trails adjacent to the breeding ground, barely a few meters from these flamboyant mating displays. These seabirds have few predators, and they don't change their behavior when you arrive with a camera. Spend the morning on land, wandering amongst the thousands of birds that inhabit the cliffs. There’s also a chance to snorkel from the shore or lounge on a quiet beach. Return to the lodge by mid-afternoon for another relaxing evening along the coast."

Pelicans take spindly steps through the shallows while marine iguanas creep across the sand. These incredible creatures have evolved to survive solely from salt-water, drinking from the ocean and expelling the salt with a flurry of sneezes. Blue-footed boobies are also found in abundance and you continue the love affair with sea lions. These are bachelor males: big, boisterous, and belligerent as they compete for a mate. Enjoy a final snorkel and wave farewell to the marine world before an hour of lounging on the white coralline-sand of what is ostensibly Ecuador's best beach."

Sea turtles add elegance to the scene, while the sea lions from earlier continue their playful fishing. After the morning in the channel, you island hop to Isabela in the Western Galapagos. A spine of volcanic mountains provides the backdrop as you check in for the first of three nights overlooking an unadulterated coastline.

Dip your head beneath the surface, and you discover how this molten lava has transformed into crowded underwater reef walls. Sharks swim past tiny seahorses, sea turtles cruise beside eel hideouts, and there are over 50 exotic fish species swarming around. Keep snorkeling and you journey through a spooky expanse of mangroves, a natural hiding place for the small and delicate of the marine world. Los Tuneles is one of the finest snorkeling sites in the whole Pacific, and whenever you emerge from the water, there's the iconic vista of the arches standing lonely amidst the ocean."

Normally these pelagic fish wouldn't be found so close to shore and would only be seen on deep-water diving trips. In the Galapagos Islands, they're found at shallow depths along the reef wall, meaning no need for a scuba qualification. Marine iguanas dot the shore, and you watch them sip on the seawater, a snippet of evolution that enables them to survive without fresh water. Watch for long enough and you'll see one sneeze out the salt. Land iguanas inhabit the cliffs in large numbers, further exemplars of evolution to admire before you take the boat back to Santa Cruz and the town of Puerto Ayora. With five days of cruising to come, this evening is an excellent chance to shop for souvenirs and enjoy the scenes around the harbor."

Like island hopping, a cruise combines thrilling excursions with tranquil time gazing out onto the seemingly infinite Pacific. Occasionally a dolphin pod or whale cruises past, gracing the scene for a few moments before continuing its migration. There's a lounge and restaurant on the boat, plus a jacuzzi for really slumbering when you're cruising the islands. After lunch and a welcome briefing on board, the cruise's first excursion is to North Seymour, an island lauded by naturalists for its remarkable nesting site. Magnificent frigates inflate their throat sacks, puffing a balloon of red towards passing females. Blue-footed boobies hop around and extend their wings in an outrageous show of color. Nazca boobies also line the walking trail and just as you're engrossed in tiny chicks, you almost stand on a large land iguana. Access to these sites is extremely controlled, so yours is the only group that is currently stepping beside the mating displays of these seabirds.

Keep cruising to Isla Lobos, named for the hundreds of boisterous sea lions that rest on its shores. Some waddle towards your camera, others dive for an afternoon fish, while the big males battle for supremacy on landscapes of rugged rock. Blue-footed boobies watch their show and initially their vibrancy holds you captive. But look around and there's an entire flock of strange birds; brown pelicans, yellow warblers, lava gulls, common noddies, ground finches.

The red-footed variety possesses a mix of colors, their flamboyant feet rising to blue chest feathers and a strange rainbow beak. Zoom out and absorb the scale of the scene, many thousands of birds nesting together on the ancient ash cones. Then zoom in and unravel the detail, like tiny lava lizards picking out flies beside feet that carefully guard eggs. As with each day, a morning excursion is followed by a few quiet hours on the boat. It's a time to sunbathe, snooze, sip on a drink, and savor the deserted bliss of the islands. It's also usually a time when the boat cruises to a new wildlife site. So on to Cerro Brujo, a dazzling expanse of coralline white sand that slopes into calm turquoise waters. It feels like a scene from a tropical vacation postcard, one of lush waters and a beach without footprints. But Cerro Brujo isn't a predictable or quiet place. Sea lions are the primary residents, and they seem to revel in swimming with snorkelers, or flapping their way around to interrupt sunbathers.

Even when you're just three meters away, they don't seem fussed by your presence. Get close to these iguanas and admire the embroidery of dots that speckle their watchful eyes and alert tongues. These reptiles are only found on this tiny island, and you're close enough to reach out and touch them. Stand back as the sea lion harem starts bellowing from the beach below. Follow the sounds and there's a battle between two males, one 800-pound giant chasing a rival away from the beach. It's here that you can jump into a kayak for another chance to paddle with sea lions before the cruise continues to South Plaza Island. It is another surreal wildlife spot for eclectic encounters with Galapagos icons: marine iguanas, land iguanas, blue-footed boobies, great frigates, lava lizards, and a succession of small tropical birds.

Admire how architectural styles blended multiple influences yet the artwork created its own distinct realm. Through the paintings you observe how newly converted Christians made original interpretations of biblical scenes. Aurelio Espinoza Polit Musuem is equally revealing of an old culture with its sculptures and gargantuan paintings. Lunch is included on this private tour and you return to the hotel in the late afternoon."

        "description": "Flamboyant colors greet you in Ecuador's most famous market, Otavalo. There are rows of endemic fruits and stalls piled high with strange vegetables. While the traditional local dress is predominantly black, a rainbow of colorful accessories makes these clothes far from dull. Ponchos and llama wool add additional dimensions to the market as you spend a couple of hours exploring. It's the best place in the country for buying traditional souvenirs. From the vibrant atmosphere of the market you travel further into the Andes to Hacienda Chorlavi, a location that's approaching its 400-year anniversary. Traditional tiled roofs slope down to a central courtyard while private balconies overlook snowy Andean peaks. Timeless and elegant, the hacienda is quick to transport you into a scene from another century. The evening is at leisure with an a la carte dinner served in the excellent restaurant."

Recently refurbished, the train celebrates the route of freed slaves and passes by an array of ancient villages. Admire the mountain vistas from the first-class carriage and watch the train slowly pass over cute wooden bridges. You disembark in Salinas to a chorus of traditional songs and a dance performance from the village's residents. From here it's a short journey to Pantavi, one of Ecuador's most unusual haciendas. Most features of this old farmhouse clearly evoke images of the 19th century, but they are contrasted with a gallery of contemporary art. Every wall and every room is filled with postmodernist paintings and sculptures, a strange sounding juxtaposition that's pulled off with an artist's enviable touch. Welcome cocktails are shared with the owner before a sublime dinner in the restaurant."

        "description": "As the road winds towards Zuleta, great swaths of forest begin to dominate the hills. Despite being less than an hour from Ibarra, it's rural and remote here, with llamas and condors speckled across the landscape. Arrive at Hacienda Zuleta, and you're immersed in a sense of wilderness, which comes complete with the tracks of spectacle bears. For the next two days, you're among just a handful of guests that have this natural reserve as their playground. Walking trails range from easy wooded routes to ascents of cliffs with untamed views over the Andean range. The onsite horses have been carefully bred for almost a century, and there's a whole menu to choose from, including those specializing in bareback rides and those for beginners wanting a private journey through the forest. There is peace and privacy everywhere, with little more than a tropical hummingbird interrupting your languid two days. Zuleta's highlight is not the endangered condors, horse riding trails, or huge native woodland; it's the hacienda itself. For almost 400 years, there's been a working farm onsite, and for over a century this has all been in presidential hands. Former Ecuadorian President Galo Lasso ran the country in the 40's and 50's, using the hacienda as a weekend getaway as well as a private space for entertaining dignitaries. It's now run by his grandchildren and has recently been opened to the public. There are just a handful of guest rooms, each beautifully decorated in regal styles and leading into traditional wooden corridors. Three living rooms are centered on wood fires while portraits of the president hang in vast libraries. Hacienda Zuleta doesn't look or feel like a guesthouse. Instead, you're invited into a family home and share wine and cheese with the owners, before fabulous three-course dinners take you into the evening."

Magnificent Cotopaxi dominates the scene, almost 6,000 meters high and among the world's tallest active volcanoes. The road winds to El Parqueadero, a 4,600-meter viewpoint with astonishing views across the Western Andes. Those feeling active can hike for an hour to see a resplendent mountain glacier. With Cotopaxi as the compass, you continue to Hacienda San Agustin de Callo, an old Augustinian convent that was built around an ancient Inca palace. This is the northernmost imperial Incan site in South America and an incredibly revealing archaeological site. Like Zuleta, this hacienda also offers a variety of activities in a huge swathe of fertile Andean valley. Hike or horseback ride to large rose plantations or head into one of the surrounding villages to experience their weekly market. Authentic Ecuadorian cuisine is served in the Incan-Augustinian dining room while a series of ruins can be explored within the hacienda's ground. Spending time here is like being in a living museum, with the unique mix of architecture revealing how disparate influences have collided through the country's history."

Charles Darwin based his Theory of Evolution in the Galapagos, noting how unique species were born out of the different conditions on each of the islands. A luxury 16-passenger boat takes you between the iconic highlights of the archipelago, enabling you to combine the opulence of a cruise with the unusual wildlife that's essential to our understanding of the world. All meals are served in a sumptuous dining room, and your suite has views of the dolphins and whales that parade past. In the morning, you're transferred to Quito International Airport for a flight to San Cristobal Island and a lunch onboard. An afternoon excursion to La Loberia introduces the eclecticism of local wildlife. A colony of sea lions basks on the beach, grunting and waddling around the white coralline sand. Yellow warblers and Darwin finches flutter around white-mangrove forests while endemic marine iguanas wait silently on the hiking trail. Continue into San Cristobal's highlands and the slopes of an extinct caldera are a haven for red-chested frigates. Up here, the El Junco Lagoon provides one of the Galapagos' only sources of fresh water, making it a magnet for exotic birds and watchful reptiles.

Pacific waves send flumes of spray towards rocks filled with sea lions, while inland stretches of green are home to endemic mockingbirds. Espanola is home to a great myriad of Galapagos characters and offers an intimate experience with nature's theater. A local guide takes you along an easy walking trail and points out the evolutionary brilliance of all these surreal species. Consider reading more about your Ecuador tour operators that seek to provide you with a unique and remarkably educational trip of a lifetime. As you ascend onto the cliffs, a mass of white fills the panorama. 25,000 Waved Albatrosses fill Espanola with their complex five-day mating displays. This is the only place on the planet where these critically-endangered birds nest and you walk within a few meters of their stunning displays.

Champion Islet is the best place in the southern Galapagos to explore the marine world and this morning is dedicated to exploring the ocean. There are three options that can be combined. Kayak with a guide and encounter the antics of swimming sea lions that pop their heads above the surface. Snorkel along the reef wall and gaze down at the vivid world beneath the surface. A glass-bottomed boat provides a less active opportunity to encounter the marine Galapagos world. After lunch on board, the afternoon takes you to the eastern edge of Floreana Island.

In the morning light, it's a hypnotic scene, the sun slowly rising above the world's biggest tortoises. After the morning excursion, it's a quick transfer to the airport and your departure flight.

They sense movement via the vibrations of the earth, meaning they quickly retract their necks inside their shells when overenthusiastic children march over. However, walk on tiptoes and you can get just two or three meters from these phenomenal creatures. Pose for photos behind the tortoises and admire the interaction as the great reptiles gently cruise the Santa Cruz Highlands.

A glass-bottom boat ride turns the Pacific into a vibrant personal aquarium. Dinghy rides reveal silhouettes and the creatures that occupy the ocean cliffs. Then take a dip in the water, as the guided snorkeling excursions are tailored for beginners. Specialist snorkeling life jackets can be used, providing buoyancy but also ensuring your head can look down into the oceanic world. Floatation devices can also be used for more confident young swimmers. Snorkeling spots are in calm bays without currents, all under the watchful eye of the guide and a support boat that will pick up any tired snorkelers. You spend the day on Santiago Island, with the morning's marine activity centered around Buccaneer Cove. It's not all about the ocean; blue-footed boobies dot the cliffs, sea lions grunt and shout, and then there are the astonishing isolated lava formations like Elephant Rock. After lunch, the early afternoon is downtime on the boat, a chance to snooze or watch the waves from the sundeck. These hours aren't times to be in the sun.

Shouts ring out and soft shades reflect off the river as you cruise back towards the outskirts of the forest. Bright tanagers and cotingas grace this final morning, their kaleidoscopic colors framed against luscious green. From the dock, you return to Quito via the same combination of motorized canoe and local flight. After being greeted at the airport, you're transferred to a spa hotel for some tranquil time in the city. Enjoy a massage and slowly your mind returns from jungle wilderness to urban lifestyle. The evening is your leisure and there are numerous excellent restaurants within walking distance of the hotel."

Three snow-capped peaks glisten in the distance, their 5,000-meter frames standing imposingly above Quito. From up here you see how the city snakes through the valley, climbs onto slopes, and then disappears into a rugged stretch of mountain. After the teleferico ride and photographic panoramas, you enjoy a walking tour of the old city of Quito, the largest and most complete of all Latin America's colonial relics. Consider learning more about your luxury Ecuador travel agents that help guide and answer any questions that may come up during your tours. Start at Independence Square and wander into the Presidential Palace. Explore churches from a distant era, many of them harmoniously blending neoclassicism with Moorish influence. One of these, La Compania, is completely bathed in gold and the most important of all of Spain's religious monuments in the Americas. Keep walking, past bishop's palaces and along lanes of adorned wooden doors. Then continue through 16th-century courtyards onto broad squares of traditional musicians and chiming church bells. Stop for a traditional Ecuadorian lunch, and then return to your hotel for another afternoon of relaxation in the spa."

        "description": "In the Amazon there are thousands of different species to discover, yet most of them hide amidst the thick jungle canopy. There's just a few dozen iconic species in the Galapagos. But this wildlife doesn't hide. After the flight from Quito your first excursion is to the Santa Cruz highlands. Giant tortoises are seemingly everywhere: walking across the road, clashing heads in a show of dominance, languidly grazing on green lawns, and turning their necks as you approach. Darwin's finches and endemic mockingbirds flutter above the gargantuan shells as you walk along these fertile plains. And just as you think there's nothing more to see, a female tortoise causes two males to bite and quarrel over the chance to mate. In the late afternoon you travel down to the dock and board your luxury Galapagos cruise ship. This 40-person vessel combines the space of a larger boat with the intimacy of a smaller operation. Enjoy welcome cocktails in the bar before gazing onto the Pacific from the broad upper deck. As night falls, the jacuzzi on this floor is a great place to decipher star constellations. Back downstairs, a three-course dinner is served in the excellent restaurant, and you retire for the night in large ensuite cabins."

There are 50 to 60 of them, all craning to observe the human visitors to this strip of sublime sand on Santa Fe Island. Return their gaze and they push themselves higher, as if they were looking up expecting a kiss. But watch out; anyone getting too close to these females is threatened by the raucous shout of the alpha male. You spend the morning on this island, engrossed in the sea lions as you explore the beach and paddle through the bay on a kayak. The endemic Santa Fe iguana also responds to your inquisitive stare, briefly breaking its trance as it lies beneath a prickly-pear cactus tree. Then your eye wanders as a pair of migrating whales flit along the horizon. Like most days, you spend the afternoon cruising through the archipelago to your next island. There are wonderful views from the upper deck and a real sense of how the islands have risen like sentinels from the ocean's crust. The iguanas on South Plaza Island are a different color, this time a strange yellow that contrasts the luminescent green of the cacti. Seabirds soar beside the island's cliffs, their mammoth wings gathered together in impressive numbers. Just as you're returning to the boat, a gang of sea lions starts shouting and demanding your attention. A few more photos and you're back on board, where sunset blurs into a tranquil evening."

This is the most important island in the central Galapagos for bird life and one of the archipelago's most revered natural sites. So spend a few hours amongst the nesting sites, watching out for the mating displays of these vibrant seabirds. Heading down from the cliffs you also inspect marine iguanas that fish in the shallows and sea lions that play with snorkelers in clear waters. On each day of this cruise, there's an opportunity to explore both land and water during your excursions. Choose to either snorkel along the reef walls or ride in a glass-bottomed boat; reef sharks, rays, and sea turtles are spotted with both options. This afternoon's marine exploration is from the Las Bachas site, a near-white beach that's filled with hatching sea turtle eggs in May and June. Behind the sand, a brackish lagoon is speckled with pink flamingos while out along the volcanic reef wall there are often intimate encounters with these graceful oceanic wonders."

They're actually a succession of volcanoes that rose from the Pacific and spurted lava across the ocean. Today you appreciate this volcanic history with visits to Bartolome and Sullivan Bay. Wander across a red lunar landscape and marvel at the twists of ancient lava cones. Scarlet merges into crimson and rusty maroon as the island's rainbow stretches towards the ocean. As you ascend to Bartolome's summit, you enjoy the archipelago's most iconic photo: red rock in the foreground, the Pacific blue in the background, and two white beaches providing the contrast. There are excellent snorkeling and glass-bottomed boat excursions from these two beaches. Joining the reef sharks and turtles is another rare character, this time the tiny Galapagos penguin. A whole colony waddles along the cliffs and then dives in beside snorkelers. One glance and the penguin is there; another glance, and it has shimmied off to hunt some fish. After lunch on board, the afternoon is spent walking across a very recent lava flow. Life is yet to flourish here, and you can make out every swirl and dot that came from an exploding crater on Santiago Island. It's a fitting final excursion that brings the Galapagos cruise full circle. You started with the islands' ancient ancestors, the great giant tortoises. Now you're standing on the rocks that will eventually disintegrate and feed the future generations of endemic wildlife. There are farewell cocktails on board and the last night of stargazing as you cruise back towards Santa Cruz Island."

        "description": "Flying over Quito can be a magical experience, snow-capped mountains glistening from the plane window as you touch down beside the first ever World Heritage Site. Get picked up from the airport as you descend into the city. 17th-century plazas dominate the serene city center, the perfect place for a relaxing drink and watching the world stroll by. Settle into the city and nip into its heritage buildings, like bishop's courtyards converted to cafes and the gold leaf interior of La Compania. The central streets are easy to explore on foot, and there's always a new building or cafe that grabs your attention. With so much adventure coming soon, today is simply about relaxing in the city and acclimatizing to the gentle atmosphere of the country."

Take the cable car to the slopes of Pichincha, where each meter brings a new valley into view. You're already at 4,000 meters above sea level, and a trekking guide takes you further. Slowly you step onto the iconic slopes of Pichincha, winding around rugged volcanic trails towards the towering summit. It's an all-day hike, and the views are astonishing. In the distance, you spot the ash spewing from Cotopaxi Volcano while towards the north there're the craters of the highlands. The trek is private, so you dictate the pace, with your guide providing side options dependent on your fitness levels. This is one of the country's premier day hikes, both for the panoramas and the sheer feeling of walking on a volcano. Return to the cable car station and then get privately transferred back to Quito where the languid plazas are even more appealing with tired legs."

Locals wander the streets in their traditional dress while forgotten 18th-century plazas retain the charm of yesteryear. Set off early and drive into the Imbabura Province where your two-day mountain bike adventure begins. On quiet backroads, you weave through villages filled with the scent of freshly baked pastries from bakeries. Stop in the colorful market town of Otavalo, where the central streets are filled with indigenous residents selling traditional products; hand-woven tapestries, ponchos, customized leather, hammocks, alpaca wool sweaters. After lunch, you ride to Cuicocha Crater Lake, an alpine nature reserve with staggering views. Wander through a forest of sensual Andean flowers and then rest the legs at a historic hacienda."

Stop and explore, then keep peddling along relaxed backroads to Peguche, a haven for Andean music. With flowing jet-black hair, a musical group provides the serenade, using half a dozen indigenous instruments to create a unique sound. Complete the cycle by heading into an isolated valley; roads are virtually devoid of traffic, and you spot the great wings of various birds of prey overhead. This is Ecuador's untouched backcountry and will be your base for the next three nights.

A horse guide will talk you through the different options; those best for bareback excursions, horses tailored towards beginners and those that love long gallops. There's over 2000 hectares of private reserve around the farm and a series of dedicated horse trails to explore. Customize your route and head into the valley, winding through indigenous forest and rising towards glorious views of the Andes. Wild condors fly ahead while spectacle bears are regularly spotted in the thick green. Stop for a picnic lunch with glorious panoramas then continue the ride through the afternoon. Elegant and responsive, the horses offers the ideal pace for exploring such wilderness. You'll cover large distances in a single day yet go slow enough to fully appreciate the surroundings. Like everything at the hacienda, the experience is privately tailored to your needs. After all, the hacienda has a revered history of entertaining heads of state and royalty. For over a century, the farm and house have been in the family of Gallo Plaza Lasso, a former president of Ecuador. This was the president's weekend home and has only recently been opened to the public. It remains a regal experience; large dining rooms and libraries take you into a different era, fireplaces and coffee scents dominate lounge areas, and the original wooden furnishings are wonderfully ornate. Gastronomy is an essential part of the experience, and all your meals are included here. And like a stately visit, socializing with the owners over a glass of wine is part of the experience."

Your guide meets you at the airport, and you head towards Punta Pitt, with a charming lunch stop with views of giant tortoises. Spend the afternoon at this world-famous birding site, observing the bizarre mating displays and being careful not to step on the iguanas. Thousands of colorful feet provide the introduction. Male boobies hop on raised rocks, hoping their distinctive feet will catch the eye of inquisitive suitors. The red-footed variety will grab your attention as this is one of only two places you'll see these birds in the Galapagos. Then a mass of blue-footed boobies cover the breeding ground, and their azure chest feathers are also visually striking. But these vivid seabirds have to move over to the larger, and more aggressive Nazca booby take the prime nesting sites. Keep walking around Punta Pitt and there's even more color. Magnificent frigate birds inflate their throat-sacks, each male standing proudly resplendent beside the odd musing land iguana. On the far eastern edge of the Galapagos archipelago, this site provides an incredible introduction to the intimacy and authenticity of the wildlife experience. After the visit, you're transferred to a luxury coastal lodge on the west of the island. Seabirds can still be observed from your balcony, and you're never far from the shouts of sea lions. Over the next six days, you'll use three different islands as bases to explore the Galapagos. San Cristobal in the West provides a chance to observe eclectic wildlife and enjoy some offbeat outdoor adventures."

Endemic flora rises from the slopes, ranging from strange cactus trees to flourishing forests of deciduous trees. You're not alone here. Hundreds of giant tortoises amble across grass clearings, and you're soon standing amongst them. Continue the adventure by biking around tropical plantations then slipping into ocean kayaks to discover the coves around Darwin Bay. Large colonies of sea lions dot the beach, and many curious individuals swim towards the kayak. They somersault and playfully twist in the water, often raising their heads for an inquisitive glance. Sea turtles and white-tip reef sharks can also be seen close to the kayak while various seabirds are diving for food across the bays. Keep paddling and you cruise beneath jagged cliffs home to thousands of nesting birds. They squawk and shout but soon their echoes are silent. You're next going to go beneath the water's surface, snorkeling into one of the Galapagos’ best marine sites. The sea lions and sea turtles are still in the water, playful highlights as you explore the reef. Galapagos sharks, eagle rays, and golden rays are all spotted here. And then there are the dozens of clams, starfish, and strange tropical fish. After this extremely active day, you return to the lodge where an elegant evening provides rewarding downtime."

Large pelagic species are found occupying the reefs next to shore, meaning that you don't need to be a qualified diver to have intimate encounters with the greats of the ocean. Today you visit a series of snorkeling sites, with the interludes provided by expansive white sand beaches. Safely spot multiple shark species beneath the water, including the possibility of seeing an iconic hammerhead down below. Sea turtles and various ray species are found in huge abundance and then there are more endearing characters darting past you in the water: Galapagos penguins. Barely two kgs in weight, these strange characters suddenly appear beside your snorkel but then swim off as soon as you've realized what's going on.

Gaze across and you see the full caldera, an iconic shape that dominates the Isabela landscape. Twisted red lava flows cascade down from the rim, and there's a series of surreal volcanic formations around adjacent Volcan Chico. Today you drive and then hike to Sierra Negra's summit, before continuing the walk down through Volcan Chico to highlands covered in giant tortoises. On a clear day, there are staggering views across a succession of volcanoes. And on Isabela Island, a clear day is usually every six in seven.

Whales and dolphin pods regularly follow the yacht, endearing chaperones for the journey into the central islands. North Seymour is another of the archipelago's most revered wildlife sites, and it's perhaps the most spectacular seabird breeding site. Great and magnificent frigates have their nests just a couple of meters from the trail while blue-footed booby chicks sit at eye-level nests. There's an explosion of color on the stark volcanic rock, each male aiming to be more vibrant than the next. Be careful where you step, because as your eyes are led by mating boobies you could easily stand on one of the hundreds of land iguanas that wait patiently on the cliffs. From North Seymour, you'll cruise to Santa Cruz and a lodge on the island's southern edge."

These islands have never been connected to any land mass and form the surreal evidence of natural evolution. Each island and site are different, and a seven-day cruise allows you to explore fully the diverse wonder that exists both on the ground and below the water. After landing at Puerto Baquerizo Airport you're welcomed onto a timeless vessel for exploring the islands. Large cabins and a sumptuous upper deck provide space to recline and relax, while a large dining area and lounge are the meeting point for drinks and lavish meals. The 40 passenger capacity is large enough to offer space and a choice of activities, yet small enough to maintain a personal feel. This is also a good-sized boat for negating the chances of seasickness. After lunch and an introductory briefing, the afternoon is spent in the heart of a deciduous forest, where the strange San Cristobal lava lizard and highly endangered giant tortoises cover a carpet of grass. These reptiles first arrived on the islands by riding slices of forest that fell into the Pacific Ocean. A few million year later and various endemic species of lizards and tortoises have evolved, each unique to its island. Go slowly and these reptiles aren't scared. Like most of the Galapagos wildlife, you can get close enough to touch, but resisting the temptation to extend an arm is essential to the continued evolution on these rare equatorial islands."

On this island, there are no lizards and no aerial predators, setting a tranquil scene for gigantic flocks of strange birds. Red-footed boobies nest in the thousands, as do Nazca boobies, storm petrels, and strange mockingbirds. Outrageously inflating their red chests, great frigate males compete for a mate just meters from your camera. Rivals dance and posture on raised nests, flapping open their wings in displays of dominance. But with so many red chests nearby, only the most dramatic displays win a female's affection. To reach Genovesa, the Isabela II will have journeyed through the night, crossing the equator to a tranquil spot that's sporadically graced by other large sea birds. Snorkeling and kayaking are also possible here and in the afternoon you land at the beach for an easy stroll past more boobies, herons, finches, and gulls. With three naturalist guides on board, there's always a choice of guided activities and later in the day you can choose a walk over sharp lava tubes to a dramatic sunset.

This is an island where the eclectic wonder of the Galapagos comes together, and you spend the day exploring two distinct sights: Buccaneer Cove and Puerto Egas. Wander the coastline at each site before choosing to snorkel or take a glass-bottom boat ride.

Barren Fernandina is yet to develop the green of islands found to the east, yet it's surprisingly abundant. Hawks circle overhead while diminutive Galapagos penguins dive into the shallows. The flightless cormorant, one of the world's rarest birds, is also endemic to a small area around Fernandina and Western Isabela. Their wings are just a third of their relatives, yet, like everything in the Galapagos, this is a very deliberate piece of evolution. Shorter wings make this cormorant denser and able to dive to greater depths, a solution to the lack of food at sea level. After lunch, you cruise into the Bolivar Channel and anchor at a cove that's filled with dramatic marine life. But first a hike, upwards to the rim of Darwin Crater, where the recent remnants of volcanic eruption scar the landscape. Then it's a choice of kayaking or snorkeling to view the underwater world. Dozens of green sea turtles swim through the channel, arriving to enjoy the benefits of a strange turtle cleaning station. Small fish arrive to pick parasites from the turtles; a sight made even more dramatic by the appearance of white-tipped reef sharks and rays. Now a penguin dives past, and it's impossible to know which way to look. Return to the Isabela II for another elegant evening looking out to cliffs, craters, and cones."

After a morning of hiking and snorkeling, the afternoon is spent immersed in the dramatic geology of the region. Take a dinghy ride along the coast, watching penguins and turtles emerge in front of tuff-stone layers and lava flows. Another major advantage of cruising on a luxury vessel like the Isabela II is the quality of the naturalist guides.

        "description": "The Devil's Nose cliff was an almost unbreakable barrier in creating a train line from Quito to the port city of Guayaquil. Over a century ago, engineers had to find a way to go over its near-vertical face. They succeeded by building zigzags and switchbacks, enabling the train to lurch forward and backwards as it slowly ascended. This historic and dramatic journey has since been revitalized, and you enjoy it from a first-class carriage in the morning. It travels down from Alausi to Sibambe, where a small museum celebrates the engineering feat. Then you ascend back onto the cliffs and continue to the Incan fortress of Ingapirca. Home to the only remaining sun temple from the Incan Empire, these ruins cascade out across a blooming Andean valley. There's a sense of history in every stone, in every line of boulders that curls around the slopes. From here it's a two-hour drive to Cuenca, where you spend the night in Ecuador's second World Heritage city."

Follow the Tomebamba River, and these townhouses stretch out towards rural Andean slopes, elegantly portraying the charm of yesteryear. Church bells chime and cafes spill coffee scents onto squares. This is one of those cities that compel you to stay for weeks doing nothing; nothing but wandering the streets and lounging on cafe terraces. You don't have weeks to spare, so enjoy a very relaxed day discovering Cuenca at your own pace. Sip drinks in 17th-century squares, snack on goat cheese and ceviche, and allow your mind to slip into Cuenca's historic rhythm."

        "description": "Decadent and spacious, your nine-passenger Galapagos boat offers an exclusive way to cruise the islands. A jacuzzi offers ocean views and a prime place to watch the stars. There are three social areas onboard: a sundeck, observation room, and luxuriant lounge. A library contains detailed literature on the Galapagos' natural history while a gourmet chef enquires about your likes as you're welcomed to the boat. A discreet team makes everything tick, so sit back and admire the dolphins and gulls that seem to hover magnetically behind the boat. A small-group Galapagos tour offers an almost completely private trip through this fabulous natural oasis, ensuring you get near-exclusive access to world-renowned wildlife spots. Access to national park sites is carefully restricted here. Nothing is overcrowded or overpopulated. Instead, every trip is timetabled to ensure there is only one boat or group at each site at any given time. This means that there will only be you and eight other passengers exploring these sites of worldwide natural significance. After the flight to the Galapagos and a lunch on-board, you cruise off to North Seymour. This small volcanic island is engulfed in the mating antics of blue-footed boobies, perhaps the Galapagos' most iconic species. Watch them extend their wings and hop from blue foot to blue foot, using their striking colors as an indicator of virility. Mothers feed flightless chicks while magnificent frigates also grab your attention with their inflated red chests. Watch your step, as land iguanas line the trail and you walk alongside the breeding ground for thousands of birds. The birds are blasé about your presence, so get closer and keep photographing their remarkably mating displays."

Sea lions bask on the white beach, curiously saying hello with a twist of the neck and a shimmy of the head. Enter the water, and a sea turtle is out on its morning rounds, cruising past reefs bathed in tropical resplendence. And this is just a snippet of what's going on. Today's excursion starts by ascending to Bartolome's summit for glorious views over the red lunar landscape. Then follow the penguins in diving into the water and inspecting the marine world. Nearby Sullivan Bay is equally poignant in its portrayal of volcanic history, the whole landscape marked by swirls of once-fiery lava. Go beneath the surface once more, and the nutrient-rich cliffs create a haven for tiny colorful fish and the odd pelagic, like a white-tip reef shark or an eagle ray. Like yesterday, you return to the boat around sunset for a leisurely evening of dining and watching the stars."

Ascend onto the island's cliffs, and you soon realize that the photos are a misinterpretation. Instead, there are over a million birds on this tiny island, most of them squawking and hopping around as they seek to mate. Look closely, and the red feet give way to endemic finds, like the short-eared owl or the red-billed tropical bird. Then switch your lens to wide angle, and try and take in the scene. You have near-exclusive access to this fabulous site, so wander along the trail and intimately encounter the bizarre antics of these strange seabirds. You'll visit two Genovesa sites today, with the morning at Prince Phillip's Steps and the afternoon in Darwin Bay. A snorkeling interlude offers a real chance to be safely in the water with both Galapagos sharks and hammerhead sharks. As always, lunch is a gourmet one and there are always leisurely hours to enjoy on the boat."

At the easternmost point of the island, you explore the only place in the world where the three booby species are found together. Their colorful feet and beaks parade alongside an endemic lizard and peculiar mockingbird. Each striking color is brightened by its white feathered surroundings, and just like in North Seymour and Genovesa, these birds are unfazed by human presence, enabling you to walk within a few meters from nests and flamboyant wing displays. After lunch, you spend the afternoon in the water at Kicker Rock, a marine site that's world famous for its schools of hammerhead sharks. Snorkeling allows you to spot them silhouetted in the depths and there's always something surprising rising from the abyss to the top of the reef wall."

You're spending the day at the southernmost and oldest island, one that's spent four million years evolving from towering volcanic peak to weathered slice of natural history. Galapagos hawks soar and boobies dive from the air, but you're here in Espanola to indulge in the really endemic and unusual. Over 25,000 critically endangered waved albatrosses breed here, filling the cliffs with beak kissing and outrageous four-day mating displays. A tiny marine iguana is also exclusive to this island, as is a cacophonous mockingbird that flutters around. Around Gardner Bay, there's also a sampling of Darwin's finches, each with a beak that reveals its preferred feeding ground. And just as you're returning to the boat, a colony of sea lions greets you on a white beach of coralline sand."

These are females, some of them fishing to feed a pup and others somersaulting around in the dawn hours. A whole colony occupies the beach and you have to watch their behavior to avoid upsetting the dominant male. Sit on a rock and admire the scene, some 50 sea lions interacting just meters away. A yelp, a grunt, and the big male charges across the sand. One young male had been impersonating a female in a bid to mate; unfortunately his acting skills weren't subtle enough. An endemic land iguana waits beneath prickly-pear cactus trees on the island while an easy walking trail takes you across the scorched remnants of this barren yet seductive island. The boat then cruises to Santa Cruz where you dock and spend the afternoon in the highlands. This landscape couldn't be any more different. It's dominated by green and charming rolls of valleys. It’s also home to one iconic character. Giant tortoises are everywhere, including the road, the pond, and the lawn that surrounds your remote lunch spot. These 500-pound giants are the biggest tortoises in the world and their evolved brilliance includes a resting heart that beats just two times a minute. Slow yourself to their pace, and you can get wonderful photos of the giant tortoises calmly grazing away. There's time to do some shopping in the port town of Puerto Ayora before you return to the boat for a final night on board."

You're in the Pacific Ocean, 600 miles from the mainland, exploring a sequence of wildlife sites with barely another person or boat in site. Your Galapagos time is split between a luxury small-boat cruise and four nights at an oceanfront lodge. And it all starts with flying from Quito and having lunch in the highlands of Santa Cruz. Giant tortoises surround the charming dining area, gently grazing as you tuck into three courses and a bottle of wine. Walk hand in hand across the lawn as you explore their habitat, with a series of necks extending from shells to inspect your arrival. These are the world's largest giant tortoises, and they're just the start of the wildlife in the Galapagos.

Gaze down on the colonial buildings of the old city through the windows of your suite in the new town. Watch the domes softly illuminated at night and see the surrounding volcanic peaks go from snowy-white to an enchanting silhouette. You'll be greeted at the airport and transferred to your five-star hotel, where there's a choice of five restaurants for the evening's dinner."

        "description": "Land in the Galapagos and step aboard the islands' most spacious luxury boat. Unlike the majority of boats, yours was never built or intended for tourism. It was a private vessel that has only recently entered the Galapagos waters. Your air-conditioned VIP suite has a private lounge plus two bathrooms. There's a broad sundeck with loungers for watching the dolphins swim past. An interior and exterior living area provide different options throughout the day. And the 48.5-meter vessel is only for 12 passengers. The 11 crew members provide intimate and discreet service while a naturalist guide takes you to the hidden spots in the mystical natural realm. It's a 90-minute flight to Baltra Airport, where you're transferred to the boat to enjoy a leisurely lunch. A first wildlife excursion brings you to Black Turtle Cove, a haven of mangroves that provides protection for the ocean's small and delicate. Guided snorkeling reveals a kaleidoscope of tropical fish and unveils the camouflage of hidden predators, like the rays that wait silently on the sandy bottom. It's a gentle introduction, one that encourages you to open your senses to the diminutive characters that swim along the exotic reefs. Watch the sunset back on the boat and enjoy the first of many dinners served by the Passion's chef. For the next 15 days, expect a menu that mixes international tastes with the freshness of Ecuadorian cuisine, epitomized by ceviche and a continual supply of pressed juices."

        "description": "Cruise north overnight and you reach northeastern Genovesa Island, just as a delicate sunrise paints reflections on the Pacific. Disembark and ascend from a coral beach to volcanic cliffs that are packed with rowdy seabirds. There's over a million birds on this tiny island, the majority of them with flamboyant red feet or inflated red throat sacks. These red-footed boobies and magnificent frigates are two of the islands' most iconic species and their mating displays play out just a few meters from your camera. Spend the morning at Darwin Bay and the afternoon around Prince Phillip's Steps, two astonishing realms that showcase the abundance of life to be found on the archipelago's fringes. Like everywhere in the Galapagos, you're not hoping to see these vibrant species. You're surrounded by thousands upon thousands of them."

These blend into two white-sand beaches that are separated by a majestic lava tower, locally known as Pinnacle Rock. Completing the evocation of a surreal world are the waddling Galapagos penguins and inquisitive sea lions. And dappled across the panorama, you gaze onto the distant volcanic peaks of other islands. From the wide angle to the delicate detail, you spend time lounging on the beach and snorkeling with the fishing penguins. The afternoon excursion is to Sullivan Bay, where an easy walk takes you across the vivid lava flows of a recent eruption. As always, there're a few hours of downtime in between, allowing you to savor the serenity and lost-world escapism of the Pacific."

        "description": "Luxury yacht cruising is often about discovering secluded beaches of tropical promise. Rabida's beach unfortunately doesn't have palm trees or white sand. Instead, the fine red sand provides a remarkable contrast to the slick black fur of sea lions. A whole colony basks around and your morning excursion brings indelible encounters with these somersaulting swimmers. Now, more colors at Dragon Hill in the afternoon; the pink from flamingos, verdant green of sea turtles, and tropical resplendence of endemic hummingbirds. Walk a little from the landing site and you find a vast nesting ground for land iguanas, the curious reptiles adorned with intricate spots from a painter's palate. And now a black and white image as you enjoy dinner on the deck and watch the stars. In such a remote piece of the world, there's always a starry show to accompany the soft lapping of waves."

Hundreds of them fill the fertile slopes, ambling at a tranquil pace that's imbued with grace. These are the world's largest giant tortoises, and there're dozens of them within a single photographic frame. Watch males bite each other's shells, marvel at young babies, and follow the shells to red lakes dappled with endemic ducks. A lavish lunch is served in the highlands, and there's a choice of activities for the afternoon. You could cycle to impressive birdwatching sites, wander the town of Puerto Ayora, or relax on a spacious white beach that's flanked by seabird nesting sites. Return to the yacht in the late-afternoon for snacks and then dinner at sundown."

        "description": "It's on the smallest Galapagos islands that you find the strangest species. Santa Fe iguanas spend days without moving; their pale yellow camouflaged into the rock as they wait for a pear to fall from a prickly cactus tree. South Plaza's iguanas are orange, evolved to blend into a different volcanic landscape. Watch where you step, as their expert camouflage can be easy to overlook. Sea lions bark happily on both islands while marine iguanas shimmy across the beach to the turquoise shallows. All these reptiles have evolved to survive without fresh water, and your guide narrates the adaptations, including drinking sea water and sneezing out the salt. You're now in the Central Galapagos, and these waters are perennially filled with an eclectic mix of marine life, making South Plaza and Santa Fe excellent places to snorkel."

        "description": "Widely regarded as Ecuador's finest beach, Gardner Bay offers a morning of sunbathing and sea lion watching. There are very few footprints in the sand, but it's impossible to escape the escapades of the blubbery locals. Mothers guard cute babies that struggle to adjust their eyes to the brightness. A large male protects its harem, chasing away other males that swim in the bay. Then there are the frisky females that want to play with swimmers in the shallows. From Gardner Bay, you continue to Osborn Islet for some excellent snorkeling, before the afternoon's excursion to Suarez Point. There's only 25,000 critically endangered waved albatross in the world, and all of them breed on Espanola Island. A four-day mating display includes ample beak kissing, an extension of wings, and exotic calls. This scene manifests across the point from April to December, and it's not just one mating pair. Walking along the breeding grounds, you watch hundreds of couples in different stages of their displays. Hawks circle overhead while endemic finches and mockingbirds sing as you continue your journey into the endemic."

After seven days through the eastern islands, you now continue onto the yacht's western itinerary. Some passengers leave the boat here and the morning is a relaxed one around Puerto Ayora. There's time for some souvenir shopping and a lunch on land before a guided visit to the Charles Darwin Research Station in the afternoon. There are 10 subspecies of giant tortoises that are bred here and the wide corrals allow you to admire their prominent differences. Shells change shape, necks extend, and it's easy to see why these giant tortoises became so central to the world's understanding of natural evolution. Return to the boat for dinner and another tranquil evening."

Sea turtles float on the currents while white-tip reef sharks appear then dive into the abyss. This is one of the Pacific's finest snorkeling spots, and your guide knows exactly where to encounter the pelagic giants. Vibrant marine life is combined with historical tales on Floreana Island, where the stories of 18th-century whalers and post office barrels provide a human story to the archipelago. Don't worry, though; all these chronicles don't mean your journey gets crowded. As always, you're docked in a calm bay, with probably only one other boat in sight. Gaze out from here and the Pacific's waters are infinite; the next land mass found due south would be Antarctica."

Exhaled flumes of water alert you to a migratory whale, a giant on its way through the abundant waters. Seabirds also follow the Passion as it cruises towards the western islands, their white wings a constant presence through this afternoon's journey. This is a day of classic cruising, one that helps to ingrain the sense of the Pacific's enormity and the seclusion of the islands. Cruise past intricate lava outcrops, along the fringes of volcanic peaks, and around to the far northwest of the Galapagos."

        "description": "Beneath the majestic backdrop of three volcanos, you discover the eclectic life of the western islands. Galapagos penguins are found in great abundance here, and this is the only penguin species you'll see in the northern hemisphere. They stand beside giant tortoises and large yellow iguanas that move with rhythmic elegance. Finches and mockingbirds flutter overhead while sea turtles cruise around the calm turquoise waters. Very few Galapagos boats visit this part of the archipelago, and you're docked without any other semblance of the human world. It's just you and the continuously playful behavior of Isabela's residents. Sea lions bask in the sun, casting a strange glance at the giant tortoises, then swimming off to join the manta rays beneath the surface. In this world of wildlife abundance, you have an exclusive invitation. So explore on land, jump into the water, and revel in nature's great oasis."

        "description": "Now Fernandina, the archipelago's youngest island and its most protected. While evolution on some of the islands was interrupted by invasive species, very few people or foreign life has ever stepped onto Fernandina. You're able to disembark at Punta Espinosa and wander across black lava rocks that are packed with marine iguanas. Strange flightless cormorants rest on the cliffs while pelicans and sea lions lounge above the thick mangrove forests. More birds fly past; lava herons, storm petrels, great blue herons, and mockingbirds. And beneath the surface, there's a fabulous spot for donning the mask and watching the birds dive into the depths. Nature is most untouched and untamed here, and there's an evocative sense of discovering a world that's yet to feature on the nature documentaries."

Endemic flightless cormorants dive into the Pacific and keep going, descending up to 80 meters into the abyss for their favorite food. Whales and dolphins push fish balls towards the swooping escapades of herons, blue-footed boobies, and other seabirds. Then when you go snorkeling, there are sea turtles and sharks that also find something on the marine menu. In a tranquil bay that's protected from the oceanic swells, you don't just find one or two of each fishing species. As always, there are dozens, often hundreds of these characters to encounter. Marine iguanas sit on the cliffs, surrounded by sally lightfoot crabs and the plummeting beauty of Galapagos hawks. Watch the show from the yacht, from a small dinghy, or in the water with your snorkel."

As per usual, sea lions find a home on the fine sand, and some take a curious liking to your camera. Tiny lava lizards harmoniously rest beside their blubbery friends, picking at the flies that flutter around the sea lions' whiskers. Today's excursions to Buccaneer Cove and Puerto Egas reflect the diverse experiences found on the islands. Wander on the beach, take to the walking trails to find seabirds and iguanas, and snorkel from the shore along coral reefs of exotic splendor. And when you've had enough with the wildlife, lounge on the yacht and revel in the tranquility of Pacific Ocean cruising."

Wander past the sea lions and land iguanas to see hundreds of blue-footed boobies that are laying nests on the rugged volcanic floor. Males hop around to showcase their healthy color while finicky females inspect their potential suitors. Magnificent frigates add balloons of red to the scene while a tiny Nazca booby chick pushes its smaller sibling from the nest. North Seymour is one of the Galapagos's most revered sites, and it brings a dazzling reel of final memories from this small boat cruise. From here, you continue to Baltra Island and the airport for your domestic flight back to Quito and your onward departure."
