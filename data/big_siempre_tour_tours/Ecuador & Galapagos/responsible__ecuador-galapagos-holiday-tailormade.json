  "generalInfo": "A very popular itinerary that combines three different experiences in a flexible way so that you have a lot of choice. You select the Amazon lodge that suits you best, in the Andes you can either explore the crafts and markets of Otavalo, the wonderful scenery of Cotopaxi, or the natural world of an Andean cloud forest. Then you select the boat of your choice for the Galapagos Islands. We can help you to decide if you are not sure. <br/><br/>Featured activities on this trip include: walking, jungle treks, horse riding (optional), cruising and wildlife watching. <br/><br/>Best time to go:<br/>Ecuador's weather varies little throughout the year, but there are large variations around the country, primarily due to differences in altitude. In the Andes, June to September are generally drier and clearer than the rest of the year (6-7 hours of sunshine as opposed to 5-6 hours at other times). At other times, a typical sierra day would start with a sunny clear morning, clouding over later in the afternoon perhaps with some rain. Cloud and rain are created by the mountains, so can vary widely as you move around them. There is little difference in temperature around the year. In the Amazon, warm temperatures and high levels of humidity are the norm. It rains too (hence the rainforest), but not as much as you might think. You would be unlucky to lose more than half a day to rain in a 4 day visit - but it does happen. The Galapagos Islands are an all year round destination.",
