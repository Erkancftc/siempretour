      "description": "SEOUL: On arrival at Incheon Airport, you’ll be met by your driver and transferred to your accommodation in the centre of Seoul. Meet your guide in the evening for a tour of the city’s nightlife, street food and Korean barbeque. Begin at a local barbeque restaurant where meat and vegetables are marinated in sesame oil, soy sauce and garlic before being cooked at the centre of your table. It sounds simple, but the food is delicious, and this will be the perfect opportunity to learn about Korean food and drink etiquette. From here, continue on to Gwangjang Market, stopping to try some traditional rice cakes en-route. The market is one of the oldest in South Korea and you can find a variety of different street food here. Try some specialities, such as soondae sausages, tteokbokki rice cakes in chilli sauce and gimbap (rice rolls). Your guide will talk about some of the more unusual ingredients which make up these dishes before leaving you to continue exploring the city’s nightlife independently or head back to the hotel."

      "description": "SEOUL: Meet your guide this morning and use the city’s excellent public transport network to explore some historical and cultural sights. First, head to Changdeokgung Palace, one of the five great palaces of Seoul and a World Heritage Site. Built by King Taejong in the early 15th century, Changdeokgung was designed as a secondary palace to Gyeongbokgung (the main Joseon palace), and is credited with having influenced Korean architecture and garden design for centuries. It is particularly noted for its sophisticated “Secret Garden” design, which takes into account Confucian pungsu principles (Korean feng shui) and adapts to the local topography. After exploring the palace, head to Bukchon, a picturesque district of low-rise hanok houses that provides a remarkably well-preserved glimpse of old Korea. Today, many of the hanok have been converted into museums and workshops, including a superb folk-art gallery, a collection of traditional Korean embroidery, and a museum displaying artefacts of everyday life donated by the residents of Bukchon. End the day flashing forward through the centuries to experience cutting-edge Seoul with a visit to the glitzy Myeongdong shopping street, Korea's best-known shopping and fashion district. A great place for people-watching, to enjoy tasty local snacks and to experience 21st Century Seoul in all its glory."

      "description": "SEOUL: Meet your guide and head to Suwon, a city 30 kilometres south of Seoul. The only remaining completely walled city in Korea, Suwon is best-known as the home of Hwaseong Fortress, which was built in the 18th century by King Jeongjo to house the remains of his father after his gruesome execution. Designated a World Heritage Site in 1997, Hwaseong is widely considered a paragon of fortress design, combining the latest developments in military architecture from both Eastern and Western traditions. If you choose to, there’s also the opportunity to take part in a traditional Korean archery session here. Next you’ll move on to Haenggung palace where the royal family retreated during times of war, and where King Jeongju often visited to pay respects to his father who is entombed here. Together with the fortress, this palace represents the power-strengthening policies of the royals and had played a significant role in Korean political and military history. Finally, you’ll head over to explore Hanggungdong Mural Village which extends from the fortress with a mix of craft stores & workshops, artful murals, and street food stalls."

      "description": "JEONJU: Use public transport to make your own way to Seoul Station and use your pre-booked ticket to board the high-speed KTX bullet train to Jeonju, Korea’s culinary capital. On arrival at Jeonju Station, use public transport to travel to your nearby traditional hanok accommodation. The afternoon will be free to independently explore this official UNESCO City of Gastronomy. Mandu dumplings, baguettes stuffed with spicy pork, bibimbap with mung bean jelly and cinnamon-flavoured moju liquor are just a few of the items on the menu. Be sure to check out “Makgeolli Town”, where entire streets are devoted to the enjoyment of the local tipple, makgeolli, a milk-white rice wine that’s served in a copper kettle. Buy a kettle to share and the food gets thrown in for free (although the locals will tell you makgeolli is a food, not a beverage). Jeonju is not only known for its fantastic cuisine, it’s also home to a beautifully preserved maze of alleys and old-fashioned, slate-roofed hanok houses that have been converted into cafés, restaurants, boutiques, guesthouses and craft workshops. If you feel up for a hike, schlep to the top of Martyr’s Mountain, the final resting place of thirteen Korean Catholics who were persecuted in the 18th century, or head up to Omokdae’s hillside pavilion for panoramic views over the town and surrounding hills."

      "description": "BUSAN: Meet your driver and take a private transfer to Busan, South Korea’s second largest city, located on the southeast coast. This port town is home to several sandy beaches and is a favourite weekend getaway for many Koreans. The afternoon will be free at leisure, and we recommend a trip to the Buddhist temple Haedong Yonggungsa, which is easily accessible by public bus. Built in 1376 during the Goryeo dynasty, it differs from most other temples in Korea as it is one of the few to be found on Busan’s stunning coastline instead of in the mountains. Devoted to the Goddess Buddha of Mercy, it is one of only three temples dedicated to her and its motto promises at least one of your wishes to be granted through prayer here. Afterwards you can head to the Haeundae beach area to relax or explore the lively restaurant scene."

      "description": "BUSAN: This morning you’ll join a shared cooking class which includes Korean homemade sauce tasting. Be guided by experienced chefs for an in-depth lesson on how to create your own authentic Korean dishes made from fresh, seasonal ingredients with a side of Korean culture thrown in. Afterwards you’ll try the fruits of your labour. In the afternoon, you’ll be taken on a tour of the city’s cultural highlights. Visit the higgledy-piggledy alleys and pastel-coloured houses of Gamcheon Culture Village. Gamcheon began life as a shanty town in the 1920s and 30s, sprawling across a steep mountainside overlooking the South Sea. In 2009, however, the local government collaborated with artists to transform the district into a living art gallery, and today the area is stuffed to the gills with sculptures, murals, and street art of all kinds - as well as numerous trendy cafés and shops selling locally made handicrafts. The renovation project has been a resounding success, and Gamcheon today is a magnet for art-lovers of all stripes - so expect to queue for that perfect selfie in front of the stunning views! Stop at Kukje International Market, where slow trains trundle through on their way to refuel the nearby US army base, and you can find selling everything from flowers and street snacks to K-Pop merchandise and knock-off Dolce & Gabbana bags. Busan is the 5th busiest port in the world so it should come as no surprise that it’s one of Korea’s best destinations for seafood. Next you will head to Busan’s most famous seafood market; Jagalchi. Here you’ll wander amongst the aquarium-like stalls, and sample some of the local produce like nakji octopus tentacles or perhaps some maeu un tanng (fish soup). Your final stop will be Yongdusan Park and Busan Tower where you will learn about Korea’s naval history from the statue of Admiral Yi Shun-sin and enjoy spectacular views over the city."

      "description": "SEOUL: Use public transport to make your way to Busan Station and use your pre-booked ticket to board the high-speed KTX bullet train back to Seoul. On arrival at Seoul Station, use public transport to travel to your centrally located hotel. The remainder of the day will be free at leisure to finish off your exploration of the capital. There’s plenty more to see and do. Hongdae and Edae in the west are the creative hotspots, where you’ll find trendy cafés and bars, vintage shops, and a vibrant, alternative nightlife scene. Gangnam, made famous by the 2012 smash-hit song, is where you’ll find luxurious skyscrapers, upmarket shopping malls, and the biggest and best clubs in South Korea. Sip soju at a streetside tent bar, relax at a traditional jimjilbang bathhouse, go gallery-hopping in Samcheong-dong, or sing your heart out at one of the city’s many self-serve karaoke spots."
