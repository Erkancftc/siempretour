      "title": "A full day exploring Seoul by public transport",
      "description": ": Today we explore the city like a local, using public transport. Walking through Gwanghwamun gate, we visit Gyeongbokgung Palace, the main royal palace of the Joseon Dynasty. Originally built in 1395, it was expanded in 1867 to become the largest, and arguably most beautiful of Seoul's five palaces, with 330 buildings in total. Next up this morning is a visit to the National Museum of Contemporary Korean History for insights into how Korea propelled itself from being an agricultural society to the modern economic powerhouse that it is today. This afternoon, we visit Cheonggyecheon Stream which flows through downtown Seoul and offers a peaceful oasis amidst the hustle and bustle of the city. After Tapgol Park, we walk down into Insadong, a neighbourhood steeped in tradition and a great place to see Korea culture and explore traditional arts and crafts. We continue to the neighbouring Ikseon-dong Hanok Village famous for its traditional houses, cafes, pubs and restaurants. We take a stroll through Myeongdong to learn more about K-pop culture through local themed shops and locations often featured in dramas and music videos. Finally we end the day at Gwangjang Market, one of the oldest and largest traditional markets in Korea. The most popular section of the market is the food street that caters to a wide range of menus like gimbap, mung bean pancake, tteok-bokki and eomuk. It's time for a taste of traditional Korean cuisine. After the food sampling, take the subway back to the hotel."

      "title": "Visit the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ). Free afternoon",
      "description": ": Today we experience one of the last frontiers of the Cold War - the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) that separates North and South Korea - an area where over a million soldiers remain on high alert on either side. The Korean War has never technically or officially ended - and this geo-political fault line is still raw for the people of Korea. We make an early start this morning, leaving at around 7am and the bus ride to the DMZ takes a little over one hour. Our Tour Leader stays behind, military clearance is obtained for all visitors, you will need to bring your passport along with you and we join into a larger group of day trippers as we are escorted by the military right into the DMZ. Our next stop is underground to explore the Third Infiltration Tunnel built by the North into South Korea with the aim to breach the border. This was found by accident - the tunnel is wide enough for 2000 troops an hour to pass through and is just 1 of 4 that were subsequently discovered. We also visit Imjingak Park, the DMZ Museum and the Dora Observatory. Please be aware that due to the nature of the area visited this excursion may be cancelled at short notice depending on the security situation. Please note that the Joint Security Area (JSA, often referred to as the Truce Village or Panmunjom) is currently closed to visitors due to tensions. This is the only area where the North and South Korean forces stand face-to-face, and diplomatic meetings happen. If the situation changes and we are able to visit the JSA, please note that you must be respectfully dressed, no jeans or sandals are allowed nor can you make any arm or hand gestures as visitors are closely monitored (and photographed) by the North Koreans for propaganda purposes. The rest of the afternoon is at leisure. There is the option to continue your Seoul exploration with the Tour Leader for a visit to Naksan Park to see and walk for an hour or two alongside Hanyangdoseong - a defensive city wall built more than 600 years ago."

      "title": "High speed train to Andong. Visit Hahoe Folk Village. Drive to Gyeongju",
      "description": ": We leave the capital this morning as we start our tour of South Korea with a two-hour ride on the high speed KTX train to Andong, a town that is often considered the spiritual and cultural heart of South Korea. Upon arrival we are met by our vehicle and our first visit is the scenic Buyongdae Cliff that offers stunning views of Hahoe Village, Nakdonggang River and surrounding mountains. Only accessible on foot, the walk up to the viewpoint takes about 10 minutes in each direction. Then it's time to explore the UNESCO-listed Hahoe Folk Village - known for its well-preserved Joseon Dynasty architecture, including its thatched-roof houses and tile-roofed mansions. Continue to the fascinating Mask Museum which is home to a collection of over 800 masks from over 50 countries. The masks are displayed in five exhibition halls, each of which focuses on a different region or culture. Our next stop is the 500-year old Byeongsan-seowon Confucian Academy - renowned for its stunning architectural design and the harmony between the buildings and the natural landscape. Finally we drive two hours further south to Gyeongju, our base for the next three nights. Once the capital of the ancient kingdom of Silla, the Gyeongju elite ruled over much of the Korean Peninsula between the 7th and 9th centuries. If your hotel is located on Lake Bosun, it is worth noting that there is a footpath around the lake which makes for a pleasant stroll or run."

      "title": "Morning Namsan Mountain Hike. Afternoon visit to Gyeongju Museum and Tumuli Park",
      "description": ": South Korea is a naturally beautiful country and this morning we aim to experience nature with a hike on Namsan Mountain - also home to over 100 temples, 80 stone Buddha statues and 60 stone pagodas. The three-hour hiking route follows a well-maintained trail, covers approximately 6km/4miles in distance and there are 465 metres/1525 feet of ascent and descent and we have graded the walk as Moderate. You can get more details from the Tour Leader and decide on the day but you may choose to opt out of this and spend the morning at leisure in Gyeongju. We take a break for lunch at a local restaurant to try some Korean food. For example in summer this could be Gyeongju Milmyeon, a popular local dish with chewy wheat noodles in a refreshing cold broth, perfect for hot days. This afternoon, we are back in Gyeongju and we start off with a visit to the National Museum for a comprehensive insight into the art, culture and history of the Silla dynasty - one of the longest in Asian history. In the Daereungwon tomb complex in Tumuli Park, we to take a stroll and pay respects to the Silla rulers. We'll also see Cheomseongdae observatory and Family Choi's House, the oldest house in the area built in the 1600s."

      "title": "Morning visit to Gyeongju Seokguram Grotto. Afternoon Golgulsa Temple Experience",
      "description": ": After a leisurely breakfast, we drive to visit Seokguram Grotto which is a part of the Bulguksa temple complex, one of the most famous and important Buddhist temples in Korea. The temple was first built during the Silla Dynasty and destroyed by fire during the Japanese invasions of Korea in the 16th century. It was rebuilt in the 17th century, however many original buildings and treasures were lost. After some time for lunch we continue to Golgulsa Temple for a memorable temple experience. This will give you the unique opportunity to experience the simple, yet rewarding, lifestyle of Korean Buddhist monks. There will be the chance to learn about and participate in activities such as archery, meditation and Sunmudo - a meditative martial art that combines spiritual elements such as meditation, yoga and qigong with dynamic striking and defensive techniques. In the early evening we will have a simple vegetarian dinner at the temple before driving back towards our hotel. If time allows, we will end with a walk on Woljeong Bridge, an historical gateway connecting the royal palaces of Silla to the south."

      "title": "Visit Bulguksa Temple. Drive to Busan. City tour",
      "description": ": After breakfast and checkout, we return to Bulguksa Temple to visit the main temple group. Continuing south we drive one and a half hours to Busan, which sits on the beautiful south coast. A busy port city renowned for its beaches, mountains and delicious seafood, Busan grew rapidly during the fighting phase of the Korean War (1950-53) as the de facto capital of the south. Today it has a similar modern spirit to Seoul but is defined and differentiated by its links to the sea. Upon arrival we hit the ground running and start our tour with a visit to the United Nations Memorial Cemetery, a significant and poignant site commemorating the Korean War where we can pay respects to the fallen soldiers but also gain a deeper understanding of the conflict. Moving on, we visit the colourful and tightly-knit houses of Gamcheon Cultural Village - a neighbourhood originally settled by wartime refugees. Next we see some of the beaches and coastline that Busan is known for with a scenic walk on a raised walkway along the coastline of Dongbaekseom Island (island of camellias) - located at the right end of famous Haeundae Beach. If time permits we will try to catch the sunset at Dalmaji Hill, with panoramic views of Haeundae Beach. The walk to the viewpoint takes about 30 minutes each way. Please note that the order of visits today can change according to our hotel location and end point."

      "description": ": The morning has been left free for you to relax and enjoy Busan. If you are interested there is the option to delve into the world of local cuisine! Immerse yourself in a cooking class (minimum 4 clients) where you'll learn the secrets of authentic regional specialties. The instructors will guide you through each step with clear English instructions and demonstrations. After the class, you'll be treated to lunch featuring the dishes you've prepared. Another option is to be introduced to the diverse world of Korean alcohol with a visit to a traditional brewery which specialises in making its own makgeolli - a lightly sparkling rice wine. The brewing, straining and tasting should take around 80 minutes and a minimum of 5 clients is required. We regroup this afternoon and continue exploring Busan with a visit to Gukje Market - one of the oldest markets in the city. Just a short walk from Gukje Market is Jagalchi Fish Market, which is South Korea's largest seafood market. It's an excellent opportunity to experience the local seafood culture.

We finish on a historical, poignant and moving note at the 5-18 Memorial Park and May 18th National Cemetery. These sites honour the victims of the 1980 Gwangju Uprising and the accompanying museum features informative exhibits about this important historical event."
