  "generalInfo": "There are actually three ‘Stans’ being covered on this extraordinary sixteen day holiday: Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, Silk Road countries that boast so much history and culture they can be overwhelming. Which is why we carefully crafted this itinerary to capture these evocative countries in the best way possible. <br/><br/>Starting in Tajikstan, in the capital city of Dushanbe, formerly ‘Stalinabad’, you can still see plenty of Soviet influences in architecture, with the Museum of Antiquities taking you back to times well before that too. As  does the nearby fort town of Gissar, which dates back to the 16th century.  Heading west, we start to witness some of the country’s great landscapes, such  the stunning, opal blue Iskander-Kul Lake in the Fann Mountains, part of the Gissar Range. <br/><br/>More ancient stops along the Silk Road await in Tajikstan, including Istaravshan which still has a craft and artisan trading quarter today, and so we take time to explore the maze of workshops from woodworkers to blacksmiths. Over the border in Uzbekistan, another of the most important Silk Road cites is Samarkand, which we visit after stopping in the fascinating if less aesthetically appealing capital of Tashkent. More historic elegance is to be found in Bukhara, a city of medieval magnificence. In contrast, the country’s desert landscapes are a wonderful place to spend a night camping and also explore ruined forts, as well as the walled city of Khiva. Khiva, unlike the other ancient towns and cities in the region, still seems utterly stopped in time from the minute you walk through the ancient gates of Ichan Qala and into its old town. <br/><br/>The third and final country on this cultural journey is Turkmenistan, where there are many fascinating and fantastic sites to explore. For the former, the ancient ruins at UNESCO World Heritage Site of Merv and the mausoleums of Konye-Urgench are eye opening. But for the latter, few things beat the flaming gas crater of Darwaza. We spend a night camping here in order to take in all of its bizarre beauty: a natural gas field that collapsed into a cavern known locally as the \"Door to Hell\", it glows and burns all year round, like the earth’s coolest fire pit. <br/><br/><br/>",
