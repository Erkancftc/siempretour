  "generalInfo": "On this short tour we visit three islands of the Cape Verde archipelago, brimming with rich culture, customs and history, and still firmly connected to their African roots. Discovering traditional villages, travelling through rugged mountain scenery and exploring cities on foot we uncover some of the most enchanting parts of this unusual island nation.<br/><br/>Starting in Praia, Santiago, we fly to Sao Vicente and explore the city of Mindelo, rich with the rhythms of Cape Verde and a good place to absorb the country’s unique atmosphere. From here we take the ferry across to neighbouring Santo Antão, dotted with imposing peaks, and with pretty valleys and rural villages to explore. Finally, we return to Santiago, taking time to wander through the capital city, Praia and the historic site of Cidade Velha, dating back to the 15th century and the first days of Portuguese colonisation.<br/><br/> The islands boast lush greenery and breathtaking landscapes, with stunning viewpoints offering great views over the archipelago. Each has a slightly different feel, giving an overview of the different layers and complexities of this most far-flung part of the African continent.",
