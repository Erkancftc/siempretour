After lunch, depart on scenic drive Northwest wards through the beautiful, terraced hillsides that display Rwanda’s landscape. Arrive at Ruhengeri, the base for gorilla trekking at the Parc National des Volcans. The town itself is located only 25km from Uganda boarder, is relatively a small city of about 70,000 people. The constant flow of humanity is quite remarkable. The Town has great views of the surrounding volcanoes. People are very friendly here and although a former Belgian colony (and thus French-speaking), many people speak English here. OVERNIGHT: VIRUNGA LODGE"

      "description": "GORILLA TREKKING Today after an early breakfast you will drive a short distance to the park headquarters for a briefing where you will be assigned a family of gorillas to visit. The trek takes about 2 to 4 hrs. When visiting the ‘Land of a thousand Hills, one should not miss out on the magnificent opportunity to visit Volcanoes National Park consisting of 125 km2 of mountain forest and home to the six Virunga Volcanoes and the world-famous mountain gorillas. Protected within the PNV, the lushly forested slopes of the mountains form an appropriately dramatic natural setting for what is arguably the most poignant and memorable wildlife experience in the world: gorilla trekking. The exhilarating climb to the gorilla’s natural habitat of shady bamboo forest offers fantastic views in all directions, before the trackers are immersed in the mysterious intimacy of the rainforest, alive with the calls of colorful birds and the chattering of rare golden monkey. Nothing can prepare one for the impact of encountering a fully-grown silverback gorilla, up to three times the size of an average man, yet remarkably peaceable and tolerant of human visitors. Please remember to bring your passport for registration, appropriate waterproof hiking boots, and a light raincoat. To protect from stinging nettles, we recommend long pants and long-sleeved tops. A pair of old gardening gloves can help grabbing onto the vegetation while most hotels/lodges provide a walking stick that come in very handy especially when hiking downhill. A small waterproof backpack is an excellent idea to carry a light snack, bottled water as well as protection for your camera. Upon sighting the gorillas, you spend the allowed one hour with them as they go about their daily life; feeding, moving, playing, raising their young and sometimes wrestling with the juveniles – it is a totally unique and unforgettable experience! OVERNIGHT: VIRUNGA LODGE"
