The trek takes about 2 to 4 hrs. When visiting the ‘Land of a thousand Hills, one should not miss out on the magnificent opportunity to visit Volcanoes National Park consisting of 125 km2 of mountain forest and home to the six Virunga Volcanoes and the world-famous mountain gorillas. Protected within the PNV, the lushly forested slopes of the mountains form an appropriately dramatic natural setting for what is arguably the most poignant and memorable wildlife experience in the world: gorilla trekking. The exhilarating climb to the gorilla’s natural habitat of shady bamboo forest offers fantastic views in all directions, before the trackers are immersed in the mysterious intimacy of the rainforest, alive with the calls of colorful birds and the chattering of rare golden monkey. Nothing can prepare one for the impact of encountering a fully-grown silverback gorilla, up to three times the size of an average man, yet remarkably peaceable and tolerant of human visitors. Please remember to bring your passport for registration, appropriate waterproof hiking boots, and a light raincoat. To protect from stinging nettles, we recommend long pants and long-sleeved tops. A pair of old gardening gloves can help grabbing onto the vegetation while most hotels/lodges provide a walking stick that come in very handy especially when hiking downhill. A small waterproof backpack is an excellent idea to carry a light snack, bottled water as well as protection for your camera. Upon sighting the gorillas, you spend the allowed one hour with them as they go about their daily life; feeding, moving, playing, raising their young and sometimes wrestling with the juveniles – it is a totally unique and unforgettable experience!

    "generalInfo": "There aren't many tour operators working within the forests of Rwanda and Uganda which offer quite as extensive an amount of time in the presence of mountain gorillas and chimpanzees as you’ll find in the 11 day tailor made itinerary below. <br/><br/>We include not one but two gorilla tracking days; one in Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park in Uganda and one in the famous Volcanoes National Park in Rwanda. <br/><br/>By visiting these two parks and spending a couple of hours with the gorillas you will be able to compare the differences between habitats, behaviours and populations. Bwindi is more tropical than Volcanoes and the gorillas here seem intermediary as they travel between the eastern lowland populations in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the ‘true’ mountain gorillas of the Virungas, further south. <br/><br/>Some scientists are prepared to list the Bwindi population as a new sub-species which would make them the rarest type of primate on the planet. You will probably see around 20 individual gorillas, this corresponds with 2-3% of the global population. When you think about it like that you realise the importance of conservation for these magnificent animals and how privileged you'll be witnessing them first- hand.<br/><br/>We also follow a group of around 150 habituated chimps from dawn to see them rise and go about their daily business until they start to make their nests and settle for the night. You will follow the dominate males and their females and infants as they feed, play, rest, groom and possibly hunt (a hunt occurs roughly once a month). This is the best way to see chimps exhibit a range of behaviours and experience how scientists study this amazing ape.<br/><br/>As well as spending some magical time with mountain gorillas and chimps we will also aim to observe over 10 species of primates, including: red-tailed monkeys, black-and-white colobus, golden monkeys, blue monkeys, Uganda red colobus, Uganda mangabey and Demidoff’s dwarf galago.<br/> <br/>This tour is a must for anyone who has ever wanted to walk in the footsteps of the great primatologists Dian Fossey and Jane Goodall. And you can rest assured that you are directly contributing to the continued research and conservation ethics of these primate pioneers. <br/><br/>All in all this really is the most comprehensive primate tour of Africa and one which will not disappoint.<br/><br/>Fitness levels required:<br/><br/>The trekking for gorillas can be strenuous as the conditions may be muddy and steep. We have no real way of knowing how far away the gorilla families will be so there could be a hike of up to 4 hours until we come across the gorillas. So a good level of fitness is required and participants must be used to walking. The chimpanzee full day habituation experience requires a good level of fitness as the walking will be through hot and humid dense rainforest. Chimps can move quickly through the forest and to follow them can mean marches for 30mins, or so, until we catch up with them again. The experience can finish whenever you wish but we can be there for 12 hours, so be prepared for a long day walking through the forest. The gorilla tracking in Bwindi National Park (Uganda) can be between 1 and 4 hours and the ridges here are very steep, the tracking in Volcanoes National Park (Rwanda) can also be between 1 and 4 hours long and include steep climbs. Both places are dense with vegetation and the weather can be either cool and wet or hot and sunny. We require all guests to be aware of the physical effort needed to see wild chimps and gorillas and require everyone to have a good level of fitness and be used to hill walking.<br/><br/>Equipment list:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; but as a rule of thumb we recommend you bring along your own binoculars or spotting scope (although this is not always very useful in the forests) as well as appropriate clothing; which should be hard wearing clothing which you do not mind getting muddy. Long trousers and long sleeved shirts are a good idea as the vegetation in the forests can be spiny and there are some stinging nettles. Travelling shorts and short sleeves are also recommended. The nights can be chilly so a fleece is not a bad idea. Waterproofs, including ponchos, are essential. Comfortable and broken in waterproof walking boots with ankle supports are a must. Insect repellent is needed. Any medication, books or other items of a personal nature is of course up to you to bring along. Oh and please bring plenty of memory cards or film for your camera. Also do not forget sun cream, sun hat and sun glasses as the sun can be very strong here during the day.<br/><br/>Minimum age: 15 years old<br/><br/><br/>",

Today you will enjoy one of the most spectacular and amazing wildlife experiences in the world – a full day chimpanzee habituation tour. This tour will give you significantly more time with the wild chimps than most other tours, as we attempt to meet up with the chimps as they de-nest and begin their daily routines (around 05:00-6:00am). The joy of this habituation tour is that we can spend all day with wild chimps and not leave until they create their new nests for the night (about 18:00pm). Spending your first full day in the rainforest is an unforgettable experience and one which will make you eager for more. You will gain first hand experience of how the researchers continue to make ground breaking discoveries of chimp behaviour and by spending the full day here you will get as close to and see as much incredible behaviour of wild chimps than you would anywhere else in the world.

This area of Kibale Forest National Park is called Ishasha and is famous for its tree-climbing lions. Here you will stop along the way for game that we can see along this road. This wildlife is more typical of the rolling plains of Kenya and Tanzania before continuing on to Bwindi Forest in the afternoon. You will pass by traditional villages and stunning panoramic views of the Virunga Mountains (the area has been called the ‘Switzerland of Africa’ and it is an awe-inspiring landscape. Once you arrive at your lodge, you will have your evening meal in the knowledge that you have arrived in the home of the endangered and impressive mountain gorilla.

After an early start you will begin your exciting hike through this beautiful rainforest. The trek will be led by expert local trackers who have spent years finding the forest’s gentle giants and once we find the gorillas you will have around 1 hour in their presence. The length of trek in the park is dependent on a few factors like the weather, trail conditions and how far the gorillas have moved since the previous day. Sometimes it can only take 2 hours and sometimes 8 hours (there and back), but one thing is for sure; when we do see the gorillas at close quarters you will be having one of the greatest experiences anyone can ever have! With only around 700-750 wild mountain gorillas left, it is an incredible experience and one which is helping to pay for their continued protection against poaching and deforestation. Once you return to the accommodation and after your lunch you will have the opportunity to try some of the shorter forest walks with guides and try your luck at finding some of the smaller forest primates.

Mountain gorillas have been monitored and studied closely since Dian Fossey began her work with them in 1967, after establishing the Karisoke Research Center. She started the process of habituating them to the presence of human observers so that she could closely observe and document their behaviors, status, movements and other important information.

Following the safety briefing you’ll climb into your canoes and head down to the river. The river banks are abundant with birds, over 40 species have been recorded, and it’s a great way to observe the countryside and see Rwanda from a different perspective.

Take a short drive to Kinigi, which is 12km away and where the Volcanoes National Park headquarters is located, you need to be there by 7am or you risk invalidating your precious permits! You will meet your park guide who will take time to explain where you will be trekking, which gorilla group you have been assigned, and the guidelines you needed to follow when in the mountain gorilla’s presence. Around 8am you will start the trek through the fields towards the park. The trek in the park is at elevations of 2500-3000m, so at times breathing can become a conscious effort as you move through the thick vegetation towards the gorillas. Excitement mounts as you approach the group. Your guide will reassure and calmed the gorillas with deep grunts, and you will be encouraged to do the same. Spending time in the mountain gorilla’s presence is truly incredible. After your trek you will return to the park headquarters. You will then enjoy lunch nearby before making the return journey to Kigali. The drive is approximately 2 hours. Overnight Heaven Boutique (or similar)"

    "generalInfo": "Ideal for travellers with little time, but who don’t want to compromise on their wildlife experiences, this Rwanda primate safari offers an unforgettable encounter with man’s closest cousins, the mountain gorillas of Volcanoes National Park. And, before your six days are up, you’ll also trek into the Nyungwe Forest in search of cheeky, chattering chimpanzees, and see a host of monkey species including colobus, golden and L’Hoest’s monkeys as they play among the trees.<br/><br/>Begin in Kigali, the Rwandan capital, with a moving visit to the Genocide Memorial, marking the genocide of 1994 when up to 800,000 Tutsi people were murdered by armed Hutu militias. You’ll also visit craft markets, and have time to explore the city a little to see how its youthful population has come together in reconciliation – not least through civic pride. <br/><br/>From the capital you’ll embark on the 200km (five hour) drive to Nyungwe Forest National Park. On arrival, you’ll get an atmospheric introduction to the forest as you head up on a canopy walk, to learn about life among the treetops. It’s an entirely different experience to walking along trails on the ground, with different species present, and amazing views. There are some 13 primate species in Nyungwe Forest, along with 300-odd bird species, and many colourful butterflies. The biodiversity on display is spectacular meaning that your nature hikes, led by expert local guides, are bound to reveal some wonderful sights. A second day in Nyungwe Forest will be spent trekking in search of a habituated chimpanzee group to watch as they eat, play and groom themselves. You’ll have just an hour with the troop to minimise disruption on their lives, which is plenty for them but sadly never enough for visitors!<br/><br/>Another long journey awaits after your chimpanzee trekking as you make for your final stop: Volcanoes National Park. Here you’ll spend an hour with a family of mountain gorillas. Their calm demeanour belies their immense size and strength, and this will likely prove one of the most unforgettable travel experiences you’ll ever have. Trekking out to find the gorillas can be challenging due to the terrain and the fact they move around constantly, so it can take an hour to find them, or much longer. But you can travel with porters, and if you’re relatively fit you shouldn’t have too much trouble.<br/><br/>Finally, as you head back to Kigali, you’ll stop off for a visit to a ‘gorilla guardians village’ – a great way to understand the effort that goes into protecting these incredible animals, and find out how your holiday has contributed to their ongoing survival.",

The forest is perhaps best experienced with an inspiring, but dizzying, canopy walk through the trees. From the park you’ll go to Cyamudongo Forest, a small fragment of nearby forest surrounded by tea plantations. This forest is smaller than Nyungwe National Park, making is an even better place to track and then spot chimpanzees on a walking tour.<br/><br/>From here you’ll head to Lake Kivu, a vast, peaceful body of water between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The best way to experience it is by boat – whether you’re kayaking, or going by motorboat to meet the fishermen heading out from Rubavu to fish for the night, singing as they go. You’ll camp on the lakeshore – look out for bats flitting overhead at dusk.<br/><br/>The Virunga Volcanoes are next on the horizon. Your trip culminates with a visit to Virunga National Park’s most famous residents. After tracking down a gorilla family your permit will allow you an hour sitting with a gorilla group high in the mountains. You’ll learn how to approach the gorillas; once you’re in their midst, you’ll be mesmerised.<br/><br/>This tour doesn’t just show you Rwanda’s big hitters. After exploring Kigali, you’ll go on to Muhanga village, where you can spend the night at a homestay, help around the village and get to know your hosts. You’ll also get to visit lesser-explored areas – such as the Mukungwa River, where you’ll probably be the only people birdwatching from your canoes, and the farmlands outside of Musanze, where exploring by electric bike means you can stop and meet people as you explore the area.<br/><br/>The price of this trip includes the price of a low season permit to meet the gorillas. The money you pay for this permit funds important research projects, healthcare, and ongoing protection of the mountain gorillas – once you meet them, you’ll know this was money well spent.<br/>",

Distinct from their cousins who live in the open spaces and lowland forests of West Africa, mountain gorillas are found at an altitude of between 1520m and 3650m.

The journey involves crossing from Uganda into Rwanda at the Cyanika border crossing which typically takes around an hour to navigate through. Home to a population of mountain gorillas as, we'll focus our wildlife viewing to the endangered golden monkey. Volcanoes National park currently hosts two habituated golden monkey troops which we will visit either on the afternoon of day seven or on day eight. Our lodge for the next two nights is situated in expansive gardens, with individual cottages fitted with fires to take the chill out of the evening air. The scenery is here is spectacular, with dense forests spanning 160 squared km and the towering Virunga volcano range dominating the park, the highest of which is over 4500 meters. Upon arrival into Valconoes National Park we will make a stop at the Ellen Degeneres Campus, a world-class research and education centre focusing on conservation and protection of the endangered Mountain Gorilla. The exhibition centre was opened in 2022 and is building upon the incredible conservatrion work by Dian Fossey (made famous by National Geographic and the blockbuster movie Gorillas In The Mist) and features a selection of displays, cinemas and ai generated gorilla activities. The visit to the campus is free, but donations are always welcome and encouraged."

We'll be picked up from our lodge early and meet up with our ranger guide at the park head quarters. Golden monkey live in the bamboo thickets located towards the base of the volcano. Typically it takes around an hour to reach the troop, however it can take longer depending on their exact location. Unlike gorillas, they tend not to go into the higher altitudes, so the trekking time is considerably less than the gorilla trek in Bwindi. The endangered golden monkey live in troops of around 30-80 individuals, typically precided over by a dominant male. It is thought that there are only around 2,500-3,000 golden monkey left in the world. They mainly feed on bamboo shoots , lichens and leaves. They are very active jumping from tree to tree which can make them challenging to photograph. We trek in groups of up to eight people so depending on the size of our group we may need to split into two groups. We will have an hour with these magnificent primates, before returning to our lodge in Kinigi. The rest of the day is left free for you to explore the local villagers, or perhaps pay a visit to The Iby'Iwacu Cultural Village, a sustainable local cooperative displaying a wide variety of crafts, art and houseware all made by locals. If you are looking for a more active option this afternoon your leader will be able to make recommendations for optional walks in the area or you can simply just relax back at the lodge."

This wheelchair accessible holiday to Rwanda ensures that you can admire these incredible, gentle creatures in their natural habitat as well as exploring many other parts of a truly fascinating African country.<br/><br/>Reaching the gorillas in Volcanoes National Park involves traversing mountainous landscape thick with vegetation, but if you are not able to trek yourself, porters are available to carry you in a throne chair, and also to carry your own wheelchair, out to wherever the gorillas are currently located. Keep in mind that the journey can be uncomfortable at times, and that getting to the gorillas can take several hours, but when you’re sat there just a few metres away from them you’ll be immensely pleased that you made the effort. Watching our close cousins as they feed, groom and play with their little ones, aware of your presence and perhaps curious, is an amazing experience.<br/><br/>While this is certain to be the highlight of your holiday, perhaps the most memorable holiday you’ll ever take, it’s certainly not the only attraction in Rwanda. You will also spend a tranquil day relaxing on the shore of Lake Kivu, explore the stunning Nyungwe Forest National Park, home to chimpanzees, monkeys and countless bird species, and gain a deeper understanding of the infamous Rwandan genocide while visiting the capital, Kigali. <br/><br/>As this is a tailormade and wheelchair accessible holiday, the operator will work with you before departure to ensure that your needs are met in every respect from accommodation to transport and suitable restaurants. Naturally you will need to be flexible at times, but you can expect the adventure of a lifetime. <br/>",

Most of the narrative remains undocumented as so much of the 1994 genocide went unseen. But this isn't a country fixated on the past, rather, one that shares an optimistic future. Land in Kigali and you will immediately encounter its modernity and fresh thinking. Plastic bags are illegal, boulevards draw comparisons with Paris, and there's an unexpected affluence that cascades across the city. Your hotel is the centerpiece of this prosperity, a historical residence that remains the luxurious heart of the country. The transition has been remarkable, and a half-day tour of the city tour helps you to unravel not only the past but also the optimism and enthusiasm that has steered the country since 1994. A guide will lead you to the National Genocide Memorial Centre, which will provide an excellent background to how such atrocities developed as you look back some 30 years before the genocide. Personal testimonies and photos are incredibly powerful while hundreds of thousands are buried in mass graves at the memorial. Thought-provoking and sometimes haunting, the memorial can be an intensely moving and emotional place. At the end of a half-day city tour, it is also imbued with inspiration.

Along the way, you will stop at two of the nationwide genocide memorials. These are churches where the atrocities took place, damp rooms with blown-out walls and human bones stacked in silent respect. Again, just meeting the memorials' guides and talking openly is a very inspiring experience and a showcase of where Rwanda came from and how far it has come. You will stop in Butare, the former colonial capital of Rwanda, where a variety of early 20th-century buildings remain, including a large Cathedral from 1900. Stop for lunch and then visit the National Museum of Rwanda, widely regarded as the finest museum in East Africa. No punches are held back as the museum explores a cultural and colonial history beginning as Rwanda was declared part of the German Empire four years before any European had even set foot in the country.

Trails are untouched as just a handful of daily visitors head deep into the realm of Nyungwe. The primates are very different to those elsewhere in East Africa, particularly those that come from the Congo basin such as the L'Hoest's monkey, grey-cheeked mangabey, and the resplendent ruwenzori colobus. And as you move slowly through the forest, you will start to hear the chirps of another poignant character, a wild chimpanzee. Sightings are not 100% guaranteed, but local trackers have an excellent understanding of where these rare chimpanzees can be found. The sounds will guide you as the odd shout will echo back across the canopy. Clues are spotted, like the discarded nut shells on the floor or the broken branches still hanging low. The forest is thick, and only at the last moment do you see them. First one, with her human-like hands used to scamper away into the higher branches. Then all of the sudden you will see the whole troop, a dozen chimpanzees that are draped across old mahogany and ebony trees. Watch them interact and admire the behavior that feels so real it nearly becomes surreal. A couple will swing past you, and the comparisons are remarkable. It only takes a glance to realize that they are closely related to man, and after an hour, you will be convinced that the comparisons are almost absolute."

Two silverbacks lounge on the edges, their back fur as charismatic in color as a wizard's beard. A baby with a hairless head suckles on her mother, before being carried away on a broad back. Half a dozen gorillas playfully fight in the clearing, oblivious to your wavering camera. One has been left out, a gorilla with wrinkled eyes and a melancholy frown. Just to get here has been an experience as every step will take you deeper into the forest and away from any trail. Less than 1,000 mountain gorillas remain in the wild and around half of these occupy this particular forest. This realm is untrammeled, and the inaccessibility has helped to preserve these final few mountain gorillas. For an hour, you will watch and marvel at the facial features and the subtle interactions as you admire the faces permanently sketched with emotion. A gorilla will pull down a piece of fruit and start to eat, and you will know how it tastes by the primate's scrunched-up nose and momentary surprise. A young gorilla will crawl powerfully across the clearing and then stop to give you a curious stare, and then show you what he thinks through a series of facial twitches. These are wild mountain gorillas, and you will be replaying these individual moments for years to come."

        "description": "In far Northwestern Rwanda, the gorillas are not the only primates cut off from the world. Rural communities continue their ancient lifestyles and traditions as they sow the fields wearing colorful wraps and endearing smiles. These are not communities that reflect the typical African clichés, and you will enjoy the surprises. You will visit a community that sees very few tourists and a local guide will help to unravel a true portrait of village life. You will see the local school and feel the warmth of the welcome as you explore a church and the contrasting approaches to religion. Taste local beer and enjoy a typical local lunch as you visit the village elders and gain perspective on how decisions are made here. You will likely share something of yourself too, for this is a cultural experience for both you and the community. Rather than being a place to point the camera, it's a village where you will first make friends, and then watch as the whole community wants to pose for your lens."

        "description": "Go gorilla trekking a second time and you will see a different troop. This time, there may be only one silverback and this gorilla’s muscled arms will tear down trees as his broad chest dominates the landscape, and his humongous hands will slowly wrap around the branches. It's enough to make you involuntarily step back, but the guide will catch you and ensure that you do not show fear by backing off. Spend your hour with the troop and follow the individuals as they respond to the silverback's grunts. Relationships are spotted as you see a mother nurturing her son, a female tempting the silverback, a baby seeking attention but finding none. Everyone who goes gorilla trekking returns to the lodge to discuss tales of what they saw, and it is remarkable how different these tales can be. By going twice, you can double the sights found in this surreal forest. Gorilla trekking can be physically demanding, although it's worth noting that the actual trek is usually shorter in Rwanda than in Uganda. Groups are allocated predominantly on fitness levels and interest, rather than the actual troops. It is impossible to request to visit a particular troop, as their location is always unknown until you arrive at the trailhead. Instead, the guides will allocate the groups to troops based on the estimated length of the trek. Feel free to request the longest or shortest hike and you will be accommodated. Realistically, expect to walk between one and three hours before you see the gorillas. The distance covered is relatively short, but the terrain makes it slow going, especially as the guides often have to slice through the undergrowth to create the trail. A maximum of eight visitors are allocated to one gorilla troop, and officially you can come to within seven meters of the primates. In reality, the troops' playful behavior means that there are times when you are closer. Each permit and gorilla trek will provide for one hour, and visitors will find that this is generously controlled by the guides. You are not on a strict clock as these are wild animals, and the gorillas' behavior is as important as the time on a watch."

Elephants are at the waterhole in front, but a herd of buffalo can often be seen marching behind the vehicle as a hyena scampers off into the distance. It is usually not long before you spot lions, a pride of them with clear eyes staring out from the grass, and it is never long before you meet the rhinos of the conservancy. Large southern white rhinos plow past, full of power and pride while around half their size but a similar color, the black rhinos are more bashful, seen hiding in the bushes. Only a couple of thousand of these critically endangered creatures still lives in the wild with more than a hundred of these in Pejeta. You may then soon see the world’s rarest rhino as the final three northern white rhinos are another of this conservancy’s highlights. Over your time spent here, there are different ways to explore this thrilling little conservancy in the heart of Kenya, home to much more than just the Big Five. Track leopards and cheetahs, meet rescued chimpanzees, take a game walk into the land of the giants, and celebrate the rawness of Africa. Few places have such diversity of life in such a compact area, making Ol Pejeta an excellent introduction to the big-game safari experience. And after these two days, you will appreciate why safari is not just an afternoon activity or a full-day tour, but a fully immersive experience for all the senses."

        "description": "Rather remarkably, Ol Pejeta is home to more species than the Masai Mara. But the Mara is the legendary home of abundance, with more than a million wild mammals on the plains during the great wildebeest migration months of July to October. Astonishing herds of wildebeest can be spotted from your luxury camp, and sometimes you drive through tens of thousands of zebra, so it may feel as though every time you look up there are Thomson’s gazelle skipping about. You will be staying in Mara Naboisho, a private conservancy that’s adjacent to the Masai Mara National Reserve. Your time spent here will allow you to explore both the conservancy and the national reserve as both are destinations with their own unique highlights. Throughout your evenings, you can sit back at your luxury camp and listen to the soundtrack that perforates the canvas as you absorb the feeling of the Mara. Your safari program is flexible and with a three-day stay, your time will usually include one full day on a game drive in the national reserve. Time in the national reserve will give you an appreciation of the scale of the region as you drive past the herds to the crocodiles of the Mara River, followed by the different lion pride that comes down from the rocky outcrops. None of the landscape is fenced, so in the Mara Naboisho Conservancy, you may see similar animals, just without the other safari vehicles. You can also get closer as your guide is able to take you off the trails. A lion glances up with blood smattered across his mane, a leopard cub peeks out from the high grass, and you smell the decay as jackals battle with vultures. Every moment of a safari is different in the Masai Mara. With Masai warriors as your guides, you can also take a walk on the grasslands for a new dimension to the safari that provides a true indication of the animals’ size. Sunrise game drives give you a chance to watch the big cats hunt their prey, while picnics can be arranged at viewpoints that overlook the hippos. From your camp, you can watch elephant and giraffe roam past beneath the moonlight, while each morning you open the curtains to the grazing herds. Your time is dramatic and dazzling with three days in the most renowned of all Africa’s safari destinations."

Not really, because when you’re exploring the forest hiking trails, you will quickly get close enough to experience the differences between the primates.

Spend an hour with them and trek through the forest to hear their echoed shouts, snapping branches, and a flurry of activity that reverberates from afar. Get closer, and you will be compelled by their behavior as a large family troop jumps and swings through the trees. The similarities with humans are remarkable, so much so that you are searching for the contrasts rather than the similarities. A chimpanzee can look straight back at you, and there is a form of silent communication that gives you goosebumps. While you can see chimpanzees in other East African destinations, there is an additional thrill to this troop as they have only just been opened to human contact. After the trek, you will travel north to Volcanoes National Park, where your lodge is ideally situated for the next two days of gorilla trekking."

Following a tracker’s radio calls, your guide will veer off the narrow trails and into even denser forest, where a large gorilla troop is feeding on the branches. There will be a moment of silence and tension, your senses heightened as two gorillas stare back at you. Creep a little closer, and it will be at this moment that you realize what it means to be out in the wild with no barriers between you and the world’s largest primates. The gorillas are habituated, and they accept your presence, but that does not mean they are not nosy. They inspect their human visitors, with the infants and juveniles especially curious. Soon there are a dozen eyes looking your way, some from the branches above. A silverback emerges with such force in the arms and such an ability to command silence. He will soon crawl onwards, content that nobody is threatening his superiority. Turn around, and there’s another three gorillas, part of the troop that was previously unseen. With a mountain gorilla trek, you can spend an hour with a troop before trekking back to the trailhead. The next day, return to the same forest to trek to another family troop, with completely different behavior and characteristics to take in."

Compact and easy to explore, yet still very wild in feel, Ol Pejeta Conservancy provides an enduring first impression of the safari experience. A broad and diverse population of animals occupy the landscape, without any one particular species seen in huge abundance. On your first game drive, you will be quickly introduced to dozens of legends from the savanna and admire many of the animals that may have lured you to Africa in the first place. On an afternoon walking safari, you will get even closer to some as you walk across the plains that are populated by zebra, gazelle, wildebeest, buffalo, and even an elephant far in the distance. Like all premium conservancies, Ol Pejeta also has its standout experience with the greatest East African rhino population. Part of the day will be dedicated to these endangered greats with a conservationist leading the very personal experience. A nighttime game drive will immerse you in surprise with strange animals illuminated by your spotlight. And as you relax in a private villa, you will discover that safari is a perpetual experience with buffalo and zebra roaming past and the breathtaking roar of a lion perforating the nighttime stillness.

The Samburu are your guides, ancestral landowners with an incredible understanding of this wilderness that will lead you on walks, where the silence is exquisite before a herd of elephants hoots from half a mile away. The warriors will provide the experienced eyes on game drives and bring you through the dust and the dazzling endlessness of the valleys. Samburu is the classic evocation of wild Africa, the experience as much about the wilderness itself as the animals that populate it. You will explore with all of your senses as you both hear and smell the changes in the atmosphere as you feast your eyes on the views. Of course, animals thrive in such a place. They are not as concentrated as in Ol Pejeta, but every encounter will be enhanced by an almost haunting mystique. Take in the expressions shown on elephants migratory wanders, hear two male lions grunting loudly in a show of dominance, and watch an impala sensing danger with tension enlivening the air before you spot the prowling cheetah. With a private safari guide, you can explore on foot and on game drives through a landscape of surreal splendor that will become your adventure playground for two days. It will be impossible to predict the scenes you will follow as you watch a hunt play out over two hours, follow herds to busy waterholes, and find drama and charm as you discover a piece of Africa that is not populated by other safari vehicles."

A 90-minute flight will bring you from Samburu in the north direct to Mara Naboisho Conservancy in the south. You will quickly be enveloped by abundance as zebra cluster in huge herds for a jigsaw of black and white stripes that leaves you speechless. Wildebeest scatter for miles and are a constant on your panorama. Elephants wander, Thompson’s gazelle blur into the grass, and large pods of hippos gather in the water. Justifying its fame, the Masai Mara is one of Africa’s most iconic destinations, even if you are not traveling during the great wildebeest migration months of late-July to October. Mara Naboisho is a private conservancy that shares unfenced borders with the national reserve, but restricts access to a small number of guests and ensures your safari maintains a sense of privacy and intimacy. Along with the herds come the predators, perhaps beginning with a leopard on the move, disappearing into the long grass as she stalks gazelle. Multiple lion pride, lounging in the open in shows of lazy dominance come into your view while perched on a rock is a cheetah, elegant and enchanting as he surveys the plains. These are not sporadic encounters as on the Mara plains you will be engrossed by the battles between predator and prey. It will be impossible to count the number of hyenas over these two days as vultures circle, and you can watch scavengers deftly jump in for scraps. The Masai Mara responds to its fame, and the encounters are legendary with every moment a new impression of the plains that have delighted wildlife documentarians for decades.

A silverback cracks a branch, two gorillas are gnawing at tree bark, three are playing around in the higher branches, and now an infant comes crawling past. From a distance of seven meters, you will start to admire the intricacies of the troop with interactions between mother and child, so intimate and caring, facial expressions that reveal feeling like the mischievous grin from gorillas picking at the fruit. You will be deep in the rainforest and far from any vehicle or building, encountering a habituated troop after trekking along often muddy trails. With trekking group size capped to eight, it will feel as if it is just you and the gorillas and your eyes will not always know where to look. Should you focus on the exuberant youngster who stares back at you with a grin? Or at the silverback’s impressive power? Do you watch the family interactions in the trees above, or on the trail below? This is a powerful and personal experience, with nothing separating you from one of the world’s largest and more rare animals.

Both treks are enhanced by the time spent in the wild, not just about the animals but also the atmosphere of a thick and tangled rainforest that hasn’t changed for many millennia."

Boulevards are broad and clean, plastic bags are illegal, and you will be immediately taken in by the enthusiasm of the country. This is not a nation that looks backward; rather it is one that has pieced together a bright future full of energy, charm, and smiles. You will land at Kigali International Airport and be greeted by a local guide and driver. Begin with a stop in the capital city for lunch, and then make the two-hour journey by road to Volcanoes National Park with the opportunity to visit traditional villages while on the route. Rwanda will surprise you as a small country that abounds with rolling green hills that are hidden deep within the heart of Africa.

        "description": "On a gorilla trek, you will not just see the gorillas. The gorillas will see you. They may be habituated to human contact, but they are still completely wild and will carefully analyze every visitor they receive. One or two gorillas will provide a greeting, often waving their arms in a show of power, a firm notion that you must respect the troop’s boundaries. Deep-set black eyes stare directly at you and inspect you with a certain curiosity. Other gorillas become visible, particularly younger members of the troop. They will climb in the trees on all sides of you, sometimes crashing amongst the branches directly above your head. Gradually they will accept your presence, but the first moments are really special as you sense the silent communication that happens between yourself and the gorillas. It is an exhilarating trek to reach them, and you will slice through a jumbled forest and follow trails created by forest elephants and the gorillas themselves. No vehicles could ever penetrate here, and the trek is a major part of the experience, a rare chance to walk in the mostly unexplored equatorial rainforest. Trackers walk ahead of you and radio in the troop’s location. It is not uncommon to meet elephants on the trail, and there is an almost eerie atmosphere beneath the canopy. Locate the gorillas, and you can approach to within seven meters, a distance that is sometimes reduced when the gorillas take a few steps towards you. Along with your guide, you can settle in and savor the experience, spending an entire hour with the world’s largest primates. Eyes dance with emotion, and you can almost read the mood from a single glance. Mouths are expressive as if the gorillas are talking without uttering a sound. Sometimes they frown, perhaps from being unable to open a seed, or struggling to work out how to climb a particular tree. Sometimes their faces express pure joy and beam in the gloomy light within the forest. The gorillas forage and feed, nurture their young, and slip into old age gracefully. You will watch it all and come to understand the intricacies of their behavior as you marvel at just how close you can get. Walk out of the forest and spend the rest of the day relaxing at the lodge as you gaze out over the forest of the primates."

        "description": "You would be forgiven for thinking that Rwanda still reels from the horrors of genocide. After all, it was as recent as 1994 when a third of the population was murdered or left homeless. The National Genocide Memorial provides an overview of the events that triggered the genocide and then opens out onto a huge mass grave containing tens of thousands of bodies. A nearby memorial helps you understand what happened, with locals who survived the genocide narrating the story in a skeleton-strewn church. You will visit the memorials when returning to Kigali, and far from being depressing, they create profound respect for the Rwandan people and the modern country they have recreated. By visiting the memorials, you will quickly see how Rwanda’s message of reconciliation is one that the current world can learn from. Other potential places to visit today include the National Liberation Museum and some of the local markets dotted around Kigali. Spend the night at an iconic five-star hotel in the city, and take your dinner on a broad verandah and sip your drinks as the sunset rolls down on the hills."

        "description": "There is a direct connection between Rwanda and the Serengeti with a light aircraft link that saves what had previously been a full day of travel. Leave Kigali in the middle of the morning, and you will be on the world-famous grasslands in time for lunch, which is served at a special picnic spot overlooking the plains. Wildebeest are scattered in all directions, clusters of them coming together to form what could be one humongous herd. Zebra moves slowly, walking elegantly across the Serengeti. Elephants grace the horizon along with giraffe and a rowdy herd of buffalo. From one vantage point, there could be over 100,000 animals in your view; such is the openness of the landscape and the abundance of life. You can spend the afternoon on a game drive to cross large swathes of the Central Serengeti to watch the battles between predator and prey commence. Lions rest on kopjes, rocky outcrops that inspired a certain Disney movie. Get closer, and you will find the whole pride draped languidly across four different rocks. Return later in the day, and the pride is more active with lionesses ambling down into the grass, casting their eyes over a straggling herd of zebra. Thomson’s gazelle skips past, their ears pointing upwards and a moment later, you will see the cheetah hiding in the grass, waiting to pounce. In the Serengeti, you will never see animals in isolation as you will always witness the interactions between species and within herds, imbuing every single moment with a sense of drama. When you stop at your luxury camp to relax, the encounters will continue as both big cats and ungulates are seen and heard from the camp verandah."

        "description": "Wake to strange sounds as a low growl floats on the morning breeze as a male lion asserts his dominance. Head out on the game drive, and you will see why as the male is seeking to mate with a lone lioness. He is quick to growl again, ensuring the driver does not take you too close to his romantic hideout. Later on the drive, you will get much closer to the lions as four of them approach the safari vehicle to circle it with a look of curiosity before wandering onwards onto the plains. At some moments, they will be barely two meters away, looking up at you with fierce eyes. Continuing your game drive, you will see a pride of bachelor lions where three young males show the scars of battle, their bloodied wounds infected by insects. It would take many months to see the vast Serengeti ecosystem, but your several days spent here gives you a good amount of time to track the herds and see big cats on a hunt. It will not just be the lions, as leopards are also found in legendary abundance here, skillfully camouflaged in the trees or in the grass. Sometimes you will find a cheetah resting, perched on a low rock or rocking itself to sleep in the high grass. Other times, the cheetah is moving with a long neck dipping beyond detection. Hyenas are seemingly everywhere, strange-looking creatures that will give you a menacing snarl. By contrast, jackals are almost adorable in appearance as they follow the smell of fresh carcasses with zeal. You are virtually guaranteed to see all these cats on a multi-day safari in the Serengeti, and it is common to see them on the move."

        "description": "The rumble of hoofs will wake you at sunrise with a drumbeat that echoes long across the plains. In total, there are close to two million four-legged mammals in the Serengeti, mostly wildebeest, zebra and Thomson’s gazelle. Many of these form the great wildebeest migration, an annual journey that continually takes them to different pastures. There is no wrong time to see this as the experience simply changes dependent on the month of the year. Whenever you visit the Serengeti, there will be astonishing numbers of zebra and wildebeest, seen in giant herds. So the rumble of hoofs is part of the daily experience. Today the full-day game drive will bring you south and away from the rocks towards the flattest and most iconic area of the park. The panoramas extend to show nothing but grass, grass, grass, and the animals that feed on it. Most of the predators do not follow the migration, preferring instead to protect their home territory with only the hyenas maintaining the stamina to keep pace with the herds. The Southern Serengeti is where the wildebeest raise their calves from January to March, making it probably the easiest place in Africa for cats to get a meal. Visit during these months, and it will be a frenzied fest of hunting. Outside of these months, there is a wonderful drama as the cats must scrap for more meager resources. Any time of year brings real wildlife theater in the south of the Serengeti National Park."

There is never any interruption to your connection with nature, from the wild nighttime soundtrack that keeps you company to the buffalo grazing next to your tent. There are few better places to wake up and eat breakfast in the whole world as the sun rises over the grasslands and the animals gallop in the distance. Spend most of the day on a final Serengeti game drive with a picnic lunch to ensure that you get to the commanding views found in the far southeast of the park. Then, keep driving across the unmarked boundary to the Ngorongoro Conservation Area to visit a traditional Masai community at their boma (this local word that mixes the definition of village and family house). They are the gatekeepers of this fabulous wildlife, and you will be welcomed with a traditional dance and then invited into a home to see how they live on the plains. Before sunset, you can continue the drive for another 30 minutes and pass nomadic elephants before continuing to your luxury lodge perched on the rim of Ngorongoro Crater."

Hippos are out of the water, rambunctious giants that waddle with surprising speed. Majestic elephants tower meters above the safari vehicle, some of the world’s largest bulls found living in solitary here with horns that curl well over a meter in length. Buffalo stare back at you, hyenas scurry past, and a whole lake is tinged pink by flamingos. Keep driving to pass the zebra to find a pair of black rhino, bashful creatures that are only really seen early in the morning. Like the gorillas, there are only around 1,000 of them left in the wild, and you will be admiring them from just a few meters away. Your drive will continue, and you will piece together the distinctive habitats found in the world’s largest intact volcanic caldera. It will feel like the archetypal garden of Eden, flourishing, mesmerizing, packed with life. It will be the early hours when everything is most active in the crater as by midday, the sun will take over, and there will be a lazy feel to the atmosphere with many animals resting or grazing languidly. This is also when the caldera is busiest with vehicles, making it a good time for you to ascend and relax at the lodge. A relaxed final afternoon ensues, time to rest up, and recount your safari experiences over the last eight days."

Before all of that, Rwanda was the land of the Nyanza kings, a land of rolling hills that rolled to a tribal beat. Butare, halfway to Nyungwe Forest, is the old-world Rwandan capital, where the Rwanda Ethnographic Museum is your first insight into this incredible past. Move next to the old palace of the kings and explore the traditions that the country has been based upon. Africa is a continent with more than a thousand tribes who now coexist in countries that were demarcated by Western powers. Rwanda was, and is, one of the few where there has only been one tribe, and it is a tribe with a fabulous past (the notion of Hutus and Tutsis as differing ethnicities was a Belgium creation to help them maintain power). After an afternoon in Butare, you can continue to the rainforest, where your experience with monkeys and mangabeys begins as soon as you arrive at the lodge."

If it were not for them living in the trees rather than on the forest floor, the similarities would be uncanny. As you think through the comparisons, two of the might descend and sit back against a tree trunk before one walks on two feet to the next tree. Of the handful of destinations for chimpanzee trekking in East Africa, Nyungwe Forest offers mystery and intimacy that goes beyond the norm, and it will be hard to believe how close you are to such remarkable primates.

But then a troop of vervet monkeys appears with almost 100 of them on the ground and in the trees, ready to steal any food you may have in your hands. Most of the species here are specialists of the Central African Congo Basin, a vast untouched wilderness that is almost impossible to access.

Rwanda is one of those countries that looks brilliant, often surreal, to the eye, yet struggles to transpose itself into photos. It is a country where point-and-shoot is shown up as a beginner’s trick. It is a two to three-hour drive to Volcanoes National Park, and there are various viewpoints along the way, places to stop and experiment as your photography guide provides some instruction. After lunch at the lodge, you take an initial journey beneath the forest, dodging its outskirts en route to two local communities. The people here are the gatekeepers of gorilla conservation, trained to identify poachers and convinced to change their own lifestyle in order to protect the giants of the forest. Enchanting and evocative, these people provide some endearing photos. But like the gorillas, it is not a point-and-shoot experience. Like any good posed portraiture photography, you will need to build a rapport with some of the locals, rather than wave the camera around at random.

        "description": "Shards of light filter through the forest canopy, illuminating the branches at random. Sometimes the green colors are intense, but mostly they are muted, constantly in shadow. Visit Africa, and some destinations make for easy photos – the bright open plains of the Serengeti or Masai Mara, as an example. But here, thick, tangled forest makes for a real challenge, the lighting conditions almost as difficult as they come. Before your time with the gorillas, today is a chance to spend the whole day in the forest, testing out and improving your photography skills in these conditions, learning from the guide. And there is a fabulous subject on which to test your talent. Endangered golden monkeys jump through the trees, their faces glimmering blue, and their short fur coats shimmering when touched by the light. With impish grins and evocative eyes, these primates offer a portrait of the strange world in the Congo Basin forests."

        "title": "Volcanoes National Park – Gorilla Trekking for Wildlife Photographers",
        "description": "Now for the ultimate challenge, and the ultimate reward: photos of wild mountain gorillas, the great icons of our planet’s natural history. Trek through dense forest, and spend a full hour with a habituated troop from an official distance of just seven meters away. With gorilla trekking, you are not admiring from afar; you are indelibly close, the atmosphere alive with the intensity that intimacy brings. Two gorillas greet you, arms waving, faces packed with emotion. Creep a little closer, the rest of the troop coming into view. Almost all troops number more than ten, with some comprising more than 20 individuals and multiple silverbacks. Guides get you into a position to see all of the troop, from the infants in the trees to the old mothers hiding behind bulbous trunks. Zoom in for the close-ups, such emotion found in every expression. Pan out to capture the social interaction, like the glances amongst gorillas or the fearful looks shared between blackback and silverback. Some angles allow you to get the whole troop in one shot. Other angles provide a detailed insight into behavior, perhaps something as simple as fingers picking fruit from the branches above your head, or something more complex, like a female leaving her scent for the giant to follow. When such incredible photographic opportunity is presented, the natural instinct is to keep pressing the shutter. After the first 15 minutes, you should settle down, knowing that the gorillas are not going anywhere. Then the photos can be more selective, taking a few more seconds to consider the angle and the camera settings. Note that all gorilla treks are led by guides from Volcanoes National Park. Your photographer guide is unable to accompany you on this trek, something that makes yesterday’s time in the forest so important. Porters are available, and it’s well worth hiring one to carry your tripod and other heavy camera equipment. Trekking in this dense and sometimes muddy forest is not easy, especially when you want to carry additional lenses and a good tripod. Having a porter also keeps you hands-free, the camera always ready to photograph the other animals sometimes seen on the journey where there is potential to see forest elephants, various monkeys, and non-habituated gorilla troops."

        "description": "Last evening, you shared the photos with your guide, a chance for a tutorial before today’s gorilla trek. It was also a chance to reevaluate the photos you have taken, helping you identify gaps in your photo gallery, and assess what worked well in the forest. Gorillas are probably Africa’s most challenging photographic subject. By now, you will have grown accustomed to the conditions and learned how to get the best shots when lighting is difficult. The world’s largest primate has small, deep-set, black eyes, and thick fur that is also jet black, often making it difficult to bring out of the shadows. Light can bounce off their smooth, softened noses, throwing compositions awry. But when everything comes together, the photos are those that could adorn any magazine cover. They are the exceptional snapshots of both an animal and a planet, images that convey the beauty and inimitability of an endangered world. Today you visit a different gorilla troop in Volcanoes National Park, spending another hour with a family of gorillas. Infants look directly into the camera; mothers converse in the trees; a silverback displays his power, muscles rippling, fingers curling, eyes revealing so much about an individual’s state of mind. Capture the scenes, from the detailed close-ups to the portraits of a family feeding in the forest. Compose the black with the green, then put your camera down for the final few minutes of the experience. As much as this safari is about outstanding wildlife images, there is an intimacy to gorilla trekking that should not be ignored. It is important to take some time to appreciate it all through your own eyes, not merely the eyes of a photographer."

Mud-brick villages stand over steep landscapes of rice paddies, colorful fabrics and beaming smiles are found along the road, the rusty red of the earth meets the shimmering blue of the lake, and exotic flora stretches out beneath viewpoints. This road is an insight into the heart of Rwanda; into a country that was not seen by European explorers until the very end of the 19th century.

Silver monkeys are nearby, puffed-out cheeks making for peculiar photos. Tiny Hamlyn’s monkeys pose a similar photographic challenge as the gorillas, another endangered species with black fur and dark eyes. Flowing tails hang down from the canopy, the unusual hue of the red-tailed monkey providing another inspiring shot. Keep walking, exploring the realms of this Congo Basin forest, seeking out the 13 different primates that call Nyungwe home. Hear a cacophony, and wait on the trail, unable to see the troop. A few individuals swing past, high in the trees, black and white beards enveloping mischievous grins. Soon there will be a dozen more, and then a hundred more. For almost an hour you are surrounded by the troop, hundreds of Angola colobus monkeys filling the forest, making for one of Africa’s great wilderness scenes. Over these two days, you go on tailored trekking excursions in Nyungwe Forest, tracking these mostly Central African monkeys and mangabeys. One of these days will be focused on chimpanzees, and you will walk through the forest to spend an hour with man’s closest relation. Like the gorillas, you can get indelibly close, with the portraits revealing such elaborate and evocative emotion. Along the way, you are likely to see many other species, each as endearing as the next. By now, you will have really developed your skills beneath the forest canopy, able to frame even when the lighting is not ideal. Completing your gallery of images is a stroll along the highest canopy walkway in East Africa, a chance to rise above the dense green, and capture ideas of scale. Like most days, an expert wildlife photography guide assists, helping you make the most of this exclusive time in the forest."

Vervet monkeys are regular visitors to the lodge and these inquisitive creatures that will steal your breakfast if you leave it unattended. Baboons rumble past, large troops often in a boisterous mood. On a guided hike, these are the easiest to find as their rowdy behavior reverberates across the canopy. Look up, and Angola colobus monkeys sit serenely with their black and white striped tails hanging down from above. White cheeks alert you to the red-tailed monkeys, which have fur that seems to change in tone as the sun crosses the sky. Silver monkeys have a cheeky stare while a golden mane alerts you to a grey-cheeked mangabey troop in a fig tree. Some 13 primate species inhabit the Nyungwe Forest, and the park's inaccessibility has helped to preserve scores of each. With its swamps and thick sweeps of bamboo, this forest has traditionally been one for people to avoid rather than pillage. A wonderfully wild atmosphere envelops every step with the distant hoots, random shouts, and baboons that drum sticks against branches to cause a racket. Your local guide has grown up here and in understanding the forest's distinctive habitats, he will know how to maximize your chances of seeing different species. While nothing is guaranteed, with three days in Nyungwe, there is a high chance that you will see all 13 different primate species."

Another four chimpanzees come from a different direction and this time, they scamper, half-crawling and half-walking towards a fig tree. Just out of sight, you can hear a baboon troop shout their protest as they had been feeding, but 30 chimpanzees are not to be trifled with, especially when they're known to hunt infant baboons. See a chimpanzee for the first time, and it will be difficult to stop staring at their facial features. Their eyes wander and their faces sketch through the emotions, so there is much to read in frowns and smiles. Watch the troop carefully and you will notice the clearly evident social structure. Males roam around to explore and forage. Females watch and follow, yet are quick to follow the lead of different males as they seek to be impressed. A baby clings to its mother's belly, a hairless wonder too weak to grasp out at the branches. Another rides on its mother's back, watching the world from its new vantage point. Juvenile chimps explore their independence, and these are the most playful of the few dozen individuals you may see on today's trek. Occasionally they will wave their arms and beat their hands until a large male tells them unceremoniously to preserve some tranquility. The chimpanzees move across Nyungwe and today's trek could be anything from one to six hours. You will see a variety of other primates on the route before up to an hour with the wild chimps."

Or your trek could return you to one of your favorites, like the chimpanzees or the serene Angola colobus monkeys. Many of this forest's primate species are classified as vulnerable or endangered, and while most have a habitat that stretches across Central Africa and the Congo Basin, there are only a handful of places where they are accessible to tourism.

Rwanda was one of the last African places to be seen by Europeans, oddly four years after it was nominated a German territory, and there is something compelling about the inaccessibility to the landscape. Nothing is flat, everything hides behind another hill, and you cannot go a moment without another epic panorama stretching out in front of you. At another time it would have taken days, weeks even, to cross Rwanda. But the modern roads easily rival those in Western Europe and the journey from south to north takes just over four hours, despite the road never going straight. There is a number of potential stopping points on your route, and your guide will tailor the journey dependent on your interests. One stop to consider is the Rwanda National Museum in Butare. After the journey, arrive in the Volcanoes National Park, and you will immediately see why the movie was called Gorillas in the Mist."

        "description": "From the tiny mangabey to the ebullient baboon, it is now the gorillas that are the kings of the forest. You will have spotted a dozen of primates, and now you will come face to face with the giants. A silverback walks on his knuckles as his charismatic fur shimmers in the gloom beneath the thick forest awning. He will stop and stand up straight just ten meters away, his arms rippling with resplendent power. For a moment, it will feel as if the whole world has stopped and it is just you and the gorilla as you share a stare in the montane forests of Rwanda. The silverback's mouth will stretch into a smile, at least you will think it is a smile, but there is enough in the expression to suggest that the gorilla isn't revealing everything in one go. Back to his knuckles, the gorilla crawls on and crashes into a fruit tree to rip a root from the ground in an undisguised show of power. Perhaps the silverback scene has been playing out for five minutes, but you may not have taken a photo. Mesmerizing natural encounters like these make it hard to for reach for technology. Suddenly you will look around, and there are another 15 gorillas in the vicinity, including a baby that seems intent on grabbing at your backpack. Officially, you must not come within seven meters of the gorillas, but they often come much closer. Spend an hour with the troop, a generous amount of time for both taking photos and soak up the behavior of the primates. Then return through the forest to the lodge for a relaxed afternoon and evening to overlook the trees."

Troops of these monkeys dot Volcanoes National Park, and the trek is usually shorter than when you visited the gorillas.

Each is different as one has three silverbacks while another nurses a couple of new babies. One troop is youthful and exuberant, while another carries an air of reserved sophistication. Sometimes you will find them eating, and the next you will find the gorillas in a very playful mood. Gorilla trekking for a second time is a very different experience as the trek, the troop, and the interaction all contrasts what happened two days ago. These are wild animals, and you will need to journey deep into the forest to find them. While some trails are well defined, most are barely more than those created by the gorillas themselves. Some troops can be just 30 minutes from the trailhead while others will be four hours away. Visitors are allocated based on their fitness levels, with senior travelers usually given the shortest trek. The maximum group size is eight per troop, and you will need good hiking shoes as the terrain is challenging, especially when the ground is wet. Packed lunches are carried in your daypack and sometimes you will stop along the trail to eat. Other times you will return just in time for lunch."

First, you will be following a marked trail, but soon you will veer off onto tracks made by forest elephants. With every step, the rainforest will seem to get darker and denser as the trees wrap themselves around the trail and the guides slice your path using their machetes. The gorillas have been located, but the last part of the journey is thrillingly slow. You are not on any particular trail, but every step brings you tantalizing closer to the sounds coming from up ahead. Through the branches, you glimpse a ball of black, but then you must clamber for another five minutes before the troop comes into full view. It can be challenging, but trekking through the thick virgin forest is a very authentic part of the experience, helping you appreciate just how remote you have to go when visiting the world's last mountain gorillas. As your guides clear your path, a gorilla will suddenly be standing before you fully upright and sidestepping with arms waving in the air. The female gorilla is making herself look big to showcase her power as she sends the message that you must respect the troop's boundaries. She isn't telling you to leave as these habituated gorilla troops are used to the daily hour of contact. Step a little closer, and you will see her smiling three-year-old baby that mischievously scampers between the trees. Fingers curl around the branches, and there is your first unforgettable look in the eyes as with these wild gorillas, there is an emotion to admire in every set of eyes. As your guide slices away a couple more branches, you will see the rest of the troop as a dozen of them fill the lush landscape before you. Soon another silverback will emerge and bound along on his knuckles, white fur shimmering on a broad back dominated by muscle. All of the sudden, there are three gorillas behind you and another four feeding beside you, making it impossible to know which way to look. Sometimes you have to refocus, baffled by the intimacy of the experience. At other times you will lose yourself in the detail, like the glint of a smile or the site of two infants playing hide and seek amongst the trees. After an hour, you must leave the troop and follow your steps through the forest to spend the rest of your afternoon relaxing at the lodge."

        "description": "Visiting one troop is an inspiring experience, but when you have come so far into the heart of Africa, it would be a shame only to do it once. Furthermore, a first gorilla experience has so much detail that it can pass in a blur. Gorilla trekking a second time helps you to relax and absorb the intricacies of the encounter. You will visit a different troop and take a different path through Volcanoes National Park. The actual time trekking is usually between 30 minutes and two hours in one direction, although that could be more dependent on the location and trekkers are divided into their interests and fitness levels, so older visitors are usually offered the easier of the treks. However, this is a rare opportunity to explore an untamed rainforest which attracts many visitors to a longer trek. As you approach the gorillas, you will feel the goosebumps rise as two blackback males will cause the ground to vibrate as they pound through the small forest clearing. This troop is larger with the up-and-coming males kept in place by a powerful drum roll on the chest of the silverback. Tension exists here, and you can feel it in the atmosphere, and sense it in the odd derogatory glance shared between individual gorillas. Perhaps in a year or two, the troop will have split, and the uneasy ambiance is in dramatic contrast to yesterday's gorilla trekking experience. Not that you will not still enjoy charms of it all, as when you spend an hour with a gorilla troop, there are always hundreds of little moments to take away. After returning from the trek, you will settle into your lodge for lunch and to freshen up before transferring back to Kigali for the night. The Kigali Serena is the city's premier hotel and an easy way to soak up the city."

Before noon, you will have touched down and settled into your camp to be gazing down at the famous Mara River. Situated in the Mara Triangle, this is one of the only Masai Mara camps on the southern side of the river, helping to bring certain privacy during the peak tourist season. Sitting back on your verandah, you can watch the herds and admire the patchwork of wildebeest and zebra that are scattered across the fresh plains. Occasionally, an elephant will amble past, or a waterbuck will come to graze right beside you. Every July and August, the great wildebeest migration crosses the Mara River and then the herds will spread out across the Masai Mara until September or October (note that for travel from January to June, you will need to safari in Tanzania's Serengeti to see the great wildebeest migration). From your camp, you can see the herds as they gather on the southern bank, meaning that you are in prime position to get close to the action whenever the wildebeest decide to charge. Dust spirals, water splashes, and crocodiles snap their jaws as tens of thousands of hooves make their perilous journey. The camp is engulfed by the enchantment of the migration, so today's afternoon game drive is likely to be a short one, bringing you beautiful safari moments yet keeping everything relaxed after your last few days of adventure."

A leopard will jump down from an acacia tree and crawl slowly across the plains in the light of dawn. As you game drive around the Mara River, you will follow their movements, not just seeing the predators but also watching them in hunting mode. Baboons shout loudly to alert a herd of Thomson's gazelle to a cheetah's camouflage. You will return to the leopard, and it has also been unsuccessful in its hunt, the wildebeest galloping away from the spotted predator. But up ahead, there has been a kill and a loud roar scatters the hyenas that were seeking to get close. Drive across to get close enough to see a black and white limb being tossed into the air. Ribs are exposed, and the pride tucks in, ravaging the carcass with a brutal intensity. Then it is back to the charm of the migration, the sight of a few thousand zebra huddled together, or the feeling of being surrounded by the miles of scattered wildebeest grazing away. But as you are getting lost in the serenity of the scene, there will be a flurry of commotion as you watch the cheetah continue her hunt.

It is impossible to know how many wildebeest and zebra are around you, but when you float above the Masai Mara in a hot air balloon, the scale is magnified. Now you realize is is more like a million as the herds fill the plains in every direction as great clumps scatter either side of the Mara River. Yours is one of the closest camps to the balloon launch site, so at dawn, you will take off early. After 90 minutes of flying across the plains, you will touch down to a champagne breakfast, before a game drive transfer takes you north across the Masai Mara. Bump across the grasslands and pass the bustling herds of buffalo before stopping to inspect the elephants that grace the trees. Find lions perched on the scorched rocks and then admire a baby giraffe that follows her mother's graceful steps. The Masai Mara is not just about predator versus prey as this ecosystem is packed with the all of the enchantment of the wild, from playful monkeys to unusual antelope, scurrying warthogs to exotic birdlife. Staying in the Mara North Conservancy helps to open your senses to these other highlights, particularly on a walking safari. A Masai warrior leads you on an animal tracking walk across the plains, pointing out the clues and bringing you close to a whole array of life such as the hartebeest, Grant's gazelle, a giraffe tower, even a buffalo herd. Much as you may have felt during your gorilla trekking, the wildlife feels so much more real when there is nothing between you and them."

        "description": "Mara North is an integral piece of the Masai Mara ecosystem and shares an unfenced border with the national reserve. Mara North is a private enclave, only accessible to those staying at one of the camps. Tucked away in this wilderness is your exquisite camp that maximizes your sense of being enveloped by the rhythm of the Mara. Today is fully flexible, and you can create your own safari program. Game drives here can go off the trail, bringing you within even closer proximity to the predators. Walking safaris are not possible in the national reserve, so there is a unique thrill to being led out by the Masai. On a nighttime drive, you will see another side to the plains as you explore under the cloak of darkness to create a 360-degree appreciation of everything that is going on in the Masai Mara. As always, expect sumptuous cuisine throughout the day and a private vista that evokes the dreamy image of East Africa."

Breakfast is served to your room as an elephant walks past. Slumber a bit longer on your verandah and take in the Masai Mara plains, a private wildlife show that provides your final moments you’re your safari. It has been an active week with many early starts, so this final day is all about the calm of the camp and the beautiful mammals that roam past. Mid-afternoon, you will fly from Mara North back to Nairobi Wilson Airport, where it is a short transfer to Nairobi International and your flight out of Africa."

After lunch at the lodge, the afternoon is at your leisure, a chance to fully relax before two days of gorilla trekking. Should you wish to start exploring, there are various forest trails that take you in and out of the canopy.

        "description": "Today you begin your trek, stepping farther into the wild and toward the gorillas. Mud squishes underfoot, branches are sliced clear by machetes, the trail disappears, and you are following paths left by the gorillas. Meeting a troop requires you to journey deep into the mountainous forest, into a landscape that feels evocatively foreign. Vehicles have never penetrated this place, and the sense of seclusion is exquisite. Groups of up to eight visitors are assigned to a particular, habituated gorilla troop, with troops assigned based upon the fitness levels of the visitors. Some troops may be a four-hour trek away; others might be found within 30 minutes. Regardless of how long it takes, this trek through equatorial rainforest is a major part of the experience. In the distance you see the gorillas, moving on all fours. You follow, excitement building until the first magical close-up of the troop. Two blackback males appear first, ebullient faces and frenzied arms providing an intense first impression. Creep closer, stepping around a mother gnawing feverishly at tree bark. In a small clearing, you see two infants, playful and mischievous as they jump around the branches. Eventually, you count 14 gorillas, including the iconic silverback, who pounds around on his knuckles, almost causing the ground to echo. Spend a full hour with these gorillas, admiring all their behavior and communication, coming to love the most impish of the individuals. Then a resounding beat on the chest indicates that visitor time is over, the silverback providing a remarkable final memory of this remote and endangered troop."

This troop is not a happy, harmonious family, over 20 individuals creating an atmosphere that feels laced with tension. Within the next few years, this troop will undoubtedly split, and you can already make out the dividing line. With so many gorillas, it is hard to know where to look, the troop feeding in the forest that surrounds you, including three swinging through the trees. You hear a loud crack, and you turn around just in time to see a baby gorilla falling through the canopy. A subtle look and you admire the peculiar stare between two old, female gorillas. A deft call and you witness the communication between two individuals. On each gorilla trek, you spend an hour with the troop. These are habituated gorillas who are used to this daily encounter with humans. However, they are very wild, and it is impossible to predict their behavior. Sometimes you find tension and imposing displays of power; other times you find playfulness and a delectable charm. Going twice not only increases the range of behavior you can witness; it also provides an insight into two distinctive family troops. Most importantly, it gives you double time to enjoy the experience, meaning you can put down the camera and really soak up the intimacy, the gorillas jumping about in all directions."

Every mile seems to bring another unfeasible tone, a new hue that cannot be captured on an artificial screen: rustic green creepers winding up mahogany trees, lush rice paddies clinging to the hills, electric colors on passing birds, the arcane olive tones scattered through the canopy. It takes four to five hours to drive from Volcanoes National Park to Nyungwe Forest, although the journey will take longer due the sheer abundance of photographic viewpoints. Stop for lunch in a local village en route, a chance to discover more about rural life in these green hills. Then escape beneath the canopy of the Congo Basin, entering a rainforest of remarkable distinctiveness. Check into the lodge, and it is hard to go more than ten minutes without a troop of monkeys swinging past. The evening is at your leisure, getting ready for tomorrow’s chimpanzee trek."

The pathway winds, slowly, haphazardly, beneath the watchful eyes of owl-faced monkeys. Grey-cheeked mangabeys make an appearance, hooting from afar, then clambering down to view their visitors. Keep walking, into the depths of the forest, where a very special primate troop occupies the trees. Chimpanzees still rule the landscape here, flourishing in a place that has been untouched by man. You will spend an hour with a troop, absorbing the similarities and understanding why they are so important to us. One glance at the chimpanzees, and you can tell that they are biologically similar to yourself. Deft fingers open seeds, eyes display emotion, and gestures change with every passing second. You spend a whole hour with a chimpanzee troop, and you understand that they are also socially very similar. Individuals form cliques, mothers nurture babies to their bosoms, certain males gain respect through their size and power, and others enchant with their peculiar ways and enigmatic actions. The chimpanzee experience is very different from the gorilla experience. You will usually not get as close, as the chimpanzees stay primarily in the canopy, only a handful coming to the forest floor. Encounters come with unpredictability; some days you will see the whole 60 or 70-strong troop, other days it is a small splinter group. But in whatever manner you encounter chimpanzees, there is an intimacy and intensity to the hour, brought on by the remarkable similarities you will witness."

Today is fully flexible, and the guide will outline potential trekking options, from leisurely trails to serious hikes into the tangled undergrowth. L’Hoest’s monkeys are scattered around the trails, different mangabeys have faces full of emotion, and when you encounter the Rwenzori colobus monkeys, it is impossible to know which way to look. They gather in 600 – 700-strong troops, bathing whole sections of forest in noise and intrigue. This second day also provides a back-up day for chimpanzee trekking if you failed to see a troop yesterday. You will find a fabulous landscape here, one that makes you feel like an old-world explorer venturing into the unknown.

The light aircraft swoops across the west of the country, rising over a thick, impenetrable swathe of forest, then soaring over the volcanic remains around Lake Kivu. Then you veer eastward, traversing the iconic, hilly scenery of central Rwanda. The hills flatten, and a savannah extends beneath the wingtips, an insight into the next three days. Touch down, and the landscape feels indelibly East African. Open grasslands are dotted with antelope, trees rise above the swamps in the distance, and lone trees act like safari sentinels. This is classic East Africa safari territory, with a distinctive difference. Akagera is a mix of both grassland and wetland, the contrast of habitats attracting a huge diversity of wildlife. After lunch, you start the safari experience by joining the park’s rangers on a behind-the-scenes tour of the park. You learn about conservation and methods of preserving this precious habitat. You find out the role of a ranger in maintaining harmony between man and wildlife, and you savor the knowledge of the rangers, who know exactly where particular lion prides hide, and precisely where to find certain ungulates. After a day with the rangers, you spend the evening watching the savannah from your luxury lodge, the silence occasionally interrupted by raucous animal calls."

Next, you will find the lions, a healthy pride that inspects you with curiosity. In the morning, you explore these plains in a vehicle, a game drive revealing wildlife diversity. It is quite possible that you could see 15 – 20 different species on the drive. In the afternoon, there is a huge change in atmosphere, a walking safari taking you across the same big-game landscape. Giraffe tower over you, zebra and buffalo cross the trail, and you watch the intense battles between horned males."

Hippos are everywhere, and you paddle within meters of their bulldozing frames. Strange aquatic antelopes line the edge of the water, ears pinned back as they watch you pass. Tropical birds swirl, joining the flocks of menacing vultures. It feels like an entirely different world than the nearby grasslands; this is one of Akagera’s great highlights. In the afternoon, you continue the safari with a game drive over a rock-strewn savannah, an area of less abundant wildlife but more intense encounters. The views from up here are very special, and you will take wine and canapes to enjoy as you watch the sunset. Back at the lodge, dinner comes with the odd giraffe wandering past, silhouetted by moonlight."

A hush comes over the vehicle as two black rhinos skip past, bashful characters you will struggle to see after 9 am.

        "description": "Your welcome to Rwanda will come from animals that you might not expect to see here. Lions lounge on the savanna, basking on lush grass as they laze away the afternoon and rhinos prowl, creating a stunned silence when they pass the vehicle. Turn around to find an elephant with its iconic shape painted against a backdrop of hills. Not far away are the stripes of a zebra herd, grazing and moving with inherent grace. After landing at Kigali International Airport, you will be greeted by a private guide for a two-hour transfer to Akagera National Park, arriving in time for lunch on the lodge verandah. Begin your adventure with your first game drive to follow the prints in the sand to a lion pride. One lion yawns as another one stretches and starts to wander over, circumnavigating the vehicle as you watch on with both excitement and trepidation. On the outskirts of bushes, you may be able to see the rhinos, and all across the savanna is the evidence of wildlife diversity. Akagera is one of Africa’s great conservation success stories, a park returned to its pristine natural state barely two decades after it was partially populated by those displaced by the genocide. On your private game drive, you can explore serenely, stopping to admire the expressions in an impala’s eyes and the antics of a hippo barreling out of the water. Your lodge will offer uninterrupted views over the landscape, continuing the safari into the evening."

Hippos poke their eyes from the water, occasionally one yawning to reveal a cavernous jaw. Young elephants playfully push each other under, waving their trunks in their air like snorkels. Ungulates cluster together, safety in numbers as they come to drink from the banks. The boat safari is a relaxed experience as you cruise past all of these animals that bask along the banks. Continue your safari in the afternoon with a game drive across the savanna that will bring many more delightful wildlife scenes. While Rwanda is not as well known as its neighbors for big-game safari, Akagera provides a beautiful contrast to the more famous forests and primates. All of today’s activities are private, and your guide can tailor the routes to your mood and interests."

Occasionally, they come down from the trees, perhaps walking upright or lounging against the base of a tree trunk. You will trek to a habituated troop, as while they are accustomed to human presence, they are still very wild. You will admire their interactions and behaviors that range from two young chimpanzees playfully breaking branches and throwing them around, to a mother gazing tenderly towards her infant or two large males with a quarrelsome stare. This is a full-day experience, and you will also spot various primates en route to the chimpanzees.

The gorillas will be close, but you must keep walking, ducking under branches, and ascending to a clearing where the primates are foraging. Goosebumps rise and anticipation builds, as the world’s largest primates come into your view. First, you might see a blackback male, stopping and staring. And then a second blackback, waving powerful arms that ripple with pride. It can be easy to take a step back, frightened by the intensity of the welcome. But the guides push you onwards as a moment of stillness comes, and you realize that both blackbacks have their eyes firmly fixed on you. Of all the memories from gorilla trekking, perhaps none can ever beat the first impression as you realize that you are almost alone with some of the less than 1,000 mountain gorillas that are left in the wild. Get close, and you will see more. The blackbacks have provided a welcome for the rest as an infant comes into view, inquisitive and curious as it jumps around lower branches. Two senior females are there seeking privacy and retreat to the thick bushes while the silverback, slow and laborious in his movements, is immediately alert in his eyes. You can stay here for an hour and the time moves surprisingly slowly. At first, you will not know where to look, but slowly you will focus on favorites scenes. The changing expressions of the infant, so redolent, so varied alongside a gorilla that keeps appearing and disappearing behind a trunk with a strange face. Back at the lodge, it may feel like it was all a dream, which is just one of the reasons that you will be delighted to go back into the depths of the forest tomorrow."

The troop could be large with more than 20 gorillas surrounding you, or there may be just nine or ten. On a second gorilla trek, you are also more likely to put the camera down and really absorb the experience, which can be difficult when the potential to document such rare animals is so apparent.

There are approximately 1,000 mountain gorillas left in the world, and your guide will take you through the dense jungle and undulating volcanic slopes in search of one of the region’s 12 habituated troupes. As the morning mist dissipates as the sunlight fills the treetops, your hike will provide an exciting challenge to find gorillas in their natural habitat. You may hear the gorilla troupe before you see them as they pull leaves from the surrounding trees or as the matriarch hoots waiting for the silverback to return the call from up to half a mile away."

        "description": "Your final day in the wilderness is yours to explore, relax, and appreciate the surrounding wonders at your preferred pace. You can venture to the top of Mount Bisoke at 12,175 feet for a stunning view of the crater lake or visit the local community to meet members of the farm cooperative. For another fascinating wildlife experience, you could follow your guide into the heart of the bamboo forest in search of the golden monkey. The dense foliage may cloud the sky and cover the forest floor along the base of Mount Sabyinyo. The sprightly character of the golden monkey will bring to light their unique personalities as the sporadic sunlight glints against the hints of red and gold fur along their backs. They can grow up to 26 inches and can live in groups of up to 62 individuals. You may find them racing across the bamboo canopy above you as they forage for fruits or weave together sections of shoots to form a sleeping canopy."

        "description": "In the morning, you can bask in the incredible view of the surrounding valley and ridges as you settle into the comforting aroma of freshly brewed coffee. You may glimpse the bronze sunbird to find its sheer plumage glinting in the sunlight with shades of green, orange, and black or spot the Rowenzori side-striped chameleon whose vivid green skin nearly blends against the lush foliage. After breakfast, your private transfer will take you to the Ruhengeri Airport for your return helicopter flight to Kigali, where you will continue the journey home bringing an end to your African safari trip of a lifetime."
