  "generalInfo": "This 14 day journey to the Antarctic Circle holiday takes in the dramatic Antarctic Peninsula then pushes further south than most cruises do, to cross the Antarctic Circle. Despite the harshness of this landscape, there is abundant wildlife here, and you’ll see seals relaxing on the ice, whales breaching and huge numbers of penguins on the rocky shores.<br/><br/>A Zodiac will take you from the expedition vessel to explore at close range, nipping around bays and making landings so you have the unique opportunity to discover Antarctica’s steep peaks, huge glaciers and enormous icebergs. This is an extended expedition, designed to give you more time at the Antarctic Peninsula, so you can explore more of it and make numerous landings, to see its unique wildlife and landscapes.<br/><br/>There are lots of optional activities laid on to supplement the regular Zodiac excursions, so you can tailor the trip to your interests. Go kayaking, take a photography class, or relax onboard with yoga and a massage. True adventurers might prefer the icy embrace of a polar plunge.<br/><br/>Polar expeditions often have a crew-to-passenger ratio of 10, 15 or 20 to one, but on this one, travelling on the Ocean Endeavour, you there is one crew member to every eight passengers, so you get greater service and a real sense of the personal touch. Our crew and expedition leaders know the Antarctic really well, having made hundreds of polar expeditions, and are know the marine biology, glaciology and history of the region inside out. This wealth of knowledge will be shared during the lecture programme that runs onboard throughout the expedition, so you’ll understand everything you’re seeing.  <br/>",

Located at the southern tip of Argentina, these parts are known as Tierra del Fuego, often called ‘The End of the World’, but this is just the beginning of your Antarctic adventure. Those with a day or two may want to head to Tierra del Fuego National Park on a full day’s adventure, or if you've only got a few hours to kill, why not stroll around town and visit the waterfront overlooking the Beagle Channel. You might also like to sample some handcrafted chocolate at a local cafe in town. Tonight, you’ll have a welcome meeting at about 5 pm at your hotel, then you’re free to get ready for an early morning tomorrow!

Over the next two days, you'll get to know your expedition team experts as our comprehensive lecture program gets underway. Your polar experts will share their knowledge of the Antarctic region so you can gain a great understanding of its wildlife, history and geology and help prepare you for the adventure that lies ahead.

      "description": "South Shetland Islands & Antarctic Peninsula Over the next few days, you’ll make Zodiac cruises through the icy waters. There are several potential landing sites, and while weather dictates which specific site you’ll land at, each presents an opportunity to get up close with some incredible wildlife. Look out for chinstrap, gentoo and Adelie penguin colonies as well as crabeater, Weddell, fur and elephant seals. When you are on board the Ocean Nova, your Expedition Team will keep the education going with a range of wildlife and history presentations and documentary screenings. A typical expedition day begins with a wake-up call from your Expedition Leader around 7 am, followed by breakfast. Weather permitting, you can anticipate at least two excursions daily, providing ample opportunities to take in the breathtaking Antarctic landscape. For those who crave even more adventure, treat yourself to an optional paddling excursion that offers a new perspective of this frozen expanse. You’ll also be able to take a polar plunge off the Ocean Nova. There’s nothing like a quick dip in the Antarctic’s icy depths to wake you up!

      "description": "The Antarctic Circle Weather and ice conditions permitting, you’ll celebrate reaching the latitude of 66°33’S and crossing the fabled Antarctic Circle. Toast to the sheer rawness of the surroundings and take it all in – while not a typical landing, the crossing of the Antarctic Circle leaves a lasting memory. Travel past colossal icebergs to a point on Earth where only a few travellers have sailed. Home to Weddell seals that are specially adapted to this icy environment, they use their canines and incisors to rasp open new ice and maintain holes in the ice through which to breathe. They also have highly accurate powers of navigation, enabling them to seek out breathing holes when their teeth are worn down, and they can no longer maintain or create breathing holes in the ice.
