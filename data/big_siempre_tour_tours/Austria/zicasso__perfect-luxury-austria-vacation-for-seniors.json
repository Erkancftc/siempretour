      "title": "Vienna - A Royal Beginning",
      "description": "A baroque cathedral spire stands high above your hotel. A small doorway leads to a grotto laden with jewels. Architectural wonder stretches out each way you look. Welcome to Vienna, one of Europe’s grandest cities. After a private airport transfer, you will have time to freshen up before a short city tour. With a hotel in the historic old town, you can explore most of the key attractions, without needing to travel far. Simply strolling the streets is wonderful here, then there are countless regal cafes for Viennese pastry and coffee."

      "title": "Vienna - Museums and Architectural Highlights",
      "description": "After yesterday’s introduction, you can now venture further into the architectural juxtapositions. On a private tour you’ll explore the nuance between Gothic, baroque, and Secessionist styles, before an intimate look into Otto Wagner’s style. After lunch, there are plenty of excellent museums, and the guide can tailor visits to your interests, with the Freud and Jewish museums especially good. Also unmissable this afternoon is Schonbrunn, a glorious palace that helps to evoke Hapsburg times. Your luxury Austria tours are private, so each day can be adjusted to your preferences. For example, you may add on the Naschmarkt food market today."

      "title": "Vienna - Lipizzaner Stallion Performance",
      "description": "Famously white but also appearing in other colors, Lipizzaner stallions are an icon of the equestrian world. Mixing power with poise, they bound elegantly across a performance ring, as you watch on in awe. On a visit to a Spanish riding school, you’ll discover how these horses are trained, before watching them perform. It’s also possible to ride one, but only if you have significant experience. This laid-back visit can be complemented by more Vienna highlights, including a tour of St Stephen’s Cathedral and a journey to find the original apple strudel."

      "title": "Salzburg - Exploring Wine Country",
      "description": "Vineyards glisten along the banks of the Danube. Waters flow gently as you cruise this famous river. Church spires dot the riverside and old stone bridges arc above your boat. This is the Wachau area, a bucolic sight that’s perfect for a languid afternoon. Leaving Vienna, you will explore Melk Abbey, before a private Danube cruise. Castles and villages roll by, and there’s an immersion in old-world Austrian scenery. After the cruise, you’ll transfer onward to Salzburg, Austria’s most famous destination. Few other European cities evoke such an easy-going and charming atmosphere."

      "title": "Salzburg - The Sound of Music Tour",
      "description": "Salzburg is universally loved by senior visitors. It’s small and accessible enough to get around, either on foot or in a horse and carriage. But you can encounter a superb variety of attractions and highlights, within such a small and perfectly-formed area. Today’s private tour will take you down Getreidesgasse, past flowing Baroque architecture, to an excellent private art museum. Mozart’s house will provide insight into a genius mind, then the sound of music will take you away, as you discover filming locations from the movie."

      "title": "Salzburg - A Day in Salzkammergut",
      "description": "Mountains clamber for attention in the snow-ridden Salzkammergut. Lakes reflect their rugged peaks, creating surreal mirror images that morph into a mirage. Small villages and wooden houses dot the roads, along with bell-tinkling cows. This is Austria’s prettiest region, and you will have a full day to explore, with the exact itinerary decided by you on the day. There are many options for walking if you wish, and you may be interested in visiting the world’s oldest salt mines. Just driving and exploring this area is a lovely insight into the Alps and rural Austrian culture."

      "title": "Innsbruck - Swarovski Crystals and the Hills",
      "description": "Make a stop at the Swarovski Crystal World this morning, a relatively touristic attraction packed with what you would expect. For glistening crystal and indulgent decoration, it’s always worth a stop. You will then continue into Tyral and Innsbruck, an alpine town with a dazzling mountain backdrop. Check into a castle hotel in the hills and gaze across the slopes, as you plan out the final three days with your guide. Innsbruck itself is a charming place to stroll, and you will have dinner reservations in the town, for a first taste of authentic Tylorean cuisine."

      "description": "These two days have been kept flexible so you can maximize your time in the mountains. Guided mountain and forest hikes can be adjusted to most abilities and energy levels, as can horseback riding. There is excellent fishing as well, along with artisanal workshops and cooking classes. Guided drives into the mountains are likely to feature on your itinerary, as you explore mind-boggling alpine landscapes and breathe in the fresh alpine air. Also expect plenty of culture, especially in Innsbruck’s Old Town, where traditions are proudly taken forward into the modern day."
