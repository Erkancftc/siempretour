    "generalInfo": "Eritrea is a curious country, squashed between its giant neighbours Ethiopia and Sudan, tumbling down from highlands to the turquoise waters of the Red Sea. With a distinctly Italian feel in many places, it often doesn’t feel quite African, yet turn the corner and step into the side streets and you’ll meet brightly robed women and men from remote villages trading camels and other livestock. <br/><br/>This tour encompasses the highlights of a country that few know much about. We start in the capital Asmara, one of the best places to see Italian Art Deco style architecture, and one of Africa’s cleanest and safest cities, where people walk the streets each evening in the style of a ‘passegiata’ more reminiscent of Rome or Milan than the Horn of Africa. We explore its churches and remnants of colonial rule before driving through the mountains to the town of Keren to visit its colourful Monday market.<br/><br/>From here we descend to the coastal town of Massawa, with its white washed buildings and Ottoman / Arabian atmosphere. On the way, we will try to meet the nomadic Rashaida people, often found in this area. Once an important port, Massawa has a decidedly languid feel, full of historic architecture and is a good place to get to grips with the country’s complex history.<br/><br/>Stepping back a few millennia, we also visit the remains of the pre-Axumite city of Qohaito, a testament to the fact that this region once played an important role in the ancient world, well before Europe was even a player.<br/><br/>Eritrea has a feel that is hard to put your finger on, a mix of styles and influences that have combined to create one of Africa’s most unique and surprising corners.",

    "generalInfo": "For too long, Eritrea has been missed off of the bucket list of most travellers,. But this proud East African nation, which offers a real 'off the beaten path' travel experience is eagerly waiting to be explored! Starting in Asmara, the capital of Eritrea and a UNESCO World Heritage site, we'll explore the early 20th century architecture, much of which dates back to the Italian period, so why not grab an Italian coffee in one of the local coffee shops. We'll also visit the Santa Maria Cathedral, Coptic Museum and of course, the Medeber Market. As we leave the capital, our first stop is Keren, known as a crossroads between the High and Low Land regions and very well known for its silver filigree work. The city of Keren itself, is home to the Bilen people, attracts visitors from the local area for the regular cattle market, which makes for an interesting photo opportunity. Whilst exploring the city, we'll make stops at the Italian and British war cemeteries, the mosque and a number of local churches before spending time in the vibrant covered food market. Heading east, we move on to Massawa, located on the shores of the Red Sea. From here we'll begin our 3 day camping excursion to the beautiful Dahlak Islands. We'll board a motorboat in Massawa, which will take us to some of the most interesting and richest coral reefs in the area. We'll set up a base camp on one of the local islands, where our accommodation will be in igloo tents. As we disembark from the boat in Massawa, we may have time to partake in a city tour before returning to Asmara where our trip comes to an end. For those looking to spend a little longer in Eritrea, we do offer a 2-night Asmara extension, which includes tours to visit Kohaito and Adi Quala. Our tour of Eritrea connects well with a number of our other tours in the region, such as those in Egypt and Jordan. If you'd like some advice on how to link these trips together, please speak with our sales team who will be happy to help.",

Head to Keren A century ago, the Italians built what was then considered a futuristic railway in Eritrea and in recent years, steam locomotives have returned to the tracks of this former Italian colony. Whilst much of the railway infrastructure is in a state of bad repair, when you step aboard the steam locomotive, you'll be transported back in time and take a journey along a route which straddles mountains, covered in prickly pears and experience breath-taking views. As the train isn't always operational, we have kept this experience as an optional extra which can be booked and paid for through your tour guide, the rate will be approximately $60.00 - the exact rate will be confirmed at the time of booking).

The most vivid and colourful attraction in Keren is of course the local market, which attracts tribes from the surrounding areas. The market has various sections, we'll make our way through the covered food market, past the streets dedicated to tailors and silversmiths and through the womens market, until we reach the river side where the wood and coal markets are held. Whilst in Keren, we'll also explore the Sanctuary of Mariam Dearit, where a Black Madonna, inserted in a Baobab tree is venerated. The Madonna of the Baobab is also highly venerated by Muslims and often there are multi-faith pilgrimages which take place. Our last visits in Keren will be to the Italian, Askari and British war cemeteries before we return to Asmara for the night. OVERNIGHT"
