  "generalInfo": "Join a small group of fellow adventurers on this 11 day Eritrea tour to discover the country’s varied landscapes, bustling towns and historic sites, from the ancient kingdom of Aksum to the remnants of Turkish and Italian rule. <br/><br/>You’ll start your journey in the capital, Asmara, a dynamic city full of pavement cafes and elegant Art Deco architecture dating to the Italian colonial period. Moving north past highlands and coffee plantations you’ll head to Keren, a solid agricultural town, which hosts a popular weekly livestock and camel market. Next, you’ll drive through the country’s last remaining tropical forest to the coastal city of Massawa, visiting the ancient port of Adulis along the way. In Massawa, there’ll be time to wander the narrow streets, past the many white Turkish, Egyptian and Italian buildings and perhaps sample some of the local seafood.<br/><br/>Moving on you’ll visit Decamhare, a favourite destination for the Italian settlers, before heading to the ancient archaeological site of Quohaito, which, according to legend, was built during the time of the Queen Sheba, around 750 BC. Here you’ll see plenty of fascinating historical relics including buildings from the Axumite period.<br/>",
