The reserve comprises of acacia dominated thornveld in the south and broadleaf sandveld in the north. Unique, intimate encounters with Mkhaya’s wildlife are exceptional and all travel within the reserve is by open Land Rovers or on foot. The reserve is criss-crossed with dry riverbeds, dotted with waterholes and has a network of intertwined game-viewing roads. Mkhaya currently supports three of the Big Five; with leopard, buffalo and rhino being present on the reserve – there are no lions or elephants at Mkhaya, but it is most famous for its rhino conservation. You should be able to see rhino up close and personal. A host of other game such as giraffe, hippo, crocodile, roan and sable antelope, tsessebe, eland, kudu, ostrich and vervet monkey are also seen regularly. The birdlife is also abundant and the rare Narina Trogan can sometimes be seen in camp along with the more common species such as the crested guinea fowl. Mkhaya was set up as a breeding program for endangered species such as the black rhino, roan and sable - a sighting of the elusive black rhino is normally very high up most visitors list, so keep your eyes peeled on those game drives. We will be at the gate of the this reserve by 10am and then on arrival you will have some time at leisure to enjoy the peace and tranquillity of the camp before embarking on an afternoon sundowner drive.
