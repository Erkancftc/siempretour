      "title": "Kathmandu – A Gentle Welcome to a Spiritual Land",
      "description": "When you touch down in Kathmandu, you’ll take your first look at the mountains. Nothing is straight or flat in the Himalayas, and as you look to the horizon, the mountains seem to extend ceaselessly. They will provide the backdrop for your time in Nepal, omnipresent as you tour a city that brims with pride and passion. Locals enter small temples, colorful saris dominate side streets, and there’s a sense that Kathmandu marches to the beat of its own drum. You’ll be greeted at the airport and transferred to a boutique hotel just outside the city, with a stunning view of Mt. Everest shining at sunset."

      "title": "Kathmandu – Buddhist Shrines, Monkey Temples and Holy History",
      "description": "On your first full day in Nepal, Buddha’s eyes will stare at you from the top of a temple. Locals burn incense and chant besides small stupas. Buddhist monks bring crimson robes to a temple loved by monkeys. Visit Swayambhunath to see the spectacular architecture and views before you enjoy all its subtleties, from Hindu holy men to stupas that bring Buddhism and Hinduism together. There will be a similar experience at Kathmandu Durbar Square, where the slower you walk, the more you enjoy, from the palace rooms and rebuilt 15th-century temples to the emotional locals and a living goddess that peeks from a balcony. There will be other potential destinations as well today, which you can take in on a private day tour of Kathmandu’s heart."

      "title": "Kathmandu – Everest Helicopter Flight and a Quiet Afternoon at Boudhanath",
      "description": "Today, you will fly to Lukla and soar through the Himalayas in a helicopter, rising above glacier-carved valleys on route to Mt. Everest. Icy rivers twist through stark landscapes, and rows of ever-rising mountains flank everything. At first, you’ll look up to the snowline, but soon mountains fully clad in white will surround you, including a string of 8000-meter giants. Pass Mt. Lola and Mt. Lhotse on to Everest, which forms a stark triangle that seems unruly from the helicopter window. Then loop around and return through the Khumbu Valley where Mt. Ama Dablam is the highlight of this scenic helicopter flight. After you return to the capital, spend the afternoon at Boudhanath and watch the spirituality that engulfs a giant pagoda."

      "title": "Chitwan National Park – Rhinos in the Jungle",
      "description": "From the lodge, you’ll glimpse Everest at sunrise, which comes out of the shadows as it is illuminated by bands of red and yellow. This morning, you’ll fly to Chitwan where you are greeted by other feats of nature. Rather than open panoramas, you will be inspired by the smell and sound of the dense jungle that is full of echoed calls and a striking atmosphere. Rhinos will be your neighbors and you’ll see one wander past before another bashfully retreats into the trees. Elephants hoot as they announce their coming, a mother and calf on route to the Rapti River below. This World Heritage Site showcases nature untamed and this first day is just an introduction to the safari experience."

      "title": "Chitwan National Park – Immersive Safari Including Canoe and Jeep Activities",
      "description": "A Chitwan safari is all about the different angles and you will have plenty of time to try it all. Canoe safaris will be slow and gentle as you paddle silently along the river to beautiful close-ups of rare animals. Jeep safaris create adventure where you will bump along muddy trails mostly in search of Chitwan’s rarest resident, the royal Bengal tiger. Walking safaris will take you even closer to offer an intimate understanding of the jungle’s inner workings, especially when you follow the spoor of a rhino or elephant. These three activities will be combined with jungle picnics, sunset cruises, and visits to conservation centers, where you discover how different species are blossoming in the park. Like Kathmandu you could spend a day in Chitwan and get a good impression of the area but to really enjoy this Nepalese highlight you must spend more time and go deeper into the jungle."

      "title": "Lumbini – A Day at the Birthplace of Buddha",
      "description": "The next day, a moving atmosphere will confront you in Lumbini, where the outpourings of emotion are sometimes too much to take in. This small border town marks the birthplace of Buddha and a cycle rickshaw is a good way to get around. From an elevated vantage point, you pass serenely through streets of temples and spirituality with barefooted monks all around. This is one of Buddhism’s four pilgrimage sites, and you’ll slowly gain a sense of the religion, through the local guide and the scenes you witness. Stop at the sublime Ashoka Pillars to view the spot where Buddha was born, then spend the evening on your own as you take your own slow footsteps through Lumbini."

      "title": "Varanasi – Opening the Senses to India’s Holiest City",
      "description": "The following morning, you’ll cross the border and drive south through India, a relatively long journey that offers a whole cascade of new impressions. Mud-brick buildings, flowing saris, vibrantly designed temples, clouds of dust, spluttering rickshaws, lanes of street food and so much more through the sanctity of your window. When you arrive in Varanasi, it will be a sensory overload as the narrow pedestrianized streets are packed with harmonic sounds, peculiar smells, living histories and an atmosphere that seems both ineffable and ephemeral. Enjoy taking in the sites at a slow pace before you return to the hotel rooftop to relax. Like each day in India, you’ll be led by an expert guide, who shows you the destination through local eyes."

      "title": "Varanasi – Sunrise Boat Ride, Burning Ghats and Sunset Ceremonies",
      "description": "In the next few days, you’ll discover that Varanasi rewards slow travel. Approximately 3000 years of history emanates from the haphazard walls, attracting devotees to an overflowing excess of temples and shrines. Narrow alleyways are lined with temple deities and mysterious archways while lumbering cows stop and sleep, requiring the street food carts to choose a different route. Incense flumes greet you on corners while funeral processions carry bodies on bamboo stretchers. Monkeys live on the rooftops while tiny food stalls send their smells through the narrowest of lanes and children fly kites over the Ganges. You will have a local guide who accompanies you everywhere in Varanasi, something that will be highly valuable while navigating the fascinating maze of the pedestrianized Old City. During your stay, your guide will plan a flexible itinerary that does not rush you through the attractions. One of the essentials will be a sunrise boat ride on the Ganges, some time spent at the holy burning ghat, and a candlelit sunset ceremony at the river. For many, this city reflects the magic of India, right down to the flower markets and confusing rituals."

      "title": "Orchha – Palaces and Proud Memoirs to India’s Rich Past",
      "description": "Once you arrive in Orchha, you’ll be amazed to think you’re in the same country. Standing on the banks of the Betwa River, Orchha is a regal town from the 16th-century, remarkably untouched since the Bundelas clan ruled the region. An abundance of old temples fill the town’s center, each seemingly more elaborate than the last. Small palaces showcase an otherworldly opulence, with Orchha Palace the grand dame of forgotten Mughal architecture. You can travel anywhere by foot, giving you plenty of time during your visit to be immersed in the 16th-century Indian backwater city."

      "title": "Agra – Beyond the Taj Mahal",
      "description": "This morning, you’ll cross India to Agra, stopping first in Jhansi for a gourmet lunch then onwards on the train to the city of the Mughal Empire’s excesses. Traveling by train is an iconic Indian experience, and this route is air-conditioned and first class, giving you quiet time to absorb the rural impressions through the window. When you arrive in Agra, you will not immediately visit the Taj Mahal. Instead, you’ll take time to explore the region’s equally impressive but less recognized attractions. Begin with part-fortress and part-palace, Agra Fort, a sandstone giant that glistens deep crimson in the fading afternoon light. All over Agra you’ll find sublime examples of Mughal architecture, many of them overlooked by tourists. Explore them with a guide and you’ll also get to know the architectural building blocks that gave rise to the Mughal ode to love."

      "title": "Agra – Sunrise at the Taj Mahal and More Beautiful Mughal Remainders",
      "description": "In the morning, all will be still in the courtyard. Slowly the marble emerges from the sun’s shadow and at first it glistens red before the color softens and light dances transiently across the domes. Walk past the pools and get a little closer, admiring the sharpness of the Taj Mahal’s form. Calligraphic messages wrap around the monument, and they beckon you inside, where the architectural opulence comes as a surprise. Almost everyone has seen photos of the Taj Mahal, but few have considered consider how beautiful it must be on the inside. Take your time and enjoy the morning around this pre-eminent Mughal monument, before the afternoon takes you off the beaten path, with Persian mosques and Akbar’s Mausoleum among the highlights."

      "title": "Jaipur – Living the History in India",
      "description": "Agra has evolved, a modern city growing around an ancient capital. In comparison, Fatehpur Sikri has hardly changed. This city was the Mughal capital for a fleeting few years in the 16th century, but the royal town was eventually abandoned and left to the desert dust. Even today it feels like a ghost town, a showcase of architectural might that almost looks out of place. Persian and Hindu styles merge together and the more you walk around, the more you’ll get to discover. From here you continue across the ochre plains of Rajasthan to arrive in the Pink City for an afternoon in the markets. After the 16th-century you’re now in a city that brings history into today, which is exemplified by bazaars of cramped stalls and enigmatic smiles."

      "dayNumber": "16",
      "title": "Jaipur – Hot Air Ballooning Above the Pink City",
      "description": "With its domes and forts, Jaipur is the perfect city to view from the air. Today, you’ll rise in a hot air balloon and cruise serenely above the monuments, perhaps spotting a procession of elephants down below. A desert landscape surrounds Jaipur that glows red and orange to complement the pink city hues. Once you touch down, you’ll enjoy the first day of exploration. Like all your Indian destinations the focus is on flexible touring with a private guide, tailored to your interests and your energy levels. So today could bring a whole host of sights, or it may be a day to escape the city crowds and recharge at your luxury hotel."

      "dayNumber": "17",
      "title": "Jaipur – Forts, Observatories and More Royal Legacies",
      "description": "The following day’s highlight will be riding a painted elephant up to Amber Fort. You’ll be dazzled by the peculiarity at The Hall of Mirrors (Sheesh Mahal). Then, explore the extravagance on show at The City Palace, where each stately room is more ostentatious than the last. Discover bazaars full of jewelry and textiles then appreciate the silence of Jantar Mantar Observatory. Go to watch a Bollywood movie in the cinema then take a stroll through streets laden with sizzling local food. Jaipur’s main attractions usually require two days, but there’s no set itinerary in a city that mixes architectural wonder with welcoming local culture."

      "dayNumber": "18",
      "title": "Delhi – The Best of Old and New Delhi",
      "description": "Your final days in India will be spent in Delhi, the bustling capital city that embodies India’s dynamic culture. Ride the modern metro system then take a cycle rickshaw down Chandni Chowk, the city’s oldest lane. Then, gaze up at what was once the world’s tallest building in the 11th century before you sit around a communal kitchen table at a cooking class. Wander through the immense colonial remains of Red Fort before a feeling of spirituality accompanies a visit to Humayun’s Tomb. Finally head into the new part of Delhi, a cosmopolitan almost-Western city that shows the changing side to India. Old and new, adventure and relaxation, Delhi has more to offer than the initial impression of crowds and chaos. In many ways it’s the microcosm of India, a fitting place to end your time in the region."
