  "generalInfo": "This nine day cultural tour takes travellers on a tailor made adventure into two of India’s lesser-visited regions, Sikkim &amp; Kolhata, with a domestic flight in between making short shrift of distances so as to invite an efficient and exciting experience close to the borders of Bhutan and Nepal.<br/><br/>Throughout the tour you’ll be invited into the villages of Limbu and Lepcha as well as finding out more about the tribal traditions of Bhutanese that have made the eastern state of Sikkim their home.<br/><br/>We value storytelling over traditional sightseeing as we think this promotes interaction with local people, on their level, rather than a more voyeuristic approach. Listening to locally told tales also keeps the spirit of the past alive as well as providing a deeper understanding of the history of an area, something that a guide book can rarely express with quite as much personal passion and entertaining insight.<br/><br/>The chance to stay overnight in the more remote villages of Sikkim &amp; Kolkata is another example of how strongly we value cultural interaction and joining in with day-to-day activities, such as cooking, handicrafts, singing and dancing, is also a great way to become immersed in life, like a local, rather than just another observational tourist.<br/><br/>As Sikkim is India’s premier state for organic agriculture you’ll be introduced to a traditional way of life from a sustainable perspective as well as marvelling at the likes of Kanchenjunga mountain and the natural beauty of Maenama Wildlife Sanctuary in the south of Sikkim.<br/><br/>Time spent in and around Kolkata (formally Calcutta) creates an authentic taste of eastern India with immersive culinary experiences combining with storytelling and interaction with local people to add to the authenticity of exploring in one of India’s most culturally enlightening Bengali capitals.<br/><br/>As this is a tailor made nine day tour you’ll be invited to explore and discover at a pace that suits you however, don’t expect to be rushing from one place to the next, far from it, this is a tour that invites pause for thought as well as organic experiences that reveal themselves piece by piece, thread by thread.<br/><br/>We pride ourselves on transparency, with no hidden costs, and encourage two way contact with our core team of tour operators rather than being passed from one member of staff to the next. We value storytelling over typical sightseeing and base our itineraries around these sorts of experiences so as to aid genuine cultural interaction for responsible travellers as well as first-class experiences to remember for all times.<br/>",

      "description": "Fly from Kolkata to Bagdogra and drive to Darjeeling, the erstwhile hill capital of the British and home of a sizeable Tibetan community. Stay in a heritage bungalow surrounded by one of the world’s finest tea producing plantations. Go for a short tour in the Darjeeling Himalayan railway. This train still uses the steam engine and is a wonderful experience in itself to witness the countryside. After the train ride, go for a guided tour of the tea gardens. Start by knowing the process of tea plantation and plucking followed by a short tour of the processing unit. You can also explore the local markets and monasteries on your own at leisure. We provide the necessary information for the same."

      "description": "Your next stay is with the Limboo tribal family in West Sikkim. On the way we briefly stop at the beautiful Temi tea gardens which are 100% organic. West Sikkim is home of Limboo, Lepcha and Nepali people. Spend time in the lap of mighty Kangchenjunga Mountain sipping the tea made from local herbs or munching on the Sikkimese snacks. Go for a nature walk with our guides from the same village. The walk takes you through organic farms of mainly cardamom, maize and vegetables. See traditional ways of bee keeping in Sikkim. Witness traditional architecture of Limboo houses made out of mud, wood and stone, and ancient burial grounds. Know about how the animists live in harmony with Buddhist, Hindu and Christian people. Visit some of these tribal families in their houses for a warm welcome. Visit the beautiful Pemayangtse and Dubdi monasteries, Khecheperi lake and Rabdentse ruins."

      "description": "Onward to south Sikkim where you spend next few days with a Bhutanese family. The community migrated from Bhutan before Sikkim merged into India. Although it is a small community, it holds position of great importance among the Sikkimese. Pamper yourself with a herbal healing experience, or participate in the traditional dances and songs, homemade cuisine, farming, and handicrafts (carpet weaving and wood carving). Depending upon your fitness level, we tailor your hike to the Menam wildlife sanctuary which is home of deer, fox and rare red Panda. This region is also home of Bon religion, which is pre-buddhist. Visit the monastery, and possibly chat with the monk if he is available. You may also witness community gatherings, prayers by monks in the village, celebrations for a newborn or seasonal harvest."
