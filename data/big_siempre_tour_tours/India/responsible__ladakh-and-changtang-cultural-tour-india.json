  "generalInfo": "This ten day tailor made cultural tour of Ladakh and the Changtang plateau region takes you from downtown Delhi into the Himalayan foothills to leave you in no uncertain terms as to the natural beauty of northern Indian.<br/><br/>Flying from Delhi to Leh, in Ladakh, allows for an efficient means of making the most of your time and we'd also recommend travelling during the months of June to September so as to coincide with the nomadic migration of the Changpa people.<br/><br/>The suggested itinerary below has been designed to incorporate many of the cultural highlights of Ladakh and Changtang as well as many lesser-known landmarks to give you an extremely well-rounded tour.<br/><br/>The opportunity to join the Changpa people as they embark on their journey from higher to lower ground for cattle grazing is a remarkable and rare experience. Camping out close to the herders' temporary villages is an authentic way to become immersed in the culture of the region as well as being able to experience, first-hand, the vast lakes and high altitude plateau on the Tibetan border.<br/><br/>Listening to the folklore tales around the campfire is one such way that travellers get to learn about the cultural traditions of the Changpa people, on their terms. This is not a gimmick or a display for the tourists, this is an opportunity to live with local families and find out more in a natural setting.<br/><br/>A combination of organised activities and organic adventures allows this ten day trip to unfold at your own pace as well as including interactive herding, cooking and dancing sessions to ensure you become completely immersed in the nomadic way of life in the mountains.<br/><br/>Spending two whole days within the Changpa community is an absolute privilege and an experience that's bound to stay long in the memory for cultural travellers and adventure seekers alike.<br/><br/>Life in Ladakh and on the Chantang plateau is geared around farming much of which means preparing food and livestock for the colder months of winter. The contrasts between life in the countryside and life in the town of Leh is significant and you'll find both locations provide fascinating perspectives with the meeting of Buddhism, Sikhism and Islamism, certain to make an indelible impact.",
