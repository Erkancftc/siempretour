  "generalInfo": "This Rajasthan small group tour not only takes you into the heart of Rajasthan, the great northern desert state, but also to the great sites of Delhi and Agra including the Taj Mahal. The group size on this trip is maximum twelve people and we will travel from place to place in private, air conditioned minibus, covering a wide variety of natural and cultural heritage sites. <br/><br/>Starting in Delhi, we take time to acclimatise a little and then visit some of the great sites, such as Old Delhi, India Gate and Humayun’s Tomb. From here we move on to Agra to see the great Taj Mahal which always lives up to expectations especially as we time our visit to coincide with sunset. Our next stop is the great desert state or Rajasthan to explore not only its magnificent, colourful and iconic cities such as Jodhpur and Jaipur but also plenty of rural villages too, where you get to immerse yourself in real Rajasthani culture. <br/><br/>Rajasthan, once known as a Princely state, always gives us a right royal welcome. Especially at the family run, heritage hotels where we stay along the way. The architecture is spectacular too, not only at these hotels but also at its famous hilltop forts or ancient palaces. Another highlight for many of our keen wildlife loving guests is the time spent at Ranthambore National Park, where we get a chance to take both sunrise and sunset safaris to see black buck, chinkaras, nilgais, civet cats and, if you are lucky, its elusive tigers. <br/><br/>This trip draws to a close in Udaipur, a fitting place to contemplate your time in Rajasthan as, like so many places we see along the way it is colourful, culture rich, beautiful and sacred. It is also known as ‘Venice of the East’, thanks to its complex lake system that winds its way around palaces, temples, ancient waterside dwellings and a wonderful collection of heritage hotels. All with a backdrop of Rajasthan’s  Aravalli Hills. <br/>",
