  "generalInfo": "Few places look as barren and inhospitable than the Trans-Himalayan highlands. Empty, rolling plains mostly made up of rock and scree as well as a few hardy grass species and stunted trees and bushes; all dominated by inaccessible steep rocky mountains and outcrops. <br/><br/>All of this do not seem like the best place to find wildlife. But this ecosystem is teeming with animals, from the ghost-like snow leopard and Eurasian lynx to herd dwelling Tibetan wild asses (kiang), argali, Asiatic ibex and Ladakhi urail there is a raft a life here waiting to be seen. <br/><br/>This tour is a specialist tour where some of the most elusive and specially adapted species of mammals and birds are searched for. So if you wish to be one of the few wildlife watchers to explore the vastness of India's Himalayas and possibly see some of the rarest species in the world then this tour is for you.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching tours and safari holidays all over the world, specialising in the Indian subcontinent and of course the wonderful and diverse country of India. Whilst most wildlife watchers who visit India spend time in the famous tiger reserves of the central plains or maybe the forests and grasslands of the north east of India and the Western Ghats in the south. But these ecosystems and incredible wildlife are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the wildlife that India has to offer. <br/><br/>This tour explores some of the lesser known regions and takes you into the wildest and least inhabited parts of India’s north west Himalayas. All of this whilst escorted by our very own expert zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us)coupled with local guides. Of course there is one species in particular that dominates everyone’s thoughts and dreams when they think of the stunning Himalayas nowadays and that is the majestic snow leopard. <br/><br/>Whilst there are chances of seeing snow leopards here we take time to showcase the their ecosystem in full and try and find as many other animals that share the mountains with snow leopards. Most of this trip will involve driving to spotting and scanning locations as well as walking among the high altitude grasslands and rocky slopes looking for animals that make this inhospitable locations their home. <br/><br/>One of the reasons why our safaris of India are unique is that our background (as a company) is from a scientific and zoological standpoint and so have a great network of colleagues and contacts all over the world who are the people on the front line in search of the best new locations for wildlife watching in the wild. All of these reasons and many more make us experts in arranging and guiding safaris and are able to tailor a Indian safaris to any location to try to find them that you request. All you have to do is to get in touch with us and tell us your budget and your group size and where you would like to go on safari.<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of Indian wildlife watching safari holidays. These tours range from the dry desert regions of Gujarat in search of striped hyena and Asiatic lions to the icy peaks of the Himalayas on the quest for snow leopards. But we also have a range of specific birding and bird watching tours, this being one of them.  <br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in cities and towns. There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through India and particularly birding holidays. Your naturalist escort is an expert in ornithology and their conservation and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. We will also employ a specific cultural guide for all sightseeing of temples and monuments.<br/><br/>The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, trekking permits, spotlighting, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the park. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>This tour is recommended for the northern hemisphere summer season. This is not the normal season people visit Ladakh for snow leopards, but they are seen throughout the year with good regularity. But the key factor here is that during the summer there are more roads and passes open to explore and the diversity of wildlife is much higher. Many of the herbivorous animals and migratory birds which leave to head to areas not covered with snow in winter are here in their numbers.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our bird watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• Our local Indian guides have a good relationship with the park and reserve officials and because of this we get a heads up when animals are sighted and this can guide us in where to focus and thus increasing our chances of seeing our targeted species.<br/>• Visit the parks and reserves morning and afternoon in your own private vehicle for your group only.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our wildlife and bird watching holidays of India a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout India so that we can try and find and observe birds. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of India at other times of year and focusing on other species such many mammals like tigers, snow leopards, elephants, rhinos and many species throughout this incredible country. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour visits a range of locations around Ladakh, your entry and exit point in Ladakh will be the city of Leh and when you arrive and depart from India you will travel through Delhi.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>This tour is at high altitude and whilst it is not full hiking, there are no long days of trekking; there are some hikes at altutude included and so a level of fitness or experience of being at altitude is needed for full enjoyment of the trip.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 Years Old",

However this afternoon we will try and find some interesting Himalayan birds, there are very few mammals around Leh so until we get more remote we will see what the avian world has to offer. A short downhill walk in the Stok area should prove productive for species like red & yellow billed choughs, Eurasian tree sparrows, Himalyan chukars, common kestrels, citrine wagtails and white-capped water redstarts. We will also keep our eyes open for mammals such as woolly hares and Himalayan pikas. In the late afternoon we will return to the accommodation for your dinner.

      "description": "Uley - Travelling & Wildlife Watching After breakfast you will be transferred to Uley village (~2 hours). The drive will bring us through the villages of Likir and Hemis Sukpachang and then eventually to the tiny village of Uley. The Snow Leopard Conservancy have reported snow leopard sightings in every month of the year here and the chances are pretty good for a sighting of the grey ghost. Over the next three full days we will have this elusive cat at the top of our list of animals to try and find. Started as soon as we have rested and grabbed some lunch. The village itself is made up of 4 or 5 houses and their families, the main livelihood being sheep, goat or yak farming and during our stay here your accommodation will be with these local people as they have opened their land to tourism and we will camp close to their houses and enjoy their hospitality. It is great to be welcomed into a small village such as this and hear of stories from people that live their lives in the presence of the ghost-like snow leopard. (all meals included)"

      "description": "Tso Kor - Travelling & Wildlife Watching Early this morning you will be taken to the check post at Karu and after a hot roadside breakfast you will continue onto Tso Kar via Lato and Rumtse – this is a spectacular drive. Lato is where the Indian plate collided with the Eurasian plate about 55 million years ago and you can see the impact of the collision here. The steep crevices and the rock faces in brilliant hues of pink, green, purple, red and ochre show what occurred in stunning colours. Here along the riversides you will be stopping to look for brown dipper, fire-fronted serins, Eurasian crag martin, Northern house martin, hill pigeon as well as fly bys from Himalayan griffons. There are chances of sighting mammals around here like the mountain weasel, stone marten, blue sheep and few other mammals. We will carry on towards Rumtse and look for golden eagle on a well known nest here, then wait and see if we can get to see the long tailed marmots, there will be birds like lammergeier, osprey, golden eagle, Himalayan griffon and of course possibilities of Himalayan snowcock, Tibetan partridge etc as we move towards Tso Kar. Along the way there are lots of birds species that can be seen including large flocks of horned larks, Tibetan snow finches, robin, brown and black-throated accentor, Tibetan lark, Brandt mountain finch etc near the Tso Kar area. Some of the speciality bird species here include the black-necked crane, great crested grebe, black-necked grebe, common tern, white-winged tern, Tibetan sandgrouse, nesting bar-headed geese and ruddy shelducks, saker falcon, upland buzzard and little owls. Also around here we will try are best to see some of the Himalayan mammal species such as Tibetan wild ass, woolly hare, silvery mountain vole, Tibetan argali, Tibetan wolf (however the chances of wolves depends on the movements of the Nomads as they follow them) and dhole. There is a small population of Eurasian lynx in the area surrounding this place however they are very hard to see here. So we will keep a look out for this with our local guide. After exploring the area for its mammals and birds we will head back to the accommodation, level camping; for your evening meal. (all of your meals are included today)."

There is also an area between Tso Moriri and Mahe which is Sumdo, Upper Sumdo, Chumathang as far as Yoye Tso. During the afternoon we will move to this area and set up the camp once again. By doing this we make the long drive back to Leh tomorrow shorter. (all meals included today)."
