  "generalInfo": "If you have always felt like exploring new and interesting places and not just following the crowd when it comes to safari destinations? Then this tiger safari for you. <br/><br/>On this Indian safari you will travel to two little known and seldom visited tiger reserves. Whilst we will be of course looking for tiger throughout we will also be occupying our time in Satpura and Panna National Parks with with searches for sloth bears, dhole, leopards, gaur, striped hyenas and jungle cats to name but a few. <br/><br/>This tour is quite unusual as it will not only combine day time safaris but also spotlighting night safaris (which is very unusual in India). Searching for animals by day and night is a new experience in India and all of a sudden animals which were deemed impossible to see are being spotted; such as striped hyena and leopard cats. Satpura, Panna and Jhinna are on the rise but if you book soon you may still be the only foreign people inside the park.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of Indian wildlife watching safari holidays. These tours range from the dry desert regions of Gujarat in search of striped hyena and Asiatic lions to the icy peaks of the Himalayas on the quest for snow leopards. But we also focus heavily on some of the 40 plus Tiger Reserves in this wonderful and diverse country. Two of these reserves are Satpura and Panna National Parks, both not often visited national parks but both full of incredible wildlife – but without the large numbers of tourists that can be found in the more popular and well known parks. <br/><br/>This tour explores these great parks on the trail of tigers of course, this iconic denizen of the Indian jungles is as symbolic of India as the Taj Mahal or Mahatma Ghandi. Satpura has a fantastic record for also showing the other predators of the jungle. Whilst rare and hard to see in other parks the leopards, sloth bears and dhole are all regularly seen here. So we will dedicate a large amount time to these species as well as the tigers whilst here. <br/><br/>Panna also has a good dhole and tiger population but another reason for visiting these two parks is that they allow a couple of things that other national parks and tiger reserves in India do not. Firstly you can stay overnight inside the park, there is a small lodging complex deep in the park. <br/><br/>They are a little more basic than the lodges of course but it allows you experience the park at night from within and also allows to get deeper into the jungle on our safaris as we do not have to come back to the entry gate in the evening. <br/><br/>But also along the buffer zone of the park we can go out after dark and spotlight. This is a great way of seeing some of India’s rarer and more elusive species such as leopards, striped hyena, Indian porcupine, common palm civet as well as owls and nightjars. <br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Delhi. There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through India and particularly Satpura and Panna. Your naturalist escort is an expert in tigers and their conservation and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. <br/><br/>The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, river safaris, spotlighting, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the park. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>This tour is recommended to run between February - May as this is the dry season and the most reliable time of year to see tigers, before the temperatures get too hot and not nice to be on safari in and of course before the monsoon comes and the tiger reserves close.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• Our local Indian guides around Satpura and Panna have a good relationship with the park officials and because of this we get a heads up when animals are sighted and this can guide us in where to focus and thus increasing our chances of seeing our targeted species.<br/>• The lodges we stay at in Satpura (Reni Pani Jungle Lodge) and Panna (Ken River Lodge) are one of the finest lodges in India, it also has a large area of land and have resident sloth bears and leopards that use their grounds (Reni Pani and wonderful views of the Ken River (Ken River).<br/>• Visit the park morning and afternoon as well as having the chance to stay inside the park on one occasion and also enjoy spotlighting after dark around the buffer zone to Satpura and spending an overnight in the bufferzone in Jhinna Jungle Camp run by Ken River Lodge.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our wildlife and tiger safaris of India a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout India so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the tigers, leopards, sloth bears, dhole and many more species. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of India at other times of year and focusing on other species such as brown and snow leopards, Indian one-horned rhinos, Western Ghats endemics, elephants, primates, Asiatic lions and many species throughout this incredible country. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour starts and ends in the historical city of Delhi, and the tour visits two different tiger reserves. Firstly Satpura and then Panna and when in Panna you will stay in a special camp in the bufferzone of the park.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from a vehicle or boat. So no physical fitness for hiking or anything like that is needed. This is a very easy trip to undertake.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 15 Years Old",

You can choose between jeep safaris or boat trips down the Ken River, we recommend jeep safaris as they cover more ground and will enable you to see a larger area of the park and have better chances of seeing wildlife. Along with the abundant wildlife in the park which includes a small population of tigers, there are ample other attractions to see including many waterfalls and numerous ancient cultural relics dotted around the park. Many people regard Panna National Park to be one of the most aesthetically beautiful parks in all of India. In between exploring the park in search of tigers, deer, wild boar and numerous bird species (over 200 species have been recorded here) you will come back to the lodge for lunch and then your evening meal.
