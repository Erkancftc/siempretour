  "generalInfo": "This nine day, tailor made holiday revolves around a carefully crafted itinerary that takes in not only the cultural highlights of Golden Triangle, India ‘s stunning historical trail, but also one of the country’s natural highlights too: seeing India’s tigers in Kanha National Park. <br/><br/>After a day of sightseeing in Delhi, you will head to the majestic city of Jaipur, where you are immersed in an eclectic and fascinating mix of royal architecture, from the Palace of the Winds to the Amber Fort, as well as ancient markets intermixed with this ancient majesty. <br/><br/>From the pink city of Jaipur to the white marble magnificence of the Taj Mahal in Agra. A vast mausoleum built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his late wife. Famous the world over, take time here to absorb its greatness. Ironically, history has it that the emperor was imprisoned and here say has it that he was able to see his creation from his prison cell. This part of the trip also takes you to the Agra Fort and also the nearby fortified ancient city of Fatehpur Sikri, the Mughal capital, from 1571 to 1585. <br/><br/>From the Taj to tigers, as our next stop is Kanha National Park in Madhya Pradesh, where magnificent habitats of rich, native sal forests and open dry grasslands are the perfect terrain for India’s finest mammal. There are around a hundred tigers within the park, a large part of the park also designated as the Kanha Tiger Reserve, formed by the prestigious and pioneering Project Tiger in 1974. There is a wealth of other wildlife here too, of course, from langurs to leopard, sambhar to rare swamp deer. On the three game drives you will be accompanied by an expert naturalist guide.  <br/><br/>The holiday cost includes bed and breakfast accommodation, driver guide and air conditioned vehicle in Delhi and Agra, entrance fees, transfers and overnight air conditioned rail journey. During your time in Kanha National Park you will stay in a luxury lodge, with all meals, game drives, park and naturalist guide fees included. <br/><br/>Please note that as this is a tailor made itinerary, we can always adapt it to your needs and interests. For example, many of our guests include an additional day or two to Varanasi and Khajuraho’s temples. Please do not hesitate to contact us to discuss any further ideas. <br/>",

The pink colour was used to create an impression of red sandstone buildings of Mughal cities and repainted in 1876, during the visit of the Prince of Wales. The city is best explored on foot and the adventurous visitor willing to go into the inner lanes can discover a whole new world not visible to the tourist-in-a-hurry. Overnight hotel."

The City Palace complex is the most important landmark with its numerous outbuildings, courtyards, impressive gateways and temples. Across the road from the palace is the Jantar Mantar, one of the five observatories built by Sawai Jai Singh. A collection of complex astronomical instruments, chiselled out of stone - most of which continue to provide fairly accurate information to this day - is the highlight of this observatory.
