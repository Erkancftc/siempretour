      "description": "Arrive Delhi - On arrival in Delhi today you will be received and taken to your hotel. Delhi with its Old and New parts — each with its specific charm and glory — makes a very interesting city for its sustenance to medieval and modern cultures at the same time and space. While Old Delhi, built by Mughal Emperor Shahjehan in the 17th century, still retains its medieval character to a great extent and almost indubitably reminds one of the crowded old towns of the Middle East; New Delhi is like any other modern city with tall buildings and massive shopping complex."

      "description": "Delhi - This morning you will be taken to visit the Jama Mosque followed by a walking/rickshaw ride tour of traditional businesses of Old Delhi (some markets in Old Delhi are closed on Sundays) – exploring centuries old arts and crafts with businessmen belonging to the 6th or 7th generation of the men who first started them. You will visit a marvellous old-fashioned shop where you can test Indian perfume (attar) from cut-glass bottles. You will saunter through the main bridal street of Old Delhi, Kinari Bazaar, with its dazzling display of embroidered silk wedding sarees, beautiful bangles and colourful turbans for the bridegroom. The Khari Baoli is all about spices - here, rice and dal, dry fruits, nuts and saffron dealers have traded for more than 150 years. The smell of the spices will remain with you even after you have left the market. Later in the afternoon you will be taken to explore New Delhi – including Humayun’s Tomb, Qutab Minar and drive past Lutyens’ Delhi. Humayun's Tomb is another magnificent Mughal building built in 1565-66 and set in a square enclosed garden. This finely proportioned structure in red sandstone and marble served later as a model for the Taj Mahal. Dominating the ruins of the earliest existing settlement of Delhi is the city's famous landmark - the Qutab Minar. This imposing victory tower (73 m) has five storeys, each marked by intricately carved projections or balconies. Elaborately carved pillars embellish the courtyard of a nearby mosque. At the centre of the courtyard is the amazing Iron Pillar (4th-5th century A.D.), which has not rusted through the centuries. The interesting buildings of Lutyens’ Delhi are the India Gate, the Rashtrapati"

      "description": "Delhi to Varansi - This morning you will be collected from your hotel and taken to the airport in time to board your flight to Varanasi. On arrival in Varanasi you would be received and taken to your hotel. Varanasi is a city of temples and places of worship and for more than 2000 years, it has attracted pilgrims from near and far. Many Hindus in the latter part of their lives wish to spend their retirement here. This is the city of Varanasi. According to Hindu belief, Benaras or Varanasi as it is known, is the cosmic centre of the Universe. Mark Twain once wrote, “Beneras is older than history, older than other tradition, older even than legends and looks twice as old as all of them put together”. Situated between the rivers Varuna and Assi as they join the Ganges, Varanasi takes its name from its location. It is also called Kashi, the city of lights. In the evening you will be taken to the ghats of the Ganges where you walk around and witness the mesmerising evening aarti."

      "description": "Varansi - Early this morning you will be taken to the ghats once again and enjoy boat ride on the river while watching spectacular sunrise. Viewing the ghats early in the morning from a boat on the river can be an unforgettable experience. The river front, as seen from a boat, early in the morning, at sunrise, is a spiritually uplifting sight. Hinduism, deep and mystical, is everywhere - in a decorated doorway, in a glimpse of a glittering temple, in the sound of a sacred bell and the chants of the priests.... After your boat ride you will be taken on a brief walking tour of the old town. The lanes and by-lanes of Varanasi are as fascinating as one can imagine. Shops sell rich brocade silks, brassware and also all the articles essential for worship at numerous little shrines. You will return to your hotel for breakfast and the rest of the morning would be at leisure."

      "description": "Varanasi – Khajuraho/Panna - After a leisurely morning you will be collected from your hotel and taken to the airport in time to board your flight to Khajuraho. On arrival in Khajuraho you will be met and taken for a short tour of Khajuraho. Once the capital of great Chandela rulers, Khajuraho today, is a quiet village of only few thousand people. In the temples of Khajuraho, the sculptures have shown many aspects of Indian life of over thousand years ago - gods and goddesses, warriors and musicians, real and mythological animals. Indeed, the theme of the sculptures also include erotic life of the period though this aspect of the sculpture has been over-emphasised...at the expense of other themes of the temple sculptures. Khajuraho's temples almost all date from one century-long burst of creative genius from 950-1050 AD. Basically all temples follow a three-part layout. You enter the temple through a porch (Ardhamandapa). Behind this is the hall (Mahamandapa), supported with pillars and with a corridor around it. The inner sanctum (Garbhagriha) is where the image of the god, to which the temple is dedicated, is displayed. The temples are almost all aligned east to west, with the entrance facing east. Most of the temples are made of sandstone. The temples can be divided into three groups: Western, Eastern and Southern. Of these, the Western Group is the most impressive. After visiting the temples you will be driven a short distance to Panna."

      "description": "Khajuraho/Panna - Early this morning you will be taken to visit the Panna National Park in a game drive. Lying along the river Ken, Panna National Park contains large areas of un-spoilt forest and a variety of wildlife spread over almost 543 sq. km. The tiger can be glimpsed here, though rarely, with other rare species such as the leopard, wolf and gharial. Herds of bluebulls, chinkara and sambhar are a common sight. Rest of the day may be spent in leisure or you may undertake activities and excursions (at an additional cost) available here: • Fishing on the pristine Ken river, walks through the crop fields of the surrounding countryside and birding on site or at nearby forest and wetland areas. • Visit a number of seasonal waterfalls in the neighbouring area • Visit Maheba/Dhubela where there are majestic Chhatris (cenotaphs) of the Bundela Maharaja and his queens. • You may also visit Ajaygarh Fort; this rarely visited wonderful hilltop fort that has equally rich and even older temples and carvings than Khajuraho."

      "description": "Khajuraho/Panna – Orchha – Jhansi - Agra - After a leisurely morning you will be driven to Jhansi Rail Station (3 ½ hours) to board your train to Agra (Shatabdi Express; departing Jhansi at 1845; arriving Agra at 2110). En route you will visit the sleepy little town of Orchha. Orchha is a city frozen in time. It was founded by Bundela Chieftain, Raja Rudra Pratap in the 16th century, who chose this stretch of land along the Betwa River as an ideal site for his capital. He and the succeeding rulers of Orchha built many beautiful palaces and temples in the 16th and 17th century. Today, remains of the fort and palaces speak eloquently of Orchha’s time of glory. Though little more than a village, stepping back in time into Orchha’s history is an enjoyable experience. On arrival in Agra you will be received and taken to your hotel."

      "description": "Agra - Jaipur - Early this morning you wil be taken to visit Taj Mahal around sunrise. The Taj Mahal (closed on Fridays) has been described as a 'tear on the face of eternity' and as an enduring monument of love. The unique beauty of Taj Mahal is blended with grandeur and its massive over-all design is matched with immaculately intricate execution. Built by Mughal Emperor Shan Jehan in the memory of his beloved queen Mumtaz Mahal, the Taj Mahal complex took 22 years to be completed and is today counted among the Seven Wonders of the World. Return to your hotel for breakfast. After check out you will be taken to visit Agra Fort. Many of the events which led to the construction of the Taj took place in the famous Agra Fort. Begun by Emperor Akbar in 1565, additions continued to be made until the time of his grandson Shah Jehan. The magnificent palaces, towers, bastions, ramparts and gateways symbolise the power of the mighty Mughals. Made mostly of red sandstone it is strikingly similar to the Red Fort in Delhi. After lunch in a city restaurant (pay directly), you will be driven to Jaipur (4 hours drive) – en route visit the deserted Mughal city of Fatehpur Sikri. Fatehpur Sikri was built by great Mughal Emperor Akbar in the 16th century to serve as the capital of his vast empire. The city was decorated with grand courts, palaces, mosques and gardens that rivalled the splendours of Delhi and Agra. However, destiny had other things in store for the city. Shortage of water and un-rest in the north-west made Akbar abandon the city only 13 years later. Today, even after the passage of 400 years, the magnificence of this royal city has not faded and remains immaculately preserved. You will arrive in Jaipur early in the evening and will be at leisure for the rest of the day."

      "description": "Jaipur - Today you will be taken for a tour of Jaipur city. Start the day with a visit to the milk market where large quantities of milk is procured from individual sellers and then resold to bulk buyers. Enjoy the interesting ways by which the buyers judge the purity of milk and negotiate the prices. Afterwards continue to Amber Fort - one of the more fascinating of Indian forts. It was the ancient capital of the erstwhile Jaipur state. Its construction began in 16th century and was subsequently added on to by successive rulers. Inside the fort, the places worth visiting are the Palace of Mirrors, inlaid with millions of tiny glistening mirrors, the hall of Public Audience and the beautiful manicured gardens. After lunch in a city restaurant (pay directly) you will be taken to visit the City Palace, Jantar Mantar (medieval observatory) and drive past Hawa Mahal (palace of winds). The City Palace is situated in the heart of the city. The whole complex is wonderfully laid out with large courtyards, balconies, cupolas, arched entrances and gardens, which are a combination of Rajput and Mughal architecture. The museum here displays the rich heritage of the Jaipur family in miniature paintings, textiles, garments, books & manuscripts, carpets, palanquins and weapons dating back to the 15th century. The medieval observatory has curious collection of sculptures which enable the calculation of many astronomical and astrological events like eclipses etc. Each of these structures was built after relentless study of books, manuscripts and discussions with scholars from all over the world. Even today they are put to good work. Built in 1799 Hawa Mahal or the palace of winds is one of the landmarks of Jaipur city, although it is little more than a façade. It is a five-storey building in pink, built to enable the women of the harem to see the activities of the outside world without being seen."

The main temple, dating back to 1439, is called the Chaumukha Temple or the “Four-faced temple” and is dedicated to Adinath — the first of Jain teachers. Beautiful sculpture and grand structures mark the glory of this place. It has 29 halls supported by 1,444 carved pillars, none of which are alike. After visiting the temples you will continue to Udaipur where you will arrive early evening."

      "description": "Udaipur - Though the entire state of Rajasthan is replete with fantastic hilltop fortresses, exotic fairytale palaces and gripping legends of medieval chivalry and heroism, no city is quite as romantic as Udaipur. ‘The city of lakes’, as Udaipur is called, is one of the most sought after destinations in entire India for relaxing.

This morning you will be taken for a guided city tour of Udaipur city – including City Palace, Sahelion-ki-Bari and Jagdish Temple. The huge city palace, towering over the lake, is the largest palace complex in Rajasthan. It is a blend of stern Rajput military architecture on the outside and lavish Mughal-inspired decorative art on the inside. The beautiful gardens of Sahelion-ki-Bari were laid out in the mid-18th century for a retinue of forty-eight young ladies-in-waiting that were sent to Udaipur as part of a princess's dowry. The gardens have beautiful lawns, lotus pools, marble pavilions and marble elephant-shaped fountains. Situated close to the City Palace is Jagdish temple in Indo-Aryan style.
