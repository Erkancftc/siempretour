He also erected three palaces, one for each of his favorite wives, one who was Muslim, one who was Hindu, and another who was Christian. Citizens of Fatehpur Sikri abandoned the masterful work of architecture shortly after the emperor’s death due to water shortages in the area. Jama Masjid, the main mosque of the city, contains elements of Persian and Indian design.

It took 20,000 men more than 20 years to complete the structure. Marble and precious stones add remarkable splendor to the enchanting architectural design. The onion-shaped dome reaches a height of 240 feet tall, centered between the four separate minarets. The gardens encompass more than 40 acres and guide visitors to the tomb entrance. The stones, such as lapis lazuli and mother of pearl, form twining vines, fruits, and flowers around the walls and inlaid surfaces.

The city draws visitors excited to view the legendary mountains, intrigued by the unique culture, or hoping for a spiritual awakening amidst the high altitude. The city is located at nearly 4,600 feet above sea level in the Kathmandu Valley, surrounded by the Himalayan foothills. Parts of Nepal’s capital city are still feeling the effects of the 2015 earthquake that caused devastation around the valley floor and up into the hills. However, the life of the city remains constant and has mostly recovered its captivating combination of color, sounds, and aromas. Rickshaws race through old town and medieval temples continue to ring prayer bells throughout the day. The back streets hold a remarkable timelessness representing the artistic heritage in hidden temples shimmering with blossoming marigolds and courtyards dusted with the scent of drying chilies and rice. Swapna Bagaicha , the Garden of Dreams, is one of the most tranquil locations in the city. Although the site is only a two-minute walk from the bustling heart of Thamel, the commercial district of the capital, it feels miles away. The garden and pavilions retain gorgeous detail, including marble inscriptions on the original gate. Fountains and ponds trickling add to the serene ambiance inside the single acre that remains of the original 40 acres. Nepali couples relax on the lawn mats supplied by the garden and enjoy a quiet moment wrapped in each other’s arms."

The royal palace of Hanuman Dhoka was founded during the Licchavi period between the 4th and 8th centuries. The compound expanded in the 17th century, but the 2015 earthquake caused significant damage to the grounds. However, reconstruction is underway to return the royal courtyards and museum to their former glory. Turn your attention instead to the rectangular courtyard of Itum Bahal, the Buddhist monastery located in the historical quarter. The grounds remain a haven of serenity amidst the chaotic streets of central Kathmandu. A Bodhi tree grows through the center of the pagoda in front of the entrance."

Your guide escorts you out of town for the day, leading you to the ancient culture and fascinating history of the Kathmandu Valley, beginning with the city of Bhaktapur, the third medieval city-state in the valley. The scars of the 2015 earthquake remain visible in the city once described as the best-preserved medieval city in the country. However, the city maintains its namesake of Bhadgon , which means “City of Devotees.” The dedicated residents are eager to rebuild the city and return the luster to the three public squares surrounded by the staggering temples that reflect remarkable religious architecture.

Culture remains on display with artisans weaving textiles, chiseling timber, and crafting ceramics in open kilns. You can hear locals playing intense card games or socializing in their communal courtyards while collecting water to create a mosaic of daily life in the historic city. The Nyatapola Temple has a towering rooftop reaching nearly 100 feet above the Taumadhi Tole. It is the tallest temple in Nepal and one of the tallest buildings in the entire Kathmandu Valley. The edifice was erected in the early 18th century with perfect proportions with such structural integrity that it has survived the major earthquakes of 1934 and 2015 with minor damage. Stone temple guardians flank the stairway and legendary Rajput wrestlers Jaimal and Phattu kneel with hefty maces along the bottom steps. The temple is dedicated to Siddhi Lakshmi, an incarnation of the goddess Durga. 180 carved roof struts dangle above a canopy of braided snakes in the torana , an arched gateway."
