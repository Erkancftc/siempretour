      "description": "Bhimbetka - Satpura National Park: Setting off after breakfast on the three-hour drive to Satpura, you will pause 45 kms south of Bhopal to see the extraordinary cave paintings at Bhimbetka. The paintings at this UNESCO site are believed to be up to 30,000 years old. Your onward journey south will bring you to a luxurious jungle lodge at Satpura National Park. Nestled in the Satpura mountain range, this national park is one of India’s best kept secrets, with a very limited number of jeeps allowed inside the park and the opportunity to explore the beautiful landscape on foot, or in a canoe. If you feel like a break from the twice daily jungle safaris, you can walk or ride a horse in the adjacent jungle or lay by the pool or enjoy a massage from an expert masseur. With a wide range of habitats and altitudes, Satpura offers a wealth of wildlife viewing that is amongst the best in India. Nowhere else are gaur (the giant Asian bison), the much sought-after sloth bear and the elusive Asian wild dog so abundant and easily seen. These species, together with the beautiful Indian giant squirrel and the leopard (which is relatively common here), make up Satpura’s ‘big five’. Sambar, chital, muntjac, blue bull, blackbuck, wild boar, rhesus macaques and common langurs, marsh mugger crocodiles, and even the elusive chousingha, may also be seen, while Indian skimmer, bar-headed geese, grey junglefowl, both red and painted spurfowl, Malabar pied hornbill, blue-bearded bee-eater and tawny-bellied babbler are amongst Satpura’s avian specialities."

      "description": "Satpura National Park - Bandhavgarh: After a final morning safari at Satpura, you will be driven to Sohagpur (16 kms) to board the express train to Katni. Katni is located 100 kms (a two hour drive) from Bandhavgarh. You will be staying in luxury forest lodge, a pretty eco-resort just a few kms from Bandhavgarh National Park. Every day before the crack of the dawn you will be given a wakeup call with tea/coffee. Search for the elusive cat for the next three days on twice daily game drives. The faunal assemblage of Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve is of typical Central Indian species, including tiger, leopard, chital (spotted deer), sambar deer, wild dogs, nilgai, wild boar, sloth bear, rhesus macaque, black facedlangurs, jungle cat, hyena, jackal, fox, and barking deer. There are 250 bird species belonging to 53 families in Bandhavgarh National Park. Among them 138 are resident, 26 are local migrants and 86 are migrants. It is the density of its big cat population that has made Bandhavgarh really famous across the globe. Many of ita tigers have played pivotal roles in numerous films made on Indian wildlife."

      "description": "Bandhavgarh – Kanha: After breakfast you will head south to the beautiful Kanha National Park, where you will stay in a lovely tented camp on the quieter side of the park. The air conditioned tents are canvas–walled homes on solid foundations with ensuite bathrooms, and the owners are the best of hosts. There is much to do here besides tiger hunting, with plenty of village walks and an excellent resident naturalist. The camps wooded surroundings and deep pool offer plenty of scope for bird and butterfly watching. Spend four adventure filled days here with morning and evening game drives in search of birds and mammals. And if you feel you’ve spent long enough rattling around in the back of a jeep, you can stretch your legs on a walk to a local Baiga tribal village. Kanha national park is located in Maikal hills of the Satpura mountain ranges. Sal trees predominate in the area, along with mixed forest of bamboo and teak. Meadows dot the park serving excellent grazing grounds for numerous prey species. These meadows are created as a result of the slash and burn practices of the Baiga tribespeople, who never plough the land, considering it equivalent to scarring the body of their mother, the earth. Wildlife is abundant here with tiger at the top of the food chain. The park is home to 22 species of large mammals and well over 200 species of birds. Commonly spotted animals include the sambar, the largest of the Indian deer, nilgai or blue bull, the barking deer and the chousingha, the world’s only four horned antelope. One can also see the sloth bear, locally called bhaloo, the same name given by Rudyard Kipling to the loveable bear in \"The Jungle Book\" as well as the thickly muscled gaur or Indian bison. The barasingha, a close relative of the swamp deer found up north in the terai forests, is referred to as the \"Jewel of Kanha\" and is making a remarkable comeback after being on the brink of extinction and can be found only in this area. Many birds can also be observed here including the racket-tailed drongo, 5 species of dove, flycatchers, Malabar pied hornbill, lesser whistling duck, common teal, pintail, cotton teal and the shoveler. The crested serpent eagle, honey buzzard, and the black-winged kite are the main birds of prey."
