      "title": "Mumbai – Arrive in Mumbai with a Private Introduction to the City",
      "description": "The city of Mumbai pulses with activity at all hours of the day and acts as the gateway to India along the shores of the Arabian Sea. Furthermore, the city represents the deep contrasts of India, which are set between history and modernity. Grand colonial-era architecture decorates the historic neighborhoods of the city, while winding lanes lead to unique bazaars and hidden temples. Your private transfer will meet you at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport upon your arrival to escort you to your luxurious accommodation at the heart of the city. After settling in to the comforts of your hotel, your guide will meet you in the lobby for a private tour of the city’s dynamic neighborhoods. The monument known as the Gateway to India was built in the early 20th century but represents the iconic style of 16th-century Gujarat. The basalt arch rises over Mumbai Harbour and remains a popular destination for people-watching as vendors sell fresh bhelpuri . The Taj Mahal Palace lines the waterway with a mixture of Islamic and Renaissance design and remains one of India’s most photographed monuments. The structure was built in 1903 and remains indelible to the city’s rich history."

      "description": "In the morning, the aroma of spicy lentils and dried chickpeas will fill the streets of Mumbai and fade beneath the enticing spices of masala chai. When you are ready, your private transfer will meet you at your hotel and escort you to the airport for a brief flight to Aurangabad, which is the former home to the Mughal Emperor, Aurangzeb. After indulging in the luxuries of your hotel, your guide will lead you on a fascinating tour of the city’s layered history, beginning with the Bibi-ka-Maqbara. The four minarets and bulbous dome create a striking resemblance to the Taj Mahal but were crafted mainly from lime mortar and interspersed with marble adornments. You will then make your way to the Ellora Caves, which will offer insight into the early Buddhist architecture of India. The collection of 100 structures, which are etched into the hillside, dates back to the 6th or 7th century AD and is spread over a half-mile area. Thirty-four of the caves are open to the public, and Temple 16 possesses a life-size elephant statue within a complex that has been excavated to resemble a chariot and was dedicated to Lord Shiva."

      "title": "Aurangabad – Traverse the Unique Contours of Ajanta",
      "description": "In the morning, you will find the aromas of red mutton curry as it slowly cooks. After breakfast, your guide will escort you to the countryside and the remote river valley that hosts caves that were carved between the 2nd century BC and the 6th century AD. The scent of wet soil and herbaceous trees derives from the surrounding Deccan forest. Your guide will point out distinctive elements of the architecture as you arrive in the network of caves, where you will notice the facades that adorn the cliffs of the horseshoe-shaped gorge. You will enter the first cave to find gorgeous decorations that explain the Bodhisattva Padmapani, which is the interpretation that depicts the most iconic Ajanta artwork. The terrace leads to a congregation hall, where you will discover sculptures and murals that add a deeper perspective to the artwork by representing daily life and showing characters with active facial expressions. Colors across the murals remain vibrant and were crafted using local minerals. You will continue to other caves, including Cave 16, which possesses the most famous paintings of the complex."

Your private transfer will escort you to the airport for your flight to Goa, where your driver will escort you to the luxuries of your centrally located hotel.

After you have settled in, you will meet your instructor for a private cooking lesson that will offer you insight into the layers of Goa’s unique flavors. Before your cooking course, you will begin your tour with a visit to the local market at Panjim City, where the aromas of dried fish and Goan spices fill the aisles.

Your guide will meet you at your hotel after breakfast to escort you to the heart of the old city, where the imposing churches and cathedrals retain their original luster. The Se Cathedral was built in the 16th century, and you can view the remaining tower houses, including the Golden Bell, which is the largest tower house in Asia. The Archeological Museum displays the history of Goa before the arrival of the Portuguese with artifacts that date back to ancient Hindu temples, including a collection of sati stones, which are markers that signify a spot where a widow flung herself onto her husband’s funeral pyre. You will then continue to a spice farm, where your guide will lead you through the spices that are grown in Goa, such as black pepper, cloves, cardamom, and tamarind, which all collectively share the history of trade and colonialism in the region."

      "description": "With the day at your leisure to explore Goa, you can dig your toes in the golden sand along the Arabian Sea or venture to the 12th-century Mahadeva Temple at Tambdi Surla. For another relaxing immersion into the history of Goa, you can visit the charming quarter of Fontainhas in Panjim. The Latin Quarter rises above the ancient Ourem Creek and edges the Altinho hills. The colorful colonial architecture shines with fluorescent and pastel facades, representing the 18th-century wealth of Portugal. The narrow-cobbled lanes will whisk you back in time as you marvel at the houses that have been painted green, yellow, and blue. Each is crowned by a set of red-colored tiled. Captivating cafes and bakeries divide the homes and fill the air with the aromas of freshly baked bread and masala chai. You can visit the 19th-century Chapel of St. Sebastian to find a pristine white façade that glints beneath the surrounding trees. In the evening, you can experience a traditional Tiatr , which is an authentic performance that involves six or seven acts of music, dance, satire, or comedy."
