    "placesVisited": "Stay in three tiger reserves, two nights in Delhi, guided tour of old and New Delhi, fly to Jabalpur, Bandhavgarh National Park, Kanha National Park, Pench National Park, fly from Nagpur to Delhi, game drives, accommodation, transfers and local flights included",
    "generalInfo": "This India safari holiday travels to three of India’s most prestigious Tiger Reserves, in search of these beautiful big cats. You’ll enjoy game drives in Bandhavgarh, Kanha and Pench National Parks, which are all found in the state of Madhya Pradesh. You will also have time to explore New Delhi at the start of this holiday, so you can see some of this great city’s famous sights. From here, fly to tiger country.<br/><br/>Tigers are not the only species you can hope to see while on safari. These three national parks are home to leopards, sloth bears and wild dogs, too, as well as Indian gaur, sambhar, wild boar, cheetal, languor and a huge number of birds. This safari holiday supports local conservation work, through membership of TOFT Tigers (Travel Operators for Tigers). <br/><br/>November, February, March and April are the best times to go on tiger safari in India. May can be very hot, but wildlife sightings are great now as undergrowth dies back and animals head to dwindling water supplies to drink. October is also possible, while December and January tend to be less busy and popular, but morning game drives in open jeeps are cold.<br/><br/>Do chat to us about your interests and requirements and together we can create the perfect trip. The accommodation is four star, with a mix of lodge styles throughout the holiday, but you can upgrade to five star. Families are welcome and children under 12 years enjoy a 50% discount on adult prices. There are no hidden extras, and we aim to give you an all-inclusive price, with any later additions clearly shown on your itinerary. <br/>",

Rich in culture, architecture, lush gardens, and human diversity, the city’s storied past is reflected in its grand monuments, museums, and galleries. It is divided into two distinct yet harmonious halves: Old Delhi, steeped in centuries of history, and New Delhi, a legacy of the British Raj. Your day of exploration is split into two parts, each offering a unique perspective on this dynamic capital—accompanied throughout by a private guide. Morning – Old Delhi After breakfast, your guide and driver will collect you for a tour through the historic heart of the city: Jama Masjid India’s largest mosque, built in 1658, featuring two towering 40-metre minarets crafted from red sandstone and white marble. Chandni Chowk A bustling 17th-century bazaar where you’ll enjoy a rickshaw ride through its maze-like alleys, soaking in the vibrant atmosphere and fragrant spice market. Red Fort (Exterior) The imposing red sandstone walls of this UNESCO World Heritage Site stretch over two kilometres, rising 33 metres above the city’s lively streets. Raj Ghat A peaceful memorial garden marking the cremation site of Mahatma Gandhi, set along the banks of the Yamuna River. Lunch follows before your afternoon tour. Afternoon – New Delhi Your afternoon reveals the elegance and grandeur of New Delhi: Qutab Minar A 73-metre hand-carved “Tower of Victory,” showcasing exquisite Afghan architecture. Humayun’s Tomb"

We kick off in the culturally and photographically rich city of Calcutta. This is one of our own favourite cities known for its welcoming friendly inhabitants, fabulous street food and oodles of out of this world street photography. From Calcutta a relatively short flight to the Northeast transports us to Nagaland and Assam, two of India’s remote eight sister states. Once in Nagaland there will be ample opportunity to photograph the ancient spring tribal festival of Aoleong Monyü. During the last four days of our tour based in Mon we will visit some very remote Konyak Naga villages. These series of unique and separate tribal village celebrations are very raw, in their original form and without refinement. The Konyak Naga tribal villages are way out and spread up and beyond the Myanmar border. In addition to visiting several villages around our base main base Mon we will also visit Longwa one of the most remote villages of all.<br/><br/>The mid-part of our tour in Assam provides a wonderful contrast to its Naga neighbour. In Assam we will encounter a wild fusion of Indo Burmese, Mongolian and Aryan influences, a land of red rivers and blue hills, drumming dancing monks and tea plantations. The mighty Bramaputra River defines the Assamese Landscape. We will visit one of the world’s largest river islands where we find the Mishing tribes who originally moved down from mountainous areas such as Arunachal Pradesh. The Mishing are renowned for their unique fishing methods and river navigation prowess. We have been running photographic tours in Nagaland and Assam for ten years now. Throughout this time, we have worked closely with a local guide, who is a talented photographer and excellent organiser. Thanks to his close relationships with the local community, we have been able to create some truly powerful documentary photography.<br/><br/><br/>CALCUTTA STREET PHOTOGRAPHY<br/>Calcutta is a superb location for photographers from the riot of the flower bazaar to the clay idol makers’ den, Kumartuli, from the Howrah Bridge to the cremation ghats – it’s the buzz of life. If people and photographing people in their natural environment, crowded bazaars and magnificent street food is what gets you going then Calcutta is not to be missed. We will spend three nights and two whole days exploring a wide variety of locations in the city before heading off on Day 4 to Nagaland.",

An outsider entering a village needs to pay his respects to the Angh and take his permission to visit the village. Polygamy too thrives for the chiefs despite the advent of christianity and its supposedly modern lessons. The young Nagas today are proudly reclaiming their identity and traditions!

After arriving in Agra we'll make a stop for lunch at the Sheroes Hangout Cafe The cafe was set up by the Chhanv Foundation and is run by victirms of acid attacks. The cafe works to raise awareness of acid attacks in India and to empower those who have sadly been the victims of these heinous crimes. Prior to gaining employment in the cafe, many of the 'Sheroes' led solitary lives, rarely going outside due to shame associated with their scars. At Encounters Travel we're proud to support such an organisation, which has the sole aim of helping these women find acceptance, a supportive community and a means of income. Lunch will be included whilst at the cafe. Once you've checked in into your hotel, we'll spend the afternoon on a Mughal Heritage Walk through the ancient village of Kachhpura and surrounding farmland on the banks of the Yamuna River across from the Taj Mahal and Red Fort. This walk has been designed by a local NGO and helps support the local community through employment and new infrastructure. During the walk one of the villagers will give a guide to their village life, the layout of their homes, with living, cooking & religious areas, the farming done, and the local cottage industry for leather shoe making which helps Agra export shoes all over the world. You'll also see some lesser known but important Mughal era monuments. Finally today we'll stroll around the park at Mehtab Bagh - originally built by Emperor Babur as the last in a series of 11 parks on the Yamuna River's east bank, before taking in the magnificent sight of the Taj Mahal at sunset. A special evening option is available today, where you can join a Hindu family for a Vegetarian Thali cooking lesson and meal. OVERNIGHT"

On our tour of the city we'll make stops at the Synagogue, the spice market and the the Dutch Palace which was built in 1555 by the Portuguese as a gift to the Raja of Kochi at the time. In 1663 the palace was captured by the Dutch but was later used as Royal Residence by the Rajas of Kochi for many more years. One sight which Kochi has become famous for are the scenes of the Chinese Fishing nets which add a unique charm to the Kochi waterfront. The origin of these nets being used in Kochi is still debated and whilst they are referred to as Chinese Fishing nets, there is actually no evidence of these nets having come from China. Some theories suggest these were introduced by the Portuguese. Why not spend tonight at a Kathakali Dance performance.

Next we'll visit one of the many tea-plantations which surround Munnar. You'll see vibrant green tea bushes, neatly trimmed into precise rows hugging the hillsides. You'll also likely see tea-pickers hard at work, moving swiftly between the tea-bushes, using their expert hands to pick the freshest of tea leaves. Next we'll learn about the processes involved in how these freshly picked leaves become the tea you're familiar with back at home. You'll see the trays on which the withering process takes places, before watching the rolling machines release the natural juices which aid the oxidation process which takes place next.

The main reason for coming to Lake Periyar is for the wildlife which is in abundance in this area. An whilst we can't guarantee you'll see any specific animals, it's not uncommon to see Elephants along the lake shore, coming down for a drink or bathing in the water.

A real highlight of any visit to Kerala is an overnight stay onboard one of the beautiful houseboats which this part of India has become known for. Kerala houseboats, known as Kettuvallams, are an incredible blend of tradition and modern comfort. Kettuvallams originally served as cargo boats, transporting rice and spices through the waterways. They were masterfully constructed without using a single nail, with planks of wood tied together using coir rope and coated with a protective resin made from cashew nut shells. Today's luxurious houseboats retain the traditional charm but incorporate modern amenities, transforming them into floating retreats. Whilst the exact route the houseboat takes will be determined by local conditions at the time of your visit, a typical day onboard a houseboat is all about slow, peaceful rhythms and quiet immersion in nature. The captain will navigate the boat through the narrow waterways of the backwaters, keep your eyes peeled for vibrant kingfishers, graceful egrets, and water lilies blooming on the waters edge. We may make a stop at a local village which you can explore or you can try your hand at fishing with the rods which are available to hire onboard.

No text mentioned this old livelihood; however it was discovered evidence of its trade links with Rome and Mesopotamia, the archaeological sites of Arikamedu and Bahur 20 km of the city.

    "generalInfo": "There are few animals in the world that evoke such imagery and emotion as the sleek, glossy form of a jet black panther walking through vibrant green jungle. But for many years the idea of seeing one of these unusual leopards in the wild was a pipe dream. But then a dominant male leopard in a place called Kabini, part of Nagarhole National Park in Southern India changed all of that. <br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>When thinking of the vast subcontinent of India from an environmental point of view it is often easy to think of a thriving sea of humanity and great swathes of land cleared for rice production and large landfills where poor Indian children collect items they can sell for pittance; all of this mixed with the horror stories of tiger poaching.<br/><br/>The very idea of there being large and well protected populations of wildlife and big ecosystems still home to a great variety of wildlife seems strange. But that is the case in some areas of southern India, the Western Ghats region is home to many species of wildlife and some of the last large populations of megafauna. This trip will focus on one such place, the stunning Nagahole National Park. This is a largely forested areas and home to a diverse collection of wildlife.<br/><br/>This tour is focused, not on just one species but actually one individual animal, there is a large male leopard that occupies a territory in the tourism zone near Kabini. Over the last few years this particular leopard has become globally famous and also one of the most sought after and photographed animals in the world. The reason being that this particular male leopard is melanistic. Meaning that it has a special gene which results the general colour pattern of leopards (yellowish with black rosettes) not being present; instead the rosettes are hidden under a dark pelage of jet black.<br/><br/>This is of course the famed and fabled black leopard, black panther the living incarnation of Bagheera from Rudyard Kipling’s Jungle Books himself.<br/>We have a high success rate of around 90% in seeing this black panther (as well as one or two other black panthers that are also in the area) and we hope to continue this success for your tour and many more in the future.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Bangalore. There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. We have great photographer guides for this and out other wildlife photography trips; this photography guide will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through India and particularly Kabini. Your photographer guide or naturalist escort is an expert in the wildlife of Kabini and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing as well as getting perfect pictures. <br/><br/>The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching and wildlife photography locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the park. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>This tour is recommended for mid November - mid December as this is during this time of year that the national park authorities clear the overgrowth of vegetation from the seasonal monsoon and so there is increased visibility into the forest and also the removal of the vegetation allows for increased big cat activity as they are out and scent marking their territories more.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife photography holidays are guided by an experienced wildlife photographers as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>• Our wildlife photographer guide that escorts all our safaris has great experience working with and photographing wild animals all over the world and in particular the wildlife of India.<br/>• Our local Indian guides around Kabini have a good relationship with the park officials and because of this we get a heads up when animals are sighted and this can guide us in where to focus and thus increasing our chances of seeing our targeted species.<br/>• Visit the park morning and afternoon in your own private jeep for your group only.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our wildlife photography and Indian big cat safaris a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout India so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the tigers, leopards, sloth bears, dhole and many more species. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of India at other times of year and focusing on other species such as striped hyena and snow leopards, Indian one-horned rhinos, Western Ghats endemics, elephants, primates, Asiatic lions and many species throughout this incredible country. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour is completely focused on one region within one national park and tiger reserve, the Kabini region of Nagarhole National Park. It is located in Karnataka state. We will fly in and out of Bangalore, which is your entry and exit point for the trip.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from a vehicle. So no physical fitness for hiking or anything like that is needed. This is a very easy trip to undertake.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 Years Old<br/><br/>Photo Credits:<br/>Davidvraju, CC BY-SA 4.0 <br/>Ranjith Kumar 2016, CC BY-SA 4.0 <br/>Jaya Krishna, CC BY-SA 4.0 <br/>Kirti Ranjan Nayak, CC BY-SA 4.0 <br/>Dheerajmnanda, CC BY-SA 4.0<br/>Scott Hyman",

    "generalInfo": "This 13-day holiday offers one of the world’s greatest adventures down one of the world’s greatest rivers, the Brahmaputra. While not for the faint-hearted this trip is perfect if you’re looking for a unique, wild and challenging adventure into one of the most spectacular and inaccessible regions in the world.<br/><br/>Before it reaches the starting point of this expedition in Arunachal Pradesh, the Brahmputra flows eastwards across the Tibetan plain and through the Himalayan mountains. A few miles from the line-of-control with China, you will board your raft for the expedition of a lifetime. After time to prepare gear and a comprehensive safety briefing, you and your small group of like-minded travellers will travel with your expert guides down the Brahmaputra as it cuts through remote hillsides and past tribal settlements nestled in impenetrable rainforest.<br/><br/>Over seven days, and approx. 180km of rafting from Tuting to Pasighat, you will negotiate some of the finest big volume white water rapids. You’ll pass through one of the most isolated and beautiful jungles gorges on the planet. The remoteness of this region means your trip down the river is entirely self-contained and undoubtedly one of the premier expeditions in the world.<br/>",

On our way, we will stop by an artistic, elegant and historical town - Sivasagar, known for Ahom Dynasty Palaces, Temples and old Monuments. All these reveal the efficiency of those skilled hillmen who arrived here by chance and ruled this land for over six hundred years. The relics of the Ahom Dynasty you see at Sivasagar explain why they were the only deserving candidates for such a long time and how come they have remained unbeaten even in the memories of Assam. Tai Museum: In Sivasagar, we visit the Tai Museum, which lives and breathes some invaluable artefacts of Ahom Kingdom, a significant part of Assam's glorious past. Rang Ghar: This is perhaps the most surprising creation of Ahom builders found at Sivasagar. An oval-shaped, double-storied construction with an inverted boat like a roof, Rang Ghar was an arena constructed by the King Swargadeo Pramatta Singha. This cultural playground of Ahom Monarchs remains the largest theatre in Asia. The drive along the Highway will finally end at the fabulous planters bungalow popularly known as Burra Shaib’s bungalow or the Thengal Manor - a heritage bungalow originally used as a Visiting Agent’s bungalow by George Williamson which is about 125 years old and the total floor area is about 10,000 sq.ft. Soak in the comfort in the bungalow and enjoy the serenity of the lush tea estate. If you have a golf interest there is an 18-hole, Par 71 Golf Course in the midst of a tea garden which was developed on a 150-acre site.

During 16th century A.D., great Vaisnava Saint Sankardeva had brought in the ideas of democratic social values, unification of diverse ethnic groups with verdant spiritualism which founded the basic fabric of a casteless social structure, the Assamese Society. It created a system of social governance and community living, which is a unique example of unity in diversity. In addition to that, Majuli is also enriched by the vibrant culture of its inhabitants belonging to the Mising, the Deori, the Sonowal Kachari, the Ahom and the Nepali communities. The vast expanse of the island is also very colourful for the sunset photography and bird watching. We will drive to Nimatighat where the chartered or public ferry will take us to this magical land (1.15hr each way). On reaching the other side we will take another vehicle and enter inside the village. We will explore the village by foot and car and visit the Satras - the religious and cultural institution which played the pivotal role in uniting the people of assam during 15th Century.

        "description": ": Our tour of Northern India starts in Kolkata. Once the capital of British India, Kolkata has had a turbulent past. It was central to the struggle for Indian independence and thousands of Bengali refugees came here at the start of the 1900s. It's a city of striking contrasts and can be overwhelming initially, but the sights, smells and chaotic sounds offer a unique introduction to life in the bustling state. For those arriving in time today our tour leader will meet you in the hotel reception at 5pm for a welcome meeting followed by the option to go out for dinner. If you arrive later, our tour leader will catch you up as soon as possible. If you'd like an airport transfer today, you'll need to arrive into Kolkata Airport (CCU), around a one-hour drive from the hotel."

The potters here spend all year creating a wealth of images and idols for the annual festivals and, as the time approaches for the models to be prepared for the coming pujas, the streets are filled with an overwhelming display of brightly coloured and richly attired idols. We'll also visit the Victoria Memorial, Dalhousie Square and Kolkata's wonderfully intricate Jain temple, an important pilgrimage site for Jains from all over India which is set in particularly beautiful gardens."

        "description": ": This morning is free to explore the city more at your own pace. You might wish to travel to the Dakshieswar Kali Temple and the Ramakrishna Mission or perhaps visit the Mother Theresa Home and Orphanage. This remarkable woman, born in Serbia in 1910, has become synonymous with the city of Calcutta. A member of the Order of the Loreto nuns, she was sent to India in 1937 and spent the next 60 years attempting to alleviate some of the appalling poverty she witnessed on her arrival, self-sacrificing acts that saw her beatified by the Vatican in 2003. Transferring to the railway station later this afternoon, we'll continue our journey by train, heading towards the Buddhist pilgrimage site of Bodh Gaya, in the Bihar province on the plains of the eastern Ganges. It was here that the Lord Buddha attained enlightenment, making the town an important mecca for pilgrims from across India and the rest of the Buddhist world. Whilst our accommodation in Bodh Gaya is on the simple side, it has been chosen due to its central location. Located in the heart of Bodh Gaya, the hotel is within walking distance of Mahbodhi Temple, the Chinese Temple and Bodhi Tree."

Whilst the original Bodhi tree, under which Prince Siddhartha Gautama achieved enlightenment over 2600 years ago, no longer remains, its ancestral descendants occupy the same space. We'll visit the sacred spot, along with the majestic Mahbodhi Temple this morning. Built in the 6th century AD on the site of an original temple erected by the emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century BC, this magnificent building, topped by a towering 50-metre-high spire, was declared a World Heritage Site in 2002 and is one of the oldest brick-built Buddhist temples in India. We'll also visit the 25-metre-high Great Buddha Statue, before taking an early afternoon train east towards the holy city of Varanasi, one of the oldest Hindu pilgrimage centres in India. Believed to be one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities on earth, the city's age makes it a contemporary with ancient Thebes and Babylon. Lying on the banks of the sacred River Ganges, Varanasi is steeped in the lore and traditions of Hinduism, and since its inception as one of the principal centres of Shiva worship 1200 years ago, it has attracted devotees from across the world to its myriad of temples and ghats. It's believed by many that this is where the material and spiritual worlds cross and countless pilgrims come here to cleanse themselves along the banks of the Ganges and partake in the rituals of Aarti."

We'll visit the main shrine, the Dharmarajka Stupa and the Dhamekh Stupa, the spot where he first espoused the teachings that were to form the very principles of the Buddhist faith. We'll also see the nearby Ashoka Pillar and the monastery. At its height this site housed over 1500 monks, before its decline and subsequent destruction by Muslim armies. It was rediscovered by British archaeologists in the 19th century and has since recaptured some of its original prestige. Returning to Varanasi, we'll spend the afternoon exploring the old city and the riverfront by cycle rickshaw and on foot before an evening sunset boat ride along the sacred Ganges. Varanasi boasts 80 or more riverfront ghats, including a number of 'burning ghats' where public cremations take place along the water's edge."

The rest of the day is free to explore the sacred city at your own pace, immersing yourself in the eclectic mayhem of its narrow streets and alleyways. Late this afternoon, we'll transfer to the railway station for the overnight sleeper train to Agra. Sleeper trains are a rite of passage on any journey through India and are a great way to meet locals as we travel. Please note, we try our best to book second class carriages and keep the group together, however due to demand and the train booking system, our group might be split, with some passengers in third class. If this happens, our tour leader will make sure everyone finds their seat and is comfortable. Second class sleeper carriages have four bed per compartment, separated by curtains. They're air conditioned and bedding is provided, however, you might want to bring a sleeping bag liner for added comfort."

Once the capital of the mighty Mughal Empire, the city is littered with opulent and iconic buildings, and the sandstone majesty of its imposing fort is no exception. Built by Emperor Akbar and then embellished by his grandson, Shah Jahan, the fort was once a great city, with palaces, mosques and halls all lying behind the protective embrace of 20-metre-high walls. We'll have free time to wander the city, perhaps taking in the elegance of the exquisite Itimad-ud-Daulah, a 17th-century tomb built for the Emperor Jehangir's chief minister. Mirroring the marble majesty of the more famous Taj Mahal, it's been given the apt title of Baby Taj. This afternoon, we'll visit the nearby abandoned city of Fatehpur Sikri. Once the capital of the Mughals under Akbar the Great, it was founded in 1569 only to be deserted just 16 years later following the emperor's death. Today it remains a ghostly testament to the majesty and power of 16th century Mughal India. Visiting the site with a local guide we'll take in the splendour of its perfectly preserved imperial court and the grandeur of the five-storey Panch Mahal. We'll also see the courtyard and pachisi board, where the emperor played an Indian equivalent of chess, using slaves as pieces. Perhaps the finest of all the city's monuments is the lotus-shaped carved central pillar of the Diwan-i- Khas (Hall of Private Audience), a magnificently column of matchless proportions that supports the vaulted roof of Akbar's old debating room."

Built by the emperor Shah Jahan to honour the memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz, the building took 22 years to complete and was once described by Rudyard Kipling as 'the embodiment of all things pure'. Built from marble and decorated with exquisite inlay work, the Taj Mahal required the labour of 20,000 men and is estimated to have cost in the region of 3 million rupees (around $70 million today). Once we've witnessed the majesty of the Taj Mahal, we'll journey on to Delhi."

        "description": ": The Indian capital has long been a phoenix rising out of its own ruins. Essentially, a city divided into two, there is New Delhi and Old Delhi to explore. New Delhi was the creation of the British Raj in the 1930s and this morning we'll begin to explore its colonial grandeur. Following the broad expanse of the Rajpath (Kingsway), we'll visit the towering memorial arch of the India Gate, a testament to the 90,000 Indian troops who lost their lives during WWI and the fighting along the Northwest Frontier during the early years of the 20th century. We'll view the imposing buildings of the Indian Parliament, as well as the Moghal majesty of Humayun's Tomb, a 16th century mausoleum commissioned by the emperor's Persian-born wife. We'll also visit the Qutub Minar, a spectacular 13th-century edifice made of sandstone and marbletowers. It towers 73 metres above the city and heralded the final demise of the Hindu kings and the arrival of the Muslim sultans. After lunch, we'll take a tour of Old Delhi by metro and cycle rickshaw. The old city, the former capital of the 17th-century Mughal emperor Shan Jahan, is a fusion of grandiose architecture and vibrant chaos. It's centred around the Chandni Chowk Bazaar, an eclectic cacophony of noise, colour and deafening barter that is quintessentially Indian. Our sightseeing takes us via the spectacular Jama Masjid Mosque, the largest in India and Shah Jahan's magnificent swansong. Taking 14 years to complete, the mosque is a majestic structure, featuring four towers, three gateways and two towering minarets that stand 40 metres high. Built from sandstone and marble its vast courtyard can hold upwards of 25,000 worshippers and from the top of the southern minaret you can get a clear view of the colonial designs of Edward Lutyens across the city."

From here we'll transfer to a narrow-gauge track and continue to Shimla on the remarkable 'Toy Train'. Climbing from the plains below, the train negotiates a meandering journey of 93 kilometres, ascending over 1600 metres towards the heights of the old British hill station. Whilst traditionally the Toy Train was pulled by steam engines, today they are mostly pulled by diesel engines. The journey takes us through 103 tunnels and past some of the most scenic landscapes in the region, before reaching Shimla itself, stretched out along a crescent shaped ridge, its alpine-style houses shaded beneath dense forests of fir. Tonight, we'll be staying in a property at is conveniently located at the start of the Mall Road in Shimla. Due to the location of the property, the area around the hotel is a vehicle-restricted road which is not accessible by cars.

The opening of the Kalka-Shimla railway at the turn of the 20th century allowed the well-to-do families of the Raj to escape the heat of Kolkata and Delhi and spend the hot summer months amongst the cooler landscapes of these verdant hills. We'll take in the ageing charm of the Christ Church and Scandal Point, where the mock Tudor architecture presents a surreal imitation of Old England against the magnificent backdrop of the Himalayas. We'll also have the opportunity to visit the Viceregal Lodge, the former residence of the British viceroy and site of a number of important negotiations that preceded Indian independence."

The holiest city of the Sikhs', Amritsar was founded in 1577 and, despite extremist unrest and destructive invaders, it remains the spiritual centre of the Sikh religion. The city's centrepiece is the magnificent Golden Temple, which we might have the opportunity to visit this evening and watch the light of the moon playing across the tranquil waters that surround the main shrine, the Harmandir. The temple is home to the revered texts of the Sikh Holy Scriptures, the Guru Granth Sahib, and its gilded dome is covered in over 700kg of pure gold. A fusion of Hindu and Islamic influences, the temple was the scene of the massacre of hundreds of Sikh protesters in 1984, when the Indian army acting on the orders of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, evicted extremists from the temple, an act that led to the assassination of Indira Ghandi by Sikh bodyguards later that same year."

The temple itself is a surprisingly small building surrounded almost entirely by tanks of holy water in which the Sikh pilgrims bathe (the name of the town itself comes from the Amrit Sarovar - the Pool of Nectar). The atmosphere is one of incredible calm, with devotees taking their turn to pass through the main shrine, where there is a continuous and melodic recital (known as the Akhand Path) from the Guru Granth Sahib. This afternoon, we'll take a visit to the Partition Museum, housed in the imposing 19th-century Town Hall along Amritsar's Heritage Mile. This remarkable institution is devoted entirely to telling the story of the 1947 Partition of India. We will also explore the Hindu Durgiana Temple, and return to the Golden Temple in the evening."

Room sized tents have luxurious bathrooms for scrubbing off the dust after a park drive with the resident naturalist Raj, whose focus is very much on the forest as a whole and is not totally tiger-centric - though if you are lucky enough to see one of these beautiful wild creatures, you will understand their spine tingling allure.<br/><br/>The focus here is not just on the national park but on the communities that live around the edges of the national park, many of whom, or whose ancestors were relocated from their villages when the park was established. You'll take walks both in the buffer zone of the national park and in the surrounding villages, you can visit markets where Gond and Baiga people buy and sell their fruits and veg, silver jewellery and the mahua (in the main picture) that is made into the local liquor. Bicycle rides (e-bikes) help take you further afield, and their slow pace and unboundried nature really helps lead to easy spontaneous interaction with the people you meet on your way.<br/><br/>We visit the work of various NGOs in the area, including a women run craft centre where you will make a beaded bag tag and learn something of what it is like living and working close to a tiger reserve. We visit a school supported by a local NGO that gives extra education to indigenous kids that supplements their government schooling. <br/><br/>Longer cycle trips with overnight stays are also possible and can include visits to villages who have been assisted by the charity we support - Frank Water, which helps people access clean and sustainable water sources.<br/><br/>We also try to visit the two much quieter zones of the national park, Sarhi and Phen, where tiger sightings are rare but the peace and beauty unmatched. And where tourist money is needed more than through the busier gates.<br/><br/>You end with a train back to Mumbai for two nights of city life staying at our favourite hotel, the chic but egalitarian (room rates vary to suit most pockets) Abode. With tours from our favourite company No Footprints Explore.<br/><br/>An optional extension is to add a relaxing few days in Goa, and the inland beauty that is Olaulim. A river side garden dotted with just five cottages, some on the river, others up in the trees. Canoe down river, through mangroves to the great Mandovi, or swim with the setting sun as wire tailed swallows dip beside you. Pirkko and Savio are the sweetest of hosts and welcome you into the fold along with their menagerie of animals including a naughty donkey and Lily the goat.<br/>We are friends with every provider on this tour and provide support from the moment you call to the day you arrive back home.",

The paintings at this UNESCO site are believed to be up to 30,000 years old. Your onward journey south will bring you to a luxurious jungle lodge at Satpura National Park. Nestled in the Satpura mountain range, this national park is one of India’s best kept secrets, with a very limited number of jeeps allowed inside the park and the opportunity to explore the beautiful landscape on foot, or in a canoe. If you feel like a break from the twice daily jungle safaris, you can walk or ride a horse in the adjacent jungle or lay by the pool or enjoy a massage from an expert masseur. With a wide range of habitats and altitudes, Satpura offers a wealth of wildlife viewing that is amongst the best in India. Nowhere else are gaur (the giant Asian bison), the much sought-after sloth bear and the elusive Asian wild dog so abundant and easily seen. These species, together with the beautiful Indian giant squirrel and the leopard (which is relatively common here), make up Satpura’s ‘big five’. Sambar, chital, muntjac, blue bull, blackbuck, wild boar, rhesus macaques and common langurs, marsh mugger crocodiles, and even the elusive chousingha, may also be seen, while Indian skimmer, bar-headed geese, grey junglefowl, both red and painted spurfowl, Malabar pied hornbill, blue-bearded bee-eater and tawny-bellied babbler are amongst Satpura’s avian specialities."

The air conditioned tents are canvas–walled homes on solid foundations with ensuite bathrooms, and the owners are the best of hosts. There is much to do here besides tiger hunting, with plenty of village walks and an excellent resident naturalist. The camps wooded surroundings and deep pool offer plenty of scope for bird and butterfly watching. Spend four adventure filled days here with morning and evening game drives in search of birds and mammals. And if you feel you’ve spent long enough rattling around in the back of a jeep, you can stretch your legs on a walk to a local Baiga tribal village. Kanha national park is located in Maikal hills of the Satpura mountain ranges. Sal trees predominate in the area, along with mixed forest of bamboo and teak. Meadows dot the park serving excellent grazing grounds for numerous prey species. These meadows are created as a result of the slash and burn practices of the Baiga tribespeople, who never plough the land, considering it equivalent to scarring the body of their mother, the earth. Wildlife is abundant here with tiger at the top of the food chain. The park is home to 22 species of large mammals and well over 200 species of birds. Commonly spotted animals include the sambar, the largest of the Indian deer, nilgai or blue bull, the barking deer and the chousingha, the world’s only four horned antelope. One can also see the sloth bear, locally called bhaloo, the same name given by Rudyard Kipling to the loveable bear in \"The Jungle Book\" as well as the thickly muscled gaur or Indian bison. The barasingha, a close relative of the swamp deer found up north in the terai forests, is referred to as the \"Jewel of Kanha\" and is making a remarkable comeback after being on the brink of extinction and can be found only in this area. Many birds can also be observed here including the racket-tailed drongo, 5 species of dove, flycatchers, Malabar pied hornbill, lesser whistling duck, common teal, pintail, cotton teal and the shoveler. The crested serpent eagle, honey buzzard, and the black-winged kite are the main birds of prey."

Dating from the 6th-8th century AD, they contain elaborate sculptures. These caves have been painstakingly hewn out of the hillside over a period of five centuries. They house over thirty monastic chambers and shrines and are a triple record of the aspirations of Buddhism, Jainism and Brahmanism. Here we'll see the rock-cut masterpiece, the Kailasa Temple, a replica of the mountain abode of Siva: it measures an astounding 33m deep by 81m long and 47m wide, and the stonemasons removed three million cubic metres of rock to create it.

If this happen, our tour leader will make sure everyone finds their seat and is comfortable. Second-class sleeper carriages have four beds per compartment, separated by curtains.

We'll take a short drive to the famous Cave Temples of Badami. A World Heritage Site, the temples were hewn out of solid rock as early as 550AD and their interiors are lavishly adorned with reliefs and statues, one even containing an 18-armed Shiva. Later this morning, we'll drive to Pattadakal, situated on the banks of the Malaprabha River. Another World Heritage Site, its pink-tinged sandstone temples date back to the 7th century and represent a mixture of South and North Indian temple styles, confirming its importance as a meeting point of both traditions. After a guided tour here, we'll stop at the temples of Aihole. The sheer number of Aihole's 70 temples brings to life the glories of the post-Gupta period and reveals the genesis of Hindu medieval art (c.600). Stopping to visit several of the temples, we'll finally continue to our destination for today, the town of Hospet, our base from which we explore the astonishing archaeological site of Hampi."

We'll aim to visit the temples of Virupaksha and Vittala, with its remarkable carvings, and amid the desolate and fantastic boulder-heaped landscape we'll come upon the Queen's Bath and the richly carved King's Throne, the finely sculptured pillars of the Ramachandra Swami Shrine, the vaulted Elephant Stables, the two-storied Lotus Pavilion, and the huge granite image of Narasimha, one of Vishnu's incarnations.

They began building a city with houses, gardens and fountains, monasteries, chapels, and churches, including the white, 17th-century cathedral of St Catherine, which still stands. Goa eventually became the entrepôt for East and West, where merchants could buy pearls, coral, rubies, golden jewellery, silks, China porcelain, lacquered furniture, ambergris, and exotic spices. The Portuguese influence is still very much apparent - the main religion is still Roman Catholicism and siestas are still widely practised on hot afternoons. Like most areas in India, Goa has its own culinary specialities, you might want to sample the locally brewed spirit feni - a spine-tingling drink made from coconut or cashews."

    "tourName": "Central India wildlife safari, India's predators",
    "placesVisited": "",
    "generalInfo": "The most famous predator in India is of course the iconic and majestic Tiger, but it is not the only predator in the Central Indian forests and grasslands. These include a smaller cousin of the tiger, the elusive leopard as well as the Indian pack hunting wild dog (also known as dhole) and the shagged haired sloth bear.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of Indian wildlife watching safari holidays. These tours range from the dry desert regions of Gujarat in search of striped hyena and Asiatic lions to the icy peaks of the Himalayas on the quest for snow leopards. But we also focus heavily on some of the 40 plus Tiger Reserves in this wonderful and diverse country. But it is not just the wildlife of India that makes India such a great holiday destination, but the varied and unique culture is also a focus for our trips.  <br/><br/>This tour is a specialist tiger safari of one of the best locations in the world for tigers and a host of other large mammals in India. Tadoba Andhari National Park has one of the highest density of wild tigers in the world. As well as the large population of tigers the park is also home to a great range of other species of predators, which are seen more readily here than many other locations in India. These are leopards, dhole and sloth bear. These predators live alongside their prey such as guar, barasingha, chital, sambar, wild boar and many other species.<br/><br/>Because this tour is only focused on Tadoba National Park you can add on extensions to also visit many of the cultural highlights such as the Taj Mahal or Old Delhi. If you are interested in adding on more to this Indian Budget Tiger Safari please let us know.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Mumbai and Nagpur. There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through India and particularly Tadoba. Your naturalist escort is an expert in tigers and their conservation and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. We will also employ a specific cultural guide for all sightseeing of temples and monuments.<br/><br/>The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, river safaris, spotlighting, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the park. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>This tour is recommended for February - May as this is the dry season and the chances of seeing tigers is much higher in the dry season. However the temperatures from April onward can be very hot and humid. You can visit this park and enjoy the itinerary between October – June. The park is closed during the monsoon season.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• Our local Indian guides around Tadoba have a good relationship with the park officials and because of this we get a heads up when animals are sighted and this can guide us in where to focus and thus increasing our chances of seeing our targeted species.<br/>• Visit the park morning and afternoon in your own private jeep for your group only.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our wildlife and tiger safaris of India a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout India so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the tigers, leopards, sloth bears, dhole and many more species. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of India at other times of year and focusing on other species such as brown and snow leopards, Indian one-horned rhinos, Western Ghats endemics, elephants, primates, Asiatic lions and many species throughout this incredible country. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour is completely focused on one national park and tiger reserve, Tadoba. It is located in Maharasthra. We will fly in and out of Mumbai, which is your entry and exit point for the trip.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from a vehicle. So no physical fitness for hiking or anything like that is needed. This is a very easy trip to undertake.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 12 Years Old",

It was from these towering walls that the Kachchawahas ruled over their kingdom for seven centuries, until its importance was eclipsed by nearby Jaipur. We'll also take in the unique Hawa Mahal, the famous Palace of the Winds, whose extraordinary façade of red and pink sandstone towers five stories above the city streets. Built at the end of the 18th century, its 935 windows were designed to allow the women of the harem to gaze out on the city scene below without themselves being seen, the openings also create a refreshing breeze (hawa), which kept the palace cool in the hot summer months. We'll spend some time exploring the lavish and well-preserved City Palace. Here, we'll find a fine collection of textiles, costumes, and armoury.

Explore on foot and by cycle rickshaw, seeing ancient temples standing against vibrant billboards advertising Bollywood films. Travel on to Agra, one of the prettiest cities in the world and home to the beautiful Red Fort, then to temple-filled Orchha. You will also take a sunrise sail along the Ganges, camping by its shores overnight. Of course, a visit to the Taj Mahal and the holy city of Varanasi are essential, too, before arriving in Nepal. Here, visit sacred Lumbini and its Maya Devi Temple, the site where Lord Buddha is thought to have been born. Then you have the chance to come face-to-face with black-horned rhinos in Chitwan National Park before exploring the crowded temples, markets and bazaars of Kathmandu.<br/><br/>You’ll be travelling in a small group (max 12 people) with a tour leader and staying in a range of accommodation, including hotels, lodges and guesthouses, with a night camping and an overnight sleeper train. Travel is via a mix of transport, from auto rickshaw and canoe, through to jeep, van and private vehicle. You’ll meet pilgrims, villagers, holy men and shopkeepers, getting to know people and customs as you go. For those wanting to travel by land between these two very different neighbours, this is the perfect journey.<br/>",

The wildlife sojourn starts at one of the most special Eastern Himalayan Landscapes, the Singalila National Park. This is the best place in India to see the elusive firefox or Red Panda. The Red Panda is a mammal native to Eastern Himalayas and Southwest China. The Red Panda has been classified as Endangered by the IUCN because its wild population is estimated at less than 10,000 mature individuals living in the wild. Singalila is one of its last strong holds and it is also the best place in India to see this elusive and rare mammal. Red Pandas are best found at an altitude ranging from 2,500 meters to 4,000 meters, and this part of the journey will be conducted at this altitude. <br/><br/>After a 5 nights quest to search for the elusive Red Panda the journey continues to Kaziranga National Park, a UNESCO world heritage site which was declared a tiger reserve in 2006. Kaziranga is a paradise for megafauna. It is stronghold for the endangered Indian One Horned Rhino with over 2,600 (2/3 of the global population) residing in its grassland and floodplain habitat. Apart from rhinos, it is home to many mammal species, including tigers, elephants, Asiatic wild buffalo, leopard, bears, swamp deer, hog deer, hoolock gibbons, smooth coated otters and a high diversity of birds. <br/><br/>The next and final stop on this journey is another UNESCO world heritage site and the largest mangrove forest in the world, the Sunderban Tiger Reserve. Nestled in the delta of the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna rivers, this intricate landscape is home to the elusive Royal Bengal tiger, as well as a wealth of other wildlife including saltwater crocodiles, wild boars, and a myriad of bird species. Visitors can embark on thrilling boat safaris that weave through the forest’s dense, tidal channels, offering glimpses of the rare flora and fauna in their natural habitat. A journey through the Sundarbans is not just a chance to witness its unparalleled biodiversity but also an opportunity to engage with the rich cultural tapestry and traditions of the communities living in harmony with this wild, ever-changing landscape.",

If you’d like, why not catch a rickshaw to the brilliantly coloured Red Fort. Then, leave the crowds behind and breathe a little easier in contrasting New Delhi. Visit the main sights – Parliament House, President House and India Gate, before returning to the hotel."

When you arrive, take some time to relax, before heading out to see the city. Agra’s not just all about the Taj Mahal, it’s also home to one of the finest looking forts in India – sitting along the banks of the Yamuna River, Agra Fort is part stronghold, part palace and part prison. Enter the dark red sandstone fort by crossing the (now empty) crocodile-infested moat. Search through throne rooms and the tiny, decorated mosques, then climb to the top to get your first glimpse of the Taj across the river! Tonight, you’re free to relax, explore at your own pace or find some delicious local dinner."

This well-preserved 16th century royal complex is full of courtyards, pavilions, gardens, the Jama Masjid Mosque and the intricately carved Rumi Sultana palace.

Over 300 years have elapsed since its construction, yet it stands today unscarred by age; its beauty and symmetry seemingly beyond man, time and space. Created by Shah Jahan as a funerary monument to his favourite wife, Mumtaz, it took 22 years to build (1630-52). The Great Moghul lies beside his beloved under the white marble dome. Inlaid with precious gems, the building cost a fortune. Later Shah Jahan moved his capital to Delhi before being overthrown by his son, Aurangzeb. Later in the day, drive to the entrance of Keoladeo Ghana National Park. Formerly a royal duck-shooting reserve and now an ornithologist's paradise, the 12 square miles of lakes and marshlands offer a safe habitat for large numbers of breeding waterbirds and migrants. More than 300 species have been sighted, among them herons, storks, geese and the huge and rare Siberian crane. We will be taken on a birdwatching tour by cycle rickshaw and we hope to see some of these magnificent birds.

We include a game drive this morning into the Reserve, in search of the wildlife which, as well as tiger, includes sloth bear, langur, jackal and fox as well as crested hawk eagle, crested serpent eagle, jacana, parakeet and white-breasted kingfisher. The park itself is very picturesque with lakes, rivers and forests surrounded by steep cliffs and rocky outcrops. In the afternoon there is another opportunity to do a game drive to get a chance to see more wildlife and views. The vehicles used for game drives are open top jeeps, with 6 seats and ideal for spotting wildlife. Due to regulations aimed at keeping traffic to a minimum in the parks we cannot guarantee exclusive use of the jeeps so you may be sharing with non-Explore customers. Please note that because the jeeps can only accommodate 6 people there is a chance we may have to split family groups up, this will depend entirely on the make up of your group and we will avoid this wherever possible."

After we’ve fully soaked in the magnificence of the Taj Mahal, we visit the imposing Agra Fort (also known as the Red Fort). It was built by the third Mughal emperor, Akbar, whose mighty red sandstone walls enclose the white-marble Pearl Mosque and the palaces, halls, courtyards, and gardens of his sons and successors, Jehangir and Shah Jahan. In the afternoon, we transfer (approximately three to four hours) to Suroth Mahal, a 600-year-old fort in the city of Hindaun.

After checking into the hotel and freshening up, we have a 45-minute round trip by camel cart to a century-old Hindu temple.

Rise early, heading out for a dawn walking tour as the pink city begins to wake. Visiting different chowkris (blocks) within the walled city, we can see the local people start their day and watch the rituals that take place in early morning flower and vegetable markets. Visiting a small temple, we witness a morning aarti, a moving Hindu ceremony accompanied by singing, ringing bells and incense. We can also interact with different artisan communities, while also sampling local food and drink. Returning to the hotel for breakfast and time to refresh, we head out again mid-morning. First, we visit the hilltop Amer Fort, which was built by Kachwaha dynasty ruler Man Singh and acted as the seat of the dynasty before the capital was shifted to Jaipur. A highlight is the Sheesh Mahal (Hall of Mirrors), which is adorned with more than a million pieces of hand-cut mirror and glass, intricately arranged to reflect light throughout the space. Later, we visit one of the most intriguing sites in India, Jantar Mantar (Jaipur Observatory), an assembly of immense marble-and-brass astronomical instruments in a pleasant garden. We also see the Hawa Mahal (Palace of the Winds), a five-storey landmark built of pink sandstone, which allowed the women of the royal household to observe street festivities without being noticed.

It was a vital and thriving trade centre in ancient times, with its trade of beads, gems and valuable ornaments. Lunch at Velavadar. Post lunch, proceed for a safari in Blackbuck National Park. Enjoy a drive in the park which resembles African Savannah. See hundreds of blackbucks with chances to sighting Wolf and Hyena. Arrive at Ahmedabad by evening. Overnight at Ahmedabad."

Pottery, papad-making, embroidery and soap-making are just a few of the other small-scale industries that give Dharavi a turnover exceeding 600 million US dollars. These thriving businesses (which export to countries around the globe) are often conducted in hovels with sheets of blue tarpaulin acting as walls.

Your guide will walk you through a secret path to the cave complex on top of the hill. The complex has 2 main caves, which between them, are home to huge statues that are made with delicate detail. Perhaps the most breathtaking of all the statues is the Trimurti or the Maheshmurti–a 21 feet high depiction of Shiva as the Creator, Protector, and Destroyer. You will be taken through the hidden nuances of the other statues and see how viewing them from different positions brings different perspectives. Post lunch, visit Khotachiwadi, a historical part that shows how Bombay was back in the day.

    "generalInfo": "This tailor made trip has been crafted by a local company that specialises in Gujarat wildlife, such as the much sought after Asiatic lions, blackbuck and wild asses. The nine day itinerary has been carefully crafted to allow plenty of time in each of the Gujarat national parks. With one full day in Velavadar National Park, famous for its beautiful blackbuck and two days in Gir National Park where the Asiatic lions take centre stage. Gir was given protected status as far back as 1900 when, after being used as a trophy hunting ground for years, the lion population was reduced to almost zero. Since then, hunting lion has been illegal and the legacy of committed conservation still stands here.  A night time safari at Gir is a highlight for many of our guests. <br/><br/>At Velavadar NP, game drives will not only bring you in contact with over 1500 blackbuck but also wolves and jackals, although a night time safari is the time to spot the latter. There is rich birdlife, such as the lesser florican, a large bird in the bustard family that thrives in these grassland habitats.  <br/><br/>In addition to the national parks, we also include the unique habitats of the Little Rann of Kutch in our itinerary, a saline desert that is famous for being one of the last places on earth where you can see the beautiful Indian wild ass. Other stunning wild mammals to catch sight of include the chinkara, desert fox, jackals, caracals, nilgais and striped hyenas. It is also home to over three hundred bird species, with flamingos and pelicans creating a fine sight as well as many migratory birds arriving in over the Gulf of Kutch. Our visit to the Rann region also allows us to spend time with the tribal groups still living very traditional lifestyles here. <br/><br/>As this is a tailor made trip, we are happy to accommodate your interests and needs, starting the holiday in Delhi or Mumbai, for example, or adding additional days to take in other experiences such as a night time leopard safari. <br/>",

    "generalInfo": "Gujarat is home to India's driest national parks, but they are full of wildlife and surprisingly diverse. This trip focuses on Asiatic lions, striped hyena, Indian wolves and other predators that are found in the arid lands of this wonderful Indian state.<br/><br/>The very idea of there being large and well protected populations of wildlife and big ecosystems in India still seems strange. But that is the case in most of Gujarat, a largely desert state in the north west of the country, bordering Pakistan to the west.<br/><br/>To help preserve this incredible diversity, Gujarat has various protected areas including wildlife sanctuaries, national parks, reserves and large community concessions which have been established to integrate humans with wildlife in the most harmonious way possible.<br/><br/>Many of the protected areas in Gujarat support large mammals including Asiatic wild ass, striped hyena, blackbuck, leopard, nilgai, Indian wolf and of course the iconic and last remaining Asiatic lions; which is testament to the state's conservation ethic.<br/><br/>About the tour:<br/>This two week itinerary is split into four mini-sections so as to properly explore the most impressive national parks and wilderness areas. We start with the fantastic and vast Rann of Kutch in the middle of the Thar Desert and spend three nights in both the Little and Greater Rann of Kutch. Here we will search for the endemic Asiatic wild ass as well as the rare and elusive Indian wolf before we head to the last stronghold of the critically endangered Asiatic lion in Sasan Gir National Park. Reduced to a couple of dozen at the turn of the 19th Century they have now been protected enough to have a population numbering over 400. From here we visit the reserve of Velavadar National Park which was originally set up to protect and conserve blackbuck antelopes. As well as the blackbuck we will also be on the look out for seldom seen striped hyenas. A short flight backs to Delhi makes short shrift of the distances we will have travelled overland.<br/><br/>More information about this Gujarat wildlife holiday:<br/>In designing this trip we believe you will be getting the best wildlife experience of Gujarat and one that will leave you with a completely wild impression of India. January through to April is the dry, and surprisingly cold, season and best for wildlife in Gujarat. This is when we have the highest chances of seeing our targeted species. All of our Indian safaris are guided by a local naturalist guides. Local drivers and also scientists or researchers may also accompany the trip. This not only gives us numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also provides a chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife we're watching. <br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 years",

        "description": "Sasan Gir National Park - Travelling - This morning you will be transferred from Gondal and continue your journey to the last stronghold of Asiatic lions in the world. Asiatic lions were once widespread from Italy in the west to the eastern side of India in the east, but due to habitat destruction and intensive hunting since the times of the Ancient Greeks they were reduced to around 20 individuals. But the Maharaja of Gir forest foresaw their extinction as his hunts were getting less and less productive. He then protected the last few (firstly for hunts and then for their continued survival) and since then the forests and scrubland of Sasan Gir has been protected (for around 100 years) and their numbers are now booming. There are now over 400 lions in the park and they are beginning to spread out into the neighbouring villages. This could lead to human-animal conflicts in the future so there is encouraging talk of reintroducing some of the lions into another national park nearby to start a second population. The supreme court in Delhi ruled in favour of translocating some lions from Gir to Kuno in Madhya Pradesh in April 2013 and this is expected to be done before the end of 2013. This drastically improves the lions long term chances of survival as it will increase genetic diversity and help in case of a disease outbreak in Gir. Once we arrive here we will in plenty of time to check into the accommodation and head into the park in the afternoon. This lodge is one of the best in the area and it actually shares a boundary wall with the park, in the recent past lions have been seen in the gardens of the resort whilst people were enjoying their dinner in the main building; it is worth bearing this in mind and looking around the gardens when heading for dinner in the evening or the early morning jeep safaris. When we have our first jeep safari into the park we will be looking for lions and they are not particularly difficult to find, with over 400 lions in a small area we should see them without too much difficulty (although they are not always seen on every safari. Also whilst here in the evenings we will be on the lookout for leopards. Leopards are very hard to see in India, they are displaced by tigers throughout the majority of Indian parks but their interactions with lions is different and as a result they are seen here more regularly than any other park in India. Of course the leopards are still hard to see here but we are in the best place for them. (breakfast, lunch and dinner included)"

This is one of the best national parks in India, home to large populations of beautiful blackbuck and probably the best places in the world to see the striped hyena. This is one of the most elusive species of mammal in the world and here there are a couple of den sites that the local guides know of. Today will be your first chance to see this incredible animal after checking into the lodge and we enter the park. The park was initially set up for the protection of blackbuck which are now doing very well. It is also the best place to see nilgai but during the evenings we will be focused on striped hyena, Indian wolves, Indian foxes and jungle cats; before returning to the lodge for your evening meal. Despite these elusive and wonderful predators the true star of the park are the many blackbuck; despite being popular in animal collections on private estates in both Europe and North America, the wild population in India decreased drastically over the last century and fragmented into various pockets from a former position of abundance throughout the plains. Velavadar Reserve now probably has the highest concentration of Blackbuck in the world with the very regal dark males with their long spiraled horns strutting their stuff for the females they are very fun to watch.

The first part of the trail takes us down a series of steep, stone steps, passing by small remote houses and on through the villages of Nongthymmai, Mynteng and Nongriat. At Nongriat we'll reach the double-decker living root bridge, a truly unique structure that, over the centuries, has been trained to span the river between two ancient rubber trees, ensuring that - even in the middle of the monsoon season - the villages are not cut off. After stopping to enjoy a picnic lunch (and a well-earned rest), we'll begin the steep climb back to our bus. The entire walk will take us around six hours and you might find walking poles useful as the steps can be tough on the knees. At the end of the trek, we'll return to Cherrapunjee for a second night."

After paying a visit to the centre, we'll continue towards the southern banks of the Brahmaputra River and into the national park. Encompassing 430 square kilometres of elephant grass, forest, and swampland, it was established in 1974 to help save the Indian one-horned rhino. Lying in the shadow of the Karbi Anglong Hills, today this magnificent reserve can boast around 1,200 - the greatest number of anywhere in the country. We'll spend our next two nights in a simple lodge in the heart of this magnificent landscape. The twin-share rooms are simple with en-suite bathrooms. Hot water is provided but can sometimes be limited.

After the flat terrain of Kaziranga, the Naga Hills offer plenty of impressive views during the journey. This region is less populated than other Indian states and for much of the journey we'll be surrounded by forests. Occupying the eastern fringes of the subcontinent, next to the border with Myanmar, the hills and valleys of this staunchly independent and little-visited region are the traditional homeland of the Nagas, fiercely proud warrior clans who still revere their ancestral beliefs. Interestingly some 90% of today's Nagas are Christian, the British missionaries finding a receptive flock amongst village communities that already believed in a solitary and all-powerful being. Our drive today is long and once in Nagaland the road conditions deteriorate so it can be slow-going. Once we reach Kohima, we'll stretch our legs with a visit to the WWII cemetery, a memorial that honours one of the most bitterly fought battles of the Second World War. Our accommodation for tonight is a simple hotel, located across from the WWII cemetery and within a short walk of the town centre, so ideal to explore after our long drive. Rooms are twin-share with en suite bathrooms. The hotel doesn't have heating and it can get cold during the winter months so having a few extra layers for the time here is worthwhile."

The festival is named after the state bird, the hornbill, admired by the tribes for the grandeur of its plumage. The headdresses worn by many of the tribes reflect the bird's colourful feathers. Nagaland is home to 16 different tribes, and each will perform traditional dances and music at the festival. Colourful clothing and ornate jewellery and headdresses make it a fantastic opportunity for photographers. The festival ground has seated area where the majority of events take place, it's worth bringing a jumper or something to use as a cushion as the seating arrangements are simple.

A UNESCO World Heritage Site, Majuli is home to a handful of Hindu temples and has been considered the cultural capital of Assam for the past 500 years. Its origins are steeped in mystery, but it's believed that the social reformer Shankardeva came here in the 16th century and established the 'satras' (monasteries and hermitages) that dot the island, sowing the seeds for a unique tribal culture that continues today. The satras have become beacons of art and religion and, on arrival on the island, we'll visit some as we make our way to our overnight eco camp. Our accommodation for the next two nights is in simple Mishing-style stilt houses. Rooms are twin share with a simple bathroom each. They're raised approximately eight feet from the ground to ensure everyone stays dry during the monsoon months.

Several of the satras specialise in making masks and we'll have the chance to see how they are made and learn the myths and stories behind their designs. Besides its cultural importance, the island is also well known for its migratory birdlife, giving us the chance to encounter some of its resident birds. As we explore the island, we'll spot bee eaters, adjutant storks and kingfishers perched on poles looking for their next meal. Our accommodation is close to a tributary and for those up early, it offers a great chance for some pre-breakfast bird watching."

The traditional ceremonial attire of the Konyaks is elaborate, with headdresses and ornate weaponry combining with elephant tusk bracelets and colourful feathers, which we'll have seen during the Hornbill Festival. We'll also have a chance to get an up-close glimpse at the jewellery and tattoos that signify how successful the males were during their lives as headhunters.

We'll stop and visit the ancient ruins before continuing to the city that has been titled the 'Tea City of India'. Located close to the Brahmaputra River, Dibrugarh lies in the heart of Assam's tea country, its surrounding estates accounting for 50% of the entire region's tea crop. In 1950 a major earthquake, measuring 8.5 on the Richter Scale, diverted the course of the river and wiped out three-quarters of the old city. From those disastrous ashes, a new city arose, one that's gone on to become a major centre of learning and commerce in India's northeastern provinces. Our accommodation for tonight is in colonial tea bungalows, twin-share rooms set within peaceful gardens on the edge of the city. They're a great chance to relax and reflect on the experience of exploring the remote villages of Nagaland."

A major transport hub in modern-day India, Delhi is also the cultural and political heart of the country, having been ruled by various empires and dynasties over the centuries. Nowadays, the city is a perfect blend of new and old, with ancient Hindu temples and impressive mosques existing alongside modern skyscrapers. If you'd like an airport transfer today, you'll need to arrive at New Delhi Indira Gandhi Airport (DEL), which is around a 45-minute drive from our hotel. As part of our Upgraded range, we also offer a complimentary transfer to those who have made pre-tour accommodation arrangements through Explore, regardless of your arrival day. For those arriving in time, our tour leader will meet us in the hotel reception at 5pm for a welcome meeting. We'll then set out for our first glimpse of the city with a walk to Hanuman's Temple, arriving in time to see the evening prayer rituals. Afterwards, we'll explore Connaught Place, a colonial-era hub of shops, bars, restaurants, and street vendors, before enjoying a traditional Rajasthani welcome meal. If you'd like to join the city tour today, please arrive at the hotel by 4pm. If you're booking your own flights, we recommend allowing at least one hour to clear the airport, plus 45 minutes to transfer to the hotel.

The trust was established in 1988, offering shelter to street children and has since evolved to provide education, skill building and mental health support for vulnerable youth.

India is home to nearly 60% of the world's remaining Asian elephant population and this non-profit organisation was set up in 1995 to rescue and rehabilitate these gentle giants. Now home to more than 20 elephants, the project works to rehabilitate those once used for tourism, manual labour and entertainment purposes. Following a short presentation about the project and the majestic elephants that call the centre home, we'll get a chance to observe them in their habitat. Keeping in line with our Animal Welfare Policy, we'll maintain a respectful distance as we watch the elephants being fed, bathed, or walked by the dedicated staff and volunteers. After our time at the Wildlife SOS centre, we'll continue to Agra, where we'll visit Itmad-ud-Daulah, affectionately known as 'Baby Taj'.

        "description": ": We'll have an early start this morning as we visit one of the most universally recognised buildings on earth, the Taj Mahal. Built by the emperor Shah Jahan to honour the memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz, the Taj was once described by Rudyard Kipling as '…the embodiment of all things pure'. Built from marble and decorated with exquisite inlay work, it required the labour of 20,000 men and is estimated to have cost in the region of three million rupees (that's around $70 million today). We plan to visit at sunrise to watch the colours of the building changing as the sun slowly rises in the sky. After returning to our hotel for breakfast, we'll make our way to the imposing Agra Fort, whose grandeur and importance have earned it a spot on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Built by Emperor Akbar and then embellished by his grandson, Shah Jahan, Agra was once a great city, with palaces, mosques and halls all lying behind the protective embrace of 20-metre-high walls. From Agra, we'll drive one-and-a-half hours to Dholpur, which will be our base for the next two nights as we explore the Chambal Sanctuary. Our visit to the Chambal Sanctuary adds a unique wildlife element to our tour and gives us a better insight into the rich history of the landscape that straddles three states - Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. There is a lack of Premium accommodation in this location, so we\\ ve chosen a former heritage property located on the outskirts of the city that we\\ ve graded as comfortable. After a few hours to relax, we'll reconvene for a high tea at the property where we'll be joined by a local who will tell us stories of the Chambal River, ravines and people from the area. The talk will be a great opportunity to learn about the wildlife and ecosystem of the Chambal River, as well as the socio-economic history of the infamous Dacoits."

Home to more than 300 species of endemic and migratory birds, Chambal Sanctuary is a haven for birdlife. The boatmen are skilled at spotting other species that call Chambal home, and will be scouring the landscape to spot gharials, mugger crocodiles, soft-shell turtles, and even the elusive Gangetic river dolphin. After spending an hour exploring the river, we'll return to our hotel for a few hours of respite. In the late afternoon, we'll embark on a different kind of safari as we climb into our jeeps, perfectly designed to navigate the deep gullies and rugged terrain of the Chambal Ravines. Less known for its wildlife, this striking landscape has a somewhat notorious past, having once served as a refuge for the infamous Dacoits of the region. These Badlands provided the perfect hideout for outlaws and bandits well into the early 2000s. The reasons behind the emergence of the Dacoits remain a subject of debate, but one theory suggests they resorted to looting businesses and kidnapping the wealthy, holding them for ransom in order to pay off exorbitant taxes imposed upon them. Intriguingly, despite their criminal undertakings, they were known to cover medical expenses for those less fortunate. This murky history, combined with the Robin Hood-esque behaviour of the Dacoits, has inspired numerous characters in Bollywood films. Please note, depending on the weather conditions the order of the safaris today may be switched around."

Built over 1,000 years ago, this 30-metre-deep stepwell is one of the deepest and largest stepwells in India, and in the world. Its intricate geometric design and the thousands of steps leading down to the water level make it a stunning architectural marvel. Although it's no longer used to store water, it once provided a vital resource all year round for both the wealthy and the poor.

Persian and Indian craftsmen worked together to build the garden-tomb, far grander than any tomb built before in the Islamic world. Humayun’s garden-tomb is an example of the charbagh (a four quadrant garden with the four rivers of Quranic paradise represented), with pools joined by channels. The garden is entered from lofty gateways on the south and from the west with pavilions located in the centre of the eastern and northern walls. Later proceed to Gurudwara Bangla Sahib, one of the prominent Sikh gurdwara or Sikh house of worship. Once inside the main building, you will be amazed with great interior, there is space to be seated on the floor and listen to “kirtan – the devotional songs” sung live by the staff. The holy book of Sikhs, the Guru Granth Sahib, is placed on top of a bed of silk and flowers. Like in all Sikh Gurdwaras, the concept of “langar, a communal free kitchen offering free sit-down meal” is practiced here too, and all people, regardless of race or religion may eat in the Gurdwara kitchen (langar hall). The Langar (food) is prepared by volunteers who wish to help out and by gursikhs who work there. It is believed that everyday around 25000 people eat in this hall. You are supposed to cover your head with a scarf and clean your feet with water at the entrance, as it is strictly followed in Sikhisim.."

        "description": "Start the tour by taking a Cycle rickshaw ride through Old Delhi, which will be a unique experience for the kids to enjoy. Here you will see Red Fort (from outside), the most opulent Fort and Palace of the Mughal Empire. The fort is Shah Jehan's symbol of power and elegance, built behind red sandstone walls. Its main gate (Lahore Gate) faces Chandni Chowk, the perpetually congested avenue heading west from the Red Fort, is filled with twisting lanes, small streets and crowded bazaars. Also visit Raj Ghat, the memorial site of the Mahatma Gandhi; Jama Masjid, the largest mosque in India; and Chandni Chowk, the bustling and colourful market of the old city. Chandni Chowk was the commercial centre of Delhi in the old time and you will see it come alive in the morning as the trading day starts. As a complete contrast to Old Delhi, New Delhi was designed and built by the British in the 1920's-it's a city of wide boulevards impressive Government buildings, green parks and gardens. In 1911 King George V announced the transfer of the capital from Calcutta to Delhi. The King's architects, Lutyens and Baker, set in motion the Design and construction of Delhi's eight city - New Delhi. Lutyens designed an \"Imperial City\" having palatial-sized buildings set amid broad tree-lined avenues punctuated by Mughal style gardens, complete with fountains and shallow pools. It took 20 years to complete this immense undertaking only to have the British pack up and relinquish the subcontinent in 1947. You will visit one of the monuments from Delhi's past – The Qutub Minar. Also visit Humayun’s tomb built by the widow of the second Mughal Emperor, Humayun’s. It is an outstanding monument in the Indo-Persian style, a precursor of the Taj Mahal. Your drive takes you along the ceremonial avenue, Rajpath, past the imposing India Gate, Parliament House and the Presidential residence."

        "description": "This morning proceed to visit the capital of Amber to see the fabulous Amber Fort. Maharaja Mansingh, Mughal Emperor Akbar’s most successful General, started the construction of Amber Fort in the 17th century. Before the City Palace was constructed in Jaipur, Amber was the seat of power. The fort is surrounded by fortified battlements and overlooks the Moat Lake. Ruins and remains are spread over the Aravali hills and sprawling crenulated walls lattice the surrounding area. A jeep will bring you up to the fortress. Once on top, stroll through the sprawling complex of courtyards and halls. Many of the rooms have delightful wall paintings, with precious stones and mirrors inlaid in the walls. Most fascinating, perhaps, is the Sheesh Mahal (hall of mirrors) where a single lamplight is reflected in the many mirrors, lighting up the room. En-route to Amber Fort you will stop and see the `Palace of Winds’, otherwise known as Hawa Mahal. It is really an elaborate façade, extremely intricate in its pink sandstone carving. The cool wind blows through its facade of windows and latticed screens through which the queens of the court once viewed the streets of the city. This afternoon, you will visit the City Palace, which is an overwhelming complex of exquisite palaces, gardens and courtyards, decorative art and carved doorways. The palace museum houses collections of rare manuscripts, armory, costumes, carpets and miniature paintings. Jaipur's Jantar Mantar is the most famous of five observatories built by Sawai Jai Singh in India. There is a very interesting story behind the construction of this observatory, considered as the largest stone observatory in the world. Sawai Jai Singh sent his emissaries to all parts of the world before commencing the construction of this observatory. The emissaries returned with many manuals on astronomy containing cutting-edge technological information. One of these manuals was a copy of La Hire's \"Tables\". The king ordered the observatory to be built according to the details contained in this manual. When the construction ended, for the astonishment of the king and others, the observatory was 20 seconds more accurate than the one mentioned in La Hire's \"Tables\"."

There are holy cows wandering in the middle of the road, holy men with long dreadlocks getting into strange contortions and holy temples awash with incense, fragrant flowers and hundreds of pilgrims.<br/><br/>It is a huge country that deserves many visits and we recommend that you concentrate on one particular part of the country for each stay. A good place to start is the princely state of Rajasthan, home to many of India's most beautiful and well known sights, including crumbling forts that are begging to be explored, exquisitely decorated merchants' houses, majestic palaces which are the perfect venue for a game of hide and seek, and the constant backdrop of colour whether from mounds of spices in the market or from the brightly coloured saris of women walking through the countryside with pots balanced on their heads. Not far from Rajasthan is Agra, home to the Taj Mahal, possibly one of the most beautiful buildings in the world.<br/><br/>Also popular is the lovely state of Kerala, in the south of India, and a world away from the north. Life here operates at a slightly slower pace and it is a land of peaceful waterways where you can spend the night in a converted rice barge, picturesque coffee and tea plantations that are perfect for a hike (or gentle ramble!) and idyllic beaches.<br/><br/>More adventurous families might want to head into the far north, to the Himalayas, home to incredible scenery and some great activities. Sip a cup of freshly picked tea on a tea estate in Darjeeling, watch the sun rise over the tip of Kanchenjunga, hang out with the monks in Ladakh, ride the rapids down a tributary of the Ganges or cycle in the mountain foothills.<br/><br/>Everywhere you will find the welcome friendly and the children will be permanently wide eyed and fascinated by the incredible experiences on offer.",

    "generalInfo": "This India Golden Triangle tour takes you to the rich plains and mountains of North India, which have drawn numerous visitors from across Asia, Persia and beyond. From luminous figures such as Napoleon to Alexander the Great to the British East India Company, many have vied to control the vast expanses and rich resources of the North. <br/><br/>The journey that we’ve put together was designed with a lot of thought. Thought into the elements that would help showcase North India’s tumultuous and checkered history, and provide insights into its various people, from the great Mughals, Persians and Afghans, to the Rajputs, the Sikhs, the Tibetans and ultimately the English who shaped the region’s more recent history.  <br/><br/>Ultimately the North is not only about its people and their cultures but also about the incredible diversity in landscape and vistas. This holiday experience takes you to landscapes ranging from flat plains, to the fringes of the Thar, to agricultural fertility in the Punjab, to high Himalayan vistas.<br/><br/>We typically begin with Mughal history, from Mughal Old Delhi and Agra to the desert state of Rajasthan. Rajasthan is where we look to showcase the incredible diversity that exists, not only in the region’s landscape, but in its people and their cultures as well. Starting with the incredible bird life of Bharatpur with its one of the kind responsible safari experiences, we move into the hillsides of Bundi, through the Aravalli Mountains, and to the lakes of Udaipur, which is also home to incredible Rajput and Jain architecture. <br/><br/>Moving away from the Aravallis we enter the semi arid but incredibly nature-rich regions that border the Thar Desert. From tented abodes that serve us some of the most delectable Rajasthani rural cuisine to rustic and immersive family homestay experiences in the heart of the villages of Osian, this part of the journey is about the discovery of local people and the cultures that form their identities in the present day. <br/><br/>The journey beyond Rajasthan enters a part of Northern India that’s often overlooked. We take you into the fertile fields of the Punjab where through a series of walking trails we showcase the unique customs, religion and way of life of the Sikhs.  <br/><br/>The final stage of this journey enters the Himalayan wilderness of Leh with its high altitude lakes and Buddhist beliefs, and moves on to the former summer capital of the Raj at Shimla. Shimla is filled with historic relics from its English past, making it a nice way to wrap up a fantastic set of experiences.",

        "description": "In Agra Morning visit The Taj Mahal, an enormous mausoleum complex commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan to house the remains of his beloved wife. Constructed over a 20-year period on the southern bank of the Yamuna River in Agra, India, the famed complex is one of the most outstanding examples of Mughal architecture, which combined Indian, Persian and Islamic influences. At its center is the Taj Mahal itself, built of shimmering white marble that seems to change color depending on the daylight. Designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1983, it remains one of the world’s most celebrated structures and a stunning symbol of India’s rich history. Later continue to Agra Fort, also called Red Fort, large 16th-century of red sandstone located on the Yamuna river. It was established by the Mughal dynasty emperor Akbar and, in its capacity as both a military base and a royal residence, served as the seat of government when the Mughal capital was in Agra. The fort complex was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1983. Return back to hotel. Rest of the day free to relax at hotel."

Also known as a home of the Nawabs of Avadh, they were great patrons of the culinary and other arts, particularly dance and music. You will find great architecture of British Raj era buildings and mausoleums. Visit architecturally beautiful La Martiniere, built by Frenchman Claude Martin as his palatial home. Continue to visit the ruins of Lucknow Residency which offer a glimpse into events of First War of Independence (Indian Uprising) in 1857, considered to be the beginning of the end for the British Raj. Visit one of the well-known sites of Lucknow, Asafi Imambara. In 1775 when a famine broke out in the city, to give employment to his people, the Nawab began the construction of this Imambara Complex. The complex has a hall, a mosque, gardens and a step well. You will have a photo stop at the 220 foot tall red brick Clock Tower. It is said to be the tallest in India, built in 1880 in memory of Sir George Couper. Later in the evening, walk through the local market."

Rest this afternoon, as you'll take to the waters tonight to observe the Aarti ceremony on the ghats. Thousands of locals and pilgrims gather together every sunset to offer their prayers to the Mother Ganges. This prayer ceremony, a fire offering given to the Goddess Ganga, is performed on a stage by a group of young Hindu priests (pandits) dressed in saffron attire. The ceremony begins with the blowing of a conch shell and continues with the circling of large flaming lamps. The movement of these lamps is synchronized with the rhythmic chants of hymns and clang of cymbals. Note : Boat ride and Aarti ceremony is subject to water level of River Ganges."

    "placesVisited": "",
    "generalInfo": "This unique Indian wildlife safari holiday is focused on the rare opportunity Panna National Park gives people to explore the forests after dark and see some of the elusive and rarely seen species of Central India. <br/><br/>Many people who have been on a safari to India have noticed in the wildlife books there are many species, from civets and hyenas to owls and nightjars which are rarely if ever seen. This is because these species and many others are strictly nocturnal. So we have found a way of getting into the forests safely after dark to try and see these species, in addition we have a much higher chance of seeing species such as leopards, sloth bear and tigers which are also largely nocturnal too.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of Indian wildlife watching safari holidays. These tours range from the dry desert regions of Gujarat in search of striped hyena and Asiatic lions to the icy peaks of the Himalayas on the quest for snow leopards. But we also focus heavily on some of the 40 plus Tiger Reserves in this wonderful and diverse country. One of these reserves is Panna National Park, a little visited but large park with a population of tigers inhabiting it – but without the large numbers of tourists that can be found in the more popular and well known parks. <br/><br/>This tour doesn't just enter the main park in search of tigers, dhole and other typical Indian tiger safari species (which are included), but we also spend time outside of the main park and in the buffer zones where we stay overnight in a wonderful tented camp and have night safaris.<br/><br/>After years of travelling to India we have been asked many times about why we cannot spotlight in the parks after dark to try and find the really interesting animals. Such as striped hyenas, leopards, leopard cats, Bengal foxes, Asiatic crested porcupines and the numerous civets and genets which live in India. We are now able to head into the buffer zone after dark and spotlight for wildlife, this has increased the sightings of usually difficult and elusive species. So if you have always wanted to see the Indian wildlife which is usually out of sight, then this is the wildlife tour for you. <br/><br/>Panna is one of India's less visited parks, so you can often have the park and surrounding buffer zones to yourself or with very little other tourists, which is a rare event in Indian tiger reserves nowadays. <br/><br/>In addition to this tour we have an incredible range of safaris in India. Whether you wish to visit the Western Ghats for its endemic species, Gujarat for the desert adapted species, the high grasslands of the North East for giants such as rhinos, elephants and buffalo or even head to the Himalayas for snow leopard spotting we have the itinerary for you. India is a treasure trove of wildlife and habitats and all you have to do is to get in touch with your budget and your group size and where you would like to go and we will come back to you with an itinerary and quote for your perfect Indian wildlife safari tour.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Delhi. There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through India and particularly Panna. Your naturalist escort is an expert in tigers and their conservation and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. <br/><br/>The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the park. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>The best time to go wildlife watching in Central India is mid January to mid May. This is the hot dry season with the hottest time from beginning March until mid May. This is when many species come out to waterholes to find water. <br/>However you can visit this park and enjoy the itinerary between November – April. <br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.• Our local Indian guides around Panna have a good relationship with the park officials and because of this we get a heads up when animals are sighted and this can guide us in where to focus and thus increasing our chances of seeing our targeted species.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our wildlife and tiger safaris of India a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here.

    "generalInfo": "If you have always felt like exploring new and interesting places and not just following the crowd when it comes to safari destinations? Then this tiger safari for you. <br/><br/>On this Indian safari you will travel to two little known and seldom visited tiger reserves. Whilst we will be of course looking for tiger throughout we will also be occupying our time in Satpura and Panna National Parks with with searches for sloth bears, dhole, leopards, gaur, striped hyenas and jungle cats to name but a few. <br/><br/>This tour is quite unusual as it will not only combine day time safaris but also spotlighting night safaris (which is very unusual in India). Searching for animals by day and night is a new experience in India and all of a sudden animals which were deemed impossible to see are being spotted; such as striped hyena and leopard cats. Satpura, Panna and Jhinna are on the rise but if you book soon you may still be the only foreign people inside the park.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of Indian wildlife watching safari holidays. These tours range from the dry desert regions of Gujarat in search of striped hyena and Asiatic lions to the icy peaks of the Himalayas on the quest for snow leopards. But we also focus heavily on some of the 40 plus Tiger Reserves in this wonderful and diverse country. Two of these reserves are Satpura and Panna National Parks, both not often visited national parks but both full of incredible wildlife – but without the large numbers of tourists that can be found in the more popular and well known parks. <br/><br/>This tour explores these great parks on the trail of tigers of course, this iconic denizen of the Indian jungles is as symbolic of India as the Taj Mahal or Mahatma Ghandi. Satpura has a fantastic record for also showing the other predators of the jungle. Whilst rare and hard to see in other parks the leopards, sloth bears and dhole are all regularly seen here. So we will dedicate a large amount time to these species as well as the tigers whilst here. <br/><br/>Panna also has a good dhole and tiger population but another reason for visiting these two parks is that they allow a couple of things that other national parks and tiger reserves in India do not. Firstly you can stay overnight inside the park, there is a small lodging complex deep in the park. <br/><br/>They are a little more basic than the lodges of course but it allows you experience the park at night from within and also allows to get deeper into the jungle on our safaris as we do not have to come back to the entry gate in the evening. <br/><br/>But also along the buffer zone of the park we can go out after dark and spotlight. This is a great way of seeing some of India’s rarer and more elusive species such as leopards, striped hyena, Indian porcupine, common palm civet as well as owls and nightjars. <br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Delhi. There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through India and particularly Satpura and Panna. Your naturalist escort is an expert in tigers and their conservation and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. <br/><br/>The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, river safaris, spotlighting, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the park. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>This tour is recommended to run between February - May as this is the dry season and the most reliable time of year to see tigers, before the temperatures get too hot and not nice to be on safari in and of course before the monsoon comes and the tiger reserves close.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• Our local Indian guides around Satpura and Panna have a good relationship with the park officials and because of this we get a heads up when animals are sighted and this can guide us in where to focus and thus increasing our chances of seeing our targeted species.<br/>• The lodges we stay at in Satpura (Reni Pani Jungle Lodge) and Panna (Ken River Lodge) are one of the finest lodges in India, it also has a large area of land and have resident sloth bears and leopards that use their grounds (Reni Pani and wonderful views of the Ken River (Ken River).<br/>• Visit the park morning and afternoon as well as having the chance to stay inside the park on one occasion and also enjoy spotlighting after dark around the buffer zone to Satpura and spending an overnight in the bufferzone in Jhinna Jungle Camp run by Ken River Lodge.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our wildlife and tiger safaris of India a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout India so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the tigers, leopards, sloth bears, dhole and many more species. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of India at other times of year and focusing on other species such as brown and snow leopards, Indian one-horned rhinos, Western Ghats endemics, elephants, primates, Asiatic lions and many species throughout this incredible country. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour starts and ends in the historical city of Delhi, and the tour visits two different tiger reserves. Firstly Satpura and then Panna and when in Panna you will stay in a special camp in the bufferzone of the park.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from a vehicle or boat. So no physical fitness for hiking or anything like that is needed. This is a very easy trip to undertake.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 15 Years Old",

You may also be lucky enough to spot tigers at night. Over the next 2 days you can enjoy your included jeep safaris through the reserve in search of sightings of the area’s iconic wildlife. Entering the park is an adventure in itself as you transfer to the river front to take a motorboat across into the core forest where your safari jeep will be waiting to collect you. As this is one of the best places in India to see sloth bears, your safaris will have a focus on finding them and the chances are very high. Leopard sightings in the park are excellent too, however, over the last 3-4 years we have seen a rise in tiger numbers which had made the other stars of Satpura a little shyer since they are no longer the top predators. Indian giant squirrels are another unique species that can be found here. During your time here you can also enjoy an included canoe safari or walking safari. The canoe safaris offer excellent birdwatching opportunities as well as sightings of crocodiles and the land mammals that come down to the water to drink. Walking safaris are a great way to get closer to the smaller fauna that is often too well camouflaged to be seen during jeep safaris.

    "generalInfo": "This is a superb small group tour around the highlights of northern India. Over ten days you’ll take in must-see sights including the iconic Taj Mahal, Agra Fort, and the Amber Fort, as well as carefully chosen experiences that bring you closer to the region’s culture and history.<br/> <br/>Your trip gets off to a promising start with a welcome dinner at one of the oldest restaurants in Delhi, a place that it’s said introduced ice cream to India! So you must order dessert. This is a great opportunity to get to know the rest of your group (maximum 12 people) and your tour leader. The following day you’ll be heading off straightaway to Agra, home to the Taj Mahal – the greatest monument to love and loss ever built.<br/><br/>Agra has much more to it than the Taj Mahal, though. For one thing there is the stunning red sandstone of Agra Fort. And for another, a colourful street food scene – one you’ll explore in the evening as you seek out stalls to dine from.<br/><br/>A change of pace comes as you reach Ranthambore National Park. Tigers stalk among these trees, and you’ll head out in search of them, and other wildlife including hyenas, sloth bears, and crocodiles, with a responsible driver and guide. Responsible wildlife viewing means putting animal welfare first, and never getting too close to them even if it means a better photo. <br/><br/>In beautiful Jaipur, capital of Rajasthan, tour the bustling bazaars with your tour leader, the scent of spices and fresh foods all around. The evening of your arrival you have a dinner invitation, to join a local Brahmin family and learn about their lives, and their cuisine. The following day you’ll be given a guided tour of a haveli, a former royal mansion, with the owner – these little slices of history need constant upkeep, and tours like this help to preserve the mansion’s handsome architecture. Rooftop drinks afterwards? Naturally.<br/><br/>Then you reach the holy city of Varanasi, where Hindu pilgrims descend in their thousands to pray at temples and shrines, and to bathe in the River Ganges. You probably won’t want to follow their lead; the water is not renowned for its cleanliness. But you will love the experience of cruising along this most iconic of waterways, seeing life along its banks both at sunrise and at sunset. <br/><br/>This cultural tour of northern India makes a superb introduction to the region. Sure, you’re seeing the sights, but you’re very much not simply ‘sightseeing’. By keeping the group size small it’s possible to visit smaller, locally owned restaurants and sleep in smaller, locally owned hotels. And from homecooked meals to guided tours of their homes, you’ll enjoy a number of fantastic opportunities to meet local people and get to know their personal traditions and customs first-hand. <br/>",

Block printing workshop You have an option of going on an early morning hot air balloon ride over Jaipur, flying over its palaces, forts and lakes - a truly mesmerising experience. If you chose to sleep a little later, your morning starts with a visit to the Amber Fort, the jewel in Jaipur's crown - an ancient fortress built on a hilltop in the 16th century dedicated to the ruling Kachhawa clan of Amber. Be mesmerised by this majestic architectural wonder, with its pink sandstone and marble palace shining in the sun. It's massive fortress walls sprawls across the hills, with many seeing a resemblance of the Great Wall of China. Later, we return to the city for a tour of Jaipur, as we visit the strange Jantar Mantar monument, a collection of nineteen architectural astronomical instruments, built by the Rajput king Sawai Jai Singh II between 1724 and 1730. Jaipur was the first planned city of medieval India and we'll also explore its City Palace. Built by Raja Man Singh during 1729-1732 AD, the City Palace was once the seat of kings as it was from here that they ruled the region. This tangle of courtyards, manicured gardens and exceptionally crafted mahals is one of the most revered attractions in India. We spend the remainder of the day walking in the walled city to discover some of Jaipur's famous crafts markets and craftsmen in action such as jewellers, silversmiths, textile workshops and bangle makers. Our tour will include a blockprinting workshop, where we learn the ways in which fabric is decorated using this ancient method and we'll also have a gemstone demonstation. OVERNIGHT"

    "generalInfo": "The most famous predator in India if not the whole world, is of course the iconic and majestic Tiger. And when it comes to seeing this amazing animal there really is only one place; central India. <br/><br/>There are a number of national parks and tiger reserves around India (over 40 in total) and many are in the central state of Madhya Pradesh, it is here where some of the reserves boast such a huge percentage of the world population its hard not to find tigers. <br/><br/>This safari is by far the most comprehensive tiger safari around; travelling to three of the best parks in the world for tigers and spending three weeks searching for them we could easily spot over 25 different tigers during our time here. But its not just tigers there are dhole, sloth bears, leopards, langurs, chital, sambar, golden jackals, jungle cats and many more mammals and birds. <br/><br/>We enter the parks with a local guide and driver, travel between the parks in private air conditioned vehicles and stay in the best lodges around the parks.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of Indian wildlife watching safari holidays. These tours range from the dry desert regions of Gujarat in search of striped hyena and Asiatic lions to the icy peaks of the Himalayas on the quest for snow leopards. But we also focus heavily on some of the 40 plus Tiger Reserves in this wonderful and diverse country. But it is not just the wildlife of India that makes India such a great holiday destination, but the varied and unique culture is also a focus for our trips.  <br/><br/>This tour is a specialist tiger safari of three of the best locations in the world for tigers and a host of other large mammals in India. Panna, Bandhavgarh and Kanha National Parks. These parks have a population of over 200 tigers and some of the highest densities of wild tigers in the world. As well as the large population of tigers the park is also home to a great range of other species of predators, which are seen more readily here than many other locations in India. These are leopards, dhole and sloth bear. These predators live alongside their prey such as guar, barasingha, chital, sambar, wild boar and many other species.<br/><br/>Because this tour is mainly focused on tigers and only visits national parks in central India you can add on extensions to also visit many of the cultural highlights such as the Taj Mahal or Old Delhi. If you are interested in adding on more to this Tiger Safari please let us know.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Delhi. There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through India and particularly the national parks. Your  naturalist escort is an expert in tigers and their conservation and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. We will also employ a specific cultural guide for all sightseeing of temples and monuments.<br/><br/>The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, river safaris, spotlighting, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the park. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>This tour is recommended for February - May as this is the dry season and the chances of seeing tigers is much higher in the dry season. However the temperatures from April onward can be very hot and humid. You can visit this park and enjoy the itinerary between October – June. The park is closed during the monsoon season.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• Our local Indian guides around Panna, Bandhavgarh and Kanha have a good relationship with the park officials and because of this we get a heads up when animals are sighted and this can guide us in where to focus and thus increasing our chances of seeing our targeted species.<br/>• Visit the park morning and afternoon in your own private jeep for your group only.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our wildlife and tiger safaris of India a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout India so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the tigers, leopards, sloth bears, dhole and many more species. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of India at other times of year and focusing on other species such as brown and snow leopards, Indian one-horned rhinos, Western Ghats endemics, elephants, primates, Asiatic lions and many species throughout this incredible country.

With Delhi being the main arrival and departure hub.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from a vehicle.

Khajuraho is well known for its magnificent temples, which were built between 950 and 1050 A.D. Khajuraho derives its name from the Khajur tree (the date palm tree), which can be found in abundance in the area. The divine sculptures in these temples are a tribute to Life itself, embodying everything that is sublime and spontaneous about it. The murals depict the life and times of the Chandelas, and celebrate the erotic state of being. They not only testify to the mastery of the craftsman, but also to the extraordinary breadth of vision of the Chandela Rajputs under whose reign, these temples were constructed. After lunch we either visit the Eastern and Western groups of Temples or we will travel direct to our accommodation at Panna National Park, level – safari lodge (Ken River Lodge) (1 hour). Once again depending on the time of arrival we may head into the park on an afternoon jeep safari to try and find some wildlife. Panna National Park is an excellent place to find leopards.

    "generalInfo": "This tour will explore one of the oldest national parks in the world, India's very first national park. Established by one of the most prominent and famous big game hunters in all of Asia. Jim Corbett decided to protect a huge area of sub-Himalayan belt in North West India in 1936. <br/><br/>His main aim was to protect the animals he was paid well to hunt, the tigers and leopards of this region were dying out quickly here and with a growing human population he was determined to protect the wildlife and ecosystem he had come to know, love and respect with passion and enthusiasm. <br/><br/>Since then the park has changed names and been expanded but the wildlife is still exceptional. With over 100 tigers resident to the surrounding area, a mix of lowland and sub-Himalayan species and 600 plus bird species recorded, Corbett National Park is a must for all wildlife lovers visiting India.<br/><br/>The combination of habitats which are more familiar to Central India, some terai habitat from the fertile floodplain belt in the sub-Himalayas as well as forested hills means that the there is a large diversity of wildlife here. Animals which are not found in the same areas elsewhere in India can be found here such as Asiatic black bears, tigers, Asiatic elephants and gharials.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of Indian wildlife watching safari holidays. These tours range from the dry desert regions of Gujarat in search of striped hyena and Asiatic lions to the icy peaks of the Himalayas on the quest for snow leopards. But we also focus heavily on some of the 40 plus Tiger Reserves in this wonderful and diverse country. But it is not just the wildlife of India that makes India such a great holiday destination, but the varied and unique culture is also a focus for our trips.  <br/><br/>This tour is a specialist tiger safari of one of the most interesting national parks in India. There is a large population of tigers here as well as elephants and many other iconic species from India. One of the most interesting species found here which is very rare is the large crocodilian the gharial.<br/><br/>Because this tour is only focused on Corbett National Park you can add on extensions to also visit many of the cultural highlights such as the Taj Mahal or Old Delhi. If you are interested in adding on more to this Indian Tiger Safari please let us know.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Delhi. There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through India and particularly Corbett. Your naturalist escort is an expert in tigers and their conservation and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. We will also employ a specific cultural guide for all sightseeing of temples and monuments.<br/><br/>The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, river safaris, spotlighting, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the park. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>This tour is recommended for late spring in the northern hemisphere as this is the dry season here and also most of the wildlife is very active during this time year.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• Our local Indian guides around Corbett have a good relationship with the park officials and because of this we get a heads up when animals are sighted and this can guide us in where to focus and thus increasing our chances of seeing our targeted species.<br/>• Visit the park morning and afternoon in your own private jeep for your group only.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our wildlife and tiger safaris of India a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout India so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the tigers, leopards, sloth bears, dhole and many more species. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of India at other times of year and focusing on other species such as brown and snow leopards, Indian one-horned rhinos, Western Ghats endemics, elephants, primates, Asiatic lions and many species throughout this incredible country. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour is completely focused on one national park and tiger reserve, Corbett National Park. It is located in Uttarakhand. We will fly in and out of Delhi, which is your entry and exit point for the trip.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from a vehicle. So no physical fitness for hiking or anything like that is needed. This is a very easy trip to undertake.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 12 Years Old",

The drive is around 4-5 hours and along the way the highway crosses the famous Ganges River and as this is the closest point of the river to Delhi so that it can get busy with worshippers. Once you arrive at the park and your lodge you will check in and then if time allows you will be taken on a short afternoon jeep safari into the buffer-zone of the park. This is a brief introduction to some of the wildlife in the area and you should see barking deer, wild boar and chital as well as many species of the commoner bird species such as crested serpent eagles, blossom-headed parakeets, pied kingfishers, dollarbirds and Asian paradise flycatchers. During this short safari you will cross the wonderful Ramganga River, this is a monsoonal river that is the lifeblood of the surrounding areas you will see how most people’s lives revolve around the river. After this you will be taken back to the accommodation to relax and enjoy your evening meal. (breakfast and dinner included)."

    "generalInfo": "This budget tiger safari of India takes you to one of the best national parks in the country; Kanha National Park. This park is a wonderful mix of grassy plateaus, open misty plains and bamboo forests and is home to around a hundred tigers living wild. As well as dhole, guar, leopard, sambhar, chital and monkeys and dozens more species. <br/><br/>This budget safari has been designed to maximise your time in the park and chances of seeing tigers with as low a cost as possible. We are proud of our 100% sighting rate and of course, you will also get a chance to see a wide array of other wildlife, not just tigers. Please note that we are very happy to organise this trip for a solo traveller as well as for groups.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of Indian wildlife watching safari holidays. These tours range from the dry desert regions of Gujarat in search of striped hyena and Asiatic lions to the icy peaks of the Himalayas on the quest for snow leopards. But we also focus heavily on some of the 40 plus Tiger Reserves in this wonderful and diverse country. One of these reserves is Kanha National Park, a popular and large park with a huge number of tigers inhabiting inside it – but without the large numbers of tourists that can be found in the more popular and well known parks. <br/><br/>This tour explores this great park on the trail of tigers of course, this iconic denizen of the Indian jungles is as symbolic of India as the Taj Mahal or Mahatma Ghandi. But Kanha has a fantastic record for also showing the other predators of the jungle. Whilst rare and hard to see in other parks the leopards, sloth bears and dhole are all regularly seen here. So we will dedicate a large amount time to these species as well as the tigers whilst here. <br/><br/>Kanha is one of India's more popular parks, however we have an incredible range of safaris in India. Whether you wish to visit the Western Ghats for its endemic species, Gujarat for the desert adapted species, the high grasslands of the North East for giants such as rhinos, elephants and buffalo or even head to the Himalayas for snow leopard spotting we have the itinerary for you. India is a treasure trove of wildlife and habitats and all you have to do is to get in touch with your budget and your group size and where you would like to go and we will come back to you with an itinerary and quote for your perfect Indian wildlife safari tour.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included.

Afterwards, we'll explore the bustling hub of Connaught Place - a colonial-era circus of shops, bars, restaurants and street vendors. If you'd like an airport transfer today, you'll need to arrive into New Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport (DEL), which is around 45 minutes from our hotel. Please note, that if you'd like to join the city tour today, you'll need to arrive at the hotel by 4pm.

Straddling Rajasthan's Aravalli Hills, Sariska is characterised by dry deciduous forests, grasslands and rocky landscapes. The park is generally considered to be a far quieter park than its very popular neighbour, Ranthambore. As the sun rises and the dawn breaks, we head out early to catch our first glimpse of India's incredible wildlife. As well as the tigers, the park is also home to the elusive leopard, jungle cat, jackals, a variety of deer a huge number of langurs.

We make the five-hour drive across fertile landscapes to the city of Dholpur, sitting beside the Chambal River. The Chambal is one of the few remaining undammed rivers in northern India and is known for its rich biodiversity and relatively untouched natural surroundings. After lunch, we will take a private boat out onto the river where we hope to spot some of the rich variety of wildlife found here. This river is one of the last remaining habitats for the critically endangered Gharial, a species of long-snouted crocodile which are often found on the banks of the river, basking in the afternoon sun. As well as crocodiles, we may spot the playful Gangetic River Dolphin, smooth-coated otters or the Indian softshell turtle. The river is also a haven for birdlife where we hope to be lucky enough to spot Indian Skimmers, Sarus Cranes and Kingfishers. In the rare event that water levels in the Chambal River rise, Indian authorities may suspend river safaris for safety reasons, in which case an alternative activity will be provided."

India has one of the largest rail networks in the world, and it serves as a vital lifeline for many Indians - connecting many small towns, villages and rural areas with larger commercial centres. Along the way, we can soak in the rural scenery as it rolls past our window and we're likely to get the chance to chat with some of the locals in our carriage who are often interested to see tourists travelling by train. After disembarking in Jhansi we will continue by bus, crossing into the central state of Madhya Pradesh to Khajuraho, a journey of around three hours. The rest of the afternoon has been left free to relax or to explore this ancient town."

        "description": ": We set off early this morning for our private 4WD game drive through the varied landscapes of Panna National Park. The park's topography provides some truly stunning scenery and makes it quite different from our experience in Sariska. The park is made up of thick teak forests separated by wide plateaus and gorges. The lazy Ken River flows through the park and acts as its main water source, and in parts cascades down stacked rocks forming impressive waterfalls. Known less for tigers (although sightings still can be made) the park is renowned for its birdlife with over 200 recorded species found here. Vultures and eagles are not uncommon sightings, as well as the colourful Asian Paradise Flycatcher; the state bird of Madhya Pradesh. Migratory birds are also prevalent in the winter months. Later this afternoon, we explore the UNESCO World Heritage Temples of Khajuraho. Intricately hand-carved, the erotic sculptures which adorn the Hindu and Jain temples here are full of symbolism and depict various aspects of life at the time, during the 9th to 12th century. We spend the afternoon exploring the main temples including the magnificent Kandariya Mahadev and Vishwanath temples."

The drive will take approximately five hours with breaks and will give us a real taste of rural India as we pass by patchworks of farmlands and pockets of small villages. It's a common scene in rural India to see children playing in the water from the hand-pumped wells, and cows and other livestock roaming freely through the villages and across the roads. Upon arrival in Bandhavgarh, the rest of the afternoon has been left free to relax."

The majestic Royal Bengal is at home here amongst the ideal habitat of high grasslands interspersed with forests of sal and bamboo, while rivers and streams crisscross their way through the park. The trees and high grasslands provide ample food for the park's large deer population, and in turn, provide plenty of cover for the tigers to hunt their prey. The various water sources are an ideal location for tigers to rest and a great place to spot the big cats lazing around on hotter days. Whilst tigers are the focus here, the park is also home to wild dogs, hyenas, spotted deer (chital), bison and many more species. We spend the day taking two safaris through the park, one in the early morning and one in the late afternoon. Safaris will be in private 4WD vehicles with a maximum of four to a jeep and with an accompanying naturalist."

The park is expansive, covering an area of 940 square kilometres and we plan to explore the park on five private game drives over the following three days.

We make our bookings in second-class air-conditioned sleepers, which have four beds in each compartment and all bedding provided. Whilst we try to ensure the group is all together, due to overwhelming demand and the system for booking train tickets in India, it may not always be possible to have everyone in the same carriage and some reservations may be in third-class air-conditioned. In such cases, our tour leaders will help everyone to find their seats and ensure you get the most out of your journey. For overnight trains, each berth is separated by curtains and has 4/6 bunk beds.

Aside from this festival it is still a popular destination for Hindus, hosting several important temples such as the Mansa Devi Temple and the Kankhal Temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva. Perhaps most iconic though, is the nightly Ganga Aarti ceremony that takes place on the riverside. Several Brahmin priests line the Ghats and perform a coordinated ritual involving fire-lit lamps, chanting and bell-ringing, making their offerings to Mother Ganga.

The Beatles stayed at the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi Ashram for three months in 1968, cementing its place in pop culture.

    "generalInfo": "India is a wealth of wonderful wildlife, historical and cultural attractions. There is an never ending variety of historical sites to visit and wilderness areas to observe animals and this tour provides you with a great overview of Indian culture and wildlife. <br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>This tour is perfect for people visiting India for the first time or seasoned travellers to the Subcontinent. This tour will showcase two of the best reasons to travel to India as well as visiting probably the last refuge for two of the worlds most unusual and endangered species. Combining sightseeing of historical sites in Old Delhi, and marvelling at the magnificent Taj Mahal, with tiger safaris in the stunning and culturally important Ranthambore National Park and river safaris looking for gharial and Gangetic river dolphins; this is the perfect overall wildlife holiday of India. <br/><br/>Ranthambore is probably the most iconic of all Indian tiger reserves and we visit here to look for tigers. The most iconic and famous wildlife resident of India is the tiger and many of the tigers that live in Ranthambore are very well known. They are regularly filmed for various documentaries and most of known by name. It is a great way to further understand the tiger and it's role in modern India. <br/><br/>Along with the tigers we will see in Ranthambore and the cultural excursions taken to Old Delhi and Agra which will include sites such as Taj Mahal, Red Fort and Agra Fort; this tour also visits the Chambal River Sanctuary. This is one of the most important sanctuaries in the world for 2 of the world's most endangered large animals, the large fish-eating crocodilian, gharial, and the Gangetic river dolphin. These two species are commonly seen here and coupled with the tiger provide chances to see some of the world's most endangered and wonderful species.<br/><br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of Indian wildlife watching safari holidays. These tours range from the dry desert regions of Gujarat in search of striped hyena and Asiatic lions to the icy peaks of the Himalayas on the quest for snow leopards. But we also have a range of specific birding and bird watching tours, this being one of them.  <br/><br/>This tour is a specialist wildlife and cultural tour of north-west India. There are many species of mammals, birds and reptiles that can be found in Ranthambore and Chambal. The different ecosystems of sal forest, bamboo groves and meadows coupled with the river and wetlands of the Chambal Sanctuary are home to a great diversity of life of all kinds. But of course no trip to India is complete without visiting religious and culturally important iconic sites such as the Taj Mahal. <br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in cities and towns. There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through India and particularly tiger safaris. Your naturalist escort is an expert in ornithology and their conservation and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. We will also employ a specific cultural guide for all sightseeing of temples and monuments.<br/><br/>The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, river safaris, spotlighting, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the park. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>This tour is recommended for February - May as this is the dry season and the chances of seeing tigers is much higher in the dry season. However the temperatures from April onward can be very hot and humid. You can visit this park and enjoy the itinerary between October – June. The park is closed during the monsoon season.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• Our local Indian guides have a good relationship with the park and reserve officials and because of this we get a heads up when animals are sighted and this can guide us in where to focus and thus increasing our chances of seeing our targeted species.<br/>• Visit the parks and reserves morning and afternoon in your own private vehicle for your group only.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our wildlife and bird watching holidays of India a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout India so that we can try and find and observe birds. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of India at other times of year and focusing on other species such many mammals like tigers, snow leopards, elephants, rhinos and many species throughout this incredible country. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour is focused on two wildlife watching locations in the northern part of India, the great national park of Ranthambore as well as the Chambal River Sanctuary and then the iconic cities of Delhi and Agra.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from a vehicle. So no physical fitness for hiking or anything like that is needed.

Before exploring this river sanctuary you will be taken to the lodge. This is a huge sanctuary which protects one of the largest and most biologically valuable rivers in India, covering a 400km stretch of the river and protecting around 1.6 km on either side of the river the sanctuary is 1235km sq. The sanctuary was initially set up for the gharial, these huge fish-eating crocodile can grow to 7m long and is the most critically endangered species in the Indian subcontinent. There may be as few as 250 breeding individuals in the world and the vast majority live along the Chambal river. But as well as providing protection for this magnificent and ancient animal the sanctuary now has over 330 bird species recorded as well as other mammals, reptiles and amphibians that now rely on this protected stretch of water. After settling into the accommodation and lunch you will be taken on a river safari here to welcome you to the birdlife. You should encounter small pratincoles, numerous duck species, black-winged stilts, common & spotted redshanks, ospreys, bar-headed geese and up to 100 other water birds. You may also see both gharial and the other crocodile species here the mugger crocodile as well as up to 8 species of freshwater turtles (all of which are endangered), the unsual and endangered Gangetic river dolphin and possible a family of foraging or playing smooth-coated otters.

        "description": "Chambal River Sanctuary Over the next two days you will further explore the various ecosystems of the Chambal River sanctuary, there are a variety of activities that can be provided by the lodge and exactly what you want to do and the order of the activities will vary. But we recommend the following itinerary for your stay at this eco-lodge; after breakfast on the first full day here we suggest taking a jeep safari to the plains that surround areas of the Chambal river, you will travel to some isolated ravines in the Chambal sanctuary to try and find one of the most beautiful animals in India, the stunning blackbuck antelope. There is a small population here protected in the sanctuary, whilst the blackbuck was once widespread throughout the Gangetic plains, hunting and habitat destruction all but wiped the antelope out. This used to be the favoured prey of the Indian cheetah and there are ongoing talks about reintroducing the cheetah to the Gangetic plains and that would be a wonderful sight. Whilst spending the afternoon here you are likely to see some species of birds that have spend their time on the open grasslands that the blackbuck favour such as coursers, harriers and possibly falcons. Then after coming back to the lodge and having lunch you would be taken the short distance to the ancient Bateshwar Temple complex. These Hindu temples are built on the banks of the Yamuna river and consist of over 100 temples dedicated to Lord Shiva. The ravines surrounding the temples and river are home to a number of Naga sadhus (snake worshiping ascetics) who have carved out little caves and temples within the mud walls. These temples are a very nice way to see how the Hindu people around here still use these ancient temples in ways that have not changes for hundreds, possibly thousands of years. The next day we suggest participating in a camel ride safari through some of the ravines that fork off from the Chambal River, here you are likely to see a different range of birdlife including plain martins, wire-tailed swallows, jungle babblers, steppe eagles, sand lark, wood sandpipers and large grey babblers. Travelling on camel back is a wonderful experience and a great way of exploring the ravines and river bank whilst on the way to another ancient building. This is Ater fort and it is a magnificent site perched on the cliff side. It is also home to many species of raptors and other bird species; once a valued stronghold and at the forefront of numerous battles between the Rajputs, the Mughals and the Marathas, the crumbling ruins bring alive the romantic glory of a bygone age but it is the breathtaking views out over the Chambal valley that are truly spectacular. From here a scan of the skies can produce many more species and hopefully some of the critically endangered vultures. Then after lunch you will have a guided walk along a new section of the Chambal river bank. By walking the riverbanks with the local guide from the lodge you will be in good hands when it comes to spotting some of the harder to see mammals birds and reptiles such as golden jackals, black-naped hares, Burmese spot-bellied duck, Temmincks stint, Pallas gull, Indian skimmer and some of the 9 species of freshwater turtles here. Whilst spending time around the lodge you are free to explore the vibrant and diverse gardens. In the grounds of the lodge the abundant flowers attract many sunbirds and the fruiting trees are home to commersmith and brown-headed barbets, many babblers, hornbills, koels, treepies as well as being the day roosts for flying foxes and owls. Also whilst here, if you are not too tired we recommend a guided evening walk around the expansive grounds of the lodge; these walks often find Indian palm civets, jungle cats, Indian foxes, black-naped hares, hedgehogs and possibly the very elusive striped hyena. Of course the skies will be full of flying foxes, owls and nightjars as well. (all of your meals included)."

    "generalInfo": "Discover the heart of real India, and relax in the warmth of South India, perfect for a winter escape. Explore the ways and culture of Karnataka, and stay in comfortable guesthouses that are owned and run by local communities. Local people benefit directly from your stay, and the welcome given to guests is truly special. These are tailor-made trips, and you have your own local guides who will reveal so much about local life. You begin in the sub-tropical warmth of the Western Ghats to explore a beautiful, little known part of southern India. Visit the majestic temples and palaces at Hampi, then taste life amongst spice plantations from the wonderful 'Spice House' at Hulgol. See the auction market, and explore on foot or by cycle the forests and the holy river. The Spice House is a comfortable traditional style bungalow, with three twin-bedded rooms. Wonderful fresh produce is used to create delicious meals. There are ample opportunities for exploring around the fascinating hamlet and spice gardens, or longer walks to temples, waterfalls and just meeting villagers. The diversity of the flora and fauna is fascinating: a wide variety of birds, small mammals, butterflies and fireflies flickering at night. <br/><br/>From Hulgol, you  visit  the coast  to discover the fishing community of Pavinakurva where you can watch the fishermen, and relax on a secluded beach, a marvelous place to unwind. This is a magnificent, unspoiled stretch of coast, where life continues as it has for centuries, reliant on the catch brought in by small fishing boats. Again, the guesthouse is comfortable and the fresh fish and local vegetables create memorable meals cooked by your hosts. The guesthouse is shaded by coconut palms, close to a cashew orchard, with river and distant hill views. Sitting in the shade reading a book is a delight! The village's sandy beach sweeps away into the distance, peaceful apart from a few seabirds and the boats drawn up above the tide line. Just off-shore is the mysterious Basavraja Durga island, a small wooded rock outcrop. Above the shore line the sandy dunes have been planted with Cassurina trees, including grassy shaded areas suited to picnics or just relaxing and watching the ebb and flow of the sea. Unfortunately, difficult currents make this an unsafe beach for swimming. <br/><br/>Karnataka, both its coast and hills, is a wonderful region to explore, and this combination of guesthouses is ideal.",

The dungeon where Tipu held a number of British officers has been preserved. Inside the fortress walls there’s a mosque and the Sri Ranganathsway Temple. After visits proceed to Mysore. Mysore, once the capital of the Wodeyar kingdom, is today the second largest city in Karnataka and one of the finest in southern India. Small, easygoing, famous for its silks and sandalwood, it is a city of fine gardens, tree-lined boulevards, art galleries and an intriguing palace. Mysore’s ten day Dessara festival in September-October is still celebrated with medieval pageantry. On arrival check in at the hotel and relax for a while.

    "generalInfo": "For some people Ladakh and Kashmir holidays can seem too remote, more of an expedition than a holiday. But this fourteen day, tailor made itinerary has been carefully crafted to allow travellers who want to visit these stunning Himalayan regions to do so with ease of access, and stay in good quality accommodation along the way. By starting and ending your  trip in Delhi, you will have the services of a private guide to guide you around the city highlights, and then guide you to onto domestic flights to both Srinagar for a few days and then, after a day’s rest back in Delhi, on another flight to Leh. Where more expert local guides await. <br/><br/>In Srinagar, the largest city of  Jammu and Kashmir state, you will stay overnight on one of the city’s famous houseboats which interconnect Lakes Dal and Nigeen, and also have plenty of time to take in the mosques, ancient streets and markets of this historical city, brimming with cultural heritage.  <br/><br/>In Leh, the capital of the Himalayan heaven that is Ladakh, enjoy its magnificent setting at 3500m, enveloped by snowy peaks, and visit some of its cultural highlights, the top of the list being its extraordinary royal palace, set into the mountain. From Leh, you can also take trips out to the Nubra Valley with your chauffeur guide, a flower filled landscape created by two rivers and stunning natural division between the Ladakh and Karakoram mountains. You will access it via the famous Khardung La pass, an ancient trading and caravan route. <br/><br/>Your final trip before returning to Delhi will be spent on a camping adventure at one of Ladakh’s most beautiful places to visit: Panong Lake, shared by both India and Tibet. Serene and sumptuously blue, this is the most perfect Ladakhi way to bring your trip to a close, before flying back to Delhi. <br/>",

Upon arrival in Leh, we’ll transfer to our hotel and spend some time relaxing and acclimatising to the altitude.

Lying high on the Tibetan plateau - and only recently opened to foreign visitors - Nubra Valley means ‘Valley of Flowers’ and visiting here is like stepping back in time. This is where the Shyok River meets the Siachan River to form a large valley separating the Ladakh and Karakoram mountain ranges.

You break for refreshments along a bund/ dyke at the mouth of the river Pamba as it flows into the ‘kayal’ or lake. The narrow bund separates the paddy fields and the water, between growing seasons the fields are flooded with water to replenish the soil. The coconut palms that frame the narrow strip of land against the reflective waters on either side is the most endearing and iconic sight of the backwaters.

Not that there’s anything wrong with them! But if you’re interested in a more immersive take on life in this part of southern India, then this fascinating two-week adventure will surely pique your curiosity.<br/><br/>Departing from Bangalore, the ‘Garden City’, you’ll drive via the ancient Hoysala temples in Hassan to Coorg, for an overnight stay at an eco lodge on the edge of a plantation. This coffee and spice-growing region sees few visitors, and is therefore wonderfully picturesque and tranquil.<br/><br/>From Coorg you’ll move on to the renowned city of Mysore, to explore its hilly scenery, markets and palace, before a further drive to Kabini. This will be your base for a safari into the Nagarahole National Park, where over 250 species of bird populate the trees, looking down on Asian elephants, Samba deer and Langur monkeys.<br/><br/>Cultural highlights of the trip follow in swift succession. In Calicut you’ll visit a Keralan gymnasium for a demonstration of kalarippayattu, a type of martial art. In Cheruthuruthy, you’ll meet a host of local artisans, and perhaps take in a show at a performing arts centre. Then, arriving in Allepey, you’ll take a dreamy houseboat cruise through the backwaters and channels of the coastal plains. Didn't we tell you this trip was a little bit special?<br/><br/>Please note from 2019 this trip will depart directly from the airport to Hassan on day one without a stop in Bangalore.<br/>",

Originally built in the 14th Century, the palace of today is the result of a significant redesign by the British architect, Henry Irwin. A wonderful fusion of European and Indian influences, the palace is still the official residence of the Wodeyar dynasty, the royal family of Mysore. We take a walking tour around the city this morning, taking in the palace and the markets before driving out to the hills that surround the city. The Chamundi Hills are home to the impressive Sri Chamundeswari Temple and the sacred Nandi bull, one of the largest of its kind and carved from a single piece of rock. We’ll also stop off at the nearby impressive Srirangapatnam with its 18th Century remains of Tipu Sultan’s Fort, Palace and Mausoleum."

A unique ecosystem that is home to a rich variety of aquatic life, the backwaters present us with a time-honoured image of an India long forgotten. Scattered villages survive amongst the labyrinthine channels much as they have for generations. Kettuvallams, Keralan houseboats, once negotiated these canals carrying rice, grain and even royalty through the backwaters. Today they provide us with an ideal way to appreciate the tranquillity and tradition of this part of southern India. We’ll pass isolated communities, and gardens of hibiscus and vegetables, as well as hopping off the boats to visit interesting sights en route. Our evenings will be spent moored up besides the lapping shores of these idyllic backwaters. Having two nights aboard our private chartered houseboats enables us to venture further into the backwaters - catching a glimpse of life rarely seen by foreign visitors to Kerala."

Built on commerce the city began to prosper with the arrival of Jewish and Arab traders. With the later arrival of the Portuguese, and then the Dutch and English, Kochi went on to become a vibrant settlement - incorporating a rare fusion of European and Asian traditions and styles. Today we will take a walking tour around the historic old streets of Fort Cochin and the red-tiled riverfront of Mattancherry, once the old capital’s main market area and the centre of the Malabar spice trade. The city is also famous for its Chinese fishing nets, which are made from teak and bamboo. The huge cantilevered nets are a legacy of some of the earliest visitors to the Malabar Coast. Similarly, the city is renowned for its Santa Cruz Basilica and the Church of St. Francis, the oldest European church in India, where the body of Vasco de Gama was held before being returned to Portugal. This evening we will enjoy a sunset cruise on the harbour before learning to cook a traditional Keralan dinner with a local family."

This trip uses a few handpicked homestays, as well as guest houses and a houseboat to give you a taste of the area. <br/><br/>And what a taste. Enjoy the home advantage of home-cooked meals. In a region that’s celebrated for its cuisine, gorge on gorgeous coconut-based pancakes, rice dishes and desserts, marinated fish, biriyanis, and vegetarian curries. <br/><br/>This trip is run by an operator with over two decades experience organising Kerala holidays and can be tailor made to you. <br/><br/>You could start with Cochin and Fort Cochin, Kerala’s colourful harbourside city, as an appetiser, before getting out into nature.<br/><br/>You’ll have your own driver taking you around  for some of the trip – a little luxury that’s incredibly helpful when it comes to getting out of the city. This way you can be driven up inland to Munnar hill station and Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary in comfort – and then down towards the coast to explore the backwaters around Kollam and on to the beachy regions of southern Kerala. <br/><br/>No trip to this area is complete without a stay on a houseboat – the region is famous for the converted river barges on its backwaters that have been converted into idiosyncratic floating hotels.  <br/><br/>It’s great to end your trip at a beach resort – and there’s no better place than Varkala beach – one of the best sandy stretches in Kerala. The beach has a spring that’s thought to have healing properties. Whether you find these or not, ending your trip here will have you feeling fully restored. <br/>",

    "generalInfo": "Kerala houseboat holidays offer a luxurious opportunity to soak up the sights and sounds of life along the riverbanks in the Kerala backwaters, one of the most peaceful and attractive regions of southern India.<br/><br/>This particular trip makes use of a traditional one-bedroom rice barge (kettuvallam). Made from natural materials, due to its smaller size it is capable of cruising away from the normal tourist routes while providing comfortable, exclusive accommodation for up to two passengers. You’ll be accompanied by a crew of three, including a guide / cook who will prepare sumptuous Keralan cuisine throughout from ingredients sourced at local markets and perhaps even fish caught fresh. Many recipes will have been handed down through the cook’s own family over generations, so you can expect to eat very well. <br/><br/>Over six nights you’ll explore lesser-visited waterways of Kerala, including numerous narrow channels and low bridges. This Kerala houseboat holiday is a tailor made trip, so as well as having the freedom to choose your travel dates, you can adapt the suggested itinerary as you please.<br/><br/>Days are spent gently cruising along, pausing to wander bird sanctuaries, coconut plantations, ancient shrines, markets and villages. In the afternoons, your crew will anchor in a quiet place and even when it’s warm you’ll be very comfortable in your air-conditioned cabin. <br/><br/>Disembarking on day 9 and bidding your crew farewell, you’ll spend the final night of your Kerala tour at a welcoming, family-owned home stay with a swimming pool and land that is exceptional for birdwatching. It’s a lovely way to bring your trip to an end, however there is plenty of scope to continue on through Kerala and beyond.<br/><br/>Please note: If you’re interested in taking a larger group on this sort of houseboat holiday in Kerala then the route would need to change. A larger craft would be required that wouldn’t be able to navigate the narrower waterways and the lower height of the bridges featured on this suggested itinerary. <br/>",

Sadly, all these lovely mansions today are vacant, though they are still well-maintained by the Chettiars living in different parts of the world…as they come once in few years to visit their homeland. It is an absolutely amazing experience to wander around a typical Chettinadu village and explore these largely abandoned mansions. Your lunch will be in Chettinadu and you will sample the unique Chettinad cuisine that has transcended the boundaries of the state to carve a worldwide following. Chettinad cuisine is famous for its use of a variety of spices in preparing mainly non-vegetarian food. Later in the afternoon you will return to Madurai and will be at leisure.

This one and a half hour drive takes us through the water-lined suburbs before giving way to smaller villages as we reach the start of the backwaters - a complex and sprawling network of waterways flanked by lush rice paddies and swaying coconut palms. Spanning over 900 square kilometres, the backwaters comprise of five freshwater lakes criss-crossed by a myriad of man-made canals and fed by 38 rivers. These waterways have been plied for hundreds of years, where kettuvallams (traditional wooden boats) were used to transport rice, spices, wood and other goods from the mountains to the sea ports. Nowadays the backwaters still support a vibrant local economy, from fishing and transportation of goods to cottage industries and agriculture on the rich fertile land. We board our up-market houseboat for the night - which is a modern take on the traditional kettuvallam rice barge, comprising of comfortable air-conditioned en-suite cabins, a central dining area and plenty of space to relax and take in the surrounding scenery. We spend the day floating along at a relaxed pace, meandering past riverside village life, spotting locals washing clothes, tending to animals and cultivating vegetables on the narrow spits of land. Please note that depending on the size of the group, we may split the group over two or three different houseboats."

There is also the option to take a guided walk from the hotel, alongside the waterways and through small villages, stopping to learn about the cultivation methods used here. Kumarakom is also known for its birdlife with both endemic and migratory birds, so we hope to be able to spot kingfishers, cormorants, herons and egrets among many others."

Calicut, or Kozhikode as it is now known, has been a historically significant trading port for centuries, first set up to trade with the Arabs and the Chinese, and later becoming famous as the place where Vasco de Gama first landed in 1498. Calicut was the point that marked the beginning of European exploration of India and the famous spice trade. Such cosmopolitan influences can be found all over the city, with mosques, churches, temples and Portuguese colonial buildings all a reflection of Calicut's rich heritage. This afternoon we'll aim to uncover Calicut's trading history, with a short walking tour through the old quarter, discovering charming old buildings, places of worship and a bustling central market. The walk ends on the beach in time for sunset, where many of Calicut's locals gather with friends and families to eat, play cricket and watch the sun dip into the Arabian Sea.

It is one of the reasons why Kerala is able to grow such a wide variety of produce, from staples like rice, tea and coffee to exotic spices like cardamom, pepper and nutmeg. The two and a half to three hour drive sees us pass vast swathes of spice plantations, banana palms and tea farms as we snake our way up into the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, India's largest protected forest and a haven for a rich variety of both flora and fauna. We'll arrive at the hotel car park, where we'll transfer into jeeps for a scenic thirty-minute drive up to our accommodation, nestled in the hills beyond the bus drop-off point. Our accommodation for the next two nights is an eco-resort nestled in the heart of the jungle.

There is an infinity swimming pool, large restaurant and bar serving locally-sourced produce and an on-site team of naturalists providing expertise, talks and excursions. Due to Wayanad's altitude, evenings are generally cool and comfortable and so the cabins do not have air-conditioning, instead they have large ceiling fans.

Camping out close to the herders' temporary villages is an authentic way to become immersed in the culture of the region as well as being able to experience, first-hand, the vast lakes and high altitude plateau on the Tibetan border.<br/><br/>Listening to the folklore tales around the campfire is one such way that travellers get to learn about the cultural traditions of the Changpa people, on their terms. This is not a gimmick or a display for the tourists, this is an opportunity to live with local families and find out more in a natural setting.<br/><br/>A combination of organised activities and organic adventures allows this ten day trip to unfold at your own pace as well as including interactive herding, cooking and dancing sessions to ensure you become completely immersed in the nomadic way of life in the mountains.<br/><br/>Spending two whole days within the Changpa community is an absolute privilege and an experience that's bound to stay long in the memory for cultural travellers and adventure seekers alike.<br/><br/>Life in Ladakh and on the Chantang plateau is geared around farming much of which means preparing food and livestock for the colder months of winter. The contrasts between life in the countryside and life in the town of Leh is significant and you'll find both locations provide fascinating perspectives with the meeting of Buddhism, Sikhism and Islamism, certain to make an indelible impact.",

    "generalInfo": "Our photo tour of Ladakh has been carefully timed to include two Buddhist monastic festivals, which are the heart of all of the Indian festivals. Traditional dances are performed by monks wearing colourful silk garments and different facial masks, who swirl and dance as they portray old legends and stories – truly a portrait photographer’s dream come true.<br/><br/>Far from the maddening crowds, the area comprises a sprinkle of ancient monasteries amongst high altitude passes, surrounded by snow-capped mountains sandwiched between China and Kashmir. Nomadic tribes with yaks, pashmina goats and Bactrian camels gently cross arid landscapes against cobalt blue skies. The dominant religion is Buddhism, and it is one of the few places where Mahayana Buddhism, also known as Lamaism, is still practiced. This religion is a mixture of the animistic Bon faith and ancient Hindu tantric practices. <br/><br/>The stark yet beautiful landscapes contrast significantly with the rich décor found in the monasteries, and the light that plays on the mountains, near and far, will delight any photographer. The people here live very tough lives, but we have found them to be some of the friendliest folk in the region, and with Nathan's help, many are willing to engage with you as you take their portrait photographs.<br/><br/>Transport is an essential consideration of any tour but even more so on a photography tour in Ladakh. Although the roads are surprisingly good for such mountainous terrain (thanks to the Indian Army), there are inevitably some long drives on this tour. Your safety and comfort are our primary concerns, and so we break the group up into a convey of Innova cars. <br/><br/>Unlike many other photography tours, we assume photographers will want private rooms and won't like to share. We do not charge a single person supplement, however we can offer a discount if you would prefer to share a room with a friend or partner.",

As we drive past colourful villages and hillside monasteries the journey will get more interesting. We spend the afternoon and evening resting as we need to acclimatise because of the high altitude. Alchi is 500m lower than Leh so it makes acclimatisation easier, and also has one or two nice cafes where you can kick back and watch the world go by."

Upon arrival at Lamayuru we will visit the village and the monastery, one of the oldest Gompas of Ladakh with more than 400 Buddhist monks undergoing training. It is located on a sediment rock hill cliff and appears to be precariously balanced by some strange mystical power unknown to human beings. Next to the cliff is a deep gorge where the Lamayaru rivers meanders like a snake through the valley. The village is located below the monastery close to the river. The green fields around the village and the stream flowing through the fields make a refreshing change from the other-worldly environment of Lamayuru."

We visit two remote and exceptionally vibrant Buddhist festivals, one each in both Zanskar and Ladakh. Thanks to their adherence to the Indian Union, these are both very rare regions in the Himalaya where traditional Tibetan culture, society, and buildings have miraculously survived the Chinese Cultural Revolution. During the tour we explore the very best locations that these two Buddhist areas can offer the adventure travel photographer. The Zanskar region is our new addition and has only recently opened up to travellers by road. This is an opportunity to photograph and document a culture before the inevitable changes the cultural landscape for ever. Previously only the hardiest trekkers were able visit this area. Ladakh is located to the north of the Himalayas on the Tibetan Plateau south of K2 and the Karakoram. Both Ladakh and Zanskar have remained isolated for centuries to the outside world although Ladakh has been welcoming visitors for several years now.<br/><br/>Both countries have a rich cultural and religious heritage that is little changed and offers photographers some rare sights which we gain by spending several days and nights out in very remote areas. In Ladakh these include Tso Moriri Lake located on the Tibetan plateau and home to the Changpa nomads. Expect spectacular views of the snow-capped mountains reflecting themselves in the ever-changing light. At Tso Moriri we enjoy and photograph the exciting Korzok Gustor Techu (festival). In Zanskar we must expect the unexpected given the undisputed isolation of the region. The inhabitants until recently lived in almost complete self sufficiency and the tourist infrastructure is little developed. The Zanskar population lives mainly in scattered small villages, the largest being the capital Padum with nearly 700 inhabitants. Here we will stay in a hotel that is quite comfortable and will be our base for the vibrant two day Karsha Festival which is celebrated at the monastery. Most of the Zanskar villages are located in the valleys of the Zanskar river and its two main tributaries. The local people will journey from afar to celebrate Karsha. Participants will be accompanied at all times by a local and very knowledgeable local guide and professional photographic tutors; be prepared to be totally blown away by this adventurous cultural and photographic journey.",

We will be there in time to catch all worshippers turning the huge prayer wheel before climbing the steps flanked by more wheels to the prayer hall. We will be allowed to sit with the monks and photograph discreetly. Throughout and between the chanting young monks dash about and will be serving their elders with tea and breakfast. After breakfast in the monastery restaurant we return to Leh. In the afternoon we will explore the bustling market area which has interesting old back streets teeming with locals going about their daily life. Walking uphill through the medieval alley ways of Leh takes us to the Namgyal Tsemo Gompa and Tsemo Castle. Sengge Namgyal must have been a proud king when he moved into this new palace in Leh 1600 AD. There was probably no other structure anywhere in the kingdom of Ladakh that matched the edifice overlooking the old town of Leh with a design based on the Potala Palace, Lhasa. The Gompa and castle afford superb vistas over the whole area, often beautifully framed with fluttering prayer flags. Photography is allowed inside most of the historic monasteries of Ladakh, although no flashes are allowed."

Situated about forty kilometres West of Leh along the route to Srinagar, the jagged skyline is visible from far away. Best known for its castle ruins and the adjoining royal temples, it is spectacularly located high on the rocks. We approach from the back and on foot making our way along an old path dotted with Stupas and other Buddhist artefacts. The complex of buildings includes a ruined fortress that dates from the 15th century, as well as two large temples and a small shrine. The best-preserved temple is situated on the summit, where there is a shrine dedicated to Maitreya. Built in the mid-16th century by Tsewang Namgyal, the ruler of Ladakh, there are several original wall murals to see. There are some small and very pretty villages below the forts and temples. We will spend time exploring and photographing here. Resuming our journey to Lamayuru we will pass through and photograph some incredible rock scenery: a moonscape in shades of cream and brown. The ascent to Lamayuru is simply stunning. For the next three nights we stay in a family run hotel, clean and simple with a lovely garden and views directly onto the rocky ramparts and the monastery."

There is a legend that this was once a lake where a disciple of Lord Buddha offered some food to the guarding serpents. A handful of the grain fell on the soil, causing the barley plants to grow in the shape of a swastika. The most common name for this symbol of peace – Yungdrung – was given to the place. The haunting chanting of the monks will be ever present during our stay for this is an active teaching monastery clinging dramatically to the rocky cliffs surrounded by a unique moon-like landscape. A medieval village seemingly grows out of the rocky hillside below the monastery which is in our opinion one of the most strikingly photogenic in Ladakh. During the afternoon we will visit a remote summer settlement inhabited by just a couple of families. Here we will encounter and photograph life little changed for many centuries."

During the winter time Padum is inaccessible except by a treacherous journey on foot along the frozen river. The first photographic stop of our journey today is the picturesque Wanla Gompa with fabulous vistas down to the valley. Continuing over high road pass Sir Sir La at 4,832m the unfolding scenery is spectacular. Photaksar our destination nestles precariously on a steep rocky hillside above a deep ravine.

Strings of colourful prayer flags adorn this high pass and prayers are offered for our safe passage. Throughout our journey into Zanskar we will pass small habitations and local people going about their daily tasks. We will pass through Zangla village with views of Karsha where the masked festival will take place. This tiny village clings precipitously to the mountain side and is one of the major scholastic centres for Buddhist studies. The monastery itself has many beautiful statues of Buddha. Arriving in Padum we find the largest and most important town in the remote Zanskar Valley. Named after the Buddhist guru Padmasambhava this was historically one of the two main capitals of the Zanskar Kingdom, the other being Zangla. A small town with about 800 houses predominantly comprised of Buddhists along with a small Muslim population. Padum is perfectly located for our explorations of this dramatic area."

This remote and atmospheric event is a spectacular photographic experience and an important event for the people who will travel from the most far flung corners of Zanskar to attend and celebrate over two days. Karsha Gustor Festival celebrates the victory of the spirit of goodness over evil forces. This festival is celebrated by the renowned Yellow Hat order monks or the Gelupka order monks who have established their own monastery called the Karsha Monastery on the Zanskar mountain ridges which lie alongside the Padum Plains. The Karsha Monastery is located in a gorgeous location about 12 km away from Padum. Classically masked dancers perform sacred dances mostly to drive off the evil spirits and to celebrate the birthday of Tsongkha-Pa who was the illustrious founder of Gelupka order. The celebrations are continued for two days with great pomp and show. Dancers wearing brilliant costumes sway to the chants uttered by Gelupka monks while the onlookers slowly enter into a religious trance like state. Fierce dances depicting, the atrocities committed by Lhang Dar-Ma and his subsequent killing by Tibetan Monk of Gelupka order in 19th century. Other acts of treachery, cowardice, jealousy, sin and other forms of evil are also enacted along with glorious dance drama depiction of how good finally triumphed over evil - in all, a fabulous photographic spectacle. We have allowed four nights in Padum to fully explore the surrounding area and its unique landscape and culture."

The road option is new and opens up this stunning Zanskar valley to people who in the past needed to make this journey on foot for many days. We will see rugged snow covered mountains, glaciers, the green fertile Suru valley, remote monasteries clinging impossibly to steep mountains, pretty villages with local people going about their daily lives, ancient fortresses and colourful rock landscapes. Our journey to Kargil will take the whole day and there will be many photographic opportunities such as the outstanding vistas from the Pensi La (4,400 m) towards the curving Drung-Drang Glacier with its array of stunning Himalayan peaks as a backdrop. When we arrive in Kargil we will check in to our hotel for showers followed by an evening meal together. The next day will be spent exploring all that this special and diverse city has to offer. The peoples of Kargil were mostly Tibetan-Buddhist until the 18th and 19th century after which most converted to Islam. Kargil has had a turbulent history but is nowadays a peaceful and immensely beautiful city is a famous draw for tourists. Nestled right in the middle of the of the Himalayas, Kargil is populated by Kargil peoples belonging to many countries, races and religions, including Hindus, Muslims, Tibetan descendants and Dhards who can be recognised by their Aryan complexion, beautiful green/blue eyes and elaborate floral head-dresses. Kargil Market is situated in the middle of the city, a multi cultural trading centre which evolved on the important silk trade route where travellers and traders would stop to rest, buy and sell. Even today the Kargil markets have an old world charm with a rich Central-Asian architectural character. The famous Balti Bazar has the mud and wood architectural style common in the Western Himalayas and Karakoram regions. Photographically we will be exploring a rich blend of Ladakhi, Balti and Central Asian portraiture in a colourful market setting, and of course shopping for some unique souvenirs."

Flanked by lofty mountains, the salt water lake of Tso Kar is situated at around 4,000 metres in the secluded and beautiful Rupshu Valley. Tso Moriri was once a popular source of salt. Until around 1960 nomads were extracting salt there and trading it in the Leh Market. Before 1994, Tso Moriri Lake and South East Ladakh were not open for tourists due to government border restrictions. The area surrounding the lake attracts a wide range of wildlife. Rare birds such as the black-necked crane are occasionally seen, along with other migratory birds, marmots, kiang (wild asses) and blue sheep. The sacred blue lake is also within the range of the occasionally spotted Tibetan wolf. The myriad colour mountains here are nothing short of stunning. The landscape opportunities are generally very fine. The Tsokar Lake lies en route in the Rupshu valley and it is the most famous Salt Lake of Ladakh. We arrive in Korzok one day before the festival starts to soak up and photograph the preparations which are equally interesting photographically. The Changpa nomadic herders will gather around and above the lake. We have excellent contacts with these hardy people and our photographers are always welcomed into their Yak wool tents for tea and a chat. Our visit is timed for the Korzok Gustor festival which is essentially the ‘Nomads own festival’. We will witness Lamas dressed as various divinities and legendary characters carrying out their traditional mystic masked dancing, there is always an air of fun and happiness at this particular festival as the Nomads take a break from their arduous chores and the serious business of herding their animals to enjoy the local ‘chang’ with friends and family. The climax of the festival is when yaks, goats and other creatures come into the monastery to be blessed. We will stay for three nights in a ‘deluxe camp’ close to the lake and festival giving us a fine base for photographing all that is happening very thoroughly. The landscapes here are outstanding. Although Tso Moriri is 4522m we will all be very well acclimatised when we spend time here."

    "generalInfo": "Few places look as barren and inhospitable than the Trans-Himalayan highlands. Empty, rolling plains mostly made up of rock and scree as well as a few hardy grass species and stunted trees and bushes; all dominated by inaccessible steep rocky mountains and outcrops. <br/><br/>All of this do not seem like the best place to find wildlife. But this ecosystem is teeming with animals, from the ghost-like snow leopard and Eurasian lynx to herd dwelling Tibetan wild asses (kiang), argali, Asiatic ibex and Ladakhi urail there is a raft a life here waiting to be seen. <br/><br/>This tour is a specialist tour where some of the most elusive and specially adapted species of mammals and birds are searched for. So if you wish to be one of the few wildlife watchers to explore the vastness of India's Himalayas and possibly see some of the rarest species in the world then this tour is for you.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching tours and safari holidays all over the world, specialising in the Indian subcontinent and of course the wonderful and diverse country of India. Whilst most wildlife watchers who visit India spend time in the famous tiger reserves of the central plains or maybe the forests and grasslands of the north east of India and the Western Ghats in the south. But these ecosystems and incredible wildlife are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the wildlife that India has to offer. <br/><br/>This tour explores some of the lesser known regions and takes you into the wildest and least inhabited parts of India’s north west Himalayas. All of this whilst escorted by our very own expert zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us)coupled with local guides. Of course there is one species in particular that dominates everyone’s thoughts and dreams when they think of the stunning Himalayas nowadays and that is the majestic snow leopard. <br/><br/>Whilst there are chances of seeing snow leopards here we take time to showcase the their ecosystem in full and try and find as many other animals that share the mountains with snow leopards. Most of this trip will involve driving to spotting and scanning locations as well as walking among the high altitude grasslands and rocky slopes looking for animals that make this inhospitable locations their home. <br/><br/>One of the reasons why our safaris of India are unique is that our background (as a company) is from a scientific and zoological standpoint and so have a great network of colleagues and contacts all over the world who are the people on the front line in search of the best new locations for wildlife watching in the wild. All of these reasons and many more make us experts in arranging and guiding safaris and are able to tailor a Indian safaris to any location to try to find them that you request. All you have to do is to get in touch with us and tell us your budget and your group size and where you would like to go on safari.<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of Indian wildlife watching safari holidays. These tours range from the dry desert regions of Gujarat in search of striped hyena and Asiatic lions to the icy peaks of the Himalayas on the quest for snow leopards. But we also have a range of specific birding and bird watching tours, this being one of them.  <br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in cities and towns. There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through India and particularly birding holidays. Your naturalist escort is an expert in ornithology and their conservation and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. We will also employ a specific cultural guide for all sightseeing of temples and monuments.<br/><br/>The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, trekking permits, spotlighting, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the park. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>This tour is recommended for the northern hemisphere summer season. This is not the normal season people visit Ladakh for snow leopards, but they are seen throughout the year with good regularity. But the key factor here is that during the summer there are more roads and passes open to explore and the diversity of wildlife is much higher. Many of the herbivorous animals and migratory birds which leave to head to areas not covered with snow in winter are here in their numbers.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our bird watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• Our local Indian guides have a good relationship with the park and reserve officials and because of this we get a heads up when animals are sighted and this can guide us in where to focus and thus increasing our chances of seeing our targeted species.<br/>• Visit the parks and reserves morning and afternoon in your own private vehicle for your group only.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our wildlife and bird watching holidays of India a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout India so that we can try and find and observe birds. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of India at other times of year and focusing on other species such many mammals like tigers, snow leopards, elephants, rhinos and many species throughout this incredible country. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour visits a range of locations around Ladakh, your entry and exit point in Ladakh will be the city of Leh and when you arrive and depart from India you will travel through Delhi.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>This tour is at high altitude and whilst it is not full hiking, there are no long days of trekking; there are some hikes at altutude included and so a level of fitness or experience of being at altitude is needed for full enjoyment of the trip.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 Years Old",

Lato is where the Indian plate collided with the Eurasian plate about 55 million years ago and you can see the impact of the collision here. The steep crevices and the rock faces in brilliant hues of pink, green, purple, red and ochre show what occurred in stunning colours. Here along the riversides you will be stopping to look for brown dipper, fire-fronted serins, Eurasian crag martin, Northern house martin, hill pigeon as well as fly bys from Himalayan griffons. There are chances of sighting mammals around here like the mountain weasel, stone marten, blue sheep and few other mammals. We will carry on towards Rumtse and look for golden eagle on a well known nest here, then wait and see if we can get to see the long tailed marmots, there will be birds like lammergeier, osprey, golden eagle, Himalayan griffon and of course possibilities of Himalayan snowcock, Tibetan partridge etc as we move towards Tso Kar. Along the way there are lots of birds species that can be seen including large flocks of horned larks, Tibetan snow finches, robin, brown and black-throated accentor, Tibetan lark, Brandt mountain finch etc near the Tso Kar area. Some of the speciality bird species here include the black-necked crane, great crested grebe, black-necked grebe, common tern, white-winged tern, Tibetan sandgrouse, nesting bar-headed geese and ruddy shelducks, saker falcon, upland buzzard and little owls. Also around here we will try are best to see some of the Himalayan mammal species such as Tibetan wild ass, woolly hare, silvery mountain vole, Tibetan argali, Tibetan wolf (however the chances of wolves depends on the movements of the Nomads as they follow them) and dhole. There is a small population of Eurasian lynx in the area surrounding this place however they are very hard to see here. So we will keep a look out for this with our local guide. After exploring the area for its mammals and birds we will head back to the accommodation, level camping; for your evening meal. (all of your meals are included today)."

    "generalInfo": "This Rajasthan holiday is all about enjoying this majestic state at a gentle pace, with excellent chauffeur guides, and staying at some of the state’s most stunning heritage and luxurious hotels. In Delhi, for example, where this tailor made itinerary begins, you will be welcomed at the Imperial Hotel in the prestigious Connaught Place. Your guide will take you around the city, Old and New, visiting some of its most splendid sites, such as Mahatma Gandhi’s memorial, Raj Ghat, the magnificent Red Fort, and also enjoying a trip in a rickshaw around Old Delhi.<br/><br/>After transferring to Rajasthan’s city of Udaipur, known as Venice of the East because of its complex lake system that creates waterways around its historic palaces and pretty streets, you will stay in a hotel that matches the city’s propensity for romanticism, The Leela Palace Hotel, with stunning rooms overlooking Lake Pichola. During your time here you can take a boat ride on the lake, visit the magnificent City Palace or just enjoy this city’s unique setting with its mountainous backdrop provided by the Aravali Hills.<br/><br/>You get to immerse yourself even more in the Aravali Hills by spending two nights in another five star heritage hotel, this one in a magnificently restored 18th century fort, with a location that is second to none. Originally built by the Jhala Rajputs who ruled the Mewar Kingdom this is a wonderful place from where to explore the local village, go horse riding into the hills and explore the local Jain temples. As you can imagine, the night skies here are also a magical experience in themselves, which you can take in from your private terrace.<br/><br/>From here, the itinerary takes you to Rajasthan’s capital city of Jaipur, famous for its pink sandstone buildings which give a constant yet ever changing rosy glow. Packed with architectural wonders, such as Jantar Mantar stone observatory, the walled city that is home to two palaces, Hawa Mahal and Jal Mahal and of course the world famous Amber and Nahargarh forts. You will stay in your own feat of architecture out in the hills surrounding the city, the Tree Of Life Resort &amp; Spa, for more luxury and more relaxation.<br/><br/>Leaving Rajasthan, the final couple of days of this holiday take place in Agra, for the icing on the cake: The Taj Mahal seen by carriage ride at sunrise. Staying at the nearby Oberoi Amarvilas hotel, from which you can actually see the most beautiful marble mausoleum in the world, you will end your Indian and Rajasthan holiday ends just as you began.

    "generalInfo": "This itinerary in western and central India is for those who want to explore wildlife off the beaten track. You'll uncover a huge diversity of wildlife in amazing landscapes, and travel well beyond the well-known destinations, staying in luxurious, sustainability-forward lodges. Highlights include: great chances to see sloth bears, leopards and tigers; safaris that go far beyond the standard jeep drive; plus a rare chance for a nocturnal safari.<br/><br/>The first destination on the tour is Jawai, which is a very interesting landscape of water, rocks and boulders. It's a great place for leopard sightings. Leopards co-exist with shepherds in the area, and you'll enjoy rural life alongside possible big cat sightings. <br/><br/>Next, we go to the little Rann of Kutch, which is a much sparser landscape, and one of the homes for the wild ass and desert fox. There's also excellent birdlife, which lives alongside the nomadic communities here. After exploring the little Raan, this itinerary takes you to the Black Buck Sanctuary, an amazing place: this small national park known for its black buck sighting and is one of the best places to see and photograph wolves and striped hyena. The Black Buck Sanctuary also has the largest congregation of different species of harriers anywhere on earth.<br/><br/>From the Black Buck Sanctuary you will travel by road to Ahmedabad and then onward to Bhopal in central India to start the next leg of your journey. Satpura is one of central India’s best kept secrets. Your first stop in Satpura Tiger Reserve is the Bori Wildlife Sanctuary, known for good tiger sightings. This hidden gem of an area feels very exclusive, and alongside tigers you might see sloth bears wild dogs, leopards, sambar, spotted deer, and a great amount of birdlife. After three nights in Bori, you will proceed to the Satpura National Park by boat, giving you a truly unique perspective of the landscape. <br/> <br/>Satpura offers a mix of activities making it unique from other tiger reserves in Central India. During your stay you will have a mix of game drives and a choice of walking safaris, boat safaris, canoes excursions, horseback safaris and even night safaris: a chance to see civets, jungle cats, owls and the tiny and very elusive rusty spotted cat. This park is the place where you'll have the highest probability of seeing a sloth bear. <br/><br/>After Satpura, return to Delhi with stories of all your amazing animal encounters.<br/>",

Our area of the Western Ghats in South India is rich with hundreds of species, many endemic to the Nilgiris. Walks, talks and safaris will be arranged to learn about the lives and environment of the hunter-gatherer Adivasi.  Sandeep, our charismatic and knowledgeable naturalist, will lead the small group tours; his popular bird-watching walks are a key feature of the tour.<br/><br/>Guests on the tours will stay, with exclusive use, in our purpose-built luxury guest house. Each room has an en-suite bathroom and a private veranda with mountain views. South Indian cuisine will be served (cooking lessons are available) with Western breakfast also provided. Yoga lessons are also on offer. The climate is perfect at this time of the year, pleasantly warm during the day without any excessive heat, because of the elevation. Nature walks will be organised in the surrounding hills and nearby estates and safaris into the Tiger and Elephant Reserve near the guest house.<br/><br/>These tours, uniquely, involve and benefit tribal communities in India, whilst exploring the extraordinarily species-rich aspects of the natural world in the stunning Nilgiri Hills and the Mudumulai and Bandipur Forests. Walking distances and difficulties can be tailored to suit the participants on each tour. By participating, you will be giving valuable help to the Adivasi community, through employment and because all profit from the tours is donated to the tribal community organisations. Please watch on Netflix The Elephant Whisperers, a short documentary Oscar winner, which features members of this community and their elephant charges.

The lower reaches of the southern slopes of Khasi and Jaintia hills in Meghalaya are humid and warm and are streaked by many swift flowing rivers and mountain streams. A species of Indian Rubber tree thrives and flourishes alongside these streams and rivers. This tree can comfortably perch itself on huge boulders along side the riverbanks or in the middle of rivers and send its roots down to the riverbed. The bridges here are made from these living roots. This is one of the most beautiful treks. The high point of this trek is the Double Decker Root Bridge and the natural swimming pools in the river bed. This trek is open through-out the year and is being used by the villagers daily. The rivers, streams and waterfalls in full flow during the monsoon months add magnificence to the root bridges spanning these rivers and streams. Before reaching the Double Decker Root Bridge you come across another Living Root Bridge and Steel Rope bridges. The valley scenery is very impressive. Beyond the Double Decker Root Bridge, you walk on level ground another 2 km to reach Mawsaw Steel Rope Bridge. From here you access natural swimming pools. The larger pool is deep and we recommend only good swimmers to attempt it. The smaller pool can be used by others. After a refreshing swim, it is time for lunch. Leave the pool side by 2:30 p.m. to reach the top before it is dark. Then drive back and overnight at your hotel."

Lady Curzon, wife of the British Viceroy to India, visited Kaziranga in the winter of 1904. Unfortunately, contrary to her expectations of seeing the great Rhino itself, she could only find a few of its hoof marks. Struck by its perilous state she impressed upon her husband Lord Curzon, the need to save the Rhino. Today 100 years later, in what can be called this Century’s Greatest Conservation Success Story, the Rhino population reached 1600 and is the single largest in the world! Kaziranga National Park in Assam might be the most beautiful and attractive place you can choose to visit in north-eastern India. An UNESCO World Heritage Site, Kaziranga's 470 sq kms of lush green flood plains is home to some of the most fascinating wildlife in Asia. Everything about Kaziranga is large. From the 5 meter tall elephant-grass to Greater Adjutants, Bengal Floricans, Pallas's Fish Eagle, Black-necked Storks, Greater One-horned Rhinoceros and Asian Elephants, size dominates the vast grasslands. The rarity and restricted range of most of these giants adds to the excitement and experience. Kaziranga is a birding paradise with a checklist of almost 500 species. The park is also popularly known as the home of the \"Big Five\" - the elephant, rhinoceros, wild buffalo, tiger and Swamp Deer. A total of 52 mammalian species has been recorded in the Park itself and include such rarities like Gangetic Dolphin, Chinese Pangolin, Hoolock Gibbon, Hog-Badger and Flying Squirrel. 39 reptiles make the list and include the endangered Gharial and the rare Assam Roofed Turtle. Both the Reticulated and Rock Pythons occur in the area."

Khajuraho's temples almost all date from one century-long burst of creative genius from 950-1050 AD. Basically all temples follow a three-part layout. You enter the temple through a porch (Ardhamandapa). Behind this is the hall (Mahamandapa), supported with pillars and with a corridor around it. The inner sanctum (Garbhagriha) is where the image of the god, to which the temple is dedicated, is displayed. The temples are almost all aligned east to west, with the entrance facing east. Most of the temples are made of sandstone. The temples can be divided into three groups: Western, Eastern and Southern. Of these, the Western Group is the most impressive. After visiting the temples you will be driven a short distance to Panna."

Lying along the river Ken, Panna National Park contains large areas of un-spoilt forest and a variety of wildlife spread over almost 543 sq. km.

Rest of the day may be spent in leisure or you may undertake activities and excursions (at an additional cost) available here: • Fishing on the pristine Ken river, walks through the crop fields of the surrounding countryside and birding on site or at nearby forest and wetland areas. • Visit a number of seasonal waterfalls in the neighbouring area • Visit Maheba/Dhubela where there are majestic Chhatris (cenotaphs) of the Bundela Maharaja and his queens. • You may also visit Ajaygarh Fort; this rarely visited wonderful hilltop fort that has equally rich and even older temples and carvings than Khajuraho."

En route you will visit the sleepy little town of Orchha. Orchha is a city frozen in time. It was founded by Bundela Chieftain, Raja Rudra Pratap in the 16th century, who chose this stretch of land along the Betwa River as an ideal site for his capital. He and the succeeding rulers of Orchha built many beautiful palaces and temples in the 16th and 17th century. Today, remains of the fort and palaces speak eloquently of Orchha’s time of glory. Though little more than a village, stepping back in time into Orchha’s history is an enjoyable experience. On arrival in Agra you will be received and taken to your hotel."

The Taj Mahal (closed on Fridays) has been described as a 'tear on the face of eternity' and as an enduring monument of love. The unique beauty of Taj Mahal is blended with grandeur and its massive over-all design is matched with immaculately intricate execution. Built by Mughal Emperor Shan Jehan in the memory of his beloved queen Mumtaz Mahal, the Taj Mahal complex took 22 years to be completed and is today counted among the Seven Wonders of the World. Return to your hotel for breakfast. After check out you will be taken to visit Agra Fort. Many of the events which led to the construction of the Taj took place in the famous Agra Fort. Begun by Emperor Akbar in 1565, additions continued to be made until the time of his grandson Shah Jehan. The magnificent palaces, towers, bastions, ramparts and gateways symbolise the power of the mighty Mughals. Made mostly of red sandstone it is strikingly similar to the Red Fort in Delhi. After lunch in a city restaurant (pay directly), you will be driven to Jaipur (4 hours drive) – en route visit the deserted Mughal city of Fatehpur Sikri. Fatehpur Sikri was built by great Mughal Emperor Akbar in the 16th century to serve as the capital of his vast empire. The city was decorated with grand courts, palaces, mosques and gardens that rivalled the splendours of Delhi and Agra. However, destiny had other things in store for the city. Shortage of water and un-rest in the north-west made Akbar abandon the city only 13 years later. Today, even after the passage of 400 years, the magnificence of this royal city has not faded and remains immaculately preserved. You will arrive in Jaipur early in the evening and will be at leisure for the rest of the day."

Start the day with a visit to the milk market where large quantities of milk is procured from individual sellers and then resold to bulk buyers. Enjoy the interesting ways by which the buyers judge the purity of milk and negotiate the prices. Afterwards continue to Amber Fort - one of the more fascinating of Indian forts. It was the ancient capital of the erstwhile Jaipur state. Its construction began in 16th century and was subsequently added on to by successive rulers. Inside the fort, the places worth visiting are the Palace of Mirrors, inlaid with millions of tiny glistening mirrors, the hall of Public Audience and the beautiful manicured gardens. After lunch in a city restaurant (pay directly) you will be taken to visit the City Palace, Jantar Mantar (medieval observatory) and drive past Hawa Mahal (palace of winds). The City Palace is situated in the heart of the city. The whole complex is wonderfully laid out with large courtyards, balconies, cupolas, arched entrances and gardens, which are a combination of Rajput and Mughal architecture. The museum here displays the rich heritage of the Jaipur family in miniature paintings, textiles, garments, books & manuscripts, carpets, palanquins and weapons dating back to the 15th century. The medieval observatory has curious collection of sculptures which enable the calculation of many astronomical and astrological events like eclipses etc. Each of these structures was built after relentless study of books, manuscripts and discussions with scholars from all over the world. Even today they are put to good work. Built in 1799 Hawa Mahal or the palace of winds is one of the landmarks of Jaipur city, although it is little more than a façade. It is a five-storey building in pink, built to enable the women of the harem to see the activities of the outside world without being seen."

Morning start your day with orientation tour of New Delhi, the foundation stone of the city was laid by Emperor George V during the Delhi Durbar of 1911. It was designed by British architects, Sir Edwin Lutyens and Sir Herbert Baker. Drive pass of President House (formerly Viceroy’s House), Indian Parliament, India Gate - a memorial to 70,000 soldiers of the British Indian Army who died in between 1914–1921 in the First World War and the third Anglo-Afghan War, and Connaught Place. Continue to visit Humayun’s Tomb built in the 1560’s, with the patronage of Humayun’s son, the great Emperor Akbar. Persian and Indian craftsmen worked together to build the garden-tomb, far grander than any tomb built before in the Islamic world. Humayun’s garden-tomb is an example of the charbagh (a four quadrant garden with the four rivers of Quranic paradise represented), with pools joined by channels. The garden is entered from lofty gateways on the south and from the west with pavilions located in the centre of the eastern and northern walls. Later proceed to Gurudwara Bangla Sahib, one of the prominent Sikh gurdwara or Sikh house of worship. Once inside the main building, you will be amazed with great interior, there is space to be seated on the floor and listen to “kirtan – the devotional songs” sung live by the staff. The holy book of Sikhs, the Guru Granth Sahib, is placed on top of a bed of silk and flowers. Like in all Sikh Gurdwaras, the concept of “langar, a communal free kitchen offering free sit-down meal” is practiced here too, and all people, regardless of race or religion may eat in the Gurdwara kitchen (langar hall). The Langar (food) is prepared by volunteers who wish to help out and by gursikhs who work there. It is believed that everyday around 25000 people eat in this hall. You are supposed to cover your head with a scarf and clean your feet with water at the entrance, as it is strictly followed in Sikhism."

Compared to New Delhi, the Old City is much closer to the image conjured up by Rudyard Kipling. This afternoon, we will travel to Old Delhi by metro and walk around the narrow, packed lanes of this fascinating part of the city, culminating with a jamboree of sounds at Chandni Chowk Bazaar. Whilst in Old Delhi we'll take a visit to the Sheesh Ganj Sikh Temple.

If you are booking your own flights, we recommend giving yourself at least one hour to clear the airport.

It became part of the Project Tiger scheme in 1974 and, today, is home to over 40 of the remarkable beasts. We hope to see tigers roaming among the woodlands and cooling off in the lakes. Aside from its more famous residents, the park is also home to sloth bear, langur, striped hyenas, marsh crocodiles, pythons and Ganga soft-shelled turtles. There is also the chance to spot a myriad of bird species, including crested hawk eagle, crested serpent eagle, jacana, parakeet and white-breasted kingfishers.

Founded in 1569 and, for a brief time the capital of the Mughals under Akbar the Great, the city was deserted just 16 years later following the political unrest. Today it remains a ghostly testament to the power of 16th century Mughal India and is a perfectly preserved example of an imperial court. Amongst the many treasures left in the city are the five storey Panch Mahal, believed to have been a pleasure pavilion for the ladies of the harem, and the stunning lotus shaped carved central pillar of the Diwan-i- Khas (Hall of Private Audience). The city also features a central courtyard that contains a pachisi board, where the emperor played an Indian equivalent of chess, using real slave girls as pieces.

Vibrant without being overwhelming, Mysore makes a wonderful introduction to India, with its lovely old buildings, its rich history stretching back to the days of the Hindu epics, and its laid-back atmosphere that wins over virtually all visitors. You’ll have a local guide with you on day two to help you get to grips with the local culture – adding depth and dimensionality to what would otherwise simply be beautiful relics. Mysore Palace, one of the grandest and most impressive of all India’s royal palaces, is bound to be a highlight. Highlights • Visit Mysore Palace, seat of the Wodeyar Dynasty, and one of the most spectacular buildings in India • Explore sprawling Devaraja Market, with a local guide to explain the zillion different sights, scents and flavours • Try a range of South Indian street food, from sweet squares of Mysore Pak to golden-brown dosas with spicy chutney"

The forest here is dense, lush and tropical (as opposed to the dry scrub forest of the north), and on its fringes you can cycle between villages where traditional tribal lifestyles survive alongside mainstream Malayalam culture. It’s wonderfully atmospheric and – if you’re lucky enough to see one of the region’s big mammals – a goosebump-inducing experience. Highlights • Enjoy your stay at a luxury safari lodge, with beautifully designed villas, infinity pool, and alfresco dining • Go on four safaris, conducted at dawn and dusk, by boat and Jeep, making the most of Kabini’s incredible wildlife • Keep your eyes peeled for sightings of tigers, leopards, black panthers and a never-ending roster of exotic birds"

You’ll be staying at a family-run plantation, from which you can go out hiking in the fields and forests, take boat trips on the property’s reservoir, or just chill out, listen to birdsong, and enjoy an ayurvedic massage. Wayanad is far less visited than Kerala’s more famous hill stations (despite being every bit as luscious). It makes for a wonderfully relaxing couple of days. Highlights • Tour the Pepper Trail plantation with your hosts, learning about how the local tea, coffee and spices are grown and processed • Take a cookery class with ‘Mum’, where you’ll learn to cook appam pancakes, Kerala curries and other local specialities • Go hiking through paddy fields and forests to lakes and waterfalls, keeping a look out for local wildlife – including elephants, Indian bison and deer"

Though the town’s laid-back, seaside atmosphere is easy to love, the real highlight of a visit to this region lies out of town, in villages where the locals celebrate Theyyam. Without a doubt one of our favourite festival experiences anywhere in the world, it’s full-on immersion in a living tradition, and totally unforgettable. Highlights • Go on a heritage walk with a local guide, meeting local people as you explore fruit-and-veg markets, colonial relics and Tellicherry Fort • Watch a demonstration of Kalari, an indigenous martial art that’s been revived in Tellicherry • Experience Theyyam, a remarkable, months-long Hindu festival of music, dance and spectacular costumes"

Here we encounter and photograph a flourishing centre for unique bronze temple statues and painting. This is a remarkable location where we are able to wander freely around the statue making work areas and observe a craft that has been unchanged over the centuries. Our accommodation is superbly located along the banks of the River Vennar. This is a branch of river Cauvery and is just three kilometres away from the city limit of Tanjore. It is a cool and calm place surrounded by a landscape of semi-jungle paddy fields. At sunrise we will go down to the river’s edge to photograph the bullocks and carts being washed and prepared for the days work ahead. We will also visit and photograph a remote mud and thatch village settlement where life is simple and still there is no electricity. We will be here for Christmas day and it is our custom to take festive presents to the villagers. Tanjore Temple is architecturally very attractive. Built on the banks of the river Cauvery, where the water was diverted to the moat, this temple is made entirely of granite, and it stands tall amidst fortified walls.

We witness women in brightly coloured saris planting rice. There are orange robed Sadhus, weird fortresses rising abruptly from shimmering forested hills, ancient shrines, peacocks, monkeys and hermits caves. We wander through one of India’s most important temples, Arunachaleswara and visit communities where the villagers live in thatched mud huts. We witness fishermen who go out each night in coracle boats returning in the morning with huge catches of large fish which they butcher and sell on the local markets. We visit local cattle markets and wander the tiny local streets to interact with the locals who are both welcoming and friendly. The unique Dravidian culture and language of this area demonstrates some unique and fascinating throw-backs in time. In all this is an incredibly rich area photographically.

It’s known for its temples and monuments built by the Pallava dynasty in the 7th and 8th centuries. The seafront shore temple comprises 3 ornate granite shrines and the rock art is quite simply remarkable.

    "generalInfo": "Our two-week Rajasthan experience is a holiday that combines desert landscapes with dramatic architecture. We begin our break in New Delhi and Agra, so that you can take in Delhi’s  stunning three UNESCO World Heritage Sites but also the inimitable grandeur of the Taj Mahal. <br/><br/>You might think that anything after the Taj Mahal might be an anti climax, but Rajasthan is the princely state that is a whole other world onto its own. We visit the unique and almost fairytale like cities of this desert region, such as the rose city of Jaipur and blue city of Jodhpur, as well as the stunning waterways of Udaipur. <br/><br/>For immersion in the Thar Desert, which dominates this incredible northern state, we also visit the beautiful fortified town of Bikaner and the even more extraordinary Jaisalmer Fort, one of the largest fully preserved fortified cities in the world. We go camel riding out into the desert, and have the chance to sleep under the stars in this great, arid terrain. There’s also the chance to stay in Rajasthan’s famous and storied heritage hotels. <br/><br/>This trip, unlike many Rajasthan holidays, also takes us north to the Shekhawati region. Once home to aristocrats between 17-19th centuries, there is still an array of grand houses here, known as havelis, with painted courtyards, colonnades and signs of obvious opulence. Rajasthan is like that everywhere, really, with great towns, forts and palaces appearing out of the desert like mirages, and yet all fantastically real. <br/>",

Then travelling through the Aravelli Hills to lesser known gem of Rankapur, we finish in Udaipur, the romantic ‘Venice’ of India.<br/><br/>Rajasthan -  “Land of Great Kings” - was the first state to fully embrace tourism in India. This is reflected in the sophistication of the state’s infra-structure for tourists. Our hotels is Rajasthan are all delightful quiet havens steeped in tradition, and  they are very comfortable. Our tour begins and ends in Delhi and visits some very well researched locations in between. Arguably the men of Rajasthan wear the biggest turbans in India and the women the most beautifully coloured Saris. This photographic tour has been designed carefully to minimise the long journeys that are often common in this vast state. We will travel executive class by train to Jaipur on Day 2 and take a flight from Udaipur back to Delhi on day 14.<br/><br/>One of the highlights of our photographic journey is the significant and celebrated Pushkar Camel Fair, one of the continent’s last great traditional melas. This is a spectacle on a truly epic scale and is the largest of its kind in the world. Vibrant, chaotic and visually impressive, the fair itself attracts a massive gathering of humankind and animals with fine opportunities for photographing these people and their rituals. Our visit is timed to coincide with the arrival of the camels, horses and cattle arriving on the sand dunes of the Thar Desert bordering this holiest of towns. Prior to arriving in Pushkar we will visit Jaipur, the ‘Pink City’ and following the fair we make the journeys to Jodhpur the famous ‘Blue City’ and Ranakpur, a lesser known location that is truly rich photographic interest. The landscape here is superb and the Marble Jain Temple is one of the finest in the whole of India. The sun rising over Kumbhalgarh Fort will also be a highlight of our stay here. The final part of our journey finishes in the romantic and ethereal lake city of Udaipur which is often known as the ‘Venice of India’. Here in this quintessential Rajasthan location we will witness classic sunsets over Lake Pichola and enjoy exploring the town’s narrow winding streets jam packed with life and colour.<br/><br/>Our photographic journeys in incredible India are the result of the many years we have spent travelling and making pictures in this extraordinarily diverse land. We provide an opportunity for our guests to travel with professional photographers, interact with local people and to  experience the wonderful culture of India. Guests can expect to return home having had great holiday with a great portfolio of images and a bunch of fabulous memories.",

    "generalInfo": "This Rajasthan small group tour not only takes you into the heart of Rajasthan, the great northern desert state, but also to the great sites of Delhi and Agra including the Taj Mahal. The group size on this trip is maximum twelve people and we will travel from place to place in private, air conditioned minibus, covering a wide variety of natural and cultural heritage sites. <br/><br/>Starting in Delhi, we take time to acclimatise a little and then visit some of the great sites, such as Old Delhi, India Gate and Humayun’s Tomb. From here we move on to Agra to see the great Taj Mahal which always lives up to expectations especially as we time our visit to coincide with sunset. Our next stop is the great desert state or Rajasthan to explore not only its magnificent, colourful and iconic cities such as Jodhpur and Jaipur but also plenty of rural villages too, where you get to immerse yourself in real Rajasthani culture. <br/><br/>Rajasthan, once known as a Princely state, always gives us a right royal welcome. Especially at the family run, heritage hotels where we stay along the way. The architecture is spectacular too, not only at these hotels but also at its famous hilltop forts or ancient palaces. Another highlight for many of our keen wildlife loving guests is the time spent at Ranthambore National Park, where we get a chance to take both sunrise and sunset safaris to see black buck, chinkaras, nilgais, civet cats and, if you are lucky, its elusive tigers. <br/><br/>This trip draws to a close in Udaipur, a fitting place to contemplate your time in Rajasthan as, like so many places we see along the way it is colourful, culture rich, beautiful and sacred. It is also known as ‘Venice of the East’, thanks to its complex lake system that winds its way around palaces, temples, ancient waterside dwellings and a wonderful collection of heritage hotels.

After arriving in Agra we'll make a stop for lunch at the Sheroes Hangout Cafe The cafe was set up by the Chhanv Foundation and is run by victirms of acid attacks. The cafe works to raise awareness of acid attacks in India and to empower those who have sadly been the victims of these heinous crimes. Prior to gaining employment in the cafe, many of the 'Sheroes' led solitary lives, rarely going outside due to shame associated with their scars. At Encounters Travel we're proud to support such an organisation, which has the sole aim of helping these women find acceptance, a supportive community and a means of income. Lunch will be included whilst at the cafe. Once you've checked in into your hotel, we'll spend the afternoon on a Mughal Heritage Walk through the ancient village of Kachhpura and surrounding farmland on the banks of the Yamuna River across from the Taj Mahal and Red Fort. This walk has been designed by a local NGO and helps support the local community through employment and new infrastructure.

These bright colours contrast the stark, dry landscape and present excellent photo opportunities along the way. We'll also stop off in the town of Fatehpur, famed for being the land of the haveli, a type of elaborately decorated mansion constructed by wealthy merchants and aristocrats. Many affluent Marwaris settled here and left behind a collection of beautiful homes. We plan to reach Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan, by the mid-afternoon and the rest of the day is free."

        "description": ": Affectionately known as the Pink City, Jaipur was first painted terracotta pink by Maharaja Sawai Ram Singh to celebrate the visit of the Prince of Wales in 1876. Nowadays, Jaipur is a bustling metropolis that's far outgrown its original boundaries. Within the crumbling walls pink buildings, ornate facades and narrow alleys give a sense of old-world charm. This morning, we'll head to the outskirts of the city and visit the dramatic Amber Fort, perched high on a hillside with impressive views back down to the city. We'll make a stop along the way to view the famous Palace of the Winds, built to allow the ladies of the harem an opportunity to look out over the city. This afternoon, we'll visit the lavish and well-preserved City Palace with its fine collection of textiles, costumes and armoury."

        "description": ": We'll leave the state of Rajasthan today as we cross into Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state in India with over 240 million inhabitants. The state is a major industrial and commercial centre, and being on the main Indo-Gangetic plain, it benefits from rich soil for agriculture, too. On the way to Agra, we'll stop and visit the deserted city of Fatephur Sikri. Founded in 1569 and abandoned just 16 years later, it's a perfectly intact example of Akbar's imperial court. Among the many noteworthy buildings is the Panch Mahal, most likely built as a pleasure pavilion for the ladies of the harem. In the centre of the courtyard is the Pachisi Board where the emperor played a game of chess with slaves as pieces. Perhaps the finest structure of all is the lotus-shaped central pillar of the Diwan-i-Khas (Hall of Private Audience), an extraordinary capital supporting a vaulted roof. The journey to Agra will take around five hours. On arrival, we'll have some time to relax, then, as the sun begins to set, we'll make our way to one of the seven wonders of the modern world, the Taj Mahal. The marble-domed building is perhaps one of the world's greatest symbols of eternal love, having been created by Shah Jahan as a funerary monument to his beloved wife, Mumtaz. Over 300 years have elapsed since its construction, but it still stands unscarred by age. It took over 22 years to build (1630-52) and an army of builders, artisans, and craftsmen to create the architectural masterpiece of marble and sandstone, which is said to change its colour depending on the time of day. We will aim to visit at sunset, when the surface of the Taj takes on a soft golden hue."

The story goes that after losing his grip on power and being imprisoned by his son, Emperor Shah Jahan was confined here to a high tower, where he spent his dying days gazing longingly downriver at his beloved Taj Mahal. We'll also explore the tomb of Itmad Ud Daulah, more commonly known as Baby Taj due to it being regarded as the first attempt at a Taj-like structure by the Mughals.

The capital of this great state, its ancient walled city is home to two palaces, and is also famous for glowing in pink, thanks to everything being built with the local red sandstone.<br/><br/>You can’t visit Rajasthan without going to Ranthambore National Park, one of the top habitats in India for the Bengal tiger and where we take an evening jeep safari. Please note that the park is closed between 1 July and 30 September every year, during which period we will visit Sawai Mansingh Sanctuary instead.<br/><br/>Bundi and Bijaipur are our next two stops, the former famous for its eponymous lake and palace and the latter a more rural spot where we take another jeep outing. From here we head further south by private vehicle to Udaipur, completely different from other Rajasthani towns and known as the Venice of the East, thanks to its complex lake system that winds its way around palaces, temples and waterside dwellings.<br/><br/>Our final stop in Rajasthan travelling by train is in Pushkar, with more water at its heart. Because Pushkar Lake is a sacred site, with pilgrims packing into the bustling ghats and temples around it. You can also take a camel ride out to the desert from here, which is a highlight for many people on this trip. Finally, we take the train back to Delhi to bring this Rajasthan odyssey to a close.",

    "generalInfo": "This nine day cultural tour takes travellers on a tailor made adventure into two of India’s lesser-visited regions, Sikkim &amp; Kolhata, with a domestic flight in between making short shrift of distances so as to invite an efficient and exciting experience close to the borders of Bhutan and Nepal.<br/><br/>Throughout the tour you’ll be invited into the villages of Limbu and Lepcha as well as finding out more about the tribal traditions of Bhutanese that have made the eastern state of Sikkim their home.<br/><br/>We value storytelling over traditional sightseeing as we think this promotes interaction with local people, on their level, rather than a more voyeuristic approach. Listening to locally told tales also keeps the spirit of the past alive as well as providing a deeper understanding of the history of an area, something that a guide book can rarely express with quite as much personal passion and entertaining insight.<br/><br/>The chance to stay overnight in the more remote villages of Sikkim &amp; Kolkata is another example of how strongly we value cultural interaction and joining in with day-to-day activities, such as cooking, handicrafts, singing and dancing, is also a great way to become immersed in life, like a local, rather than just another observational tourist.<br/><br/>As Sikkim is India’s premier state for organic agriculture you’ll be introduced to a traditional way of life from a sustainable perspective as well as marvelling at the likes of Kanchenjunga mountain and the natural beauty of Maenama Wildlife Sanctuary in the south of Sikkim.<br/><br/>Time spent in and around Kolkata (formally Calcutta) creates an authentic taste of eastern India with immersive culinary experiences combining with storytelling and interaction with local people to add to the authenticity of exploring in one of India’s most culturally enlightening Bengali capitals.<br/><br/>As this is a tailor made nine day tour you’ll be invited to explore and discover at a pace that suits you however, don’t expect to be rushing from one place to the next, far from it, this is a tour that invites pause for thought as well as organic experiences that reveal themselves piece by piece, thread by thread.<br/><br/>We pride ourselves on transparency, with no hidden costs, and encourage two way contact with our core team of tour operators rather than being passed from one member of staff to the next. We value storytelling over typical sightseeing and base our itineraries around these sorts of experiences so as to aid genuine cultural interaction for responsible travellers as well as first-class experiences to remember for all times.<br/>",

This afternoon, we have a long journey as we make our way back to the coast for some well-deserved rest and relaxation to round off our incredible tour of Southern India. After our sightseeing and a quick lunch in Mysuru, we will transfer to the railway station to board our express train to Chennai. The journey to Chennai will take around six-and-a-half hours, arriving in Chennai by early evening. We will have dinner onboard our train to Chennai before arriving at our destination. From there, we will drive for two to two-and-a-half-hour towards the shores of the Bay of Bengal and the town of Mamallapuram. Please note, today we will be arriving late, around 10pm, into our hotel in Mamallapuram. While it will be a long journey day, we have a leisurely day tomorrow to enjoy the beach or relax after our 2-week trip around Southern India."

These thin flat crepes are made from rice batter and often served with a side of chutney, potatoes and lentil sambars. Following breakfast, we'll explore the nearby shore temples. Mamallapuram was the chief harbour town of the Pallava Dynasty some 1200 years ago, and several superb examples of its masterful rock carvings still exist today. We will walk around some of the areas' most celebrated structures, including the 7th century Shore Temple - a UNESCO World Heritage site - and Ajuna's Penance, the world's largest bas-relief and one of the most impressive friezes in India. Although both have suffered at the hands of natural erosion over many centuries, although a remarkable amount of detail remains amongst the carvings.

Tickets can be purchased online in advance (approximately 900 rupees/US$10.90 per person, minimum four people). We recommend doing this to avoid a long wait at the ticket office. Please inform your leader on Day 1 if you wish to book this in advance as it’s also popular with domestic tourists and last-minute booking requests may lead to disappointment.

The journey begins in a shikhara boat, cruising to the banks of Manjira village. Through our local guide and the community, we learn about many of their practices and products, including the art of climbing a coconut tree and coconut leaf weaving. We also see a skilled fisherman cast his net and enjoy a stroll by the green paddies. For a light refreshment, try a freshly cut coconut before learning about (and sampling) fresh Kerala toddy, a specialty of the area. Return to the hotel for breakfast before checking out and continuing our journey. Stopping en route, we visit the Coir Museum, learning how coconut husks were historically manufactured and how so many products we use daily are created. At midday, we board a houseboat and journey along the Kerala backwaters and open lakes – one of the trip highlights! These enchanting boats, built of anjili (wild jack) wood and bamboo, transported goods for hundreds of years; now, they have been decorated and made into comfortable cruise boats. As we meander through tropical vegetation, we can see prolific bird life and gain a different perspective on village life. The cruise takes us along shallow, palm-fringed canals where coconut fibre, coconut meat, and cashews are loaded onto dugout canoes and then opens up to broad lakes, where you can spot and photograph a wide variety of birds. In the evening, we anchor by a bank and watch the sun set over the paddy fields. Accommodation: Houseboat"

    "generalInfo": "South India is home to a dazzling range of rare and endemic species and we explore all of the individual forests, hillsides and waterways in search of some of the world's most charismatic and endangered species such as Asiatic elephants, Tigers, Hornbills and King Cobras. <br/><br/>Introduction:<br/><br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching tours and safari holidays all over the world, specialising in the Indian subcontinent and of course the wonderful and diverse country of India. Whilst most wildlife watchers who visit India spend time in the famous tiger reserves of the central plains or maybe the sub-Himalayan parks of the north west and north east. But these ecosystems and incredible wildlife are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the wildlife that India has to offer. <br/><br/>This tour explores some of the lesser known parks and takes you into the deepest parts of India’s southern rainforests and hillsides. All of this whilst escorted by our very own expert zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) coupled with local guides. Of course there is one species in particular that dominates everyone’s thoughts and dreams when they think of an Indian safari and that is the beautiful tiger. <br/><br/>Whilst there are chances of seeing tigers here we take time to showcase the tiger’s ecosystem in full and try and find as many other animals that share the forests with tigers. We also offer a few different ways of exploring the parks, so however you like to travel through the tiger’s habitat we have the tour for you, whether you want to drive around in your own jeep, walk through the forests and grasslands tracking the elusive big cat or even via a boat or canoe in the water ways of Periyar. <br/><br/>One of the reasons why our safaris of India are unique is that our background (as a company) is from a scientific and zoological standpoint and so have a great network of colleagues and contacts all over the world who are the people on the front line in search of the best new locations for wildlife watching in the wild. All of these reasons and many more make us experts in arranging and guiding safaris and are able to tailor a Indian safaris to any location to try to find them that you request. All you have to do is to get in touch with us and tell us your budget and your group size and where you would like to go on safari.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner). There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned vehicles with an excellent local driver for all transfers. We include internal flights where ever possible on all our Indian safaris. We use two brilliant full time guides; first a professional zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) will escort you on all your excursions and also a very knowledgeable English speaking local guide at each national park. Your zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) escort is an expert in mammal biology, ecology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. Your zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) escort has spent time studying and working with different species all over the world and he has years of experience guiding throughout most of India’s national parks. We also use local expert guides with decades of experience on all our Indian safaris. We also include all jeep safaris, guided walks, canoe safaris, boat-trips, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more individual safaris into national parks per tour than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the national parks to search for tigers and other wildlife. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on tigers and other Indian wildlife which are available to watch throughout the tour.<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>March and April is the dry season and best for wildlife. For wildlife watching in southern India we recommend visiting during March and April (this is the best overall game viewing in the Indian Subcontinent’s main tiger reserves and national parks). This is towards the end of the hot dry season and offers the best chances of seeing wildlife as the hotter and drier it gets the more the wildlife aggregate around waterholes as well as there being less vegetation blocking the view. <br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>•\tAll of our Indian safaris are guided by a zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) as well as local naturalist guides, drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife your watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) that escorts all our Indian safaris has great experience guiding throughout India and the world, and specialising in big cat tracking and has worked with and tracked big cats on 4 continents.<br/>•\tWe use camera traps (where available) which will increase the chances of getting close up pictures and movies of tigers and other rare nocturnal wildlife.<br/>•\tDuring this tour we explore various national parks and wildlife sanctuaries (Bandipur, Nagahole, Wayanad, Parambikulam, Eravikulam, Silent Valley and Periyar) which will give you a very good overview of the Western Ghats and Nilgiri biosphere wilderness.<br/>•\tTravel to Silent Valley National Park for the rare and endemic lion-tailed macaques, that are best seen here than anywhere else in the world.<br/>•\tBy joining one of our Indian safaris you will have an overall wildlife experience as we are determined to showcase all of the wildlife of the parks we visit (not just tigers), you will not feel like a passenger in a rally and bounce all over the place in pursuit of tigers; we make sure all our Indian safaris are relaxed and environmentally friendly experiences. In fact the majority of tiger sightings that we enjoy in India are of tigers that our jeep and guides have found (as opposed to other operators who wait for a tiger to be seen and then stake out the waterhole surrounded by dozens of other jeeps), we always investigate any suspicious behaviour exhibited by their prey and usually find tigers by watching the deer and monkey behaviour as they change from relaxed to agitated when a predator is spotted.<br/>•\tWe have explored all the areas we visit in depth and have found the best and most conveniently located accommodations to stay in whilst searching out wildlife in isolated and remote places. Including some of the best and most ecologically friendly lodges in all of India.<br/>•\tWe are a member of Tour Operators for Tigers (TOFT) and we make sure that all of our tiger safaris run by their code of practice and we also make sure that all the accommodation we use is audited by TOFT to make sure of sustainable practices.<br/>•\tAll the above reasons give this our tiger tours and general wildlife holidays of India a great success rate of seeing tigers (100% in Bandhavgarh and close to 50% for this tour, which is very good considering the dense forests and vastness of the protected areas). <br/>•\tWe have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout the India and are able to find and observe species that are difficult to find or overlooked sometimes such as Indian leopards, Asiatic elephants, water buffalo, sloth bears, jungle cats, dhole, gaur and hundreds other endangered, rare or endemic species throughout the tigers current distribution. <br/>•\tDue to our greta network of guides and researchers throughout India we are able to organise tailor made safari to anywhere in India, whether it is Bandhavgarh, Kanha, Periyar, Kaziranga, Corbett, Ramthambore, Satpura, Tadoba, and many other wildlife watching locations you want to visit we can arrange it. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari holiday to India.<br/>•\tUnlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour takes you to the southern states of Kerala and Karnataka and from the cities of Bangalore to Trivandrum, visiting Nagarhole, Bandipur, Parambikulam, Silent Valley &amp; Eravikulam National Parks as well as Wayanad &amp; Periyar Wildlife Sanctuaries. <br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The fitness level required for this safari holiday is not very high. The vast majority of the activities are conducted from vehicles so no fitness is required, but there is some walking involved. The walking is all done at a leisurely pace with regular breaks, anyone who is used to mild hiking will find this easy.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 Years Old",

        "description": "Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary – Travelling & Wildlife Watching – This morning you will be transferred to your last wildlife watching destination which is Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary after breakfast (~4 hours). Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary is one of the largest and most famous protected areas in all of southern India. Periyar is full of water ways and lakes and is nestled in the middle of spice and rubber plantations and provides a great home for a vast array of animal life; including 62 species of mammal, 320 species of birds, 45 species of reptiles, 27 species of amphibians and 38 species of fish! Our aim is to try and find some of these specific animals here over the next couple of days. On arrival at the lodge and after checking in you will be taken to the sanctuary for a short boat ride on Periyar lake. On the lake we will hopefully find short-clawed otters, black bazas, woolly-necked storks and possibly the two freshwater turtle species that live here. Then on day 13 you will start with a short jeep safari in the national park before breakfast, followed by a 4 hour guided walk through the sanctuary before a 2 hour long boat trip after lunch. Or you have the option for a full day jeep safari inside Periyar. Either way we will search for some of the 1,000 Asiatic elephants, guar, Indian muntjac, Nilgiri tahr, tigers, leopards and dhole. If you are out all day you will take a packed lunch with you otherwise you will return to the lodge for meals between safari activities. Then on day 14 you will be taken on a guided walk in the morning. During this time we will focus on the very rare, smaller animals such as Malabar giant squirrels, lion-tailed macaques, Nilgiri langurs, side-striped mongooses, Nilgiri martens, blue-winged parakeets, rufous babblers, broad-tailed grass warblers and king cobras (the largest and most impressive venomous snake in the world). Then in the afternoon you will have the rest of the day to relax or possibly enjoy a spice plantation tour. (Breakfast, Lunch & Dinner included)."

This tour can be customized according to your preference by adding interesting tours in a) Delhi, b) Agra, c) Jaipur, d) Varanasi, e) Punjab or any other place of your choice in  India. We understand that you may want to customize your experience with activities and budget of your choice.<br/>**<br/>Best time: June - October<br/>**<br/><br/>Travelling to barren mountain desert of Spiti valley is like travelling to another planet. Spiti in local language means ‘middle land’, which means the land between Tibet and India. For centuries, these valleys have been ancient routes for traders and travelers between India and Tibet. The local culture and religion of Spiti is heavily influenced by Tibetan Buddhism. The high altitude mountain passes of Rohtang and Kunzum that you will cross on the way to Spiti will take your breath away. The valley opens for only a small time window during the year because of extreme weather. Summer comes with bright sunlight and emerald green Pin and Spiti rivers. Once the winter sets in post September, not only animals but also humans go in hibernation as the temperature plummets below 20 degrees below zero.<br/>We not only take you through the stunning landscapes that will make you skip heartbeats, we will also give you a very local experience of staying with families and storytelling about the Folk Tales. You go as a tourist but come back having formed a deep relationship with the place and its people.<br/><br/>About us: We come from diverse background of travel writing, photography, social sector and corporate experience. We are well travelled in India, and understand the villages, its people, and the grass root issues of our country well. Therefore the trips are designed to directly provide environmental, economic and social benefit to the local community. Hope to see you in India soon.",

After taking a flight from Delhi to Nagpur, and then a two hour transfer by car or minibus, you arrive at this wonderfully remote park that is well off the normal tourist tiger trail. The name of this tiger watching terrain comes from the indigenous tribe’s language, as Tadoba was a deity worshipped by them. Indeed, the indigenous people still live in this region and, having been stewards of it for generations. It is fitting, therefore, that this responsible tiger watching holiday ensures that it supports local conservation initiatives, as well as the economy.

We begin by ascending to Amer Fort, a majestic hilltop stronghold constructed by the Kachwaha dynasty under Man Singh’s rule, which rises above a lake a few miles from the main city. This fortress once served as the Kachwaha dynasty’s seat before their capital relocated to Jaipur. Next, delve into the architectural marvel of the City Palace, a fusion of Rajasthani and Mughal styles and the ancestral residence of the Kachwaha Rajput clan. Our tour continues to the Jantar Mantar, an ancient solar observatory housing impressive astronomical instruments that remain remarkably accurate. As we drive past the Hawa Mahal (Palace of Winds), marvel at its intricate pink sandstone facade designed as a discreet viewing area for the royal women during street festivities. We conclude the day by exploring the vibrant local market within Jaipur’s historic walled city, where you can discover handicrafts, textiles, and traditional Rajasthani delights.

Once a royal hunting ground, the reserve was set up by Project Tiger in 1973, a government-backed conservation scheme, and is now home to nearly 90 tigers, plus plenty of other wildlife, including wild boars, langurs, crocodiles and more than 300 bird species. To increase our chances of spotting the elusive tiger, we have two game drives today, one in the morning and another in the afternoon, with each taking three to four hours. Each vehicle is also joined by a Forest Guard, who are part of a national park initiative to generate employment for the nearby villages. They are skilled spotters and trackers so, though their English is sometimes very limited, they greatly improve the experience.

Beneath honking traffic, building sites and crowds, it’s a city humming with cultural life, both classical and contemporary. We’ve included an evening of Carnatic storytelling to cover the classical (Chennai is a repository of Tamil culture, one of the oldest continuous cultures in the world), while a morning walking tour on day two should take care of the contemporary: from chic art galleries to hipster coffee shops and Marina Beach. You won’t be here long, but a taste of Chennai makes an exuberant contrast to the ancient temple towns you’re about to discover.

Stop along the way to explore seaside Mahabalipuram, famous for its monolithic rock-cut temples, before arriving at ‘Pondy’ – where the French ruled for three centuries, leaving behind pâtisseries, crayon-bright townhouses and Catholic churches. Over the course of just two days, you’ll go from skyscrapers to thousand-year-old World Heritage carvings, to sipping coffee in colonial courtyards, with a visit to India’s most famous ashram thrown in. It’s a wonderful snapshot of Tamil Nadu’s sheer variety and depth of history. Highlights • Take a guided tour of Mahabalipuram, a little seaside town with outstanding Pallava-era rock carvings – including a visit to a sculpture workshop • Visit Auroville ashram to learn about this experimental community, founded in the late 1960s on sustainable principles • Understand the complex history of Pondicherry on a storytelling heritage walk through its French, Tamil and Muslim quarters."

This is one of the holiest pilgrimage destinations in India, with thousands of temples and monasteries scattered throughout the countryside. But the real joy of a visit here isn’t ancient architecture so much as the chance to immerse yourself in rural life. Bullocks pull wagons along dirt roads between betel plantations, locals gather at the mill to have their grain ground into flour, and brickmakers mould and bake bricks using age-old methods. It’s a wonderfully friendly, timeless atmosphere – and worlds away from anything you’ve experienced yet in Tamil Nadu. Highlights • Stay in a cottage modelled after a traditional Tamil home, surrounded by coconut groves and gardens full of peacocks • Take a tour of the Kumbakonam countryside, visiting millers, silk weavers, and brick makers • Stop in at another World Heritage temple, built in the 12th century by Chola emperor Rajaraja II, on your way from Pondicherry."

Today, it’s dotted with thousands of abandoned (or near-abandoned) mansions – some of them staggeringly ostentatious. These ghostly edifices are Chettinad’s primary draw, but a tour of the region will uncover more rural culture: Chola-style temples, handmade tile workshops, a women’s snack-making cooperative and a vibrant local market. Staying at a restored mansion, with an outdoor pool and bougainvillea-fringed garden, is the cherry on the cake. Highlights • Stop in at Thanjavur on your way to Chettinad for a tour of its World Heritage temple and thriving crafts workshops • See Chettiar mansions and palaces decked out in Burmese teak, Belgian mirrors, Venetian glass chandeliers and British wrought ironmongery • Take a guided visit to Chettinad market and sample some of the region’s world-renowned cuisine."

Though its temples top most must-see lists (with the 14 brilliantly coloured gopurams of Meenakshi deservedly at number one), the markets are our favourite part of Madurai. Sprawling across the city, buzzing all night, and overflowing with everything from jasmine flowers to dried chillies, they’re the reason this is called the ‘city that never sleeps’. Highlights • Go antiques shopping at the market in Karaikudi, on your way to Madurai from Chettinad • Visit Meenakshi for the nightly putting-to-bed ceremony, when the temple’s idols are sent off to sleep amid music, dance and devotions • Experience Madurai’s exceptional street food scene on an evening food trail with a local guide."

Nothing could be further from what you’ve seen so far in Tamil Nadu, and it’s a blissfully cool and pleasant place to relax for a day and amble through the plantations, spotting exotic birds and stopping in for tea tasting at the local factory. Highlights • Take in the spectacular views on the drive from Tamil Nadu into Kerala • Relax in a hammock or by the pool at beautiful Windermere Tea Estate • Go for guided walks through the local plantations, meeting tea pickers, touring the processing plant, and tasting the final product at the Tea Tales Café."

Among the many noteworthy buildings is the five-storey Panch Mahal, probably used as a pleasure pavilion for the ladies of the harem. In the centre of the courtyard is the pachisi board, where the emperor played a game much like chess but using slaves as pieces. Perhaps the finest structure of all is the Diwan-i-Khas (Hall of Private Audience), with its lotus-shaped carved central pillar. Leaving Fatehpur Sikri behind us, we'll drive to Chand Baori stepwell. Constructed more than 1,000 years ago, the stepwell is the equivalent of a modern-day water storage unit, built to provide water year-round. Although it's no longer used today, the perfect symmetry of the structure, with its hundreds of slanted steps, is a beauty to marvel at. Finally, we'll make our way to today's final stop, Kalakho.

The tiger population – which currently numbers around 500 – has been affected by poaching in recent years but the huge abundance of animals makes the game drives a memorable experience.

    "generalInfo": "The itinerary for this nine day tiger watching holiday with Indian wildlife experts has been crafted in a way that makes the most of every opportunity possible to see not only the magnificent tigers of Madhya Pradesh state and, in particular Kanha National Park and Bandhavgarh National Park, but also a plethora of other wildlife. Plus the guides on this trip are all expert naturalists from the region, who will share all their knowledge and passion for conservation while on the tiger safari with you.<br/><br/>After a sleeper train journey from Delhi, your first safari experience is in Bandhavgarh National Park, celebrated as the place where the rare white tigers were captured for the Maharaja of Rewa, the last one thought to have been seized in the mid 1990’s. Today it is an extraordinary arid landscape, where a 2000 year old ruined fort provides dramatic rocky terrain, surrounded by caves and chasms for tiger to roam. As well as the park’s other wild residents, with mammals and reptiles ranging from monkeys to mongoose, leopard to lizards, snakes to sambar. As well as 138 species of resident birds, and flocks of many other migratory ones passing through too. Kanha National Park proffers an eclectic mix of habitats over its almost 2000 sq. km of grassy plateaus, open plains and resplendent Shorea robusta or sal forests. All perfect terrain for tiger as well as the endangered and exquisite Barasingha Deer.<br/><br/>A large part of Kanha National Park also falls into the domain of Kanha Tiger Reserve, an important conservation initiative from the 1970’s led by Project Tiger. Kanha is also famous for being the first place where leading biologist and conservationist, George Shaller, carried out the first scientific research into tigers in the 1960’s. Today there are approximately one hundred tiger here, as well as leopard, wild dogs, langur monkeys, chital, sambhar and mongoose. This tiger watching holiday includes jungle accommodation, all meals, safaris and expert naturalist guide.<br/><br/> Note: An extension to see Taj Mahal at Agra is available.<br/>",

    "generalInfo": "This tour is a unique combination of India’s wildlife. We will be visiting Sunderbans, a UNESCO World Heritage Site to see its famous swimming tigers, as well as Kaziranga National Park for rhinos.  Your first stop is Kaziranga NP, one of the world’s beacons of conservation, having successfully protected its great one horned rhinos, and now home to two thirds of the world’s population of them. With over 2,400 of them today in the park, rhino safaris here are second to none. The park is also a tiger reserve and, as if that isn’t enough, other animals that you will be able to look out for on your morning and evening game safaris here include elephants, water buffalo and superb birdlife. <br/><br/>In contrast, your time spent in the Sunderbans, in the state of West Bengal and accessed by an internal flight to Calcutta and onward transfer to Sonakhali, is all about water. This UNESCO World Heritage Site recognises the importance of this vast wetland of estuarine forests, mangroves and maze of rivers around the Ganga delta. On two different river cruises you will have chances to spot creatures ranging from crocodiles to chitals, wild boar to Olive Ridley turtles. The birdlife is sublime too, with kingfishers, ibis, herons and storks dipping and diving all around and, last but not least, this is home to the largest population of Bengal tigers. <br/><br/>A tailor made itinerary to suit your interests, many of our guests often add on Kanha National Park to the trip, another haven for tigers. Or else, for a cultural highlight, we can organise a trip to Agra to see the Taj Mahal. <br/><br/>We recommend the best time to go wildlife watching for tigers and rhinos is between October and April.<br/>",

This tour of tribes of Arunachal Pradesh can be customized according to your preference to include experiences like wildlife, history, village life, crafts, culinary and more. You can also choose to add other excursions like Kolkata, Meghalaya, Kaziranga national park, Majuli island, Delhi, Agra &amp; Varanasi to this tour. Your preferences can be included the way you want and according to your budget.<br/>**<br/>Best time for Arunachal Pradesh: October - April<br/>**<br/><br/>Arunachal Pradesh is one of the most densely forested states of India where a large number of tribes live. Some of the main tribes are Adi, Galo, Apatani, Nyishi, Hill Miri. Apart from these, there are many sub-tribes under each of these which have further clans under them. Each of these tribes live in harmony with nature and have their own unique dresses, cuisine, dances, songs, festivals, marriage rituals and customs. Some of these tribes like Apatani are primarily agrarian whereas others like Tagin and Adi have been fierce warriors. Their food, dances and songs are influenced by their lifestyle and history.<br/><br/>Although Arunachal Pradesh is connected to other parts of India and a lot of people now travel to other cities for jobs, the natives still live their traditional lives. This tour also provides access to alternate income for the locals which helps in preserving their culture. We will talk more about that in Responsible Travel section below.<br/><br/>This is not meant to be only a sightseeing tour. It is rather an immersive experience where you can participate in daily life of the tribes through various activities designed for you. We also recommend that you take this journey slow and spend ample leisure time soaking in the nature and life of Arunachal Pradesh.<br/><br/>About Us: We come from diverse background of travel writing, photography, social development sector and corporate experience.

We drive through the smooth highways for another 60 km before embarking on a bumpy ride on old mountain roads that head to Ziro. Arunachal Pradesh is sparsely populated as compared to other states of North East or Northern India. Therefore you may often find yourself travelling through pristine rain forests without any sign of human habitation. Ziro valley is a sprawling expanse of green and golden rice fields. Accordingly to a local folklore, the mountain which lord Hanuman extracted for Sanjeevani plant once existed over Ziro valley. Locals say that Ziro valley was formed because a huge mountain was scooped off from the earth by Lord Hanuman. To prove this folklore, they insist that medicinal plants found in Ziro valley that got carried away with the mountain are found in southern Meghalaya also. This is because part of the mud and plants from the mountain which Lord Hanuman was carrying fell off in Meghalaya on its way to Sri Lanka. While you stay in Ziro, know about many such interesting stories. Spend the next few days in Ziro relaxing in your accommodation. Go with us on short trails of Apatani tribal villages and see how they live in harmony with nature. Taste local food and learn to cook it. You may also choose to participate in farming depending upon the season or visit the pisciculture farm. Discover the unique stories behind facial tattoos and wooden nose plugs of Apatani women. Apatani people are followers of Donyi-Polo religious practices, which is about worshipping Sun (Donyi) and the Moon (Polo). See how this is practiced in daily life. Apart from the activities, we also recommend that you spend ample leisure time soaking in the natural beauty of Ziro valley and talking to locals."

However, locals say that Tagin is the only tribe which has traditionally comprised of warriors, and are not afraid of Nyishi people. After a long drive from Ziro winding through the remote mountains, arrive at Daporijo by evening. Check-in your hotel and relax for the day. Spend the next full day exploring the small Tagin villages. Visit the houses of Tagin people and see how animals play an important part in their life.

You may also visit the local fruit, vegetable and meat markets that are mostly run by women. The vegetables and spices found in this part of India are very different. Walk with us into a friendly market with smiling faces where you can even sit and have a chat with anyone of the ladies."

    "generalInfo": "Nestled in West-central India, the lure of the Tiger at Tadoba and the fascinating undulating landscape at Pench is what drew us here many years ago in the pursuit of our love of photographing the stunning diversity of wildlife and game in what has come to be among the list of India’s best managed wildlife reserves on the sub-continent. <br/><br/>The etymology of Tadoba comes from the amalgamation of the tribal God Taru and the Andhari river that serves as the reserve’s water vein, filling it’s fresh water lakes during the brutal summer months. <br/><br/>Situated in the western state of Maharashtra, Tadoba’s wildlife fringes the local Gond tribal settlements around the region of Chandrapur. Traditional farmers and basket weavers, these tribes dwell in traditional village homes. Over the years we’ve cultivated a support system with these communities where we share with travellers what they do and how they carry on their process of living. We attempt to give back for our footprint in the region by supporting these communities by sourcing their produce and enlightening travellers about their culture and heritage. <br/><br/>It’s important to not just understand the rich bio-diversity of the park but also be made aware of the social conservation that inherently exists amongst these villages and their efforts in establishing a stable co-existence, especially within such close proximity, between man and wildlife in this region. <br/><br/>Pench on the other hand is situated in slightly hillier terrain over the border of Maharashtra and into the state of Madhya Pradesh in Central India.<br/><br/>Serving as an inspiration for Rudyard Kipling’s Jungle Book as home to Mowgli, it’s easy to see why Sir David Attenborough described Pench as the most appropriate location for documenting the behavior of Tigers in the wild. <br/><br/>Spread over an area of 750 square kilometres, Pench’s undulating terrain makes for a fascinating mix of plant species, rock caves and a fantastic diversity in woodland bird species. <br/><br/>But again, Pench is not just about the Tiger. In fact the excitement in pursuing unique species such as the four-horned Antelopes, wild dog packs, the elusive Leopards and the rather sly Indian Jackals. <br/><br/>With some of the best managed and regulated game drives within national Parks in India, the experience in Pench is of anticipation, intrigue and the satisfaction of being amidst nature in it’s best preserved state.",

    "tourName": "Wildlife holiday in North East India",
    "placesVisited": "",
    "generalInfo": "Eastern India is one of the most biodiverse areas of the world; an area rich in forests, river systems and grasslands all bursting with wildlife. Some iconic and crictically endangered such as tigers, Asiatic elephants, Indian one-horned rhinos and others smaller and regionally endemic such as sunbirds, frogs and primates like Gee's golden langur and western Hoolock gibbon. <br/><br/>This tour explores some of the most famous and best wildlife watching locations in north-east India. These include the vast mangrove wetland ecosystms of the Sunderbans, the lush grasslands of Kaziranga and Manas as well as the seldom visited forests of Hoolongopar Gibbon Sanctuary. <br/><br/>For anyone interested in exploring some of India’s wildest and most remote national this is the tour for you.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/><br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching tours and safari holidays all over the world, specialising in the Indian subcontinent and of course the wonderful and diverse country of India. Whilst most wildlife watchers who visit India spend time in the famous tiger reserves of the central plains or maybe the sub-Himalayan parks of the north west and Western Ghats in the south. But these ecosystems and incredible wildlife are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the wildlife that India has to offer. <br/><br/>This tour explores some of the lesser known parks and takes you into the deepest parts of India’s north eastern rainforests, mangroves and grasslands . All of this whilst escorted by our very own expert zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) coupled with local guides. Of course there is one species in particular that dominates everyone’s thoughts and dreams when they think of an Indian safari and that is the beautiful tiger. <br/><br/>Whilst there are chances of seeing tigers here we take time to showcase the tiger’s ecosystem in full and try and find as many other animals that share the forests with tigers. We also offer a few different ways of exploring the parks, so however you like to travel through the tiger’s habitat we have the tour for you, whether you want to drive around in your own jeep, walk through the forests and grasslands tracking the elusive big cat or even via a boat or canoe in the water ways of the Sundarbans. <br/><br/>One of the reasons why our safaris of India are unique is that our background (as a company) is from a scientific and zoological standpoint and so have a great network of colleagues and contacts all over the world who are the people on the front line in search of the best new locations for wildlife watching in the wild. All of these reasons and many more make us experts in arranging and guiding safaris and are able to tailor a Indian safaris to any location to try to find them that you request. All you have to do is to get in touch with us and tell us your budget and your group size and where you would like to go on safari.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner - where mentioned in the itinerary). There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned vehicles with an excellent local driver for all transfers. We include internal flights where ever possible on all our Indian safaris. We use two brilliant full time guides; first a professional zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) will escort you on all your excursions and also a very knowledgeable English speaking local guide at each national park. Your zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) escort is an expert in mammal biology, ecology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. Your zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) escort has spent time studying and working with different species all over the world and he has years of experience guiding throughout most of India’s national parks. We also use local expert guides with decades of experience on all our Indian safaris. We also include all jeep safaris, guided walks, canoe safaris, boat-trips, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more individual safaris into national parks per tour than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the national parks to search for tigers and other wildlife. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on tigers and other Indian wildlife which are available to watch throughout the tour.<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>March and April is the dry season and best for wildlife. For wildlife watching in southern India we recommend visiting during March and April (this is the best overall game viewing in the Indian Subcontinent’s main tiger reserves and national parks). This is towards the end of the hot dry season and offers the best chances of seeing wildlife as the hotter and drier it gets the more the wildlife aggregate around waterholes as well as there being less vegetation blocking the view. <br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>•\tAll of our Indian safaris are guided by a local naturalist guides, drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife your watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>•\tWe use camera traps (where available) which will increase the chances of getting close up pictures and movies of tigers and other rare nocturnal wildlife.<br/>•\tDuring this tour we explore various national parks and wildlife sanctuaries (Sundarbans, Kaziranga, Manas and Hoolongapor Gibbon Sanctuary) which will give you a very good overview of the wild Eastern forests of India.<br/>•\tTravel into wonderful and world's largest mangrove forest of the Sundarbans in search of tigers, river dolphins and enormous slat-water crocodiles.<br/>•\tBy joining one of our Indian safaris you will have an overall wildlife experience as we are determined to showcase all of the wildlife of the parks we visit (not just tigers), you will not feel like a passenger in a rally and bounce all over the place in pursuit of tigers; we make sure all our Indian safaris are relaxed and environmentally friendly experiences. In fact the majority of tiger sightings that we enjoy in India are of tigers that our jeep and guides have found (as opposed to other operators who wait for a tiger to be seen and then stake out the waterhole surrounded by dozens of other jeeps), we always investigate any suspicious behaviour exhibited by their prey and usually find tigers by watching the deer and monkey behaviour as they change from relaxed to agitated when a predator is spotted.<br/>•\tWe have explored all the areas we visit in depth and have found the best and most conveniently located accommodations to stay in whilst searching out wildlife in isolated and remote places. Including some of the best and most ecologically friendly lodges in all of India.<br/>•\tWe are a member of Tour Operators for Tigers (TOFT) and we make sure that all of our tiger safaris run by their code of practice and we also make sure that all the accommodation we use is audited by TOFT to make sure of sustainable practices.<br/>•\tAll the above reasons give this our tiger tours and general wildlife holidays of India a great success rate of seeing tigers (100% in Bandhavgarh and close to 50% for this tour, which is very good considering the dense forests and vastness of the protected areas). <br/>•\tWe have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout the India and are able to find and observe species that are difficult to find or overlooked sometimes such as Indian leopards, Asiatic elephants, water buffalo, sloth bears, jungle cats, dhole, gaur and hundreds other endangered, rare or endemic species throughout the tigers current distribution. <br/>•\tDue to our greta network of guides and researchers throughout India we are able to organise tailor made safari to anywhere in India, whether it is Bandhavgarh, Kanha, Periyar, Kaziranga, Corbett, Ramthambore, Satpura, Tadoba, and many other wildlife watching locations you want to visit we can arrange it. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari holiday to India.<br/>•\tUnlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour takes you to the eastern states of Bengal and Assam all from the city of Kolkata where you will enter and leave India. The parks visited include the Sundarbans, Kaziranga, Assam and Hoolongapor Gibbon Sanctuary. <br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The fitness level required for this safari holiday is not very high. The vast majority of the activities are conducted from vehicles so no fitness is required, but there is some walking involved. The walking is all done at a leisurely pace with regular breaks, anyone who is used to mild hiking will find this easy.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 Years Old",

The place is full of thick forests with creepers and undergrowth and here one might see the Red Headed Trogon, Snowy Browed Flycatcher, Ferruginous Flycatcher, Lesser Shortwing, Grey Bellied Tesia, Slaty Headed Tesia and many other species of birds. After the morning gibbon watching and birding you will be stopping at a place inside the sanctuary for the packed lunch. After lunch you will continue searching forest for wildlife, including one of the only ape known from the Subcontinent. We have a choice of accommodation whilst exploring the Hoolongapor Gibbon Sanctuary, firstly for anyone interested in seeing the rare and elusive Bengal slow loris there is a single government run guest house (Forest Rest House) in fairly livable condition inside the forest – those interested to see the Slow Loris will need to spend the night inside the sanctuary. Where after dinner a short walk for about an hour might reveal a Loris. However the decision regarding the stay has to be done prior to coming at Gibbon and the permission for the night walk has to be secured from the authorities – so we would need to know at the time of booking. The best time for the Loris is February – though it is sighted in other months too. For anyone not wanting to stay here we will leave the sanctuary towards sundown and drive back to other accommodation. (all meals included today)"

Other species are Malayan Giant Squirrel, Hoary Bellied Squirrel, Slow Loris, Capped Langur, Asiatic Elephant, Wild Boar and with luck a Leopard Cat. There is a wealth of bird life from the reserve too, species of note include Longtailed Broadbill, Silver Eared Mesia, Speckled and Rufous Piculet and several species of hornbills and with a bit of luck even the Hooded Pitta.

You will check in quickly and then hop on to your jeeps for the safari.

Today you will find yourself outside of Cochin, drifting away from the shores and winding through the mountains that are lush with greenery, looking as though they have been draped over with plantations and trees in vibrant, impossible color. The warmth of the beaches has given way to the cool mountain air that brushes along the leaves of the largest tea-growing region in southern India. The scent of musky earth rises along the rolling hills that peak just above the low-lying clouds. When you come to your hotel you could sip a cup of freshly brewed tea and stare out over the illustrious landscape, settling in nicely to the countryside."

Within the early light of day you can walk along the stretch of plantations that reach over what feels like the entirety of the region, watching local women in lavish blues and reds harvesting fresh leaves between the endless rows of crops. The aromatics are soon blended into the sounds of rushing waterfalls as you pass the whitewater of the falls meandering down the mountainside of the Western Ghats. Whether you slip a fresh leaf into your mouth to taste the herbal blossom or sip on some of the finest tea in India, grown, blended, and brewed for the best flavor, your day will take you through and into a tranquil lifestyle filled with the majesty of the landscape and the delicate flavors of culture."

After your time settling in to your accommodation you will enjoy a boat ride along the manmade lake at Thekkady. The lake’s banks are surrounded by vivacious forest and marvelous mountains, adding specks of greenery to the skyline. The quiet trickle of the water turns into a distant splash as the skipper points out a herd of elephants bathing in the warmth of the afternoon sun. As they parade from the water onto the banks you can see their lumbering gait swaying back and forth in focused steps, while their graceful and regal aura only fades with their disappearance into the forest."

The animals tend to be most active in the cool air of the early morning as you venture into the mixture of forest and savannah, making your way above the tall grass and beneath the taller trees. You can hear the excited hooting of the lion-tailed macaques, their faces framed by hair that resembles a lion’s mane. One of the biggest draws and breathtaking sights is when you look just beyond the thin strands of collective grass and witness that sharp teeth of a yawning tiger. The largest of cat the family, the golden orange and black stripes of the feline are mesmerizing, even as it lazes and strolls through the grass, indifferent to your arrival; though you will not be indifferent to the tiger’s presence. Whether elephants, foxes, monkeys, or tigers, there is something majestic about seeing an animal in its natural habitat living the life it was meant to."

The gardens are manicured alongside the cobblestone pathways that lead to the entrance doors. When you step inside you come to an interior that is as opulent as the exterior. A large dome is raised at the center, empty of pulpits and images of any kind. Natural light beams in from the latticed window at the top of the dome which resembles a flower.

The shops and customers are wrapped in historic character. You notice the rainbow of color that beams from shops selling saris while other stores almost overflow with books. You could even find the wholesale cloth and stationary markets somewhat hidden down the lanes. At Humayun’s Tomb you will find the Mughal Emperor’s 16th century Persian design captivating. The white and red marble architecture radiates in the sunlight surrounded by manicured gardens before the small stairs that lead to the main deck.

The center bulbous dome is reminiscent of Mughal architecture and was constructed for Queen Mumtaz Mahal in the 17th century. The main archway at the center is inlaid with precious tones in floral patterns. There is an effortless ambiance of excitement and serenity along the cool platform, where people stand in awe of the stunning design, impeccable construction, and unparalleled dedication that Shah Jahan had for his third wife.

Indian bison graze in the tall grass that reaches as high as the bison itself. The longer you search the more likely it is that your will guide stop the vehicle, point into the brush, and show you the elegant stride of the tiger skulking beneath the towering sal trees. Their orange fur is streaked with black lines, and when they look your direction assessing whether you are a threat or not, their eyes glint with fierce yellow, adding to their unique and majestic appearance. In the afternoon you will transfer to Alwar, arriving before dusk.

After breakfast, you come to the Amer Fort and see the walls rising to powerful heights and casting a shadow over Maota Lake. The pathway that leads to the main gate winds up the hillside. The complex was constructed in the 16th century using a combination of sandstone and marble. Imposing yet elegant gates divide the four main sections of the fort. Enter through the Sun Gate to find the first main courtyard. The open plaza was once used as a space for victory parties when triumphant armies returned. The upper walkways are lined with latticed windows where the royal women would watch the procession while still hidden from view. The grand arch at the gate’s center was large enough for elephants to enter through. The grandeur of the complex is apparent in the exceptional design and the preserved extravagances of the royal residences, from gold-lined mirrors to the fine detail of the magic flower fresco in the Mirror Palace. Later in the day you will leave the Pink City behind and visit the abandoned city of Fatehpur Sikri en route to Agra."

The architectural elements of Islamic, Persian, Ottoman, and Indian styles are apparent in the design and décor. The interior chamber is decorated with semiprecious gemstones that help catch the sun and were arranged to look like twirling vines and flowers."

Layers of orange spread across the sky. The city dates back to the 11th century and continues to be the holiest of the seven sacred cities in Hinduism and Jainism. The ochre buildings decorate the riverbanks. The ghats are allocated for specific uses. You can see an early gathering of women already washing clothes. Farther downriver a man slowly pours water over his head and washes. Shallow wooden boats are sporadic, each one filled with fishermen ready for the day’s catch. A group of people prays in the early light and you know that this is a humbling and charming moment."

After breakfast you will venture out into the city to find the charm and historic culture that has captivated both visitors and locals alike. The Lotus Temple is a sensational Baha’i religious sight that resembles a large lotus flower with 27 constructed flower petals made of marble and appearing as though the building will blossom at any moment. Walking to the temple takes you through an expanse of manicured gardens that guide you to the welcoming doors beneath the sacred flower. When you step inside the sanctuary you are greeted by an overwhelming silence that you can swear echoes within the domed marble, shimmering with natural light and glowing in a way you imagine the inside of a lotus would. The Qutub Minar looms over the remains of crumbling structures, reaching over 215 feet. The minaret is textured with colors of sandstone and tiers that bring a constricting curvature with protruding circles that resemble burgeoning collars. The tower was built in the 12th century and is the second tallest minaret in the country, filled with numerous inscriptions in both Arabic and Nagari. As you make your way closer to the tower it is not just the combination of history and architecture of the tower that is easy to marvel at but the surrounding collection of the ruins, collected and spread over a small area, which creates the dramatic atmosphere that calls to you."

The pathways of Amer Fort wind up the mountainside like a collection of walled mazes leading to a grandly designed palace at the summit made of sandstone and marble. You make your way up the serpentine staircase and step into the courtyard that almost whisks you back in time; the façade of Ganesh Pol entrance continues to glisten green and gold in the sunlight, while the fortress overlooks the hillside and Maota Lake below. The women of the royal family used to watch processions and functions without jeopardizing their virtue by viewing the people from the lattice windows above the entrance. The iconic image of the city is the Hawa Mahal, “Palace of Winds,” known for its high screen wall built for the royal household so that the royal women could observe the festivities without being seen, and gives credence to the Pink City’s name having been made of sandstone that glows red and pink. The five-story pyramid is textured with more latticed windows that bring a unique, detailed look of semi-octagonal spaces. The bustle of the city continues to pass below the façade as it once did at the end of the 18th century when the structure was built, filling the skyline with 953 small windows. The palace is more no less than a show of detailed craftsmanship that gives grace and color to the vibrant city."

        "description": "The morning over Mysore comes with the delicious aroma of masala dosa, similar to an Indian crepe, which is delightfully crispy and fluffy at the same time. Your guide meets you at your hotel and takes you on an early tour of the Mysore Palace. The structure was rebuilt in 1912 and remains one of the grandest examples of India’s royalty. When you come to the palace through the main entrance you find an incredible tripartite gateway. The palace itself supports a five-story tower that stands 145 feet. The sensational exterior is matched by the lavish interior. Step through the ornate rosewood doorway and into the Abavilasa where the king held private audiences. The doorway is inlaid with ivory and the columns are gilded beneath the stained glass ceilings. The elegant design and the lavish décor are nothing less than inspiring. After your tour of the palace you will venture onward to the Kabini Forest Reserve. When you come to the river you will board a boat and begin your afternoon river cruise. You can see locals paddling through the water on coracles. They smile and wave with sincere excitement. The water is calm. There is a long stretch of grassland between the riverbanks and the lush forest. At the edge of the tree line you see a large fluffy animal making its way to the water. Your guide tells you that it’s a sloth bear. Their arms are lankier and their hair is shaggier than a black bear and they can weigh up to 290 pounds. Their long snout sniffs at the air. You continue to drift down the river but can’t stop watching the animal lumber closer to the water."

When breakfast ends your early morning guide, an elephant, meets you. You climb atop the elephant and begin to explore the surrounding prairie along the Kabini riverbank. Every step the elephant takes is controlled and calculated. You sit in a large box on the elephants back a sway with every step. The birdlife is vivacious in the canopy, chirping and soaring through the open sky before returning to the comfort of the trees. In the afternoon you say goodbye to your elephant and continue deeper into the expansive jungle of Nagarhole National Park. The park extends over 247 square miles and is home to many endangered species, such as the tiger. Leopards dangle their limbs off of tree branches. Bison graze on the luminous grass. As you spend the day looking through the towering trees you spot a tiger’s orange glow. The tiger steps in long and slow strides and you can see the black stripes marking its back. The moment feels like slow motion, giving you more time to take in the largest of the big cat family; they can grow to over 10 feet long and weigh over 500 pounds. In the tiger’s elegant presence you don’t think about its size, you only think about its beauty."

You begin the day with an early morning game drive once more around Nagarhole National Park. The wildlife is most active in the cool air of the early daylight before the sunlight creates a warmer afternoon. Your guide takes you through the diverse grounds of the park, from floodplains to forestry. Each movement forward is another chance to see the majestic fauna in a natural and undisturbed habitat. Deer stroll along the meadow. Their fur is decorated with white spots that look like snowflakes. You see a collection of wild boar speed into the brush. Just as you think you may not find any more wildlife in the beauty of the emerald trees, you spot a troop of elephants in the distance. They step cautiously near the riverbank and dip their trunks to the water. After breakfast you will make your way to Fringe Ford. The plantation stretches over 520 acres and shares borders with both the Wyanad and Tholpetty wildlife sanctuaries. The surrounding Wyanad Mountain Range rolls up to 6,300 feet above sea level. The olive and teal trees shine in the wide sweeping sunlight. A cozy fire flickers in the warm colors of the dwindling day. In the quiet solitude of the plantation you find the scenery comforting, the luxuries soothing, and the location unlike anywhere you have ever seen."

The day is at your leisure, meant for you to enjoy however you wish. You can set out along one of the plantation’s innumerable trails that lead into the hillsides and watch the golden light seep through the foliage. Soon you will hear the trickle of water. Twenty-seven separate streams careen through the forest; some of them eventually become waterfalls. The trickle becomes a thunder.

The cinnamon and fennel scent of chai is luscious, while the chapatti , baked flatbread, are fresh, warm, and soft. After breakfast you will venture to Elephanta Island, known for the magnificent caves that were carved into temples during the mid-fifth to sixth-centuries. The high cliffs give way to stone pillars etched out of the rock’s base, chiseled and refined beneath a series of different precipices, from full stone to those overrun with fields. Once inside, the earthen scent and cool temperature adds to the atmosphere of the surrounding reliefs. Images of Shiva protrude from the walls in various sizes, bringing to light the god as creator, protector, and destroyer eternally etched into stone, hidden from the elements. Later in the afternoon you will meander through the monuments of Mumbai, from the Hanging Gardens to Marine Drive, where you can see the uniqueness of the Parsi “Towers of Silence,” a 19th century engraving representing the Zoroastrian religion meant to be a final resting place."

As you are met at the airport you may think you have already come to Agra, noticing the large white domes of the Taj Mahal; however, the replica was built in 1679 to stunning response but less grandeur. You can almost feel the famous silk of the city draping through the air and gliding across your skin as you notice the elegant flow of Paithani and Hamroo saris. Eighteen miles north of the city will bring you to the Ellora Caves, displaying the epitome of rock architecture dating back to the fifth-century all the way to the 10th with both Buddhist and Hindu origins. Strewn across a relatively flat area of the Western Ghats Mountain Range, the temples are carved into the rock, including Cave 10. Here you can find The Buddhist Carpenter’s Cave, with its arched columns and vaulted roofs textured with ribs to imitate wooden beams while standing over a depiction of a seated Buddha."

Walking along the vast greenery you can barely see the architecture displayed through the forest, it looks like limestone mountains peaking through the canopy. The present scent of fallen rain and wet stone brings fresh life to the day. When you enter the prayer hall your breath literally leaves your body, amazed by the power and elegance that people have made out of a cave, with its ribbed, vaulted ceilings towering over thick, smooth pillars. The tremendous artistry is not just in the architecture but the reliefs that line the walls. Where many children have dreamed of being Indiana Jones and happening upon a lost world hidden within the earth, you are embodying such a discovery here, where images of gods and myths are carved and painted onto the walls in detail difficult to create in stone and in colors that continue to inspire with their vibrancy. You will arrive at the airport in the afternoon and quickly find yourself settling into India’s capital city of Delhi."

The Red Fort is a massive sandstone structure that stands over a lengthy manicured green field with adjacent cupolas at its gate rising over 54 feet high. The mixture of marble and sandstone gave power and force to the outer walls during the 17th century. The interior was once used to house embellished jewels and gold but even now you can still see the remnants of opulence around the frilled arches and sunken ponds meandering through the interior.

The fort and the palace inside dates back to the 11th century; however, the marvels of the palace in its current form dates back to the 16th century, as lavish and unadulterated as it can be. Follow an imposing stairway from the main courtyard that will take you through two lush silver doors where the texture from the raised relief catches the light and glows. Sitting above the doorway is an image of Ganesh carved from a single piece of coral. Every step through the palace, from the Hall of Public Audience to the maharaja’s apartment, brings another layer of history, another image of luxury, and another adventurous story for you to experience before returning to the city center and finding the latticed windows of the famous Hawa Mahal, the signature architectural image if Jaipur."

The imperial ghost city was constricted by Emperor Akbar and continues to shimmer the quintessential pink of Indian sandstone. What was once the short-lived capital of the Mughal Empire in the latter half of the16th century, it became desolate of empirical custom but continued to house the natural grandeur inherent in the architecture. Within the palace walls you can find the main courtyard where a splendid platform is raised over a pond, reached by bridges that extend over the waterway on either side of the square shaped podium. Cupolas rise over the walls offering terraced views over the empty squares and cityscape as the fabulous Hall of Private Audience is as majestic outside, with a large Moorish arch, as it is on the inside where a column rises into a blossoming textured sphere that helps support the structure. In the evening you will come to Agra where the luxuries of the city sit within the legendary shadow of the Taj Mahal."

Built in the 17th century for emperor Shah Jahan’s third wife, it has always been considered a “jewel of Muslim art in India.” The myth and majesty of the building stands within the manicured gardens and quiet early morning fountains. The reflection of the pristine structure blossoms in the long stretch of water before the platform. The vibrant pulse of the day winds through the pathways as the translucent marble captures the stark colors of sunrise, bringing the white stone to graceful orange and purple. The symmetry of the construction brings a uniform look and atmosphere, an image of regal elegance that surrounds everyone coming to pay homage to the spectacular artistry and magnificent arabesques.

Once on the Ganges River you can see where the true heart of the city lies, where women wash their clothing and men lather their bodies and bathe. Children swim in the wandering heat of the summer but you feel the drifting breeze sweep across your skin from the gentle speed of the boat. The stonework along the river harkens back to history, where the deep roots of the city lie. You will come to the Dhamekh Stupa in Sarnath just outside of Varanasi, the site where Buddha gave his first address after reaching enlightenment. The park is set aside from the energy of the city, embraced by tranquility and overlooked by the 132 foot high Dhamekh Stupa, decorated by fifth-century floral and geometric carvings. There is an endless source of spirituality in and around Varanasi, filled with pilgrims and color, where a lifetime of stress can be washed away in the scared waters of the river."

Lush, vibrant gardens flank the wide boulevard of Rajpath, the “King’s Way” and the blossoming flowers emulate the marvelous patterns and colors of the textiles local women wear. The grand boulevard leads from the India Gate to the Presidential Palace, and a 73-foot dome stands at the far edge of the wide street, in a grassy garden. Beneath the canopy sits the Royal Coat of Arms and an inscription dedicated to King George V, which reads “Rex Imperator,” or “King-Emperor.” The modern city of Delhi hosts luxurious shopping areas centered around the colonnaded facades of the city’s financial district known as Connaught Place. Boutique and designer shops continue to blend international style and Indian flair amid the top heritage structures of the city.

Long reflective pools stretch toward the platform of the celebrated marble edifice as the water mirrors the sparkling domes and spires that stretch into the sky. The mausoleum was constructed in the 16th century and was the first Mughal building erected using all marble. The symmetry is impeccable, and the pristine color of the façade emanates light. The central dome stands 115 feet tall, and it was meant to resemble a blossoming lotus. The entire complex was dedicated to Shah Jahan’s third wife reflecting the emperor’s eternal care and devotion. Semiprecious stones decorate the mausoleum’s interior, which are arranged in the shape of flower petals and vines. They capture the sunlight that peeks through the windows, which shimmer with grace and life. Each second near the Taj Mahal is a moment of discovery.

Today, the palace grounds remain elegant, and the rustic red of the walls will capture your attention. Diwan-i-Khas was the Hall of Private Audience, and it still retains the plain square exterior. The interior central pillar will draw your attention for good reason as the square base supports an octagonal pillar that is adorned with a geometric and floral design. It looks more like a centerpiece than a pillar. The 36 serpentine brackets at the center create an image of a stonework chandelier. After your exploration of the distinct capital city, you will continue onward to Jaipur, the famous Pink City of Rajasthan. The wide boulevards of the old city are remnants of an imperial past.

The royal women would watch the procession of marching armies or the morning boisterousness of the bazaars from behind the windows to preserve their modesty. This tradition emulates the mythical stories of maharajas and the mysterious women behind the curtain. The City Palace was built in the 18th century, and descendants of the royal family continue to reside in the Chandra Mahal. The Private Audience Hall is paved with marble tiles and is open to the outer courtyard. The wide arches, stone tiles, and open space create a cross breeze in the heat of summer.

        "description": "In the light of the desert beyond Bikaner you embark on your journey out of the city and onward to Jaisalmer, considered to be the Golden City of India. Once there it is impossible not to notice the towering fort that stands atop a hill in the city center. The rest of the homes, shops, restaurants, and hotels wrap around the fortress’s base. The fort looks as though it were made from the very sand that surrounds Jaisalmer, giving it that golden sheen in the afternoon light. 99 bastions encircle the twisting and turning lanes where shops are draped in spectacular embroideries. The 12th century construction is layered with three walls, from the solid stone blocks of the lowest bastions that were reinforced with loose rubble, to the inner walls where the Rajput once hurled oil and water onto their enemies. Around 3,000 people continue to reside within the honeycomb lanes. Children rush along the cobblestone and women sew beneath the translucent shade of stretching cloth. In the evening you can sit on the roof of your hotel and watch the fortress glow beneath the lively starlight of the clear desert sky."

Back in the city you find yourself strolling beneath the Patwa-ki-Haveli, the largest mansion in Jaisalmer. Its intricate stone placement divides its interior into five sections each dating back to the 19th century, evoking a richness of the past and connecting to the immaculate discoveries of the day."

When you enter the gardens you understand the words of the poet Rabindranath Tagore when he said the Taj Mahal was “a teardrop on the face of eternity.” The gardens are manicured and pure. The scent of pine and budding flowers is prevalent. The reflective pool almost points the way to the mausoleum. The marble captures the light and changes colors throughout the day. The sun casts a pink shadow over the site when sunset nears. The four minarets are 130 feet tall and add to the overall symmetry of the mausoleum’s design. The dome has remarkably rounded angles and stands 115 feet tall at its peak. The design is both elegant and staggering. Semi-precious stones decorate the interior gallery and catch the light that beams through the window.

Begin with part-fortress and part-palace, Agra Fort, a sandstone giant that glistens deep crimson in the fading afternoon light. All over Agra you’ll find sublime examples of Mughal architecture, many of them overlooked by tourists. Explore them with a guide and you’ll also get to know the architectural building blocks that gave rise to the Mughal ode to love."

Slowly the marble emerges from the sun’s shadow and at first it glistens red before the color softens and light dances transiently across the domes. Walk past the pools and get a little closer, admiring the sharpness of the Taj Mahal’s form. Calligraphic messages wrap around the monument, and they beckon you inside, where the architectural opulence comes as a surprise. Almost everyone has seen photos of the Taj Mahal, but few have considered consider how beautiful it must be on the inside. Take your time and enjoy the morning around this pre-eminent Mughal monument, before the afternoon takes you off the beaten path, with Persian mosques and Akbar’s Mausoleum among the highlights."

This city was the Mughal capital for a fleeting few years in the 16th century, but the royal town was eventually abandoned and left to the desert dust. Even today it feels like a ghost town, a showcase of architectural might that almost looks out of place. Persian and Hindu styles merge together and the more you walk around, the more you’ll get to discover. From here you continue across the ochre plains of Rajasthan to arrive in the Pink City for an afternoon in the markets. After the 16th-century you’re now in a city that brings history into today, which is exemplified by bazaars of cramped stalls and enigmatic smiles."

When you picture the city you come to the image of Hawa Mahal, the grand palace that almost looks like a large pink model of organ pipes, also giving the façade the name “Palace of Winds.” The marvelous color comes from the sandstone that lends the pink and red hues to the walls depending on the angle of the sun, and also gives Jaipur the name of its particular coloration. Built just before the 19th century in a style meant to imitate the crown of Krishna, the honeycomb texture houses 953 small latticed windows that were meant to allow cool air flow and, more importantly for the time, let women of the royal household view the street processions without being seen and risking their virtue. Traveling along the walls of the interior takes you to a wild world, one that seems so different but always close at hand, viewed in the romance of movies and books that have captured the imagination of millions worldwide. The courtyard carries the same hue as the façade, where a large square is sunken, perforated by a protruding platform surrounded by water. You can stand at the center of the palace, look out over the courtyard and even in the eternal bustle of the city, feel the peaceful nature for which the yard was originally constructed."

Founded in the 16th century as the capital of the Mughal Empire, the sandstone buildings offer shimmering red beneath the crescent blue sky, where both mirror the other’s emptiness. Each building, from the palace to the mosque was constructed with Persian principles but with Indian aggrandizements. The grandeur of the abandoned city is both beautiful and peculiar, with great cupolas and intricate pillars, and continuous manicured gardens within the palace. The over 162 feet high entrance gate is as welcoming as it is imposing, with a Moorish arch and domes making the red and off-white color stand out like clouds at sunset. In the late afternoon you will arrive in Agra, a city known for its industry but famous for its architecture. As the sun begins to set you will come to one of the Seven Wonders of the World, the Taj Mahal. The radiant white marble of the structure captures the colors of the sun that spread across the sky turning the lavish pearl into an ever-changing rainbow. Constructed in the 17th century as a mausoleum for Mughal emperor Shah Jahan’s third wife, it has become one of the most well-known and treasured buildings in the world. Within the strident colors you can see the detailed inscriptions that line the exterior and interior, beneath the domes and within the minarets.

Surrounding the temples is exquisite stonework that shows a storyboard of life displaying gods, warriors, and mythological animals from ages long ago. The carvings of Varaha shows Vishnu’s boar incarnation in an over four-foot high sandstone boar. The rising, detailed chedis of the temples are only half of the reverence for which the ruins are known, while the Kama Sutra carvings tout a legacy of artistry, ancient intrigue, and account for 10 percent of the overall artwork along the monuments wrapping around the outer and inner temple walls.

Chaumukha Mandir, known as the Four-Faced Temple, was constructed in the 15th century with milk-white marble. Twenty-nine halls and 80 domes come together to show the architect’s and funder’s devotion. It is easy to marvel at the work of artistry and the chiseled gods, where pillars are knotted with carvings that bring a calm and harmonious echo to the exquisite space. You continue to Kumbhalgarh and arrive in the evening with the unforgettable detail of each statue that lined the interior walls of the complex fresh in your mind. Kumbhalgarh is a remote fort that brings the romantic expectations of the Rajput era to life, where the traditions and culture can be seen enriched in the architecture of the fort. Dating back to the 15th century rising over 3,300 feet above sea level, the fort brings endless vistas of the blue sky and the mountain horizon. The walls run over 22 miles and protect 360 temples, some dating back to the second century BC. If the history and magnitude isn’t mesmerizing enough, the massive entrance gate, known as Ram Gate, is both bulbous and powerful, protecting a wall that is only second in size to the Great Wall of China."

The people have been known since the 15th century for their conservationist religion, standing for the preservation of animals and vegetation. The village highlights the diversity of the country, displaying the eclectic combination of people in a large and small expanse. The sect of Hindu follows 29 principles to live by which have helped them survive in the desert landscape outside of Jodhpur. Blackbuck graze along the desert grass outside of the village. The Bishnoi consider the buck sacred and have been known to be aggressive toward people that harm animals and trees, which are considered pillars of sanctity. As the afternoon lingers along the landscape you continue onward to the towering stretch of blue buildings that create the old city of Jodhpur. The powerful stone of Mehrangarh Fort stands atop the cliff and looms over the ancient buildings. You are guided around the clock tower on a rickshaw tour of the old city. The streets are aromatic with spices. You can see all the collected colors of the spice trade emanating from Mohanlal Verhomal, MV, one of the oldest spice merchants in the city."

Soon you will come to Pushkar, a unique city that draws in Hindu pilgrims and curious travelers alike with its charm and the holy Brahma temples. When entering the religious complexes you find numerous bathing ghats among 400 milky-blue temples, and you can feel the earth tingle with humming prayers, drums, and gongs echoing off of the mountains and the marble. The ghats surround the lake and allow pilgrims to dip into the sacred waters where legends of Vishnu and Brahma took place.

The arch is 203 feet tall and 20 feet wide. The gold plating on the main temple shimmers in the evening lights and reflects off of the water. The main hall was constructed in the middle of an expansive water tank and has become the center of Sikhism. The marble work and gilded ceilings in the main hall are mesmerizing. You watch in awe during the Night Ceremony as the holy text is carried from the main shrine to the sanctum. Several people help support the palanquin that holds the book until the text is removed and surfs along the hands of the devoted followers."

You are met at the airport by a private transfer and taken into the city where you will soon visit the monuments that decorate the streets and add to the splendor. The Jama Masjid is the largest mosque in India with the ability to hold up to 25,000 people in its courtyard. The atmosphere around the mosque is always filled with awe and joyful energy, people ready to step inside and devote themselves or simply witness the grandeur of the structure that was meant as a devotion of its own, built in the 15th century with 15 different domes that undulate across the skyline. A simple black-marble platform just south of the Red Fort brings you to the location where Mahatma Gandhi was cremated in 1948. The area along the banks of the Yamuna River provokes thought and wonder and stretches the lengths of India’s modern history and beyond, filled with vibrant flowers often sprawling along the marble beneath the flickering flame that continues to billow no matter the weather."

After your meal you will make your way out of the city en route to Agra with a visit to Sikandra, home to the tomb of Akbar. The pink sandstone structure was constructed in the 17th century where four red sandstone gates once led into the complex decorated with bold, large mosaic patterns in a combination of Hindu, Muslim, Christian, and a patented style that was Akbar’s alone. Between the rising minarets and fabulous glowing textiles you will feel inspired by the artistry and in awe of the magnitude before arriving at the Wonder of the World: Taj Mahal. Emperor Shah Jehan constructed the famous mausoleum for his third wife in the 17th century. It has become an icon of India and a celebration of architectural craftsmanship. The curving marble domes flow into graceful minarets standing on a platform that overlooks a series of manicured gardens and curling fountains. When the water isn’t trickling down, the pristine white façade of the building is reflected in the ponds. As you step closer to the structure you can see the details that have been carved into the walls, over the doors, and within the cavernous interior. Whether in the echoing quiet of the mausoleum or while walking along the trickling mist of the fountains and ponds, the majesty of the Taj Mahal is all encompassing.

The effervescence of the city comes from the unrelenting color in the clothing, along the streets, and washing over the Ganges River with a seeming chaos, but a chaos that is organic to the lifestyle of Kashi, “City of Life.” There is an immediate magic to the air, filled with the local spirit that has made this city the palpable center of the Hindu world. When you arrive just outside of the city to Sarnath you will notice the large stupa that dates back to the 6th century and is known to be the place that Buddha first preached after obtaining enlightenment. The site is peaceful and open; you can see the large stone structure rising in the distance above the trees, adding a simple tranquility to a place where serenity and balance was understood."

In the morning you will come to the banks of the Ganges and climb aboard a boat that will take you drifting along the vibrant waterway that is the source of a cycling life for those in Varanasi. As the early light begins to twist into a warmer day, the breeze brings comfort and relief. Candles sit atop banana leaves floating away from the shores as people offer prayers to the gods while the boat oars tap softly at the water. Part of the wonder of the city is its amazing vibrancy which thrives along the riverbanks, including the bursts of colors that come from elegant saris, and the men who lather themselves with soap and dip into the water. The commotion is hypnotic, somehow fitting cohesively into what would otherwise seem like pandemonium; however, it is within that diversity along the stone-lined river that you experience the sacred daily life. In the evening you will be welcomed to Bodhgaya, one of the four most important pilgrimage places for Buddhists."

When you come to the open space before the rising spire you feel a serene shift in the air that you cannot ignore.

Inside the complex walls you come to a series of palaces and villages interconnected through zigzagging corridors. The Garden Palace, known as Badi Mahal, is found on a natural rock. The rooms are on the ground floor of the precipice but actually look to the fourth-story of the surrounding palaces. Paintings decorate the walls and commemorate the history of the palace, from maharajas to elephants. The atmosphere is romantic and regal as you stroll through the palaces that are pressed against the quiet lake."

        "description": "When the morning light stretches over the jungle canopy you will depart from Bandhavgarh and make your way by private transfer to Kanha National Park. The afternoon sun reaches through the expansive forest of over 1,200 square miles where you can see the undulating mountain ranges covered in lush trees, rising up to 2,700 feet above sea level. The diverse topography comes from the Horseshoe Valley at the foothills of the Mekal Mountains where the Surpan River winds its way along the grasslands. In the evening you will set out on a game drive to explore the sensational nature when the wildlife awakens with vigor after the midday heat recedes. In the tall grass you can see the iridescent feathers of a peacock strutting through the blades. The elegant blue neck and swaying neon green tail radiate within the meadow offering new allure to the forest."

        "description": "The sounds of the morning come with a rush as you hear gaur , Indian bison, calling along the banks of the Surpan River. After breakfast you will once more climb aboard an elephant to explore the surrounding jungle regions of a tremendous nature reserve. On top of the animal’s back you sway with every step and watch the grasslands below, the trees above, and the vast expanse in front, while searching for leopards in the branches and tigers in the bush. Every now and then your elephant pushes aside a tree or brings up a sapling’s roots. It marks the path and spreads the seeds along the forest floor. Close by you find the graceful but skittish dhole , an Asiatic wild dog with red fur, a black tail, and a bark that sounds more like a whistle. It is easy to imagine an unaltered state of the forest, brimming with flora and fauna over the mountains and along the riverbanks. As you listen to the rambunctious chirp of the dhole you find awe in their playfulness with one another and in the surrounding rising grassland."

        "description": "It is easy to imagine Rudyard Kipling traversing the forest on elephant-back in search of nature’s majesty and becoming inspired by the immense land, diverse plant life, and enduring wildlife. Kanha National Park is known as the inspiration for Kipling’s The Jungle Book and persists in its ability to awe visitors in the same way it once captivated the famous novelist. The day takes you out into the woods once more in search of the tiger, referred to as “Shir Khan” in The Jungle Book in reference to the tiger’s power and prowess within these lush lands. When you come across the tiger in the wild you find unquestionable beauty in its stride. You notice its black and faded orange tail curling under its hind legs. Each step it takes is slow and calculated, not wanting to waste any unnecessary energy. Adult tigers, especially males, are often solitary, so when you come across two tigers lingering at the edges of the river you will witness a rare moment when the cats display how relaxed and delicate they can be toward each. As the sunlight drifts across the sky you don’t want to pull yourself away from the extraordinary vision of the wild."

The Rah Ghat is also known as the Gandhi Memorial, and commemorates one of the most notable people associated with the country. A park sits as the entrance area, filled with lush greenery and open space. Students tend to run around and relax along the grass. The central courtyard is adorned with a black marble memorial surrounded by ever-changing gardens. However, at the center of the marble, flickering inside what looks like a large lantern, is the eternal flame that represents the memory of Mahatma Gandhi. You continue your tour and the indulgent scent of kulle chaat entices you. The snack is a combination of hollowed out fruits that are filled with a blend of spices, lime juice, salt, chickpeas, and pomegranate seeds and brings a mixture of sweet, savory, and tart refreshment to your lips. You make your way through the twist of bazaars filled with rose petals to the shrine of Nizam-ud-din Auliya. It feels like you have stepped back through time to view a commemoration of the centuries. The site has become a place of pilgrimage, filled with the embodiment of the Sufi saint, along with the Urdu poet, Amir Khusru. The marble brings an opulent touch to the rousing singing of hymns that call out at sunset. Often filled with devoted followers and fans, you will notice the enthusiasm and charm on people’s faces as they visit with the ancient saint whose tomb is often covered with fresh flower petals that decorate the lavish yellow pillars and immaculate marble.

The reserve stretches over 1,200 square miles of undulating country, from the flatland to the mountains of the Mekal Ridge that gives a horseshoe shape to the valley. A mountain peak rises over 2,700 feet above sea level. The wildlife is abundant and vivacious as you search through the collection of thin, tall trees, where the canopy rustles with Langer’s monkeys. The white fur of the monkeys stands out against the dark bark, and darker faces. You hear tigers roar in the distance and your guide attempts to chase the sound as it reverberates through the trees and your bones, a tremendous, powerful call. You may not find the tiger today but you do find the iridescent plumage of a roller bird along the thin tree branches. Its tail feathers shine a vibrant turquoise against the leaves as a blackbuck grazes in the tall grass nearby. The deer’s upper pelt stands out against its white underneath. Its textured horns twist away from its forehead. Kanha’s fauna brings endless splendor to the day, and as you return to the the lodge for the evening you will find the comforts of your room embracing."

With your professional and seasoned guide you will traverse through the revving of early morning forest. Sloth bears are nocturnal but can be seen traveling through the woods within the early mixture of night and day. Their lanky build and shaggy coats create a mane around their face. Their lower lip has been adapted to dig for insects. The bamboo forest shapes the terrain as much as the rising mountains creating the valley. The scent of bamboo and sal are picked up in the breeze while the quiet atmosphere brings an echo to the rustling leaves. When you look into the trees you can see a branch dangling from an awkward angle. Soon you realize that it isn’t a branch but a tail, flicking lightly in the warm afternoon air. Able to leap more than 20 feet and capable of carrying an animal three times their own weight straight up a tree, the leopard’s nocturnal nature keeps them lazing about in the cool shade of the canopy during the day. You watch its tail swish along the branches and you can see the leopard’s elegant spots as well. As one of the most prolific cats, you cannot deny its stunning grace. In the evening upon your return to the hotel you can sit around the fire and listen to jungle tales that range from tribal dances with fabulous rhythms, to simple stories that have been passed down through the ages, adding mystery to the starlight and understanding to the relationship of animals and humankind."

The forest canopy mixes sal and pakur trees and the foothills bring the bamboo thickets to abundance. You hear a hawk-eagle call in the sky, circling somewhere beyond the lush leaves that have overtaken the view. Cheetal deer groom one another along the riverbanks, their white spots glowing against their brown fur. Peacocks stand attentively on branches that overlook the tall grass and their chortle brushes through the blades. Their effervescent blue feathers look like a spotlight, standing out against the coloration of the landscape. The day brings another endless collection of wildlife along garnered memories, whether from your photos or from the pictures in your mind, all wrapped together with the tranquil sounds and abundant life of the park. Upon your evening return to the lodge you are certain that the following day will bring you close to the majesty of tigers."

You climb aboard the pachyderm early in the morning and sit comfortably in a brass saddle covered with pillows. You already feel like the moment has accentuated your exploration of the wilds in India. Every second seems to be worth a photograph as your elephant steps with intent, able to traverse the dense forest, steep foothills, and tall grasslands without worry. The longer you travel through the flora, the more excited you become, as you scour the distance in search of the largest wildcat. Finally, you spot one, resting at the edges of a marsh with its paws dipped into the water. You have only imagined its exquisiteness, but up close you find that your images don’t measure up to what the tiger looks like in reality. Its coat glows in the afternoon light. It lounges against the comfort of the cool water. The black and orange coloration somehow blends into the grasslands around it. As the photos of the tiger hold strong in your camera and your mind, you continue through the forest, where you will come to the river where you can help your guide wash the elephant if you wish.
