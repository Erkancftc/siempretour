The Langar (food) is prepared by volunteers who wish to help out and by gursikhs who work there. It is believed that everyday around 25000 people eat in this hall. You are supposed to cover your head with a scarf and clean your feet with water at the entrance, as it is strictly followed in Sikhisim. Head scarves are available (no charges)."
