We suggest in the morning visiting Sanjay Colony, a small slum built on 25 acres of land located in the south of Delhi near the Bahai Lotus Temple and Iskcon temple. Learn about the working and residential life and witness how despite the challenging living conditions it remains an area charged with positive energy and strong community. You will also learn about the NGO programs directly supported by your visit. In the afternoon we suggest doing some more traditional sightseeing of your choice such as visiting India Gate, Qutub Minar, Humayun’s tomb, Agrasen ki Baoli (a stepwell) and Gurudwara Bangla Sahib, a Sikh temple and one of the largest community kitchens in India which feeds more than 10,000 people per day. In the evening, if you still have the energy, you can explore old Delhi and go on our popular food tour if you wish!"
