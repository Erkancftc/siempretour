      "description": "You arrive at the kayaking jetty, a short distance from the town of Alappuzha, better known by its angelized name Alleppey. Your guide will meet you on the bank of the river and after a short briefing, you set out on the kayaks for a fascinating introduction to this meandering world of water. You pass by coconut palm fringed villages with quaint names ending in suffixes like ‘kery’- a nod to the chieftain of area many centuries ago, or ‘kulam’ a homage to the fresh water ponds families depended on. You will be heading to Champakulam on the banks of the river Pamba which was an important stop on the river route from Kollam to the ancient port of Muziris. Famous for the St Mary’s Basilica which count as one of the oldest churches in India and an offshoot the church established by Thomas the apostle at Niranam. The structure built in the 1100s, still retains decorative elements like lotus’ a very Indian motif, the original rock cross – testament to this being a “Nasrani Christian” church and is a prime example of the East Syriac architectural scheme. In the evening you explore this area with a lot of interesting history. You visit Karumadi Kuttan, a renowned Buddhist pilgrim centre, wherein lies a special Buddha statue that dates back to the 11th century. Made of solid black granite, the entire site is today under the protection of Kerala Archaeology Department. You will be staying at a homestay and your hosts will be happy to share their home and Syrian Christian traditions and more importantly you will indulge in the home cooked delectable cuisine of the region"

      "description": "We start kayaking in the morning and the onslaught of amazing sights continue today with glimpses of emerald green fields or large expanses of water filled paddy fields, children skipping over narrow ‘palams’ or bridges on canals on their way to school, a boatsman herding a flock of ducks in an impossibly narrow wooden canoe, Cormorants on their perches on the river. You may have opportunities to interact with children, women doing their washing on the shore, or even encounter the fishmonger and grocer who sells his wares off his small wooden canoe - calling out to the ladies of the house he knows by name. You will be able to observe at close quarters homes, schools, whitewashed churches, wood worked ambalams or temples with notches for oil lamps that are lit at sunset, the thick foliage of overhanging trees. You break for refreshments along a bund/ dyke at the mouth of the river Pamba as it flows into the ‘kayal’ or lake. The narrow bund separates the paddy fields and the water, between growing seasons the fields are flooded with water to replenish the soil. The coconut palms that frame the narrow strip of land against the reflective waters on either side is the most endearing and iconic sight of the backwaters. You head to a 100 year old traditional home, complete with it original teak ‘arra’ or the granary of the home, around which the home was built. You will also get to wander around the village, interact with the locals as they fish, toddy tap, drink tea at the local chai kada and discuss the latest news with them as they devour the local Malayalam newspaper."
