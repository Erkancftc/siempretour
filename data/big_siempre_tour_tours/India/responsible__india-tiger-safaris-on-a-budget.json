  "generalInfo": "India is well known for various things, however what many people associate with this massive and fascinating country are the many glorious temples and fantastic architecture and also the iconic and endangered tiger. This tour focuses on showcasing the tiger in its natural habitat in a way that should fit any budget. <br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of Indian wildlife watching safari holidays. These tours range from the dry desert regions of Gujarat in search of striped hyena and Asiatic lions to the icy peaks of the Himalayas on the quest for snow leopards. But we also focus heavily on some of the 40 plus Tiger Reserves in this wonderful and diverse country. But it is not just the wildlife of India that makes India such a great holiday destination, but the varied and unique culture is also a focus for our trips.  <br/><br/>This tour is a specialist tiger safari of one of the best locations in the world for tigers. Bandhavgarh National Park has the highest density of wild tigers in the world. As well as the large population of tigers the park is also home to a great range of other species. Animals such as leopards, sloth bears, chital, wild boar, Indian peafowl, crested serpent eagles and dozens more are all regularly seen here alongside the iconic king of the Indian jungle, the majestic tiger.<br/><br/>Because this tour is only focused on Bandhavgarh National Park you can add on extensions to also visit many of the cultural highlights such as the Taj Mahal or Old Delhi. If you are interested in adding on more to this Indian Budget Tiger Safari please let us know.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Khajuraho. There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - a zoologist is not always available, please contact us for availability if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through India and particularly Bandhavgarh. Your naturalist escort is an expert in tigers and their conservation and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. We will also employ a specific cultural guide for all sightseeing of temples and monuments.<br/><br/>The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, river safaris, spotlighting, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the park. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>This tour is recommended for February - May as this is the dry season and the chances of seeing tigers is much higher in the dry season. However the temperatures from April onward can be very hot and humid. You can visit this park and enjoy the itinerary between October – June. The park is closed during the monsoon season.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• Our local Indian guides around Bandhavgarh have a good relationship with the park officials and because of this we get a heads up when animals are sighted and this can guide us in where to focus and thus increasing our chances of seeing our targeted species.<br/>• Visit the park morning and afternoon in your own private jeep for your group only.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our wildlife and tiger safaris of India a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout India so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the tigers, leopards, sloth bears, dhole and many more species.

      "description": "Bandhavgarh National Park / Khajuraho - Today will be your last safari into Bandhavgarh this morning. Then after the morning safari you will leave the lodge and travel back to Khajuraho. Khajuraho is an ancient city and is well known for its magnificent temples, which were built between 950 and 1050 A.D. Khajuraho derives its name from the Khajur tree (the date palm tree), which can be found in abundance in the area. The divine sculptures in these temples are a tribute to Life itself, embodying everything that is sublime and spontaneous about it. The murals depict the life and times of the Chandelas, and celebrate the erotic state of being. They not only testify to the mastery of the craftsman, but also to the extraordinary breadth of vision of the Chandela Rajputs under whose reign, these temples were constructed. If we have time we will explore some of these temples after checking into our accommodation for your final night in central India. (B)"
