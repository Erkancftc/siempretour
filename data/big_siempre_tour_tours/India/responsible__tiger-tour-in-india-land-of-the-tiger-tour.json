  "generalInfo": "Tiger tours in India offer an amazing opportunity to get up close to one of the world’s most endearing, yet deadly, predators, which is why this tour has been designed to make the most of Northern India’s premier national parks in order to increase chances of safety and success.<br/><br/>The protected areas of Bandhavgarh, Pench and Kanha national parks make ideal destinations for tiger tours in India with an abundance of alternative animal action adding to excitement levels as you go exploring on 15 individual India tiger tours over the course of two weeks.<br/><br/>Early booking recommendation:<br/><br/>Due to recent changes in the management of India tiger tours, and organising game drives in general, it’s now imperative to book wildlife safaris well in advance. A full list of traveller names and personal information details will be required to book your place on an India game drive with a no refund and a no name change policy also added to recent updates by the Indian authorities. In light of these changes we recommend all of our India tiger tours should be confirmed at least six months in advance which allows us, as tour operators, to work within the new guidelines and ensure game drives are secured for you, the client. Please note: it’s also imperative that guidelines are read and understood prior to booking. Thank you.<br/>",

It provided inspiration for Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book and marks our first chance to see our very own Shere Khan. This designated tiger reserve is home to around 45 Bengal tigers, plus leopards, wolves, monkeys, deer, and nilgai (the largest antelope in Asia). Our two days include four game drives, in which we’ll keep our eyes peeled for the incredible creatures that live here. Accommodation: Pench Jungle Camp (or similar)"

The park is vast, encompassing expansive grasslands, plateaus and dramatic rocky escarpments that house hundreds of wildlife species. The tiger population – which currently numbers around 500 – has been affected by poaching in recent years but the huge abundance of animals makes the game drives a memorable experience.

It is home to a wide variety of game, including leopards, sloth bears, jungle cats, wild pigs and, of course, tigers. The healthy tiger population of approximately 60-70 means this park has the highest tiger density of any reserve in India. The park also hosts up to 150 bird species including many on the migratory trail, such as the steppe eagle. During our stay, we embark on six games drives.

No stay in Agra would be complete without a visit to the Taj Mahal, built by the Moghul emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died in 1631. The Taj is serenely beautiful and never fails to amaze a first-time visitor – the white marble exterior changing colour according to the position of the sun. Nearby is the imposing Red Fort of Akbar, whose mighty sandstone walls enclose the beautiful white marble Pearl Mosque, palaces, halls, courtyards and fountains. Please note: In December and January, our Taj Mahal visit is earlier in the afternoon to avoid fog that can limit visibility during sunset. Accommodation: Howard Plaza The Fern (or similar)"
