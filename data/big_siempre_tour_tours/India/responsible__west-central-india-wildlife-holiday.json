  "generalInfo": "Nestled in West-central India, the lure of the Tiger at Tadoba and the fascinating undulating landscape at Pench is what drew us here many years ago in the pursuit of our love of photographing the stunning diversity of wildlife and game in what has come to be among the list of India’s best managed wildlife reserves on the sub-continent. <br/><br/>The etymology of Tadoba comes from the amalgamation of the tribal God Taru and the Andhari river that serves as the reserve’s water vein, filling it’s fresh water lakes during the brutal summer months. <br/><br/>Situated in the western state of Maharashtra, Tadoba’s wildlife fringes the local Gond tribal settlements around the region of Chandrapur. Traditional farmers and basket weavers, these tribes dwell in traditional village homes. Over the years we’ve cultivated a support system with these communities where we share with travellers what they do and how they carry on their process of living. We attempt to give back for our footprint in the region by supporting these communities by sourcing their produce and enlightening travellers about their culture and heritage. <br/><br/>It’s important to not just understand the rich bio-diversity of the park but also be made aware of the social conservation that inherently exists amongst these villages and their efforts in establishing a stable co-existence, especially within such close proximity, between man and wildlife in this region. <br/><br/>Pench on the other hand is situated in slightly hillier terrain over the border of Maharashtra and into the state of Madhya Pradesh in Central India.<br/><br/>Serving as an inspiration for Rudyard Kipling’s Jungle Book as home to Mowgli, it’s easy to see why Sir David Attenborough described Pench as the most appropriate location for documenting the behavior of Tigers in the wild. <br/><br/>Spread over an area of 750 square kilometres, Pench’s undulating terrain makes for a fascinating mix of plant species, rock caves and a fantastic diversity in woodland bird species. <br/><br/>But again, Pench is not just about the Tiger. In fact the excitement in pursuing unique species such as the four-horned Antelopes, wild dog packs, the elusive Leopards and the rather sly Indian Jackals. <br/><br/>With some of the best managed and regulated game drives within national Parks in India, the experience in Pench is of anticipation, intrigue and the satisfaction of being amidst nature in it’s best preserved state.",

Over the course of the late afternoon, you’ll head out for a walk with a Naturalist to hopefully get up close with the unique wetland birds, both resident and migratory that make their way to these parts."
