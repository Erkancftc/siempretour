  "generalInfo": "Dive deep into northern India’s great cultural route: the Golden Triangle – Delhi, Agra and Jaipur – on an adventure where the headline acts are just part of the story. The rest is unlocked thanks to the in-depth knowledge of your local tour leader. It’s meeting the vendors at spice-laden market stalls, waving to friendly local people, learning to cook (and eat) traditional Rajasthani cuisine, and staying in a 600-year-old royal residence. Of course, the highlight for many is visiting the Taj Mahal at sunrise, but the lesser-known wonders may linger just as long in the memory.",

      "description": "Begin your adventure in pulsating Delhi. It’s a city split in two, with historic Old Delhi in the north and the nation’s capital, New Delhi, in the south. At approximately 2pm, join your leader for a tour of Old Delhi, starting outside Jama Masjid, a colossal mosque capable of holding up to 25,000 worshippers. After, we’re taken through the narrow streets of the Old Delhi markets by cycle rickshaw, finishing at Khari Baoli, the largest spice market in India, where we can meet the vendors and walk through the fragrant rows of spices, nuts, herbs and grains. Around 6pm, we gather as a group to get to know each other and learn more about the adventures ahead over a welcome meeting. Your tour leader then arranges a group dinner at a nearby restaurant.

      "description": "Join our tour leader to explore New Delhi this morning. It starts at Humayun’s Tomb, a rather understated name for what is really a precursor to the Taj Mahal, a mausoleum on a palatial scale. We then drive past fine colonial buildings, including Rashtrapati Bhavan, a 320-acre (130ha) estate built by British architect Edwin Lutyens in 1931, which comprises the official residence of the President of India, Parliament House and India Gate – a memorial to soldiers who died in the First World War. This afternoon, we head to Agra (approximately four to five hours’ drive). Upon arrival, check into the hotel with the evening free to relax. Accommodation: The Taj Vilas (or similar)"

      "description": "It’s the moment everyone’s been waiting for! Wake early to visit the Taj Mahal at sunrise, when the white-marble exterior is illuminated by the soft early light, the crowds are smaller and the birds chatter among themselves. After admiring it from the outside and enjoying a deep dive into this New World Wonder from our tour leader, we head inside, with a chance to explore the beautiful inner chambers and mausoleum. After we’ve fully soaked in the magnificence of the Taj Mahal, we visit the imposing Agra Fort (also known as the Red Fort). It was built by the third Mughal emperor, Akbar, whose mighty red sandstone walls enclose the white-marble Pearl Mosque and the palaces, halls, courtyards, and gardens of his sons and successors, Jehangir and Shah Jahan. In the afternoon, we transfer (approximately three to four hours) to Suroth Mahal, a 600-year-old fort in the city of Hindaun. This former royal residence was once home to the Maharaja Krishna Chandra Pal, though tonight you’ll be the guest of honour! After checking into the hotel and freshening up, we have a 45-minute round trip by camel cart to a century-old Hindu temple. Back at the hotel, enjoy a short cooking demonstration, in which you’re shown how to make pakora – a skill certain to impress your friends back home. Accommodation: Suroth Mahal, Heritage Hotel (or similar)"

      "description": "Start the day with a gentle one-hour walk to a 300-year-old village, where we meet the residents and learn about their daily life. En route, we also visit a local market (haat) and see the community going about their daily tasks, such as creating handicrafts or working in their fields. In the afternoon, transfer (approximately four to five hours) to Jaipur. Breaking up this journey, we stop at Chand Baori, one of the largest and deepest stepwells in India. With its intricate criss-cross staircase pattern, you’ll feel like you’re part of an Escher artwork. The evening is free but if you still have some energy, why not join your tour leader for an evening cooking class at a local family home? This optional activity is a great way to interact with the local people, learn some great cooking tips and gorge on sumptuous food.

      "description": "Enjoy a full day exploring Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan and one of the most attractive and colourful cities in India. Rise early, heading out for a dawn walking tour as the pink city begins to wake. Visiting different chowkris (blocks) within the walled city, we can see the local people start their day and watch the rituals that take place in early morning flower and vegetable markets. Visiting a small temple, we witness a morning aarti, a moving Hindu ceremony accompanied by singing, ringing bells and incense. We can also interact with different artisan communities, while also sampling local food and drink. Returning to the hotel for breakfast and time to refresh, we head out again mid-morning. First, we visit the hilltop Amer Fort, which was built by Kachwaha dynasty ruler Man Singh and acted as the seat of the dynasty before the capital was shifted to Jaipur. A highlight is the Sheesh Mahal (Hall of Mirrors), which is adorned with more than a million pieces of hand-cut mirror and glass, intricately arranged to reflect light throughout the space. Later, we visit one of the most intriguing sites in India, Jantar Mantar (Jaipur Observatory), an assembly of immense marble-and-brass astronomical instruments in a pleasant garden. We also see the Hawa Mahal (Palace of the Winds), a five-storey landmark built of pink sandstone, which allowed the women of the royal household to observe street festivities without being noticed. Finally, we can end the day exploring the local market within the walled city – admiring the local dhurries (woven rugs), carpets, printed cloth, semi-precious stones and leatherwear.
