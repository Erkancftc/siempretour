  "generalInfo": "Combining time exploring India’s Golden Triangle with two nights in Ranthambore National Park on the trail looking for tigers, this northern India holiday has the perfect mix of history and natural history. Starting in Delhi, you’ll explore both Old Delhi and New Delhi via rickshaw rides, street food and tours of the mix of modern and Mughal architecture. Next: on to Agra, then Jaipur, before your time in Ranthambore.<br/><br/>Historic sights come thick and fast on this trip. In Agra you’ll see the Taj Mahal at sunrise and in Jaipur, you can’t miss the Amber Fort, City Palace and Jantar Mantar Observatory. <br/><br/>Ranthambore isn’t just about tigers: this famous national park has over 300 species of bird, plus 30 mammals including sloth bears, leopards, monkeys, wild boar, jackal, deer and antelope – you’ll never know what will cross the path when you’re out in the park travelling in a canter (open backed lorry). This trip includes two game drives, but you have the opportunity to book an additional one, if you want more time searching for tigers.<br/><br/>Your trip supports local communities by giving you lovely personal experiences with families and people who live in the area. In Agra, you’ll visit a cafe that supports the victims of acid attacks. A local villager will give you a Mughal Heritage Walk through the villages that lie on the other side of the river from the Taj Mahal – providing a unique perspective not just of the mausoleum but of local life in Agra. In Jaipur you’ll take part in a block printing workshop and, in Agra, an optional thali cooking lesson with a Hindu family. <br/><br/>The holiday ends with a relaxing train ride back to Delhi – so you can sit back, look at the landscape, and think back on your fantastic trip to some of the best sights in northern India. <br/>",

      "description": "Exploring Delhi, Rickshaw Ride & Street Food Tasting Your day starts with a morning tour of India's capital, New Delhi. Built on the banks of the Yamuna river, New Delhi is a beautiful blend of a historical past and a vibrant present. We start at India Gate in the centre of New Delhi, a 42-metre high \"Arc-de-Triomphe\" like archway, a war memorial built to commemorate the 82,000 soldiers who partook in the undivided Indian Army. We'll drive past various government buildings such as the President's Palace and the Parliament of India, before passing Humayun's Tomb - a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the Bangla Sahab Gurudwara Sikh Temple. We'll stop at Connaught Place Station and join the locals on the metro to Old Delhi where we'll walk through one of the oldest and busiest markets in Old Delhi, Chandni Chowk, before exploring the narrow streets of Chawri Bazar which specialises in selling brass, copper and paper products. Throughout the afternoon our guide will also introduce you to the wide range of street food snacks and delicacies so you can get your first authentic taste of the delicious and varied Indian cuisine. Our walking tour will also take in a rickshaw ride and the Jama Masjid mosque, one of the largest in India. OVERNIGHT"

      "description": "Head to Agra. Sheroes Hangout, Mughal Heritage Walk. First glimpse of the Taj Mahal We head to Agra this morning, home of the famous Taj Mahal. After arriving in Agra we'll make a stop for lunch at the Sheroes Hangout Cafe The cafe was set up by the Chhanv Foundation and is run by victirms of acid attacks. The cafe works to raise awareness of acid attacks in India and to empower those who have sadly been the victims of these heinous crimes. Prior to gaining employment in the cafe, many of the 'Sheroes' led solitary lives, rarely going outside due to shame associated with their scars. At Encounters Travel we're proud to support such an organisation, which has the sole aim of helping these women find acceptance, a supportive community and a means of income. Lunch will be included whilst at the cafe. Once you've checked in into your hotel, we'll spend the afternoon on a Mughal Heritage Walk through the ancient village of Kachhpura and surrounding farmland on the banks of the Yamuna River across from the Taj Mahal and Red Fort. This walk has been designed by a local NGO and helps support the local community through employment and new infrastructure. During the walk one of the villagers will give a guide to their village life, the layout of their homes, with living, cooking & religious areas, the farming done, and the local cottage industry for leather shoe making which helps Agra export shoes all over the world. You'll also see some lesser known but important Mughal era monuments. Finally today we'll stroll around the park at Mehtab Bagh - originally built by Emperor Babur as the last in a series of 11 parks on the Yamuna River's east bank, before taking in the magnificent sight of the Taj Mahal at sunset. A special evening option is available today, where you can join a Hindu family for a Vegetarian Thali cooking lesson and meal. OVERNIGHT"

      "description": "Taj Mahal sunrise. Drive to Suroth Mahal, Village Walking tour We start today early for our tour of the Taj Mahal. Truly one of the wonders of the world this elaborate monument to love was built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan and took over twenty-two years to complete. Sunrise is a great time to visit as the light changes gradually with the colours of the Taj changing too. After breakfast we leave the region's popular tourist areas and head into the heart of rural Rajasthan to the small town of Suroth. The property was a former palace, now welcoming guests as a hotel, but retaining its heritage charm, with rooms painted with murals. The afternoon sees us exploring the village, interacting with the local villagers, getting invaluable insight into seeing their way of life. Our walking tour will pass by local shops, down narrow streets, we'll visit a small temple and perhaps even visit a local barber shop where you can have a shave or head massage. In the evening we'll have a cooking demonstration before enjoying dinner at the hotels restaurant. OVERNIGHT"

      "description": "Amber Fort & Jaipur City. Block printing workshop You have an option of going on an early morning hot air balloon ride over Jaipur, flying over its palaces, forts and lakes - a truly mesmerising experience. If you chose to sleep a little later, your morning starts with a visit to the Amber Fort, the jewel in Jaipur's crown - an ancient fortress built on a hilltop in the 16th century dedicated to the ruling Kachhawa clan of Amber. Be mesmerised by this majestic architectural wonder, with its pink sandstone and marble palace shining in the sun. It's massive fortress walls sprawls across the hills, with many seeing a resemblance of the Great Wall of China. Later, we return to the city for a tour of Jaipur, as we visit the strange Jantar Mantar monument, a collection of nineteen architectural astronomical instruments, built by the Rajput king Sawai Jai Singh II between 1724 and 1730. Jaipur was the first planned city of medieval India and we'll also explore its City Palace. Built by Raja Man Singh during 1729-1732 AD, the City Palace was once the seat of kings as it was from here that they ruled the region. This tangle of courtyards, manicured gardens and exceptionally crafted mahals is one of the most revered attractions in India. We spend the remainder of the day walking in the walled city to discover some of Jaipur's famous crafts markets and craftsmen in action such as jewellers, silversmiths, textile workshops and bangle makers. Our tour will include a blockprinting workshop, where we learn the ways in which fabric is decorated using this ancient method and we'll also have a gemstone demonstation. OVERNIGHT"

      "description": "Ranthambore - Home of the Bengal Tiger. Afternoon Game Drive We leave Jaipur today and head to Ranthambore National Park, which is named after Ranthambore fortress, located within its boundaries. If you're looking to see tigers in the wild, this is the place to be. In 1973, the park was established as a sanctuary for the tigers and to help decrease the fatal interactions that were increasing between humans and tigers. We'll have our first chance to see Tigers this afternoon as we join a shared canter for game drive through the park. OVERNIGHT"

      "description": "Morning Game Drive in search of tigers We'll head back out on an early morning game drive, giving you the best opportunity to see India's tigers in their natural habitat, but keep your eyes peeled for other wildlife such as leopards, sloth bears, black bucks, flying foxes, Indian porcupines, striped hyenas, jackals, jungle cats, wild boar, civets, desert cats, macaques, mole rats, and many more species. We'll be transported through the jungle in an open-backed truck (shared canter), which allows us to travel deep into the park, as we search for India's unique wildlife. We'll also visit the ruined fort located within the boundaries of the park, which is beautifully elevated on a natural hummock, which towers at just over 200 metres high. The ancient ruined fort is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In the afternoon you'll have some free time to relax or you could consider booking additional private jeep or shared game drives within the park. OVERNIGHT"

Our preferred service is the Kota Jan Shtabad leaving at 0725.
