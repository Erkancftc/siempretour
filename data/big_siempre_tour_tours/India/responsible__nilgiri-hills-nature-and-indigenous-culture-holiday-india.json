  "generalInfo": "Explore the world of the Adivasi – the indigenous forest-dwelling tribal people of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve in South India – with a pioneering social enterprise which aims to bring mutual benefit to them and to those who support them. <br/><br/>We offer two fortnight-long nature tours (April and Dec 2026). Our area of the Western Ghats in South India is rich with hundreds of species, many endemic to the Nilgiris. Walks, talks and safaris will be arranged to learn about the lives and environment of the hunter-gatherer Adivasi.  Sandeep, our charismatic and knowledgeable naturalist, will lead the small group tours; his popular bird-watching walks are a key feature of the tour.<br/><br/>Guests on the tours will stay, with exclusive use, in our purpose-built luxury guest house. Each room has an en-suite bathroom and a private veranda with mountain views. South Indian cuisine will be served (cooking lessons are available) with Western breakfast also provided. Yoga lessons are also on offer. The climate is perfect at this time of the year, pleasantly warm during the day without any excessive heat, because of the elevation. Nature walks will be organised in the surrounding hills and nearby estates and safaris into the Tiger and Elephant Reserve near the guest house.<br/><br/>These tours, uniquely, involve and benefit tribal communities in India, whilst exploring the extraordinarily species-rich aspects of the natural world in the stunning Nilgiri Hills and the Mudumulai and Bandipur Forests. Walking distances and difficulties can be tailored to suit the participants on each tour. By participating, you will be giving valuable help to the Adivasi community, through employment and because all profit from the tours is donated to the tribal community organisations. Please watch on Netflix The Elephant Whisperers, a short documentary Oscar winner, which features members of this community and their elephant charges. We are happy to tailor any aspect of the tours to meet your preferences including visiting some heritage sites in Mysore, Srirangapatna, Somanathapura and Ooty, as well as a trip on the 'toy' mountain train if desired. Contact us for details!<br/><br/>Testimonials from former tour participants:<br/><br/>'It was the best holiday I have ever had. We were beautifully looked after by wonderful staff in a very comfortable house, driven to National Parks, saw tigers, elephants and a mass of other animals and birds, were fed delicious food, went to Ooty where we stayed the night in a lovely comfortable hotel; our guide was just brilliant, we learnt a lot, saw so much and I didn’t want to come home! Just wonderful. Thank you.' <br/><br/>'Words can't describe what a fabulous time we had. Nothing could have prepared us for that extraordinary experience thanks to you and your wonderful staff and collaborators';  <br/><br/>'Awe-inspiring views, superb staff and outstanding cooks'; <br/><br/>'A unique and fantastic experience';<br/><br/>'Simply wonderful - rarely does a destination over-perform, but Plenti does so in spades'.",
