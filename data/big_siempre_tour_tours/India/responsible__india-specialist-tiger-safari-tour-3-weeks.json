  "generalInfo": "The most famous predator in India if not the whole world, is of course the iconic and majestic Tiger. And when it comes to seeing this amazing animal there really is only one place; central India. <br/><br/>There are a number of national parks and tiger reserves around India (over 40 in total) and many are in the central state of Madhya Pradesh, it is here where some of the reserves boast such a huge percentage of the world population its hard not to find tigers. <br/><br/>This safari is by far the most comprehensive tiger safari around; travelling to three of the best parks in the world for tigers and spending three weeks searching for them we could easily spot over 25 different tigers during our time here. But its not just tigers there are dhole, sloth bears, leopards, langurs, chital, sambar, golden jackals, jungle cats and many more mammals and birds. <br/><br/>We enter the parks with a local guide and driver, travel between the parks in private air conditioned vehicles and stay in the best lodges around the parks.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of Indian wildlife watching safari holidays. These tours range from the dry desert regions of Gujarat in search of striped hyena and Asiatic lions to the icy peaks of the Himalayas on the quest for snow leopards. But we also focus heavily on some of the 40 plus Tiger Reserves in this wonderful and diverse country. But it is not just the wildlife of India that makes India such a great holiday destination, but the varied and unique culture is also a focus for our trips.  <br/><br/>This tour is a specialist tiger safari of three of the best locations in the world for tigers and a host of other large mammals in India. Panna, Bandhavgarh and Kanha National Parks. These parks have a population of over 200 tigers and some of the highest densities of wild tigers in the world. As well as the large population of tigers the park is also home to a great range of other species of predators, which are seen more readily here than many other locations in India. These are leopards, dhole and sloth bear. These predators live alongside their prey such as guar, barasingha, chital, sambar, wild boar and many other species.<br/><br/>Because this tour is mainly focused on tigers and only visits national parks in central India you can add on extensions to also visit many of the cultural highlights such as the Taj Mahal or Old Delhi. If you are interested in adding on more to this Tiger Safari please let us know.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) where mentioned, in some locations lunch and dinner are not included (please refer to the itinerary), such as in Delhi. There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through India and particularly the national parks. Your  naturalist escort is an expert in tigers and their conservation and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. We will also employ a specific cultural guide for all sightseeing of temples and monuments.<br/><br/>The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. We also include all vehicle safaris, river safaris, spotlighting, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the park. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>This tour is recommended for February - May as this is the dry season and the chances of seeing tigers is much higher in the dry season. However the temperatures from April onward can be very hot and humid. You can visit this park and enjoy the itinerary between October – June. The park is closed during the monsoon season.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• Our local Indian guides around Panna, Bandhavgarh and Kanha have a good relationship with the park officials and because of this we get a heads up when animals are sighted and this can guide us in where to focus and thus increasing our chances of seeing our targeted species.<br/>• Visit the park morning and afternoon in your own private jeep for your group only.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our wildlife and tiger safaris of India a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout India so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the tigers, leopards, sloth bears, dhole and many more species. We also have the ability to organise and run wildlife tours of India at other times of year and focusing on other species such as brown and snow leopards, Indian one-horned rhinos, Western Ghats endemics, elephants, primates, Asiatic lions and many species throughout this incredible country. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour is completely focused on three national parks and tiger reserves all located in the Central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. With Delhi being the main arrival and departure hub.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The vast majority of wildlife watching is all done from a vehicle.

      "description": "Panna National Park - Travelling & Sightseeing After breakfast we will be transferred to Delhi domestic airport to catch the short (2.40 hours) flight to Khajuraho. When we arrive here you will be met by your local guide/driver and depending on the time of the flight we will spend some time sightseeing here. Khajuraho is well known for its magnificent temples, which were built between 950 and 1050 A.D. Khajuraho derives its name from the Khajur tree (the date palm tree), which can be found in abundance in the area. The divine sculptures in these temples are a tribute to Life itself, embodying everything that is sublime and spontaneous about it. The murals depict the life and times of the Chandelas, and celebrate the erotic state of being. They not only testify to the mastery of the craftsman, but also to the extraordinary breadth of vision of the Chandela Rajputs under whose reign, these temples were constructed. After lunch we either visit the Eastern and Western groups of Temples or we will travel direct to our accommodation at Panna National Park, level – safari lodge (Ken River Lodge) (1 hour). Once again depending on the time of arrival we may head into the park on an afternoon jeep safari to try and find some wildlife. Panna National Park is an excellent place to find leopards. Our evening meal will be at our accommodation and an early night is recommended as tomorrow is a busy and exciting day. (breakfast and dinner are the only meals included today)."
