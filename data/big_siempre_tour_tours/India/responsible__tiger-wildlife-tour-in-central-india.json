      "description": "Bandhavgarh: The Reserve is named after the highest hill Bandhavgarh (807 m.) in the centre of the Reserve. Bandhavgarh has the highest density of tiger population in the country and hence offers the best chance to see them in the wild. The Spotted Deer, or Chital, is a favourite item on the Tiger menu and several thousand of these delightful deer inhabit the Reserve. Other species found here in varying abundance include chinkara, wild boar, sambar deer, barking deer and blue bull. Each outing in the Reserve provides a chance to meet one of its rarer inhabitants such as a sloth bear, Bengal fox, jackal and jungle cat. Other animals present in more significant numbers in the Reserve include the ruddy mongoose, rhesus macaque, Indian hare and the delightful palm squirrel. Common langurs are also plentiful, sitting with an elevated view of the forest as they devour their favourite leaves. Explore Bandhavgarh for another 2 days with four safaris and jungle walks."
