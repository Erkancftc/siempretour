      "description": "Kolkata - Kolkata is a city full of character and contrasts, best explored with the insight of a private guide. Start with some of its most iconic landmarks, such as the grand Victoria Memorial and gallery, the peaceful Botanical Gardens, and Mother Teresa’s Missionaries of Charity. In the afternoon, join a “confluence of cultures” walking tour to discover the many global communities who have shaped the city over the centuries – from the Chinese, Parsis and Armenians to Anglo-Indians and people from across India. Round off the day with a serene evening cruise along the Hooghly, a tributary of the sacred Ganges."

From here, a scenic three-hour drive winds uphill to Shillong, the charming hill station and capital of Meghalaya. On arrival, check in to your hotel – Tripura Castle, once the summer residence of the Maharaja of Tripura – before heading out to explore Bara Bazaar, the bustling outdoor “big market”."

      "description": "Around Shillong - The Khasi people follow a matrilineal system, a striking contrast to the strongly patriarchal traditions found in much of India. Today, your guide will take you beyond Shillong into rural villages to meet members of the Khasi community, with a special stop in Smit – the traditional seat of Khasi royalty and culture. Here, you might see timber houses with sloping tin roofs, women in distinctive 'jainsem' dress, and open spaces where community gatherings and festivals take place."

      "description": "Living Root Bridges at Laitkynsew - One of the most remarkable features of this region are the living root bridges, created by guiding and intertwining the aerial roots of rubber trees to form natural crossings over rivers. They take decades to grow strong enough to use, so communities here rely on bridges built by their ancestors while nurturing new ones for generations yet to come. From Shillong, it’s a scenic 1.5-hour drive each way through the hills to Laitkynsew to see these extraordinary structures, with the option to stop at Cherrapunjee to admire its dramatic waterfalls."

As you near the park, keep an eye out – you may be lucky enough to spot one of the area’s iconic one-horned rhinos grazing in the distance. On arrival, check in to your resort and take the rest of the day to relax."

      "description": "Kaziranga National Park - Today, you’ll venture into Kaziranga National Park on two game drives – one at first light, the other in the late afternoon glow – travelling in open-top jeeps with your expert naturalist guide. The early mist adds a touch of magic, drifting over the wide, open landscapes of elephant grass. This is the only place in the world where you can see the endangered one-horned rhinoceros in the wild, alongside wild boar, water buffalo and a wealth of birdlife. And if luck is on your side, you might just catch a fleeting glimpse of a tiger."

      "description": "Majuli Island - This morning, you’ll be driven for a couple of hours to board the public ferry to Majuli Island, still within Assam. The 1.5-hour crossing is an experience in itself, shared with local passengers and sometimes their livestock, offering a glimpse of daily life along the Brahmaputra. Majuli is the world’s largest river island, though sadly it is shrinking fast and may not survive many more decades. Homes here are built on stilts to protect against flooding and wandering wildlife, and tonight you’ll stay in a traditional house. During your visit, you can meet local artisans and watch them crafting pottery and masks from clay and bamboo, skills passed down through generations."

      "description": "Around Mon - With a packed lunch, set off on the two-hour drive to Longwa, a remote village where tribal traditions have changed little over the centuries. As you walk through its narrow lanes, you might see smoke curling from wood-fired kitchens, hear the steady rhythm of weaving looms, and notice the intricate tattoos worn by elders – each marking a story from their past. Longwa is also home to the local king, whose wooden home famously straddles the border between India and Myanmar, symbolising his authority over villages in both countries."

From here, you can explore the surrounding tea gardens, stroll into town to browse the bustling markets, and sample some authentic Assamese cuisine.
