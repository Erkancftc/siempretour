  "generalInfo": "Over just four days, and travelling for the most part by train, this small group tour of India whisks you around some of the most iconic sights in the country, as you explore the famous Golden Triangle.<br/><br/>Beginning in Delhi, you will take a guided walking tour of the Sanjay Colony, a small slum, to learn about the daily lives of its residents. Time is set aside for sightseeing around key landmarks in the capital, including Qutub Minar, India Gate and Humayun’s Tomb, before reconnecting with your guide to enjoy a mouthwatering street food tour.<br/><br/>Next day you’ll move on to Jaipur, the fabulous ‘Pink City’, with almost every building in the historic centre painted in terracotta pink, a magnificent sight at sunset. The unmissable sights here of course included the Amber Fort, built from red sandtone during the 16th century.<br/><br/>From Jaipur it’s on to Agra, where you’ll be accommodated in a welcoming homestay. The historic Agra Fort was once the main residence of Mughal emperors, and is now a key attraction here, but you will be elsewhere by sunset. This is the perfect time to admire the spectacular Taj Mahal, the greatest monument to love ever created. You’ll need to be quick with your camera to capture a great shot, as this is without doubt India’s most-visited site.<br/><br/>After having dinner with your hosts in Agra, the following day it’s just a short train journey back to Delhi where you can continue your adventures. For those with limited budget or time, this tour really is the best way to take in the Golden Triangle, as well as several other lesser-known locations that many tours miss.<br/>",

We suggest in the morning visiting Sanjay Colony, a small slum built on 25 acres of land located in the south of Delhi near the Bahai Lotus Temple and Iskcon temple. Learn about the working and residential life and witness how despite the challenging living conditions, it remains an area charged with positive energy and strong community. You will also learn about the NGO programs run by our sister NGO Reality Gives, which are directly supported by your visit. In the afternoon we suggest doing some more traditional sightseeing of your choice such as visiting India Gate, Qutub Minar, Humayun’s tomb, Agrasen ki Baoli (a stepwell) and Gurudwara Bangla Sahib, a Sikh temple and one of the largest community kitchens in India which feeds more than 10,000 people per day. In the evening, if you still have the energy, you can explore old Delhi and go on our popular food tour if you wish!"
