This North Kerala tailor made holiday will help you explore them.<br/><br/>Now how about traditional folk dances involving frenzied drumming and dancing around fires?  Or ancestral spice-traders whose homestays offer up some of the region’s most authentic and culturally distinct cuisine? Or walks to local tribal homes, and meeting traditional boat builders? All of these are possible and more. You can also experience an invigorating ayurvedic massage by the beach, go on spice-plantation walks or jeep safaris through the forested Western Ghats, go country boating to get close to migratory birds, or trek through deep, dark rainforest. Enjoying a local catch of fish prepared right on your houseboat as it glides along the unexplored scenic backwaters will also add to your experiences of Kerala’s beautiful and culturally diverse North. <br/><br/>",
