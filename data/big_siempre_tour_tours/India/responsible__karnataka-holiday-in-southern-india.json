  "generalInfo": "Discover the heart of real India, and relax in the warmth of South India, perfect for a winter escape. Explore the ways and culture of Karnataka, and stay in comfortable guesthouses that are owned and run by local communities. Local people benefit directly from your stay, and the welcome given to guests is truly special. These are tailor-made trips, and you have your own local guides who will reveal so much about local life. You begin in the sub-tropical warmth of the Western Ghats to explore a beautiful, little known part of southern India. Visit the majestic temples and palaces at Hampi, then taste life amongst spice plantations from the wonderful 'Spice House' at Hulgol. See the auction market, and explore on foot or by cycle the forests and the holy river. The Spice House is a comfortable traditional style bungalow, with three twin-bedded rooms. Wonderful fresh produce is used to create delicious meals. There are ample opportunities for exploring around the fascinating hamlet and spice gardens, or longer walks to temples, waterfalls and just meeting villagers. The diversity of the flora and fauna is fascinating: a wide variety of birds, small mammals, butterflies and fireflies flickering at night. <br/><br/>From Hulgol, you  visit  the coast  to discover the fishing community of Pavinakurva where you can watch the fishermen, and relax on a secluded beach, a marvelous place to unwind. This is a magnificent, unspoiled stretch of coast, where life continues as it has for centuries, reliant on the catch brought in by small fishing boats. Again, the guesthouse is comfortable and the fresh fish and local vegetables create memorable meals cooked by your hosts. The guesthouse is shaded by coconut palms, close to a cashew orchard, with river and distant hill views. Sitting in the shade reading a book is a delight! The village's sandy beach sweeps away into the distance, peaceful apart from a few seabirds and the boats drawn up above the tide line. Just off-shore is the mysterious Basavraja Durga island, a small wooded rock outcrop. Above the shore line the sandy dunes have been planted with Cassurina trees, including grassy shaded areas suited to picnics or just relaxing and watching the ebb and flow of the sea. Unfortunately, difficult currents make this an unsafe beach for swimming. <br/><br/>Karnataka, both its coast and hills, is a wonderful region to explore, and this combination of guesthouses is ideal.",
