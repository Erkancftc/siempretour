This temple, built in 1026 AD by Bhimadeva of the Solanki Rajput clan, is dedicated to Lord Surya, the sun god. It was destroyed by Muhammad Ghaznavi and rebuilt later. The temple was designed so that at the time of the equinoxes, the first rays of the sun fell on the image of Surya. The temple is partially in ruins now but, despite the passage of time, it is still considered an architectural wonder. After our visit we drive on to Dasada where we stay for the next two nights.

The drive today will be long, about 8 hours dependent on the road conditions and the number of stops along the way. Gondal is a testimony to the great visionary ruler Sir Bhagwatsinhiji, who introduced social reforms, planned the development of Gondal town and created a model state of Saurashtra in late 19th and early 20th century. Gondal, the capital of the former princely State of Gondal, was ruled by the Jadeja Rajput clan, until the independence of India. It is a fortified town located on the river Gondali and is home to three fabulous palaces – one of which we stay in – and the Maharaja’s classic car collection. Here we see many of the amazing forts and palaces and the rather lovely old town: quiet and pretty, it puts one in mind of Bundi or Udaipur 20 years ago."

Champaner is an ancient fort located at the foothills of Pavagadh. Muhammad Begada decided to establish the new capital of Gujarat at this place in 1484 AD and changed the name of the town to Muhammadabad. It took 23 years to build the town and it had a meteoric rise to fame, attaining glory as a great town of western India. It also became a major trading centre producing fine silk, woven and dyed textiles and sword manufacturing. The entire landscape for miles around is scattered with remains of fort walls, ruined tombs, gardens, arches, pillars and wells and reminds one of other such great deserted towns of India: Mandu, Hampi, Orchha and Fatehpur Sikri. We will return to Vadodara for a late lunch before a transfer back to Ahmedabad where we have our farewell dinner."
