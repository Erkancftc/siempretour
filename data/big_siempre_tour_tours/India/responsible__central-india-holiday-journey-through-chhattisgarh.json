Due to the absence of tigers other species have flourished, with leopard and gaur having benefited the most. Tourism here is still in its nascent stages. You can go on an evening and morning safari in the sanctuary in search of wildlife. There is also the opportunity for forest treks, a rare thing in Indian wildlife sanctuaries and, we feel, the very best way fully to experience the sights and sounds of the jungle."
