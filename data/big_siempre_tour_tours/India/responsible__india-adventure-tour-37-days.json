  "generalInfo": "Starting in Delhi and finishing in Goa, this twin-focus trip takes in both north and south. Ride camels through Jaisalmer's desert and camp between the sand dunes, wander the bazaars of Jodhpur, witness pilgrims performing ancient ceremonies on the ghats of Varanasi and marvel at the iconic Taj Mahal in Agra. A plane whisks you into the south for the second leg of your trip. Cruise along the Kerala backwaters, explore Periyar National Park with its resident tigers and elephants, and end your adventure relaxing on the beaches of Goa. <br/><br/>In the north, experience old and new India in the bustling streets of Delhi, where ancient temples stand against billboards advertising Bollywood films. Discover the ancient forts, lake palaces, rural villages and colourful cities of Rajasthan: sandy red Jaisalmer, blue Jodhpur, white Udaipur and pink Jaipur. Then journey to Pushkar and Varanasi. Climb to hilltop temples at sunrise and cruise the Ganges to better understand these holy cities. In the south, Madurai’s bazaars and colourful, intricately carved Sri Meenakshi Temple is a must-see, as is the World Heritage-listed Virupaksha Temple in Hampi. Explore the historical trading post of Kochi, with its Chinese, Portuguese, Dutch and English influences. Then spend a relaxed few days enjoying beautiful Goa with its fishing villages and beaches, as a chilled-out end of this comprehensive journey.<br/><br/>More than just a sightseeing trip, this 37-day journey brings you closer to the people of India, too. Guided walking tours reveal the culture and history of each location and you’ll be travelling on public bus and train, for a chance to rub shoulders with local people. This also keeps costs down, so you can see more without spending more. You’ll sleep under the stars in the Thar dessert, on overnight sleeper trains and with a family on a homestay in Kerala, discovering authentic India and its people.<br/>",
