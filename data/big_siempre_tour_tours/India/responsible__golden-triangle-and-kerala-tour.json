  "generalInfo": "Experience a real taste of India on this tour.  The 'Golden Triangle' combines India’s most famous sights - historic Delhi, the legendary Taj Mahal at Agra and the Pink City of Jaipur.  In Kerala you visit the harbour city of Cochin, Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary in the Western Ghat mountains, spend two nights on a houseboat in Kerala's backwaters and finish at a beach for a couple of days relaxation.  This tour uses economy hotels, guesthouses and homestays so there are plenty of opportunities to upgrade if required.  There are airlines that allow an 'open jaw' flight into Delhi and out of Cochin, we have included Air India in the quote who fly direct to Delhi and back direct from Cochin..",
