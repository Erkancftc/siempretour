  "generalInfo": "Beginning in Malaysia’s fascinating KL we’ll explore the city’s highly eclectic sites from stately Victorian architecture to the iconic Petronas Towers and from the spectacular Batu Caves to the colourful local markets, street-life and of course street-food. From here we move to the Peninsula’s west coast and the twin World Heritage sites of Melaka (Malacca) and George Town (Penang). The former displays its old Portuguese and Dutch heritage while in Penang we’ll visit the Little India quarter and what is perhaps Southeast Asia’s most extensive and best preserved Chinatown as well as the island’s colonial-period British remains. <br/><br/>On our itinerary we’ll take a boat trip along the Malacca River to discover traditional village life, take a ride on Penang Hill’s famous funicular railway before hiking through the Hill’s lush rainforest and join a hands-on Malaysian cookery class in a tropical spice garden.   <br/><br/>Heading into the interior we’ll visit the picturesque cave temples (and a haunted Scottish castle no less) around rarely-visited Ipoh and hike through the magnificent landscapes of the old hill station, the Cameron Highlands, before completing our circular tour with a return to KL.<br/><br/>An exciting and varied introduction to this still little-known Southeast Asian country. <br/><br/>Features:<br/><br/>1. Vibrant KL; the street-life of Chinatown, classic Victorian architecture and iconic, ultra-modern Petronas Towers<br/>2. Visit the historic old Portuguese and Dutch port, and now UNESCO-listed, of Melaka (former Malacca)<br/>3.
