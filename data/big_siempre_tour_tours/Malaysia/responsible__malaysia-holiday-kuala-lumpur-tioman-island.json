  "generalInfo": "A wonderful 13 day break, this Malaysia holiday, to Kuala Lumpur and Tioman Island, combines the capital’s exciting architecture, thriving foodie scene and busy markets with a relaxing week on beautiful Tioman Island, off the east coast of the peninsula.<br/><br/>Kuala Lumpur became Malaysia’s capital in 1890, and the colonial buildings of Merdeka Square contrasts with the bold contemporary architecture found here, including the world famous Petronas Towers, the tallest building in the world. Home to three main cultures – Malay, Indian and Chinese – the city is diverse, with a Chinatown, Little India, mosques, temples and slick shopping malls. Here, stay in a beautiful villa style hotel on the edge of the city, in the quiet embassy district away from the hustle and bustle. Take a day to explore beyond the city, too, with a visit to the Forest Research Institute of Malaysia, where you can enjoy exploring and learning about the jungle.<br/><br/>After three nights in KL, you’ll travel to remote and delightful Tioman Island. This is a classically beautiful ‘paradise’ island, complete with blue seas and white sand beaches backed by jungle. The waters around the island have been declared a marine reserve and much of the jungle inland is protected as a wildlife reserve. Relax and enjoy the peace, or try scuba diving and snorkelling to inspect the coral reefs. You might also like to hike around the island, to spot some of the 45 species of mammal that live here. Visit a few of the eight villages, too, to see local life and chat with the islanders, too.<br/><br/>You will spend seven nights here in the stylishly rustic Japamala boutique resort, which has just 13 villas and chalets. It’s tucked away in the jungle and close to a beach with an offshore reef – a private and comfortable place with friendly service, where you can relax surrounded by nature. There are lovely restaurants – one sitting at the tip of a jetty – and an excellent spa. <br/>",
