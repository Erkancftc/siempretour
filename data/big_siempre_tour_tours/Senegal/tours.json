The coast is known for its great, sandy beaches. Inland, marvel at the stately baobab trees dotted across the Sahel landscape. <br/><br/>A six-day small group Senegal cultural holiday is an action-packed way to see the country. You’ll see multiple sites a day: walking among enigmatic standing stones one morning and cruising through mangrove forest in the afternoon. Thanks to your driver and the use of local tour guides, you can meet salt harvesters on Pink lake and village elders in Wolof or Fulani villages.<br/><br/>Enjoy cultural highlights: mooch around Dakar’s markets, and gawp at its enormous African Renaissance Monument. The past is never far away, and you can visit Goree Island, near Dakar, where 20 million people were shipped on to the Americas as part of the Atlantic slave trade. The House of Slaves, a museum and memorial to those who were sold into the trade. <br/><br/>Senegal’s natural beauty comes from its diverse landscapes. One of the best for birdlife is its Sine Saloum delta, where flamingos, herons, egrets and spoonbills vie for your attention on river trips.  <br/><br/>Travelling in a small group is a great way to move quickly between sights, and be unobtrusive as you visit small villages.<br/><br/>There’s no better place to end a trip than on a beach. The tour ends in Saly, a seaside resort with yellow sand and swaying palms, where you can enjoy the country’s more relaxing side after your busy travels.",

Sites include: the African Renaissance Monument: a 164 Feet high monument overlooking Dakar and is taller than the Statue of Liberty. The once controversial bronze statue is a popular attraction among locals as well as visitors. It features a man, woman and child pointing, a symbol of renewed African hope. The woman is now decently clothed, as conservative groups forced the lengthening of her formerly short skirt, at a cost of more than US$ 10 million, to more modest length. We will also visit the Independence Place, the heart of the city, you will pass by the presidential palace and the main cathedral. In the afternoon, depart on a 20 minutes ferry ride to visit the charming yet infamous Goree Island, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Explore the usually quiet Streets lined with pastel colored colonial era buildings from where you can enjoy amazing views over the Dakar bay. Among the most famous buildings here is the House of Slaves which records the painful history of Goree’s past. Observe the “Door of No Return” through which millions passed..

We will visit the Musée des Civilisations Noirs. Opened in December 2018, it is the realization of Léopold Sédar Senghor’s vision (the first president of independent Senegal, a poet, and Nobel Prize winner). The museum represents the historical and contemporary worldwide cultures, art, and soul of Black people, which he called Negritude. We will also see the Cathédrale Notre Dame des Victoires and Place de Souvenirs. The project to build the cathedral was started in 1910 and was consecrated on 2 February 1936. Our day continues as we travel to the port to board a ferry. We will be spending the night in Gorée, the island where slaves used to be housed before being shipped to the Americas. There are some restored buildings remaining that bear witness of those times. The Portuguese were the first to establish a presence on Gorée in?1450, where they built a small stone chapel. After the decline of the slave trade from Senegal in the 1770s and 1780s, the island became an important port for the shipment of peanuts, Arabic gum, ivory, and other products of a much more legitimate trade. Thanks to the nice breeze and the many restaurants and shops, Gorée is today a pleasant and quite trendy location. In the late afternoon and evening, when the other tourists are gone, we will experience the real feeling of this special island. Overnight at hotels in Gorée.

An exciting drive along the beach using 4x4 vehicles (depending on tides) will bring us to the largest fisherman village in Senegal.

It was the capital of all French West Africa colonies from 1895 until 1902 when the capital was moved to Dakar. From 1920 to 1957, it also served as the capital of the neighbouring colony of Mauritania. Saint Louis is located on two islands between the Senegal River and the ocean at the southern edge of the Sahara. It is rich with history, culture, geography, and architecture. Saint-Louis is seen as a bridge between the savanna and the desert, the ocean, the river, and the inland, between tradition and modernity, Islam and Christianity, Europe and Africa. The city and its people have a unique identity. \"No one comes without falling in love with the city,\" its people are proud to tell you. They also consider Saint-Louis as the birthplace of Senegalese Teranga, the Wolof word for hospitability. We explore the narrow lanes of Saint Louis by calash, just as locals do, and walk in the fisherman’s quarters. There will be time to stroll in the tiny avenues and enjoy the unique atmosphere of this old town.

This is a natural oasis formed by hundreds of miles of partially flooded land that has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Located between the Sahara and Ferlo desert it is the habitat and nesting site for over a million migratory and resident birds. Out of more than 400 species, pelicans and flamingos are the most common, whereas aquatic warblers are a bit less conspicuous as they migrate here from Europe. Djoudj National Bird Sanctuary is their single most important wintering site yet discovered. Apart from birds, there is also a wide range of wildlife such as warthogs and crocodiles. We will take a motorboat excursion led by a local guide-ornithologist. Depending on the season and taking into consideration the time of migrations and level of water, the visit to Djoudj may be replaced by a similar experience in Langue de Barbarie. This is a thin, sandy peninsula, adjacent to the Atlantic Ocean, located in western Senegal. The peninsula separates the ocean from the final section of the Senegal River and Langue de Barbarie National Park is home to an abundant variety of bird species and three species of turtle. In the afternoon, we will continue to the Ferlo Desert and explore the arid region where nomadic Fulani tribes herd large herds of zebu. The Fulani (also called Peul) are the largest nomadic tribe roaming the West African Savannahs, living in a vast area from Senegal to Chad. The origins of the tribe are still shrouded in mystery. In the afternoon a local guide will join us for a visit to the neighbouring villages and shelters. When the herds come back, we might even be invited to witness the milking process. Overnight in a camp made up of simple grass huts, managed by a local entrepreneur (all rooms with beds, mosquito nets, en-suite). (BLD) (Distances travelled today 150 km / driving time 4 hrs.)"
