Next, we’ll visit the Karim Khan Citadel from the outside. Built during the Zand Dynasty, this historical structure offers a glimpse into the past. We’ll also have some free time to explore and shop in the bustling Vakil Bazaar, filled with hundreds of stores, beautiful courtyards, and even an ancient caravanserai (Saray-e Moshir). Next, we’ll visit the beautiful garden surrounding the Tomb of Hafez, one of Iran’s most celebrated poets, to experience the essence of Persian literature. Hafez is renowned for his poetic mastery, which has left a lasting impression on readers worldwide. His poems evoke deep emotions, and the serene atmosphere surrounding his tomb adds to the sense of peace and tranquility that makes this visit truly special.

Famous for its mud-brick architecture, wind catchers, qanats, Zoroastrian heritage, silk production, special sweets, and much more, Yazd offers a unique glimpse into Iran’s rich history and culture. Along the way, we’ll make several stops. First, we’ll visit the legendary city of Persepolis, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the former capital of Darius the Great, founded in 518 BC. Persepolis remains one of the most impressive constructions of the ancient world. Next, we’ll head to the Necropolis (Naqsh-e Rostam), where the tombs of four of the most famous Achaemenid kings are carved into the rock. Afterward, we’ll continue to Pasargadae, another UNESCO World Heritage Site, where we can visit the Tomb of Cyrus the Great and explore the ruins of the former capital of the Achaemenid Empire. Though not as grand as Persepolis, Pasargadae offers a stunning viewpoint to overlook the site and the surrounding area. Finally, we’ll continue our journey to Yazd and check into our hotel."

        "description": "Yazd is one of the oldest continuously inhabited towns in Iran, recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Its silhouette is punctuated by minarets and ingeniously designed wind towers that capture desert breezes to cool homes during the hot summer months. Yazd is also the center of Iran’s Zoroastrian community, where we will begin our day’s sightseeing. At the Tower of Silence, we will learn about one of the traditions of this ancient pre-Islamic religion. Until the mid-1900s, the dead were transported to this tower, where they were left to decompose and be devoured by birds. Zoroastrian tradition considers a deceased body to be “unclean,” and this process of excarnation prevents contact with either fire or earth, both of which are regarded as sacred. At the still-active Zoroastrian Fire Temple, we will see a flame that is said to have been burning for the last 1,500 years. It is an important pilgrimage site for the faithful, and here our expert guide will offer additional insight into one of the world’s oldest monotheistic religions. After the temple, we will make a short trip to the Mehrban Polad Museum of Documents and Manuscripts.

Its silhouette is punctuated by minarets and ingeniously designed wind towers that capture desert breezes to cool homes during the hot summer months. Yazd is also the center of Iran’s Zoroastrian community, where we will begin our day’s sightseeing. At the Tower of Silence, we will learn about one of the traditions of this ancient pre-Islamic religion. Until the mid-1900s, the dead were transported to this tower, where they were left to decompose and be devoured by birds. Zoroastrian tradition considers a deceased body to be “unclean,” and this process of excarnation prevents contact with either fire or earth, both of which are regarded as sacred. At the still-active Zoroastrian Fire Temple, we will see a flame that is said to have been burning for the last 1,500 years. It is an important pilgrimage site for the faithful, and here our expert guide will offer additional insight into one of the world’s oldest monotheistic religions.

Home to nearly six million graves, this sacred site holds deep religious and historical significance and is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. We then continue south to the city of Nasiriyah. There, we will visit the Ziggurat of Ur, one of the best-preserved and most iconic monuments of ancient Mesopotamia. Dating back to the 21st century BC, this stepped pyramid was a temple dedicated to Nanna, the Sumerian moon god. The ziggurat’s massive structure and enduring design offer a remarkable glimpse into the spiritual life and architectural mastery of early civilizations in the region. Overnight in Nasiriyah."

        "description": "After breakfast in Nasiriyah, we set out to explore the Mesopotamian Marshes, the largest wetlands in the Middle East and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. These vast ecosystems are not only vital for biodiversity—supporting hundreds of species of birds and fish—but also home to the Marsh Arabs, who have lived here for millennia and are gradually returning to their ancestral lands. We’ll enjoy a traditional tea and spend time with local families, listening to their stories of life in the marshes. Then, we’ll take a boat ride aboard an Al-Mashhouf—a slender wooden boat used for centuries, gliding through the serene channels and reed mazes. For lunch, we’ll be welcomed into a reed house known as Al-Mutheef to enjoy Masgouf, a beloved southern Iraqi dish made from fish grilled over reeds. After this memorable cultural experience, we will drive back to Baghdad for the night. Overnight in Baghdad."

Standing over 50 meters tall with a dramatic spiraling ramp, this minaret is a powerful symbol of early Islamic ingenuity and ambition. We will then visit the nearby Abu Dulaf Mosque, another significant example of Abbasid architecture, noted for its large courtyard and historical significance. Later in the day, we head further north to explore Hatra, a remarkable ancient city that once flourished in the 2nd century AD. Known for its fusion of Hellenistic and Roman architectural styles with Eastern decorative elements, Hatra’s monumental ruins, recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, offer a stunning glimpse into the past. Though it was destroyed in the 3rd century, the grandeur of its temples and fortifications remains intact. After a full day of exploration, we return to Baghdad for the night."

        "description": "Yazd is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in Iran. Its silhouette is punctuated by minarets and ingeniously designed wind towers that capture desert breezes to cool homes during the hot summer months. Yazd is also the center of the Zoroastrian community in Iran, where we will start the day of sightseeing. At the Tower of Silence (also called Dakhmeh), we will discover one of the rites of this ancient pre-Islamic religion. Until the mid-1900s, when a man dies, his immortal soul, three days later, is carried away by the wind to the place of judgment, on the bridge of Chinvat. Corpses were considered impure objects that could not be put in the ground, in water, or even thrown into fire without infecting one of these three elements. Only the king's corpse was divine and therefore entitled to a tomb. At the still-active Zoroastrian Fire Temple (Atashkadeh), we will see a flame that has been burning for 1500 years. It is an important place of pilgrimage for the faithful and our expert guide will offer you additional insight into one of the oldest monotheistic religions in the world. In the Amir Chakhmaq Square, we will see an impressive Hussainiya – a congregational hall for Shia commemoration ceremonies. With three levels of recessed alcoves, all perfectly proportioned, its façade is one of the city's most photographed landmarks.

The houses of Abyaneh bear an ancient architectural style, featuring the use of clay as the construction material and latticed windows and wooden doors. Our overland journey continues in Isfahan. As the 17th-century capital of the Safavid Empire, Isfahan was one of the world’s greatest cities– architecturally striking, wealthy beyond imagine, and politically powerful with Europeans, Ottomans, Indians, and Chinese coming to its court– the heart of a vast Persian Empire that stretched from the Euphrates River in present-day Iraq to the Oxus River in Afghanistan. Indeed, its grandeur inspired the rhyming proverb, Isfahan Nesf-e Jahan (Isfahan is half of the World).

For example, the famous bridges of Sio-se-pol and Khajou.

This is one of the oldest congregational mosques in the country, and its construction and embellishment over the past twelve centuries illustrate several important periods in Islamic architecture. In the city’s Armenian quarter, we’ll delve more deeply into the region’s complex history as we will visit several churches including the 17th-century Vank Church with its lavishly decorated interior and unique blend of Islamic and European architectural elements. Also, we will visit the Music Museum where we will find a collection of local and national Iranian instruments. In the afternoon, we will visit Hasht Behesht Palace and Garden. At this octagonal palace, we can see gangs of retired men who spend their free time chatting with the visitors."

But set along an ancient trade route, Meybod also offers several fascinating sites to visit including its Narin Castle, Caravanserai, Ice-House, and Pigeon Tower. Our first stop in Meybod is at the Narin Castle a 2000-year fortress from the Sassanid Dynasty. Then, continue to the Shah Abbasi Caravanserai, a typical Safavid style, this ancient desert Inn features verandahs, shaded passageways, and nearly 100 rooms– some of which are now used as artisan workshops. After that, at the local Ice-House, we’ll learn about the thick-clay construction and subterranean chamber that allowed residents to have ice and food storage before refrigeration– even during the intense desert heat of summer. Our last stop before leaving Meybod is at the Pigeon Tower. There, we will get more familiar with the ancient system of Agriculture to fertilize. Continue to Yazd.

        "description": "Yazd is one of the oldest continuously inhabited towns in Iran which is registered in the UNESCO World Heritage Site. Its silhouette is punctuated by minarets and ingeniously designed wind towers that capture desert breezes to cool homes during the hot summer months. Yazd is also the center of Iran’s Zoroastrian Community, which is where we’ll begin the day’s sightseeing. At the Tower of Silence, we’ll learn about one of the traditions of this ancient pre-Islamic religion. Until the mid-1900s, the dead were transported to this tower where they were left to decompose and be devoured by birds. Zoroastrian tradition considers a deceased body to be “unclean” and this process of excarnation prevents contact with either fire or earth– both of which are considered to be sacred. At the still-active Zoroastrian Fire Temple, we will see a flame that is said to have been burning for the past 1,500 years. It’s an important pilgrimage site for the faithful and here our expert guide will offer additional insight into one of the world’s oldest monotheistic religions. In Amir Chakhmaq Square, we’ll see a very impressive Hussainiya– a congregation hall for Shia commemoration ceremonies. With three tiers of recessed alcoves, all perfectly proportioned, its facade is one of the city’s most photographed landmarks. The next place to visit is the Jame Mosque of Yazd (Friday Mosque), built in 1324, where we can gaze upon the tallest minarets in the country. Just beside the mosque, we have time to stroll in the Fahadan District. There, we can get familiar with the desert houses' architecture. Among the many other historic sites to be seen in Yazd are beautiful old homes and the Dowlat Abad Garden (UNESCO World Heritage Site) Standing by the garden’s long reflecting pool, we’ll be shaded by ancient cypress trees. Ahead of us is an 18th-century hexagonal pavilion with a beautiful stained-glass window and a graceful wind tower– the tallest in Iran. All around are flowering fruit trees and other ornamental plants and trees. TRADITIONAL SPORTS EXPERIENCE Tonight, we will watch a Zurkhaneh performance. Zurkhaneh is a form of traditional martial arts in Iran, where men practice calisthenics and other body-building exercises in a ring. In 2010 Pahlevani and Zoorkhaneh rituals were inscribed on the representative list of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity."

There was no more impressive construction in the ancient world than Persepolis, except perhaps the Karnak in Egypt. From here, we will drive a couple of miles away to the Necropolis (Naqsh-e-Rustam), where Darius and his successors are buried. Carved into the side of a cliff, the site is extraordinary in its magnitude and sheer ambition and does not disappoint even after the impressive Persepolis. Back to Shiraz. We will pass by the Quran Gate, one of the most famous gates in Shiraz where we will have a short stop to take a photo. An afternoon visit to the Tomb of Saadi will be our today's last visit. Saadi was one of the major Persian poets and literary figures, born in Shiraz in the 12th century. He is widely recognized as one of the greatest poets of the classical Iranian literary tradition around the world."

Its silhouette punctuated by minarets and the ingeniously-designed wind towers that capture desert breezes to cool homes during the hot summer months. Yazd is also the center of Iran’s Zoroastrian community, which is where you’ll begin the day’s sightseeing. At the Tower of Silence, you’ll learn about one of the traditions of this ancient pre-Islamic religion. Until the mid-1900s, the dead were transported to this tower where they were left to decompose and be devoured by birds. Zoroastrian tradition considers a deceased body to be “unclean” and this process of excarnation prevents contact with either fire or earth– both of which are considered to be sacred. At the still-active Zoroastrian Fire Temple, you’ll see a flame that is said to have been burning for the past 1,500 years. It’s an important pilgrimage site for the faithful and here our expert guide will offer additional insight into one of the world’s oldest monotheistic religions. In Amir Chakhmaq Square, you’ll see a very impressive Hussainiya– a congregation hall for Shia commemoration ceremonies. With three tiers of recessed alcoves, all perfectly proportioned, its facade is one of the city’s most photographed landmarks. The next place to visit is the Friday Mosque, built in 1324, where you can gaze upon the tallest minarets in the country. Among the many other historic sites to be seen in Yazd are beautiful old homes and the Dowlat Abad Garden. Standing by the garden’s long reflecting pool, you’ll be shaded by ancient cypress trees. Ahead of you is an 18th-century hexagonal pavilion with a beautiful stained glass window and a graceful wind tower– the tallest in Iran. All around are flowering fruit trees and other ornamental plants and trees."

Then, we will have some stop on our way to visit the Legendary City of Persepolis, the former capital of Darius the Great which was founded in 512 BC. There was no more impressive construction in the ancient world than Persepolis, except perhaps the Karnak in Egypt. Darius built the terrace, Apadana (great audience hall), Tachana (a palace), and the Monumental Staircases; his son, Xerxes, added the Harem and the Hall of 100 Columns. Alexander the Great entered Persepolis in January 330 BC and then committed an uncharacteristic act of wanton destruction that still mystifies historians today, burning the mighty city to the ground. Though a shadow of its former self, the soaring pillars, terraces and sculptures of Persepolis still remain, but probably most impressive are the bas reliefs which line the site, telling the story of ancient governors and kings that came to Persepolis to pay tribute to the Persian Emperors. Finally, we will drive to Shiraz and will go to the hotel to take a rest."

        "description": "After breakfast, you will visit Nasir-al-Mulk Mosque (Pink Mosque) which is a few steps far from Vakil Bazaar. It was built at Mirza Hassan Ali Nasir-al Mulk’s command (one of the lords of the Qajar Dynasty); it took 12 years to complete it in 1888. Its interior reveals a magnificent masterpiece of design with stunning colors. This is a space where light and worship intertwine. The mosque comes to life with the sunrise and the colors dance throughout the day like whirling Dervishes. It reflects on the ground, walls, the arches, and the towering spires. It even reflects on the visitors as if a colorful ball is hit by the first sun ray and has exploded into thousands of butterflies all around. Continue your exploration in Shiraz at the beautiful orange-scented Narenjestan Garden, laid out in the 19th century during the Qajar Dynasty. Then, you will visit Karim Khan Citadel from outside. It was built during the Zand era. You’ll have time to explore and shop in the bustling Vakil Bazaar, home to hundreds of stores, beautiful courtyards, and even an ancient caravanserai. You will end your visit on a tranquil note in the lovely garden-tomb of Sa’adi and garden-tomb of Hafez, two of our most outstanding poets to feel the taste of Persian Literature. Hafez is one of the great poets who has impressed everyone with his mastery. His poems give us a special feeling and the peace in his tomb is really outstanding. Sa’adi is a poet, philosopher, and mystic who is known as the father of alternative tourism. About seven centuries ago, he travelled to different countries and cities. Then, he collected all his experiences in verses and rhymed prose in two books named Boustan and Golestan. These two books give you lots of inspiration and information. We will get a chance to pay homage to tombs of these great poets. Tonight, we will take the train to Isfahan."

        "description": "As the 17th-century capital of the Safavid Empire, Isfahan was one of the world’s greatest cities– architecturally striking, wealthy beyond imagine, and politically powerful with Europeans, Ottomans, Indians, and Chinese coming to its court– the heart of a vast Persian Empire that stretched from the Euphrates River in present-day Iraq to the Oxus River in Afghanistan. Indeed, its grandeur inspired the rhyming proverb, Isfahan nesf e jahan (Isfahan is half of the World). Your exploration starts in Imam Square. This 17th-century site is one of the largest public spaces in the world. Here in the square, you’ll visit the 17th-century Shah Mosque, revered as a masterpiece of Islamic architecture and easily recognized by its magnificent tile-work and soaring cupola and minarets. You will also visit Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque, also known as the Ladies Mosque, as it was built for the Shah's harem, renowned for brightly colored domed ceiling, where the light creates the image of a peacock. In the Ali Qapu Palace, you’ll marvel at its beautiful music rooms and the balconies where Safavid kings would sit to enjoy the polo matches unfolding in the square below. You’ll end your exploration of the square by visiting the Qeisarieh Bazaar. With hundreds of local vendors that specialize in traditional arts and crafts, it’s a wonderful place to shop for pottery, enamel, jewelry and delicately inlaid board games. Next up is Chehel Sotun Palace. Set in a landscaped and forested park in front of a tranquil reflecting pool, this graceful pavilion was built by Shah Abbas II for entertainment and court receptions. Entering through a portico with twenty slender wooden columns, you’ll discover soaring halls embellished with frescoes, paintings and mosaics; the Hall of Mirrors is especially breathtaking! In the city’s Armenian quarter, you’ll delve more deeply into the region’s complex history as you will visit several churches including the 17th-century Vank Cathedral with its lavishly decorated interior and unique blend of Islamic and European architectural elements. You will finish your exploration of the city by visiting two of the centuries-old, still elegant bridges that span Zayandeh River, namely, Si-o-se Pol and Khaju Bridges."

        "description": "Leaving Isfahan behind, we’ll travel to Kashan, a town originally famous for its textiles and ceramic production, but now better known for Fin Garden and its extensive bazaar and hammams. Fin Garden (A UNESCO World Heritage Site) is our first stop; a relaxing and visually impressive Persian garden with water channels all passing through a central pavilion. There is also the chance to buy some rose water, a local specialty, outside of the site. Then, you will visit Boroujerdi Traditional House. It was built about 130 years ago in the reign of Qajar dynasty (1857) by Iranian famous architect Ustad Ali Maryam. The owner was Haj Seyed Hasan Natanzi, a well-known merchant who mostly dealt with people of Boroujerd city. That’s why the house is known as Boroujerd's House. Afterwards, we will visit the bazaar area, a widespread complex filled with hammams and mosques; one hammam has been converted to a traditional teahouse where we will stop for those who need a break from shopping. Late in the afternoon, we will drive towards Imam Khomeini International Airport."

As the ocean dried up, it left behind a salt layer as much as 6 to 7 kilometers thick. Over time, the salt was covered by mud, but its power made it push through over the years and created the salt domes in this desert, which is definitely a unique phenomenon worth exploring while you are in Iran!<br/><br/>This Iran tour package is designed to show you the modernity of cities like Tehran, the calmness of the sandhills, and the uniqueness of Tabas villages along our way to get to one of the unique desert cities in the world, Yazd.",
