      "description": "After breakfast, we will visit the Nasir-al-Mulk Mosque (Pink Mosque). Its interior reveals a magnificent masterpiece of design with stunning colors. This is a space where light and worship intertwine. Then we will visit the Karim Khan Citadel from outside, which was built during the Zand Dynasty. We’ll have time to explore the Vakil Complex and shop in the bustling Vakil Bazaar, home to hundreds of stores, beautiful courtyards, and even an ancient caravanserai (Saray-e Moshir). After that, we’ll visit the lovely garden Tomb of Hafez, one of our most outstanding poets to feel the taste of Persian Literature. Hafez is one of the great poets who impressed everyone with his mastery. His poems give us a special feeling and the peace in his tomb is outstanding.

Very welcoming and friendly, this experience also allows you to discover the essence of Iran through a Persian family, recipes, stories, and the pleasure of sharing a meal."

      "description": "We have a full day of driving today to reach our destination of Isfahan. On our way to Isfahan, we will have some stops on our way to visit the legendary City of Persepolis (UNESCO World Heritage Site), the former capital of Darius the Great founded in 512 BC. There was no more impressive construction in the ancient world, except perhaps the Karnak in Egypt. Later, we will journey to the Necropolis (Naghsh-e Rostam), to view the astonishing tombs of the four Achaemenid kings: Darius the Great, Xerxes, Artaxerxes, and Darius II. Carved into the sacred Mount Rahmat, these tombs are a sight to behold. En route we will have a short stop to visit Pasargadae (UNESCO World Heritage Site), the Tomb of Cyrus the Great, and the former capital of the Achaemenid Empire. We will spend some time exploring the site and though not as striking as Persepolis, there is a great viewpoint where we can look over the site and the surrounding area. Continue to Isfahan and check in to our hotel."

      "description": "Our exploration starts in the Chehel Sotun Palace (UNESCO World Heritage Site). Set in a landscaped and forested park in front of a tranquil reflecting pool, this graceful pavilion was built by Shah Abbas II for entertainment and court receptions. Entering through a portico with twenty slender wooden columns, we’ll discover soaring halls embellished with frescoes, paintings, and mosaics; the Hall of Mirrors is especially breathtaking! Next up is the UNESCO World Heritage Site, Naghsh-e Jahan Square (Royal Square). This 17th-century site is one of the largest public spaces in the world. Here in the square, we’ll visit the 17th-century Shah Mosque, revered as a masterpiece of Islamic architecture and easily recognized by its magnificent tile-work and soaring cupola and minarets. We will also visit Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque, also known as the Ladies Mosque, as it was built for the Shah's harem, renowned for its brightly colored domed ceiling, where the light creates the image of a peacock. In the Ali Qapu Palace, we’ll marvel at its beautiful music rooms and the balconies where Safavid kings would sit to enjoy the polo matches unfolding in the square below. We’ll end our exploration of the square by visiting the Qeisarieh Bazaar. With hundreds of local vendors that specialize in traditional arts and crafts, it’s a wonderful place to shop for pottery, enamel, jewelry, and delicately inlaid board games. The last place to visit is one of the two famous historic bridges, the Sio-se Pol (33 Bridge). This beautifully designed bridge should definitely be visited at night when the bridge lights are on!"

Khajou Bridge is famous for its tiling and brickwork decoration. Then, we’ll travel to Kashan, a town originally famous for its Textiles, Rose Water and Ceramic production. Our first stop in Kashan is the Fin Garden (UNESCO World Heritage Site), a relaxing and visually stunning Persian garden with water channels all leading through a central pavilion. There is also the opportunity to buy rose water, a local specialty, outside the garden. We then visit the Tabatabaei Traditional House. It was built about 130 years ago during the reign of the Qajar dynasty (1857) by the famous Iranian architects. Continue our journey to Tehran."

      "description": "This morning, we will take you to a World Heritage Site, the lavish Golestan Palace. Built during the Qajar Dynasty, which rose to power in the late 1700s, this fabulous walled complex is centered on a landscaped garden with tranquil pools. Many of the elements we’ll admire today, date to the 19th century when local Qajari architects and artisans were looking to integrate traditional Persian style with elements of Western and Russian origin. The palace buildings are among the oldest in modern Tehran and they are still regarded as a crowning achievement of the Qajar era. Then, we will walk around the Tehran Grand Bazaar. The second largest grand bazaar in Iran after Tabriz.
