With hundreds of local vendors that specialize in traditional arts and crafts, it’s a wonderful place to shop for pottery, enamel, jewelry, and delicately inlaid board games. Just beside the Bazaar, there is the Assarkhaneh Museum. In ancient Iran, the special mills used to grind certain ingredients such as turmeric and pepper were called Assarkhaneh. Also, distilleries were used to extract the extract of oily substances such as castor. The word Asarkhaneh means a place of extraction, and the function of these distilleries can be considered similar to oil extraction factories."
