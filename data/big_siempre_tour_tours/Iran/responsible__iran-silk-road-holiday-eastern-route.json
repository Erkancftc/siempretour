      "description": "To get better acquainted with the historic hotels and hostels in Iran, we started our exploration of the Silk Road with a visit to the caravanserais (UNESCO World Heritage Site). One of the most famous caravanserais is called “Robat-e Sharaf” (140 km). Sharaf is a museum of brick and stucco decorations (UNESCO World Heritage Site). On the other hand, this caravanserai is one of the most important elements and facilities of the \"Silk Road\" and represents a valuable document in this regard. On the way back to Mashhad we will visit the second most important caravanserai, “Robat-e Mahi” (120 km after Mashhad). Like Robat-e Sharaf, this caravanserai is considered one of the architectural masterpieces of the Seljuk period, characterized by the varied use of bricks and stucco. The remains of the plaster, the variety of brickwork on the roofs, the format of the inscription, and the Islamic motifs make it a valuable historical work. Evening visit to the Holy Shrine of Imam Reza, the 8th leader of the Shiite Muslims."
