    "generalInfo": "Few wildlife destinations can match the allure and mystique of the fabled Masai Mara. This is where the modern concept of safari took root; it’s also among the earliest places explored by our distant African ancestors.<br/><br/>The endless grasslands of the Mara are a truly iconic landscape – studded with lone acacia trees and rocky kopjes, they offer endless vistas – and are home to a vast array of wildlife, in numbers that simply can’t be found elsewhere.<br/><br/>Even outside of the Great Wildebeest Migration – which passes through this area as part of its constant cycle – there is a great deal of resident wildlife to look out for, and game drives in the Mara ecosystem are always rewarding. The Mara is also home to the Maasai, one of Africa’s most recognizable tribal groups, and the visionary custodians of this special place.<br/><br/>Our ‘The Best of the Mara’ safari allows you to stay at three different camps, and see the Mara ecosystem from multiple perspectives. Like all our suggested safaris, The Best of the Mara can be customized to meet your specific requirements and tailored to focus on your interests. Talk to our journey specialists about adapting or extending this itinerary to create a Kenyan safari that’s as unique as you are.",

About Lake Naivasha A freshwater lake, the highest of the string of lakes that glitter down the vast trench of the Great Rift Valley, Lake Naivasha is infamous for its rapidly shifting moods. Enigmatic, and dotted with floating islands of Nile cabbage (water hyacinth) and papyrus, Lake Naivasha has no known outlet, and legends abound regarding the vast tunnels that supposedly run beneath its surface. Towered over by the brooding bulk of Mount Longonot (2,776 m), and featuring a submerged volcanic crater known as Crescent Island, this beautiful lake is best known for its high numbers of water birds. Also, for the haunting cry of the fish eagles, which feed on the black bass and tilapia of its waters. Overnight at Naivasha Sopa Lodge-Standard room-LDBB Distance/drive time: 240 km / 3½ hours"

        "description": "Nairobi to Lake Naivasha and the Masai Mara After loading the truck with all our gear, we depart Nairobi this morning and head north into one of Africa’s greatest natural features, the East African Rift Valley. Stretching from the Dead Sea in Jordan down to Mozambique in Southern Africa, our first view is from the top of a steep escarpment. Overland trips through East Africa will allow you to experience some of the most dramatic scenery in the world, and the Rift Valley is a definite highlight. The valley floor seems to sweep on forever and is dotted with volcanic peaks, shimmering lakes and countless springs. Our journey takes us into the heart of the Rift Valley to Lake Naivasha. We camp near the lake shore where Hippos sometimes feed at night! Here you can walk to Elsamere, the house of Joy Adamson - of Elsa the Lion and Born Free fame, and enjoy a film of her life - and cream teas! You can also hire mountain bikes and cycle or walk through Hells Gate National Park - the only game reserve in Kenya in which you are permitted to do so. Or for a less active but equally enjoyable game viewing experience - visit the Crater Lake Game Sanctuary. Both offer excellent scenery and opportunities to spot hyrax, abundant bird and plant life along with several types of gazelle, impala and eland. Next we head to one of Africa’s most famous wildlife reserves, the Masai Mara. Famous for its dense concentration of animals and birds, and for its important place in the annual wildebeest migration (July to October), you will have a great chance to see lions, elephants, buffalo, leopards, cheetahs and also rhino if you are lucky. We include a morning and afternoon safari, while an additional evening safari may be available to arrange locally on our arrival day if we have made good time."

A guided walk in the forest is included here. Next, we make our first border crossing as we cross from Kenya into Uganda and continue on to camp near Jinja - Uganda's adventure playground. Here, on the edge of Lake Victoria, the Nile begins its 6700km journey to the sea. We spend the next few days a little downstream from the source of the Nile. This is a spectacular area and a superb place to go whitewater rafting or kayaking. You can also organise quad biking, horse riding or a visit to a local education project."

As we travel through Uganda, we'll pass through a number of small towns and villages; Mpigi, where you will see roadside stalls manufacturing and selling traditional musical instruments; Kyazanga, where we can buy fresh rotisserie and roasted meat and vegetables, as well as roasted plantain bananas. We will also be able to make a photo stop where our route crosses the Equator. Our destination is Kalinzu Forest Reserve. Here we have a great opportunity to take an optional hike into the forest to see some habituated chimpanzee families. Permits need to be booked several months in advance, so please get in touch if you would like to add this experience. Only 12 permits are issued each day to minimize disruption to the animals, and a local guide will take you through the forest to find the group. You then have an hour watching and following them before returning to camp. You should see many other monkeys, birds and other wildlife during the trip too. If you don’t book the chimp trek, then various other walks are available in the forest to see waterfalls, birds, primates, and other wildlife. The forest has four main paths for nature walks, including the valley trail, the waterfall path, the river trail, and the Palm trail. These can all be arranged when you get there. After our day in the forest, we take a short drive to Katunguru on the edge of Queen Elizabeth National Park. We have a free morning here to take a wide range of optional village walks, learning about the culture of the Basongara, Bakonjo and Banyabindi who live in Queen Elizabeth National Park. Then in the afternoon, we include a guided boat cruise on the Kazinga Channel, where you can look out for hippos, crocodiles, elephants, buffalos, waterbucks and a huge range of bird species. Next, we spend the morning on a game drive on our truck, as we drive south through Queen Elizabeth National Park and on to our next stop, Lake Bunyonyi."

Getting up close to these amazing creatures is truly a once in a lifetime experience and one of the highlights of the trip. You have the opportunity to trek to see the Gorillas in Uganda (bookable as an Add on). It is estimated that only around 700 of these gentle giants remain. This mountainous area on the borders of Rwanda, Uganda and Zaire (now renamed Democratic Republic of Congo) is their only natural habitat and they are periodically threatened by poachers and political instability in the area. One permit allows you to spend about 50 to 60 minutes with one of the gorilla families. Trekking to find them in groups of 8 people can take anywhere from half an hour to 5 hours. The organisations and well-trained guides that continually monitor and protect the families are conscientious and responsible. We will base ourselves near the village of Kabale which will give you the opportunity to trek the Mountain Gorillas and visit the beautiful Lake Bunyonyi, where you will have the opportunity to visit a pygmy village. If permits are limited, we may adjust the itinerary slightly to spend an extra day here to give everyone in the group the opportunity to see the gorillas. After our latest forest adventure, we pass through mountain ranges and cross the border into Rwanda and continue to the capital, Kigali. Here we can visit the genocide memorial, which is a moving and humbling experience."

It is also one of the Ugandan parks to offer adventurous night game drives, which you will have the option to take.

A morning safari into the park is also available the next day. From Lake Mburo we drive on to Uganda’s capital, Kampala. Kampala has had a turbulent past, but these days it is a friendly and safe city. We have a free evening to spend in local cafes and nightspots where you can get to know the local people. Then we head north to see the spectacular Sipi Falls. There are three waterfalls here on the Sipi River as it cascades into the Kyoga Basin from the slopes of Mount Elgon.

Your home is a luxury eco camp with comfortable beds, a terrace and WiFi. Raised up from the plain by a natural escarpment, the camp commands fantastic views over a watering hole, so even when you’re not on a safari drive, you’re still watching the animals come and go.<br/><br/>The camp is in Mara Naboisho Conservancy, bordering the Masai Mara National Reserve. There’s a vast area of rolling grassland to explore with your expert Maasai guide. Embark on drives – including a special nocturnal safari, and even go a walking safari which culminates in a picnic right out in the savannah. <br/><br/>The Naboisho Conservancy is the second largest conservancy in Kenya. The land is leased from Maasai families, meaning that nearly 600 Maasai households benefit from guaranteed monthly income. Your trip supports the conservancy model. On your holiday you’ll get a chance to visit the guiding school, which provides sustainable and sought-after employment opportunities to young people in the area. <br/><br/>The camp is suitable for children aged seven and up, and you’ll get the helping hand of a guide to keep your children safe so that you can relax. Children aged 12 and over can join in the walking safari; younger children can be entertained with safari-themed activities back at camp. The rest of the trip is designed to suit families – so you can all experience an amazing African safari together, whether for the first time, or for an experience that feels like the first time all over again.",

Owing to the terrain and need to explore to find the gorillas, our trek doesn’t follow a path; instead, our guides cut a route through the undergrowth. After a safety briefing, we are assigned to a gorilla family group and begin our trek. Expect a minimum of three hours of walking on irregular terrain; steep ascents and descents over muddy slopes are the norm. Strong footwear is essential, and we recommend hiring a local porter to help you carry your bag/camera equipment and provide a steady, supportive hand (porters are arranged and paid for locally on the day). Seeing wild mountain gorillas in their natural habitat is an experience you will never forget. An adult male can weigh up to 430lb (195kg), a female up to 220lb (100kg), and a male can reach 5ft 7in (1.7m) tall. They are almost exclusively vegetarian and quite destructive eaters, which makes them unpopular with the farmers lower down the mountain as they have been known to wreck a whole field of crops just to eat one plant. For this reason, and poaching, the gorillas are very carefully protected. Gorillas are gentle creatures and are not known to attack unless very severely provoked. The family groups we trek to see are habituated to human presence but to prevent over familiarisation our time with them is limited to one hour. If the permits for gorilla families close to where we stay are unavailable, there may be more permits for other areas of the park, although this will mean a longer drive to the start of the trek.

In the morning after early breakfast depart to Lake Naivasha, the only fresh water lake within Africa's Great Rift Valley, famous for its vast flocks of exotic bird life, hippos and fish. On arrival, check-in & pick up packed lunch and drive to Magahi Olorgesailie Prehistoric site and later return for dinner and overnight at Lake Naivasha Sopa Lodge. Lake Naivasha is a freshwater lake in the Kenya section of Africa’s Great Rift Valley, and is located north west of Nairobi with the town of Naivasha on its north eastern shore. At 1,890 meters (6,200 ft) above sea level, the lake is at the highest point in the Kenyan rift, and is set in a complex geological combination of volcanic rocks and sedimentary deposits from a much larger Pleistocene era lake. Because the outlet for this ancient lake, now called Njorwa Gorge, is today much higher than the lake, the original Lake Naivasha must have indeed been a truly vast expanse of water. The gorge now forms the entrance to the Hell’s Gate National Park which, for obvious reasons, today contains some spectacular examples of water and weather-worn rock formations as well as an abundance of flora and fauna to include some extremely rare, resident breeding pairs of Lammergeyers, otherwise known as Bearded vultures. Lake Naivasha is home to a wide variety of wildlife including a sizeable population of hippos which usually invade our property during their nightly forays for food. Being a freshwater lake, it also has a healthy fish population to include Black bass, Tilapia and Crayfish which attract a variety of fish-eating birds such as Long-tailed and Great Cormorants, along with Fish Eagles, Pelicans, and various types of Kingfishers. Naivasha is also a good place to see the Grey-backed fiscal. This bird replaces the Long-tailed Fiscal in areas with higher rainfall. Also to be seen in the area is the Black-lored Babbler. The Naivasha race tends to show pale tipped feathers on their heads which gives their appearance a somewhat frosty or haloed effect, and it is believed that this variation may be the result of hybridization with Northern Pied Babblers at some point in the past.

Jozani is home to other species including Syke’s monkey’s, small buck and bushpigs. The elusive Zanzibar leopard (last sited several years ago) is said to feed here at night – perhaps this is why the reserve is only open during the day?! Jozani has an excellent nature trail. Jozani is the island’s only remaining complete forest. With evergreen thickets, mangrove boardwalks, succulents and broadleaf varieties, the forest is a botanists delight. Jozani Forest has a rich diversity of flora and fauna, with a huge variety of wildlife in and around the forest. There are large troops of the rare endemic Red Colobus Monkeys (Procolobus Kirkii) one of the most endangered monkey species in the world. Just down the road is the pioneering Zanzibar Butterfly Centre. Providing income for local farmers – who previously relied on mangoes and were over farming the forest- this small but delightful centre provides pupae to butterfly collectors globally. It generates valuable sustainable income for the farmers, and re-skills them. Next door is the Zala conservation park, a private conservation and education project, with details of the indigenous animals of the region. A small contribution is required on entrance to both places. The best times to visit are early morning or dusk, and the forest is at its most abundant between May- July and December – January.

The Island has sandy beaches and is covered in lush vegetation making it prefect habit for Island and sea birds. The surrounding sea offers some lovely opportunities with beautiful coral formations. The island is perfect for nature lovers. The Islands most famous inhabitants are the giant tortoises. These endangered animals are not native to Africa but to the Seychelles and Galapagos Island. Originally the Prison Island tortoises were brought from Aldabra in the Seychelles to help increase the conservation efforts by starting a new breeding population. Tortoise populations started to decline many years ago when sailors used to collect them to carry on the ships as a fresh protein source as the tortoises could survive many weeks or months without food. Unfortunately, these days the tortoise decline is due to habitat destruction and poaching. Location: -Stone Town, Hotel: Serena Zanzibar, Room: Prime Room, Board: Breakfast"

With an altitude of over 2,500 metres/8,202 feet, the air is noticeably cooler compared to Nairobi and the rolling hills are covered in dense forests and open moorland. After around four hours, we'll reach the Aberdare Country Club where we'll break for lunch.

After lunch, it's a short transfer to one of Kenya's more unusual safari properties, The Ark. Modelled after Noah's Ark, The Ark features four viewing decks with balconies and vast viewing windows to provide superb game-watching, all from the comfort of the lodge. Keep an eye out for your first glimpse of elephants on your way in. After settling into our rooms, there's plenty of time to head to one of the viewing areas or down to the bunker to quietly watch the lodge's floodlit waterhole, which attracts a host of wildlife including elephants, buffalos, monkeys, warthogs, baboons and on occasions hyenas. From here, you can also spot forest birds including hornbills, wagtails and giant kingfishers. Before dinner at our lodge, we'll have an informal talk on the local flora and fauna and the wildlife that inhabits the Aberdare National Park. Going to bed early doesn't mean missing the action either. During the night, the resident ranger stays on watch and will buzz your room if an interesting animal comes to the waterhole - listen out for one ring for an elephant, two for a rhino, three for leopard and four for other unusual sightings.

The heart of the lodge is an expansive bar, lounge and dining area with an open deck and swimming pool. There's a complimentary bar and meals can be taken at a time of your choosing. After being shown around, we'll head down to the waterhole right next to the camp which attracts elephants, buffalos and occasionally even leopards, we'll then head out for a game drive within the conservancy. You're welcome to dip in and out of the scheduled drives as you wish. Early morning game drives generally leave the lodge around 6.30am, taking advantage of the cooler temperatures to maximize game viewing and return approximately three hours later - just in time for breakfast. Afternoon game drives depart around 4pm and return at sunset, after which you can freshen up and gather for pre-dinner drinks. All meals are included at the lodge."

The road, the main artery between the capital, the Rift Valley and ultimately Uganda, heads northwest. A highlight of the journey is the first glimpse of the huge Rift Valley emptiness just past Limuru, at the top of the escarpments of the valley. Below, the acacia-scattered Kedong Valley bed conveys a neat and archetypal snapshot of the African landscape. Further away Mount Longonot, Hell's Gate National Park and Lake Naivasha may be glimpsed, while the plains seem to sweep on forever to the south. Lake Naivasha is the furthest south of the lakes. Proceeding north the next is Lake Elementaita, then Lake Nakuru, followed by Lake Bogoria and Lake Baringo. Approximate journey time 2-6 hours, depending on the destination. Route details and journey times may vary depending on road conditions. Discover Naivasha. Derived from the Masai name \"Nai'posha\", meaning \"rough water\" in reference to the sudden storms that may come up over the lake, Lake Naivasha covers nearly 139 km²and is surrounded by a marsh of 64 km². With an altitude of 1890 m above sea level, it is, along with Baringo, one of only two freshwater lakes in the region, enabling the irrigation of the fertile volcanic soil of its surroundings. Spread around the lake are rich green plains supporting zebra, hartebeest, waterbuck, buffalo, impala, giraffes, monkeys and, at night, hippos. There is also an important bird population (over 300 species of birds) including African fish eagle, osprey, jacana and black rail. The cultivation of flowers is the main industry around the lake, and the lake itself is a key source of jobs and income for the local population (including fishing). You will have packed lunch as you continue with your journey. Half day guided walk on Crescent Island situated in the deepest part of Lake Naivasha. The shores of this beautiful piece of paradise host an abundance of bird life and have especially large numbers of pelicans, cormorant and fish eagles. While the island is secure and private it is connected to the mainland and this allows animals to roam freely. See hippos grazing in the cool afternoon air or resting under acacia trees in the heat of day, while giraffe who were born on the island come back to birth their own young. The scenic beauty and sense of freedom in this little park has seen many film makers alight on its shores to film herds of wildebeest, waterbuck and zebra passing through the grassy Savannah."

Famous for its rich wildlife, the Masai Mara is home to not only the \"Big 5\" (elephant, lion, buffalo, rhino and leopard) but also many birds (over 500 species of birds have been recorded). Along the rivers, crocodiles and hippos lie in wait. Composed of vast rolling plains and hills, the Masai Mara is dotted with umbrella thorn acacias and thorny thickets.

The main Nairobi-Mombasa road leads southeast, falling steadily from the 1661m altitude of Nairobi to around 500m in the Tsavo area. The road runs in between Tsavo East and Tsavo West with access to the Tsavo West National Park typically through Mtito Andei or Tsavo Gate. Approximate journey time 4 hours. Route details and journey times may vary depending on road conditions. Discover the Tsavo West National Park, located about 240 km from Nairobi. With its 9,065 km2, Tsavo West is one of the two entities comprising the Tsavo National Park (the largest park in Kenya [20,812 km2] and one of the largest in Africa). Divided into two parts (Tsavo East and Tsavo West) by the railway linking Mombasa to Nairobi, the animals move freely from one part of the park to another. At the heart of this hilly region composed of thick woods and deep forests, abundant wildlife, although often well hidden, can be observed. Over 400 species are present including many water birds such as the knob-billed duck, pied kingfisher and African skimmer. During your safari, you may also encounter many mammals including cheetahs, elephants, leopards, buffaloes, Maasai giraffes and spotted hyenas as well as rarer species such as caracal, kudu and Hunter’s hartebeest. A particular -feature of Tsavo West is undoubtedly the \"black-maned lions\", alas very difficult to locate. Turn up the heat on an afternoon game drive in the Tsavo West National Park. Besides a good selection of wildlife, Tsavo West is also notable for its striking and ancient natural scenery, such as the Mzima Springs where millions of gallons of crystal-clear water gush out from under parched lava rocks. Rugged and beautiful, the park offers better grazing than its neighbour Tsavo East, with belts of riverine vegetation and plains of grassy savannahs. Your afternoon game drive will break at spots such as Poacher’s Lookout where you can admire the plains below teeming with wildlife that include the Big Five and many grazing species. Breathe in the fresh African air and admire the views of the sinking sun as day turns to night and the bushland comes alive with the roar of lions as they prepare to hunt out their evening meal"

Route details and journey times may vary depending on road conditions. Discover the Ngorongoro Conservation Area. Initially incorporated into the Serengeti National Park, the Area is not a National Park. It was founded in 1959, following a conflict between the National Parks and the Maasai, as a nature reserve to protect a unique wildlife but also as a haven for the Maasai. Its name comes from the warriors of the tribe once living in the crater: the Likorongoros (which was distorted to Ngorongoro by the German colonists). The Ngorongoro Conservation Area covers approximately 8288 km2, 890 km2 of which is montane forest covering part of the crater wall. Ngorongoro offers a wide range of habitats: wetlands, grasslands, forests, streams and savannas. The crater itself covers about 260 km2. A World Heritage Site, it is in fact a caldera, caused by the collapse of a massive volcano nearly 2.5 million years ago. During the descent into the crater you will enjoy a spectacularly panoramic view of the interior of the crater. Even from the top of the crater wall you'll notice the first large herds as dark spots on the landscape.

Approximate journey time 5 hours, depending on the exact start and end points. Route details and journey times may vary depending on road conditions. Discover Lake Manyara National Park. Set between the cliffs of the Rift Valley and the alkaline lake of the same name, Lake Manyara National Park covers some 320 km2. Its name derives from the Maasai word \"emanyara\", the name of a plant growing all around the lake and used by the local people to protect their homesteads. Dominated by the Rift Valley escarpment, Lake Manyara National Park presents a diverse flora. Thus, whereas the north is dominated by dense tropical vegetation (giant mahogany, wild palms), vegetation in the south becomes sparser before giving way to grassland and swamps near the lake. Covering an area of about 50 km2, this lake is a favorite with flamingos and waders. Some 350 species of birds have been identified including thousands of Egyptian geese. The park also offers all kinds of wildlife: giraffes, buffalos, zebras, baboons, monkeys or elephants, all are present. If you are lucky you might even spot lions in the trees. Perched in the acacias to better see their prey, the park is famous for these tree climbing lions. Track down tree-climbing lions on an afternoon 4x4 safari in Lake Manyara National Park in your tour vehicle. Small, yet filled with splendour, this park is a delight to explore, consisting of 11 different ecosystems that support one of the highest biomass densities of large mammals in the world. Among them are Lake Manyara’s famous tree-climbing lions, and although you may see lions in trees in other parks, it is a real speciality in Manyara. It is believed that the lions developed this habit in order to avoid pesky biting flies, but whatever the reason it is a unique sight to behold as well as a likely one on your afternoon game drive as these late-night predators take to trees for an afternoon nap. Traverse through the Savannah, marshes and evergreen forests as you seek out elephant, hippo, giraffe, buffalo, zebra, wildebeest and so much more"

    "generalInfo": "Travel through some of East Africa's best wildlife watching and safari destinations on this comprehensive three week safari which explores no less than 12 reserves and national parks and aims to showcase the very best of the natural world.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/><br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife tours in Eastern Africa which combine various different wildlife watching activities. In order to develop our unrivalled range of combined wildlife watching holidays, our guides and colleagues around the world have spent years searching out the world’s best wildlife watching locations as well as visiting some seldom visited areas. This dedication has led us to create this comprehensive safari which visits nearly all of the important wildlife watching locations within both Kenya and Tanzania. <br/><br/>By visiting the arid ecosystems of Samburu as well as the Afro-montane habitats of Sweetwaters Game Reserve, Mt Suswa we combine unusual habitats with the more well known African safari areas such as Ngorogoro, Serengeti, the Mara and diverse lakes such as Naivasha and Magadi. No other East African safari visits the range of locations and offers the levels of diversity that you can see on this trip. <br/><br/>All of our tours are guided by our own professional zoologist (where available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) so you are sure to be in the best hands possible for the best sightings as well as a great network of local guides in East Africa who have developed a great range of wildlife watching locations where the rarest species are commonly seen. Also to try and make sure that we will see as many of the rarer and elusive animals such as striped hyenas in Sumburu and specialist species in the Afro-montane parks. On this trip we will spend many hours during the early morning and late afternoon on jeep safaris and also after dark each night we will head out with high powered spotlights and start the search for nocturnal species. <br/><br/>One of the reasons why our wildlife watching holidays are unique is that our background (as a company) is from a scientific and zoological standpoint and so have a great network of colleagues and contacts all over the world who are the people on the front line in search of the best new locations for wildlife watching. All of these reasons and many more make us experts in arranging safaris and are able to tailor a safari to any location to try to find your targeted species. All you have to do is to get in touch with your budget and your group size and where you would like to go to try and find rare and elusive species.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner (where mentioned in the itinerary)). There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers and open top 4x4 vehicles for all safaris. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) will escort you on all your excursions and also very knowledgeable English speaking local guides who have decades of experience working and guiding throughout Eastern Africa. Your zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) escort is an expert in mammal biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge of where some of the most elusive African animals are; as well as having years of experience in bringing people out to see Africa’s big five and its hundreds of other species safely. We also include all vehicle safaris, guided walks, spotlighting drives, cultural performances, cultural activities, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the African bush or some other wildlife watching activity. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour.<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>We recommend September as a great time for this trip as the wildlife is abundant at this time of year and the weather is not too hot and drier than other times of year. But we can run the trip at other times of year; just note that the price quoted here is based on the low season, we can and do run this tour at other times of year, the wildebeest migration can also be included, please ask for specific quotes for different times of the year.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>•\tAll of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by a zoologist (where available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) as well as local naturalist guides, drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>•\tWe can offer you spotlighting trips around some of the many conservancies in the southern Rift Valley so that you can search for the rarer species and other nocturnal wildlife when they are more active. These conservancies are community projects which increase income to the local community whilst preserving the natural ecosystem.<br/>•\tWe can also bring thermal imaging and night vision equipment as well as spotting scopes (on request) to also aid in finding the nocturnal mammals after dark and scan the horizon for harder to see species.<br/>•\tWe use camera traps (where available) which will increase the chances of getting close up pictures and movies of rare animals and other rare nocturnal wildlife.<br/>•\tExplore a huge ranger of ecosystems and protected areas across two of the world's greatest wildlife watching destinations.<br/>•\tImmerse yourself into the wonderful life of the Maasai and see how their famous coloured beads are made and also see how they and their cattle interact and live alongside the wildlife of the African plains and valleys.<br/>•\tAll the above reasons give this East African safari holiday a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. <br/>•\tWe have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Eastern Africa so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the Big Five, gorillas, chimpanzees and hundreds of other species throughout Eastern Africa. Whether it is the Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda or Rwanda or any of the other many wildlife watching locations you want to visit we can arrange it. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>•\tUnlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour travels to Samburu National Reserve, Sweetwaters Game Reserve, Lake Nakuru National Park, Lake Naivasha, Mt. Suswa, Amboseli National Park, Maasai Mara Game Reserve, Lake Magadi, conservancies in the southern Rift Valley, Ngorogoro Crater National Park and Serengeti National Park.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The majority of wildlife watching is all done from the 4x4 safari vehicle so any fitness level can participate. There are very few walks involved and all do not require any special physical fitness.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 Years Old.",

Arriving in time for lunch, you settle in before heading out on your first afternoon game drive. This is one of the most rewarding times to explore the Mara, as animals become more active in the cooler hours. Your safari begins with classic sights of the region: elephants moving slowly through the grasslands, giraffes silhouetted against the sky, and large herds of zebra and antelope scattered across the savannah. Predators such as lions and cheetahs may be spotted preparing for their evening activities, while hyenas patrol the plains in search of opportunity. Birdlife adds to the spectacle, with secretary birds striding through the grass and raptors soaring overhead. As the sun begins to set, the Mara transforms into a golden, peaceful expanse. You return to the lodge at dusk, ready for dinner and the promise of even more extraordinary wildlife encounters in the days ahead."

    "generalInfo": "Thrilling, unforgettable experiences abound on this Kenya and Tanzania tailor made safari. The trip has been designed to showcase some of the finest wildlife-watching in all of Africa, while ensuring you’re accommodated in comfort and style throughout. Exploring some of the continent’s most renowned national parks and reserves you’ll stay in a succession of luxurious lodges that have been strategically located to place you in the very heart of the action.<br/><br/>Immense herds of elephants range across Amboseli National Park, its skyline dominated by the majestic Mount Kilimanjaro, highest peak in Africa. In Lake Manyara, the lions find a breeze and respite from insects by climbing trees, which also gives them ideal vantage points for spotting prey. And in the spectacular Ngorongoro Crater, sometimes described as ‘the eight wonder of the world’, you’ll discover a unique biosphere teeming with wildlife, set against a backdrop of lakes, forest and dormant volcanoes. <br/><br/>Safaris are taken in the mornings and late afternoons, avoiding the worst of the heat while also ensuring you find the animals at their most active. Driver-guides, drawn from local Masai communities, are trained to put the interests of the animals first. They’ll help you get some memorable sightings while also making sure that the wildlife, and the habitats they rely upon, are not disturbed by your presence.<br/><br/>Among the moments likely to be most treasured are an (optional) hot air balloon flight over the plains at sunrise, as the Masai Mara wakes up beneath you. Another will surely be spending time at a Masai village, where local guides can explain traditional culture and ways of life to you, and help you share a little of your own lives with your hosts. These are communities that benefit hugely from responsible tourism, supplying lodges with fresh-grown produce, guiding, and selling their handicrafts to visitors. In some cases just a snatch of conversation with a villager, or a moment of mutual connection, can be one of the highlights of your trip.<br/><br/>Your final stop is Crescent Island on Lake Naivasha, in Kenya’s Great Rift Valley. The wildlife populations here are exceptional, and admiring the lakeside setting from a hilltop during the ‘golden hour’ before sunset encapsulates everything that makes an African safari so splendid. One of the many reasons for choosing a Kenya and Tanzania tailor made safari is that it can create moments like this for you to enjoy, every single day. <br/>",

There are more animals per acre than any other Kenyan Park, hence many film companies have been to the Island to film the herds of Wildebeest, Waterbuck, Zebra and Gazelle.

Hyena come to hunt at night but are not resident on the island, the many python that live here can be seen occasionally with a kill. Groups of Buffalo come and go but they are always monitored.

But look beyond these stereotypes, glorious though they are, and one can find a diverse kaleidoscope of ethnicities and tribal groups, far removed from the tourist trail and virtually unchanged for generations. On this expedition we head north from the capital to Samburu Game Reserve – no visit to Kenya would be complete without at least a little wildlife, after all. We spend a day here on game drives looking for lion, elephant and some of the species which are seldom found elsewhere, such as gerenuk and beisa oryx.<br/><br/>We then drive into the tribal heartlands that stretch towards the borders with South Sudan and Ethiopia, taking challenging routes and driving through remote areas to meet some of Africa’s most traditional groups. We meet the Samburu and Rendille people, pastoralists who compensate for their austere surroundings with stunning body decorations and enormous beaded necklaces.<br/><br/>Continuing to the Chalbi Desert we head for the oasis of Kalacha, a centre for the Gabbra people, camel herding nomads who eke an existence from this unforgiving land. Pushing further north we drive to the ‘Jade Sea’, the vast waters of Lake Turkana – one of East Africa’s most remote regions. Here we meet the Turkana people, a proud warrior people who held out against colonial domination until the 1950s, and who still retain a fierce independence from central government. <br/><br/>This is a trip through some of East Africa’s most isolated regions – you can expect some full days of driving on rough and non-existent roads to reach these communities, and at times it may be challenging. The rewards however are great – to meet proud warriors and nomadic communities following in the steps of their ancestors, with little influence from the modern world, masters of their own lands yet welcoming to visitors.

    "generalInfo": "Kenya is without a doubt the most famous safari destination and rightly so, it has the vast plains and huge numbers of animals that other countries are frankly envious of. Often people who are seasoned visitors to East Africa are shocked when they visit other wildlife watching destinations around the world.  <br/><br/>As well as the typical African safari species we will try and find some of the species that are often overlooked or unknown to the everyday safari goer.<br/>This particularly happens during our time in the last of the three national parks, the little known Arabuko Sokoke Forest, here many of the animals are not found anywhere else and after seeing the more common species in the Mara and Tsavo we hope to find elusive species like the golden-rumped elephant-shrew, Sokoke bushy-tailed mongoose and Ader’s duiker. <br/><br/>But before we enter Sokoke we will explore the Mara and then the vast and under-developed Tsavo National Parks. In fact in Tsavo we could have most of the park to ourselves, as the park is seldom visited. Few parks the combination of vast size and few tourists, this means that the experience in Tsavo can be seen as a more ‘authentic’ safari and we do not know exactly what we will see here.<br/><br/>So join us on this four destination safari holiday to Kenya and experience the wild majesty of the Mara, West &amp; East Tsavo and Sokoke Forest in all of their glory.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/><br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife tours in Kenya which combine various different wildlife watching activities. In order to develop our unrivalled range of combined wildlife watching holidays, our guides and colleagues around the world have spent years searching out the world’s best wildlife watching locations as well as visiting some seldom visited areas. This dedication has led us to create this comprehensive safari which visits nearly all of the important wildlife watching locations within Kenya. <br/><br/>By visiting the grassland / savanna ecosystems of Masai Mara and Tsavo as well as the forest habitat of Sokoke you will combine the famous wildlife watching destinations with some of the lesser visited in Kenya. By visiting more than one protected area you will gain a larger appreciation for ecotourism and conservation matters, which is what makes this safari unique. <br/><br/>All of our tours are guided by our own professional zoologist (where available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) so you are sure to be in the best hands possible for the best sightings as well as a great network of local guides in East Africa who have developed a great range of wildlife watching locations where the rarest species are commonly seen. Also to try and make sure that we will see as many of the rarer and elusive animals such as hirola in Tsavo, elephant shrews and Ader's duiker in Sokoke as well as the famous Big Five in the Mara. On this trip we will spend many hours during the early morning and late afternoon on jeep safaris and also (where possible) after dark each night we will head out with high powered spotlights and start the search for nocturnal species. <br/><br/>One of the reasons why our wildlife watching holidays are unique is that our background (as a company) is from a scientific and zoological standpoint and so have a great network of colleagues and contacts all over the world who are the people on the front line in search of the best new locations for wildlife watching. All of these reasons and many more make us experts in arranging safaris and are able to tailor a safari to any location to try to find your targeted species. All you have to do is to get in touch with your budget and your group size and where you would like to go to try and find rare and elusive species.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner (where mentioned in the itinerary)). There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers and open top 4x4 vehicles for all safaris. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) will escort you on all your excursions and also very knowledgeable English speaking local guides who have decades of experience working and guiding throughout Eastern Africa. Your zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) escort is an expert in mammal biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge of where some of the most elusive African animals are; as well as having years of experience in bringing people out to see Africa’s big five and its hundreds of other species safely. We also include all vehicle safaris, guided walks, spotlighting drives, cultural performances, cultural activities, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the African bush or some other wildlife watching activity. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour.<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>We recommend September / October as a great time for this trip as the wildlife is abundant at this time of year and the weather is not too hot and drier than other times of year. But we can run the trip at other times of year; just note that the price quoted here is based on the low season, we can and do run this tour at other times of year, the wildebeest migration can also be included, please ask for specific quotes for different times of the year.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>•\tAll of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by a zoologist (where available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) as well as local naturalist guides, drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>•\tWe can offer you spotlighting trips around some of the places visited on the trip - where the local authorities allow after dark activities.<br/>•\tWe can also bring thermal imaging and night vision equipment as well as spotting scopes (on request) to also aid in finding the nocturnal mammals after dark and scan the horizon for harder to see species.<br/>•\tWe use camera traps (where available) which will increase the chances of getting close up pictures and movies of rare animals and other rare nocturnal wildlife.<br/>•\tExplore a huge ranger of ecosystems and protected areas across two of the world's greatest wildlife watching destinations.<br/>•\tImmerse yourself into the wonderful life of the Maasai and see how their famous coloured beads are made and also see how they and their cattle interact and live alongside the wildlife of the African plains and valleys.<br/>•\tAll the above reasons give this East African safari holiday a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. <br/>•\tWe have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Eastern Africa so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the Big Five, gorillas, chimpanzees and hundreds of other species throughout Eastern Africa. Whether it is the Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda or Rwanda or any of the other many wildlife watching locations you want to visit we can arrange it. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>•\tUnlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour travels to four locations, firstly the wonderful Masai Mara National Nature Reserve and then both Tsavo East and West National Parks (they adjoin each other) before Arabuko Sokoke Forest. The entrance point for this trip is Nariobi and the exit point is Mombasa.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The majority of wildlife watching is all done from the 4x4 safari vehicle so any fitness level can participate. There are very few walks involved and all do not require any special physical fitness.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 Years Old.",

The Masai Mara National Reserve is arguably the most famous wildlife watching destination in the world and home to some of the world’s most spectacular wildlife. As with the vast majority of wildlife around the world it is the early mornings and late afternoons which are the best for wildlife watching and so as the sun begins to get lower in the sky we will have the best chance of seeing lions and leopards. The reserve should still be playing (during September / October) host to around 1.7 million blue wildebeest, 260,000 plains zebra and 470,000 Thompson’s gazelles as they are at the end of their migration and spend the dry season in the Mara. Today will be more of a brief introduction to the Mara and we will be opportunistically trying and see anything of interest at the various waterholes and known locations for targeted species.

Once we arrive in the eastern side of the Tsavo ecosystem we will have another short game drive as we drive to our lodge, on arrival we will have lunch and then head out for our afternoon game drive once the temperatures cool a little as the day progresses. The eastern park is 13,747km2 in area and is drier than the western side, previously known as Taru Desert the area is not a true desert but more a semi arid ecosystem. The whole ecosystem (and the two national parks) were renamed Tsavo after the Tsavo River that flows through the park. The park is also a biodiversity hotspot and over the nest three full days we will spend lots of time looking for wildlife; there are some animals which are found here which are usually restricted to the very arid regions to the north and into Somalia, such as desert warthogs, somali ostriches and hirola. Once again we will have our evening meal back at the lodge amongst the sounds and sights of the African wilderness. (all meals included on these days)."

Soon you’re soaring over a patchwork of wilderness, dotted with acacia trees and winding rivers, before touching down in the legendary Masai Mara. Here, the drama of the Great Migration plays out on golden plains, with wildebeest and zebra thundering across the landscape in their millions.<br/><br/>Naibor Camp awaits, an elegant tented hideaway shaded by forest along the Talek River. Wake to birdsong and the low rumble of hippos, and drift off each night to the sounds of the bush. Days are filled with game drives led by expert guides, tracking big cats, elephants, and the ever-moving herds. Between July and October, you may even witness the most dramatic spectacle of all: wildebeest braving crocodile-filled rivers in their epic southward push.<br/><br/>For a truly unforgettable perspective, rise with the sun and float silently across the savannah in a hot air balloon. Watch the plains come alive with light and movement, then touch down for a champagne breakfast in the bush.<br/><br/>After the thrill of safari, it’s time to change pace. Fly north to Lamu, where you'll be met and whisked away across the water by boat to Manda Bay, Kenya’s ultimate barefoot luxury retreat. Shoes come off on arrival and won’t be needed again until you leave. Here, white sands meet turquoise seas, and days drift by in a haze of relaxation and adventure. Snorkel, sail, water-ski, or simply stretch out under the sun. As evening falls, take a dhow cruise into a fiery sunset or set off to explore the narrow streets of historic Lamu Town, a UNESCO World Heritage Site steeped in Swahili culture.",

    "generalInfo": "Nearly everyone who has ever seen a wildlife documentary will have seen some of the world famous rolling grasslands of the Masai Mara. This is Kenya’s premier protected areas and also one of the world’s most famous ecosystems. It has been the setting for countless wildlife documentaries and the reality more than lives up to the images shown on screen. <br/><br/>The iconic footage of lionesses chasing down a zebra, or the millions of blue wildebeest moving through the endless grassy plains and crossing the crocodile infested waters of the Mara River are synonymous with safaris. And what experiences they are to witness first hand.<br/><br/>However there is much more to Kenya than just the Masai Mara and this safari also visits the lesser known but equally wonderful Tsavo National Park a little further to the east along the border with Tanzania. <br/><br/>So join us on this two destination safari holiday to Kenya and experience the wild majesty of the Mara and Tsavo in all of their glory.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/><br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife tours in Kenya which combine various different wildlife watching activities. In order to develop our unrivalled range of combined wildlife watching holidays, our guides and colleagues around the world have spent years searching out the world’s best wildlife watching locations as well as visiting some seldom visited areas. This dedication has led us to create this comprehensive safari which visits nearly all of the important wildlife watching locations within Kenya. <br/><br/>By visiting the grassland / savanna ecosystems of Masai Mara and Tsavo you will combine the famous wildlife watching destinations with some of the lesser visited in Kenya. By visiting more than one protected area you will gain a larger appreciation for ecotourism and conservation matters, which is what makes this safari unique. <br/><br/>All of our tours are guided by our own professional zoologist (where available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) so you are sure to be in the best hands possible for the best sightings as well as a great network of local guides in East Africa who have developed a great range of wildlife watching locations where the rarest species are commonly seen. Also to try and make sure that we will see as many of the rarer and elusive animals such as hirola in Tsavo as well as the famous Big Five in the Mara. On this trip we will spend many hours during the early morning and late afternoon on jeep safaris and also (where possible) after dark each night we will head out with high powered spotlights and start the search for nocturnal species. <br/><br/>One of the reasons why our wildlife watching holidays are unique is that our background (as a company) is from a scientific and zoological standpoint and so have a great network of colleagues and contacts all over the world who are the people on the front line in search of the best new locations for wildlife watching. All of these reasons and many more make us experts in arranging safaris and are able to tailor a safari to any location to try to find your targeted species. All you have to do is to get in touch with your budget and your group size and where you would like to go to try and find rare and elusive species.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner (where mentioned in the itinerary)). There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers and open top 4x4 vehicles for all safaris. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) will escort you on all your excursions and also very knowledgeable English speaking local guides who have decades of experience working and guiding throughout Eastern Africa. Your zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) escort is an expert in mammal biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge of where some of the most elusive African animals are; as well as having years of experience in bringing people out to see Africa’s big five and its hundreds of other species safely. We also include all vehicle safaris, guided walks, spotlighting drives, cultural performances, cultural activities, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the African bush or some other wildlife watching activity. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour.<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>We recommend September / October as a great time for this trip as the wildlife is abundant at this time of year and the weather is not too hot and drier than other times of year. But we can run the trip at other times of year; just note that the price quoted here is based on the low season, we can and do run this tour at other times of year, the wildebeest migration can also be included, please ask for specific quotes for different times of the year.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>•\tAll of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by a zoologist (where available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) as well as local naturalist guides, drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>•\tWe can offer you spotlighting trips around some of the places visited on the trip - where the local authorities allow after dark activities.<br/>•\tWe can also bring thermal imaging and night vision equipment as well as spotting scopes (on request) to also aid in finding the nocturnal mammals after dark and scan the horizon for harder to see species.<br/>•\tWe use camera traps (where available) which will increase the chances of getting close up pictures and movies of rare animals and other rare nocturnal wildlife.<br/>•\tExplore a huge ranger of ecosystems and protected areas across two of the world's greatest wildlife watching destinations.<br/>•\tImmerse yourself into the wonderful life of the Maasai and see how their famous coloured beads are made and also see how they and their cattle interact and live alongside the wildlife of the African plains and valleys.<br/>•\tAll the above reasons give this East African safari holiday a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. <br/>•\tWe have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Eastern Africa so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the Big Five, gorillas, chimpanzees and hundreds of other species throughout Eastern Africa. Whether it is the Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda or Rwanda or any of the other many wildlife watching locations you want to visit we can arrange it. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>•\tUnlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour travels to two locations, firstly the wonderful Masai Mara National Nature Reserve and then both Tsavo East and West National Parks (they adjoin each other) and the entrance and exit point for this trip is Nairobi.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The majority of wildlife watching is all done from the 4x4 safari vehicle so any fitness level can participate. There are very few walks involved and all do not require any special physical fitness.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 Years Old.",

The park is also a biodiversity hotspot and over the nest three full days we will spend lots of time looking for wildlife; there are some animals which are found here which are usually restricted to the very arid regions to the north and into Somalia, such as desert warthogs, somali ostriches and hirola. Once again we will have our evening meal back at the lodge amongst the sounds and sights of the African wilderness. (all meals included on these days)."

    "generalInfo": "Kenya: Safari, Culture &amp; Coast - A Journey Through Wild Beauty<br/><br/>Discover the soul of Kenya on this 11-day adventure that weaves together wildlife, culture, and coast. From the high plains of Laikipia to the vast savannahs of the Maasai Mara and the timeless charm of Lamu Island, this journey takes you far from the more typical safari routes to explore Kenya in its most authentic form.<br/><br/>Your adventure begins in Nairobi, East Africa’s energetic capital. Here, skyscrapers rise beyond acacia trees, and rhinos roam within sight of the city skyline. Spend your first night relaxing at the Trademark Hotel in Gigiri, with the option to visit Nairobi National Park, the Giraffe Centre or local markets before you head into the wild.<br/><br/>Next, fly north to Laikipia, one of Kenya’s most exciting conservation regions. Your base is Moon’s Camp, a small, solar-powered retreat nestled in the private Lolldaiga Conservancy. Here, sustainability meets comfort, with tented suites overlooking a watering hole frequented by elephants and zebras. Days are designed to unfold at your own pace, walk with expert guides, explore on horseback, enjoy bush breakfasts or help with local reforestation projects. You can visit nearby communities, learn traditional plant uses on an ethno-botany walk, or simply watch wildlife from your veranda. Evenings are spent around the fire, sharing stories under vast starry skies.<br/><br/>From Laikipia, fly south into the Maasai Mara, Kenya’s most iconic wildlife destination. At Enkewa Camp, you’ll experience the Mara at its most peaceful, away from crowds and close to nature. Led by experienced Maasai guides, you’ll track the Big Five, spot cheetahs on the hunt and pause for sundowners overlooking the plains. Full-day game drives, bush breakfasts and visits to local villages provide a deeper connection with both wildlife and culture. Optional balloon safaris offer breathtaking views at sunrise.<br/><br/>Finally, unwind on Lamu Island, a UNESCO World Heritage treasure where life moves at the rhythm of the tides. Days are blissfully unhurried - sail traditional dhows at sunset, wander through the labyrinthine alleys of Lamu Old Town, explore mangrove forests or simply relax on a palm-fringed beach. The island’s car-free, community-led lifestyle is the perfect reminder that the simplest experiences are often the most profound.<br/><br/>Throughout your journey, every flight, camp, and activity is designed to tread lightly, supporting local conservation and community initiatives while providing genuine connection and comfort.<br/><br/>This trip aims to be more than just a safari; it’s a journey through Kenya’s wild heart. Whether you’re tracking elephants in Laikipia, sharing stories with Maasai guides, or watching the sun dip below the Indian Ocean, this trip reveals Kenya as it truly is: raw, beautiful, and full of life.",

    "generalInfo": "Starting in Nairobi and ending on the shores of the delightful Indian Ocean, this is a comprehensive safari that visits four extremely diverse wilderness areas. You begin your journey after a night in Nairobi discovering one of the most famous safari destinations, the Masai Mara situated in South West Kenya renowned for being home to over a million wildebeest, zebra and antelope between July and October, when the migration of huge herds make a dash across the rivers. Lion, leopard, hyena and cheetah are abundant … this is the area of the Big 5 safari. <br/><br/>Travel across the ‘breadbasket’ of Kenya where acres of wheat and barley grow towards the Rift Valley lakes and Lake Naivasha for a boat ride before continuing your journey on to Amboseli park, for stunning views of Mount Kilimanjaro in neighbouring Tanzania.  The mountain is crucial in supplying the plains here with a steady flow of water for feeding the various swamps and wetlands, thus attracting a huge variety of wildlife, including elephant, zebra, buffalo, giraffe, wildebeest and various grazing antelope. <br/><br/>You then head on through to Tsavo West park, more mountainous and wetter than it’s counterpart where swamps and a series of natural springs known as Mzima are the perfect spot from which to view the many hippo which can be seen from the underground viewing holes here. <br/><br/>Finally continue on to the Taita Hills Game Reserve for your last stop, viewing the wildlife from the platforms and hides which surround the watering hole. You end your journey with a last morning game drive through the sanctuary en route to the coast where you will be dropped off at the airport for your onward arrangements.  Alternatively head to a hotel on the North or South coast for some rest and relaxation to wrap up your unforgettable safari.  <br/><br/>This superb 8 day/7 night trip includes airport transfers and night in Nairobi at the start. With weekly departures every Sunday and Wednesday, this small group tour is guaranteed to depart with a minimum of 2 clients, max of 6 clients per vehicle and each passenger is guaranteed a window seat.  <br/><br/>Transportation is provided in 4 x 4’s with a pop up roof and an experienced English/bilingual speaking driver/guide.",

    "generalInfo": "Revel in some of Africa’s most exhilarating safari experiences with this Kenya, Tanzania and Zanzibar holiday. You’ll stay in lodges and camps that are set in premium locations, allowing for privileged access deep into the Masai Mara, the Serengeti and the vast Ngorongoro Crater, which are among the most wildlife-rich destinations on the continent. And with driver-guides drawn from local Masai communities leading the way, you couldn’t be in better company. <br/><br/>The Masai Mara and the Serengeti share the same ecosystem – winter sees the incredible Great Migration take place between the two, as untold thousands of wildebeest and other herd animals run the gauntlet to their grazing grounds. But in truth the wildlife-watching here is exceptional at any time of year, especially when you have knowledgeable guides, capable of getting you in just the right position for memorable sightings.<br/><br/>Mornings mean early starts to wonder as the landscape comes to life; evenings mean dinner and drinks around the campfire, swapping stories with your fellow guests. For those looking for a thrilling start to the day and a great story to share by night, a sunrise hot air balloon flight over the bush takes some beating. This optional experience ends with a champagne breakfast surrounded by the magnificent African wilderness.<br/><br/>Every day of this trip promises new adventures. In the Mara National Reserve you might visit a local Maasai community, a chance to meet the villagers and learn about their lives while perhaps sharing a little about your own. You can discover how responsible safari holidays help them earn a living through guiding, or selling produce to accommodations. Then from the Serengeti you head to the Ngorongoro Crater, a unique biosphere that plays host to a spectacular cast of predators and prey. <br/><br/>And finally, you leave the plains behind for the gorgeous white sands of Zanzibar, a luxury resort with its own private stretch of beach awaiting you. Here, besides watersports or relaxing in the shade, you can take a tour of the historic Stone Town with a local guide. It’s a chance not only to learn about Zanzibar’s spice-trading heritage, but also the darker history of colonialism that the island has had to contend with – a visit to the old Slave Market a particularly poignant reminder.<br/><br/>This is a classic East African safari – outstanding wildlife-watching, fantastic local guides whose knowledge is matched by their willingness to show you around their communities, and a sumptuous couple of days to unwind in style on the coast. <br/>",

        "description": "Tsavo West & East National Park - Wildlife Watching & Travelling Today we will have a final morning game drive of Tsavo West National Park before breakfast and then departing the relatively short distance to Tsavo East National Park, the parks are separated by A109 road that runs from Mombasa to Nairobi and a railway line. Once we arrive in the eastern side of the Tsavo ecosystem we will have another short game drive as we drive to our lodge, on arrival we will have lunch and then head out for our afternoon game drive once the temperatures cool a little as the day progresses. The eastern park is 13,747km2 in area and is drier than the western side, previously known as Taru Desert the area is not a true desert but more a semi arid ecosystem. The whole ecosystem (and the two national parks) were renamed Tsavo after the Tsavo River that flows through the park. The park is also a biodiversity hotspot and over the nest three full days we will spend lots of time looking for wildlife; there are some animals which are found here which are usually restricted to the very arid regions to the north and into Somalia, such as desert warthogs, somali ostriches and hirola. Once again we will have our evening meal back at the lodge amongst the sounds and sights of the African wilderness. (all meals included on these days)."

    "generalInfo": "This trip takes in some of the smaller, but more rewarding East African National Parks. Their soda and fresh-water lakes are abundant in bird and wildlife and there are rare opportunities for walking safaris. An optional highlight of this trip is trekking through the rainforests of the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park or Virunga Mountains in search of the protected Mountain Gorilla. For a different type of adrenaline experience you can try your hand at quad biking, kayaking or whitewater rafting in Uganda. Note: This is one of our Overland Adventures which are run using one of our specialist famous yellow overland expedition trucks. Trips are run on a participatory basis – you’ll be involved in the day to day running of the trip and have fun taking turns helping to shop and cook for the group. Expect to sometimes get dusty and dishevelled and not to be able to have hot showers every night. Groups of up to 24 people are led by our crew of two. Please note that the accommodation on this trip is predominantly camping, though there may be opportunities to upgrade this locally where rooms are available. Please see the trip inclusions for an approximate percentage of camping and room nights. Our Overland Adventures provide once in a life time experiences and whilst some safari activities may be included in the itinerary, or be available to book locally, this should not be considered a traditional safari holiday, though we consider that part of the fun!!",

        "description": "Nairobi to Lake Naivasha and the Masai Mara After loading the truck with all our gear, we depart Nairobi this morning and head north into one of Africa’s greatest natural features, the East African Rift Valley. Stretching from the Dead Sea in Jordan down to Mozambique in Southern Africa, our first view is from the top of a steep escarpment. Overland trips through East Africa will allow you to experience some of the most dramatic scenery in the world, and the Rift Valley is a definite highlight. The valley floor seems to sweep on forever and is dotted with volcanic peaks, shimmering lakes and countless springs. Our journey takes us into the heart of the Rift Valley to Lake Naivasha. We camp near the lake shore where Hippos sometimes feed at night! Here you can walk to Elsamere, the house of Joy Adamson - of Elsa the Lion and Born Free fame, and enjoy a film of her life - and cream teas! You can also hire mountain bikes and cycle or walk through Hells Gate National Park - the only game reserve in Kenya in which you are permitted to do so. Or for a less active but equally enjoyable game viewing experience - visit the Crater Lake Game Sanctuary. Both offer excellent scenery and opportunities to spot hyrax, abundant bird and plant life along with several types of gazelle, impala and eland. Next we head to one of Africa’s most famous wildlife reserves, the Masai Mara. Famous for its dense concentration of animals and birds, and for its important place in the annual wildebeest migration (July to October), you will have a great chance to see lions, elephants, buffalo, leopards, cheetahs and also rhino if you are lucky. We include a morning and afternoon safari, while an additional evening safari may be available to arrange locally on our arrival day if we have made good time."

This is a real contrast to other wild areas we’ll visit, and the forest is home to various mammals including colobus and Debrazzar monkeys, pottos, bush pigs and giant forest hedgehogs, as well as a great selection of colourful birdlife. A guided walk in the forest is included here. Next, we make our first border crossing as we cross from Kenya into Uganda and continue on to camp near Jinja - Uganda's adventure playground. Here, on the edge of Lake Victoria, the Nile begins its 6700km journey to the sea. We spend the next few days a little downstream from the source of the Nile. This is a spectacular area and a superb place to go whitewater rafting or kayaking. You can also organise quad biking, horse riding or a visit to a local education project."

As we travel through Uganda, we'll pass through a number of small towns and villages; Mpigi, where you will see roadside stalls manufacturing and selling traditional musical instruments; Kyazanga, where we can buy fresh rotisserie and roasted meat and vegetables, as well as roasted plantain bananas. We will also be able to make a photo stop where our route crosses the Equator. Our destination is Kalinzu Forest Reserve. Here we have a great opportunity to take an optional hike into the forest to see some habituated chimpanzee families. Permits need to be booked several months in advance, so please get in touch if you would like to add this experience. Only 12 permits are issued each day to minimize disruption to the animals, and a local guide will take you through the forest to find the group. You then have an hour watching and following them before returning to camp. You should see many other monkeys, birds and other wildlife during the trip too. If you don’t book the chimp trek, then various other walks are available in the forest to see waterfalls, birds, primates, and other wildlife. The forest has four main paths for nature walks, including the valley trail, the waterfall path, the river trail, and the Palm trail. These can all be arranged when you get there. After our day in the forest, we take a short drive to Katunguru on the edge of Queen Elizabeth National Park. We have a free morning here to take a wide range of optional village walks, learning about the culture of the Basongara, Bakonjo and Banyabindi who live in Queen Elizabeth National Park. Then in the afternoon, we include a guided boat cruise on the Kazinga Channel, where you can look out for hippos, crocodiles, elephants, buffalos, waterbucks and a huge range of bird species. Next, we spend the morning on a game drive on our truck, as we drive south through Queen Elizabeth National Park and on to our next stop, Lake Bunyonyi."

        "description": "Gorilla Trekking, to Kigali We have a whole day set aside today to visit Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park and Mgahinga Gorilla National Park which are home to several families of Highland Mountain Gorillas. Getting up close to these amazing creatures is truly a once in a lifetime experience and one of the highlights of the trip. You have the opportunity to trek to see the Gorillas in Uganda (bookable as an Add on). It is estimated that only around 700 of these gentle giants remain. This mountainous area on the borders of Rwanda, Uganda and Zaire (now renamed Democratic Republic of Congo) is their only natural habitat and they are periodically threatened by poachers and political instability in the area. One permit allows you to spend about 50 to 60 minutes with one of the gorilla families. Trekking to find them in groups of 8 people can take anywhere from half an hour to 5 hours. The organisations and well-trained guides that continually monitor and protect the families are conscientious and responsible. We will base ourselves near the village of Kabale which will give you the opportunity to trek the Mountain Gorillas and visit the beautiful Lake Bunyonyi, where you will have the opportunity to visit a pygmy village. If permits are limited, we may adjust the itinerary slightly to spend an extra day here to give everyone in the group the opportunity to see the gorillas. After our latest forest adventure, we pass through mountain ranges and cross the border into Rwanda and continue to the capital, Kigali. Here we can visit the genocide memorial, which is a moving and humbling experience."

One of the best ways to protect these beautiful animals is by visiting them, as money spent on permits are used to fund their protection. One of the most important factors in the future conservation of the mountain gorillas lies with in community development - if the attitudes of the local communities' changes towards protecting the wildlife around them instead of poaching - the battle in protecting mountain gorillas can be won. Permits granting permission to visit the gorillas are limited, so flexibility is required in both the tour itinerary and where we visit them. The home of the mountain gorillas is completely at odds with man-made borders and so their range encompasses Uganda, Rwanda and the DRC (Democratic Republic of the Congo). We prefer to make use of the national parks of Uganda, but depending on the availability of the permits, we may travel to Rwanda or the DRC, in which case you will be advised in advance.

Ololo Safari Lodge & Farm borders the 117-sq-km Nairobi National Park and this morning you’ll go on your first early morning game drive to view Kenya’s spectacular wildlife. It’s the world’s only national park that shares a boundary with a bustling capital city and features diverse landscapes ranging from broad savannah grasslands to pockets of riverine woodlands and dramatic rocky gorges. It’s home to over 100 species of mammals including a large population of black and white rhino, Cape buffalo, giraffe, lion, leopard, hyena, zebra, jackal, and antelope such as eland, hartebeest and impala. After an exciting game drive, it’s back to Ololo for a hearty breakfast. The lodge prides itself on serving excellent farm-to-table food and your plate will be filled with fresh produce; eggs, mushrooms, milk and yoghurt, fruit and vegetables are all produced using organic farming practices. Then there will be a late morning visit to the nearby Sheldrick Wildlife Trust that also occupies a site on the edge of Nairobi National Park. This pioneering elephant orphanage was founded in 1977 by Daphne Sheldrick in memory of her husband and naturalist David Sheldrick, and today the trust is the most successful baby elephant rescue and rehabilitation programme in the world. Your time here watching the adorable and endearing young calves come out for their morning play and bath time will be unforgettable, and the keepers will explain their individual stories and more about the challenges elephants are exposed to in Kenya. Returning from the Sheldrick Trust, enjoy a delicious lunch at Ololo and then while away the afternoon relaxing on the terrace or open lounge with a drink. Alternatively go on an interesting farm tour to wander through the shambas and orchards and visit the free-range livestock, and children will especially enjoy the farmyard animals. Ololo is proud of its sustainable techniques such as water-recycling, composting systems, production of natural fertilizer, and all its farm produce has been awarded wholly organic by the Kenya Organic Agriculture Network (KOAN). An additional game drive in Nairobi National Park can be arranged in the late afternoon if you wish, followed by another scrumptious dinner of food you perhaps have just seen growing on the farm on your tour."

Lying only 7-km away from the city centre, Nairobi National Park is fenced along its northern perimeter but is open to the south along the Embakasi and Athi rivers allowing migrating herds, and the predators that follow them, to come and go freely. On today’s early morning game drive, you’ll be able to photograph the unique sight of herds of zebra, giraffe and antelope peacefully grazing on the open grassy plains studded with flat-topped acacia trees with a view of Nairobi’s skyscrapers on the horizon. After breakfast back at Ololo Safari Lodge, we spend the rest of the day connecting with Kenya’s proud Maasai people in an authentic and interactive way by becoming part of the hustle and bustle of Maasai village life. Having maintained a semi-nomadic way of life on their communal lands for centuries, the Maasai are well-known for their distinctive dress, valued customs and unique social and family structures, which include rites of passage and revered respect for elders. This fun and insightful day starts with a song and dance welcome where the wife of a village elder will offer to dress you in traditional Maasai shuka cloth or ‘African blanket’, then you'll take part in the rituals of the young warriors, perform daily tasks with the women, and sit with the villagers as they share their stories and folklore while the women teach you how to make some traditional decorative beaded jewellery; you can also purchase Maasai jewellery and curios produced by the villagers. Lunch is a delightful picnic basket prepared by Ololo Safari Lodge, and after the Maasai village excursion is another opportunity to go on a late afternoon game drive in Nairobi National Park. Then later dine under the trees or on the terrace, or on cooler nights, inside with small braziers (jikos) keeping you warm and cosy."

The first couple of hours after dawn are always best for game-viewing, and on today’s early morning drive in Nairobi National Park, as well as the large animals, keep eyes peeled for the more than 520 species of endemic and migratory birds—the highest number recorded than any other park in Kenya. Notable birds include the kori bustard, secretary bird, Maasai ostrich, and the park is well known as a habitat for falcons, eagles and other large birds of prey. In the dams, ponds and rivers, Nile crocodiles and hippos are present too. After breakfast at Ololo you will visit a project that is turning around the lives of grandmas in a Kikuyu community. On this tour you meet some engaging and entrepreneurial grandmothers who are beating their generational cycle of poverty. Many Kenyan grandmothers play a vital role in raising their grandchildren and extended families, and you’ll visit a pig farm, which is a project supported by travellers like yourself to improve the livelihoods of grandmothers by empowering them through small-scale farming. They invite you to assist with farming activities, join in some joyful singing and dancing over a cup of local tea or chai, and by sharing lots of laughter and listening to their inspirational stories, you’ll get a real insight into the strength and resilience of these remarkable Kenyan women. On the way back to Ololo Safari Lodge and Farm, we stop in the watershed ridge of the Ngong Hills just outside the city. Enjoy the broad views over Maasai country and another delicious picnic basket lunch prepared by the chefs at Ololo, and once again you’ll appreciate the quality, freshness and healthiness of the lodge’s food. On the final afternoon there’s be time to relax by the pool or in the open lounge and peacefully watch the passing herds of wildlife across the Mbagathi River in Nairobi National Park. Or perhaps indulge in an invigorating massage (optional extra) or another late afternoon game drive before dinner."

First stop is the Masai Mara National Reserve that every year between July and October forms the backdrop for the most thrilling wildlife spectacle on earth. The Great Migration sees vast numbers of wildebeest and other herd animals make their way to the grasslands of the Masai Mara from the Serengeti in Tanzania, a journey fraught with peril from teeming predators. Over cocktails around the campfire you can share tales of sightings with your fellow guests. Buffalos, lions and elephants roam the Masai Mara, as well as leopards, cheetahs, hippos and Nile crocodiles. For a memorable overview of this epic tapestry, why not take an optional hot air balloon flight, finishing with a champagne breakfast in the bush.<br/><br/>Leaving the Masai Mara, you’ll continue by comfortable minivan to some of Kenya’s most iconic locations for wildlife. At Lake Naivasha you’ll stroll by sunset, watching from a ridge as herds gather at the water’s edge. Meanwhile the sightings at Amboseli National Park are overlooked by Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa’s highest peak.<br/><br/>After a day in the magnificent Tsavo West National Park, which is one of the largest in the world, you’ll continue on to the coast at Kenya’s Diani Beach. Here at a waterside hotel you can shake off the dust, unwind and indulge in everything from spa treatments to scuba diving.<br/><br/>From arrival in Nairobi, you’ll be escorted throughout by an expert driver-guide. Not only can they take you to the finest viewpoints, but they also act as a bridge to connect you with local people. One of the great highlights of our Kenya wildlife safari and beach holiday is the opportunity to meet Maasai people and learn about their lives and traditions, while perhaps sharing some of your own. Our responsible partners also use modern, low carbon vehicles to get around that make little noise – less disturbance out on the plains means happier animals and, hopefully, more offspring for wildlife-watchers of the future to spy.",

There is just one “Crescent Island Game Park” and it is located on Lake Naivasha, Kenya in the Great Rift Valley. There are more animals per acre than any other Kenyan Park, hence many film companies have been to the Island to film the herds of Wildebeest, Waterbuck, Zebra and Gazelle. They are not fenced in, which allows the wildlife on the mainland to come in as they lose their habitat to development and the ever increasing population. Hippo graze all over us at night then sleep under the acacia or rest in the water by day. The giraffe who were born on the Island return to give birth; sometimes you see three generations at a time. Hyena come to hunt at night but are not resident on the island, the many python that live here can be seen occasionally with a kill. Groups of Buffalo come and go but they are always monitored. From the top of the hill there is a 360 degree view across the Lake from Longonot to Hell’s Gate to the Mau Escarpment to Eburu and onto the Aberdares. Walking along the ridge in the golden hour before sunset whilst watching the animals grazing with the water shimmering beyond is what Africa is all about. Take a boat back to the lodge."

Because of its size the park was split into two, Tsavo West and Tsavo East, for easy administration. Located midway between Nairobi and the coast, the area boasts volcanic hills, four rivers, more than 60 major mammal species and 1,000 plant species. The northern part of Tsavo West is the most developed and has spectacular scenery with a rolling volcanic landscape carpeted in long grass and dense bush. Although the tall vegetation makes game spotting trickier than in some of the other parks, Tsavo West's bio-diversity is amazing. The landscape is a mixture of grassland and forest shrub vegetation. Thus driving and exploring the vegetation almost assures you close encounters with the following animals: lions, leopard, cheetah, zebras, giraffes, antelopes, kongoni, waterbuck, klipspringer, impala, gazelles, buffalos, and elephants. Apart from Tsavo’s elephant population there are many lion –some undoubtedly the descendants of the infamous and feared “Man-eaters of Tsavo” popularized in the film Ghost in the Darkness. In addition to lion the resident carnivores in Tsavo include serval, hyena, leopard, cheetah, and caracal. The landscape is dominated, especially off the hills, by the giant baobab, a tree which is reputed to live 1,000 years. Tsavo West is famous for the Mzima Springs. This star attraction is a pool of natural spring water with underwater viewing hides for observing hippos where a gushing supply of fresh, crystal clear water has created an oasis for wildlife. A specially constructed underwater observatory provides visitors with a unique view into the underwater world of Mzima. The water catchment is divided into two pools; here you can view hippos and crocodiles. The upper pool is occupied by the hippos and lower pool by the crocodiles. In your stay you will also visit the rhino sanctuary in Ngulia where most of Tsavo's surviving rhino, plus a number of re-located animals, have been moved and where a meter-high electric fence surrounds an area of 70 sq km now designated an official sanctuary for approximately 40 rhinos. The Sanctuary also offers shelter to a broad range of other threatened wildlife to include cheetahs and leopards and the rare frog (Afrixalus pygmaeus septentrionalis)."

    "generalInfo": "Once a year, the Maasai Mara transforms into the heart of one of nature’s most dramatic events: the Great Migration. During this season, immense herds of wildebeest and zebra surge across the Mara River, triggering intense predator activity and offering extraordinary opportunities for wildlife photography. It’s a time of heightened energy and raw spectacle, and it’s precisely when we invite you to join us for a photographic and conservation-focused safari experience.<br/><br/>This journey is designed for those who want more than just a glimpse of wildlife - it’s for storytellers, conservation enthusiasts, and photographers seeking depth, variety, and meaning. The itinerary includes time in three distinct regions of the Mara ecosystem: the Mara Triangle, known for its classic savannah landscapes and dramatic river crossings; the Pardamat Conservation Area, a community-led initiative where wildlife and people share the land; and the private Naboisho Conservancy, renowned for its predator density and off-road freedom. Each location offers a unique perspective and contributes to a richer, more layered photographic narrative.<br/><br/>Group sizes are kept small to ensure flexibility and intimacy. There’s no pressure to rush from sighting to sightin; instead, you’ll have the freedom to wait for the right moment, observe animal behavior, and capture images that tell a deeper story. Whether it’s the tension before a river crossing, the quiet connection between a mother and calf, or the golden light falling across the plains, you’ll have time to respond to the scene with intention.<br/><br/>Throughout the safari, professional photographic guidance is available from Sam Turley, a seasoned wildlife photographer with a deep understanding of the Mara and its rhythms. Sam offers support both in the field and during optional editing sessions, helping you refine your technique and elevate your storytelling. His approach is collaborative and insightful, tailored to your experience level and creative goals.<br/><br/>Beyond photography, this experience offers meaningful engagement with conservation efforts and local communities. You’ll meet Maasai leaders and conservation teams working to protect wildlife and support sustainable livelihoods. These interactions provide context and connection, helping you understand the challenges and successes of coexistence in one of Africa’s most vital ecosystems.<br/><br/>This is not a standard safari. It’s a chance to create powerful imagery, gain insight into conservation in action, and experience the Maasai Mara through a lens of purpose and curiosity. You’ll leave with more than just photographs - you’ll carry a deeper understanding of the land, its people, and the wildlife that defines it",

    "generalInfo": "The Masai Mara Nature Reserve forms part of one of the most incredible and well known ecosystems in the world. Spreading south into Tanzania and the neighbouring Serengeti National Park the rolling plains are home to some of the largest numbers of animals on the planet. <br/><br/>This safari holiday takes you into the heart of the Mara and on the trail of Africa’s famous big five and much much more. Kenya is without a doubt the most wildlife watching and safari destination in the world and rightly so. With millions of individual animals living in the wide and largely open spaces, seeing nature on a grand scale is easier and more enjoyable here than anywhere else on earth. <br/><br/>From the Mara you will also visit the equally famous Amboseli, whilst the name may not be as famous as the Mara the iconic image of impressive mount Kilimanjaro rising above the plains is one of the most iconic images of East Africa and it is here where you can experience it.<br/><br/>So join us on this two destination safari holiday to Kenya and experience the wild majesty of the Mara and Amboseli in all of their glory.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/><br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife tours in Kenya which combine various different wildlife watching activities. In order to develop our unrivalled range of combined wildlife watching holidays, our guides and colleagues around the world have spent years searching out the world’s best wildlife watching locations as well as visiting some seldom visited areas. This dedication has led us to create this comprehensive safari which visits nearly all of the important wildlife watching locations within Kenya. <br/><br/>By visiting the grassland / savanna ecosystems of Masai Mara and Amboseli you will combine the famous wildlife watching destinations with some of the lesser visited in Kenya. By visiting more than one protected area you will gain a larger appreciation for ecotourism and conservation matters, which is what makes this safari unique. <br/><br/>All of our tours are guided by our own professional zoologist (where available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) so you are sure to be in the best hands possible for the best sightings as well as a great network of local guides in East Africa who have developed a great range of wildlife watching locations where the rarest species are commonly seen. Also to try and make sure that we will see as many of the rarer and elusive animals such as cheetah as well as the famous Big Five in the Mara &amp; Ambsoeli. On this trip we will spend many hours during the early morning and late afternoon on jeep safaris and also (where possible) after dark each night we will head out with high powered spotlights and start the search for nocturnal species (where this is possible). <br/><br/>One of the reasons why our wildlife watching holidays are unique is that our background (as a company) is from a scientific and zoological standpoint and so have a great network of colleagues and contacts all over the world who are the people on the front line in search of the best new locations for wildlife watching. All of these reasons and many more make us experts in arranging safaris and are able to tailor a safari to any location to try to find your targeted species. All you have to do is to get in touch with your budget and your group size and where you would like to go to try and find rare and elusive species.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner (where mentioned in the itinerary)). There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers and open top 4x4 vehicles for all safaris. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) will escort you on all your excursions and also very knowledgeable English speaking local guides who have decades of experience working and guiding throughout Eastern Africa. Your zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) escort is an expert in mammal biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge of where some of the most elusive African animals are; as well as having years of experience in bringing people out to see Africa’s big five and its hundreds of other species safely. We also include all vehicle safaris, guided walks, spotlighting drives, cultural performances, cultural activities, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the African bush or some other wildlife watching activity. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour.<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>We recommend September / October as a great time for this trip as the wildlife is abundant at this time of year and the weather is not too hot and drier than other times of year. But we can run the trip at other times of year; just note that the price quoted here is based on the low season, we can and do run this tour at other times of year, the wildebeest migration can also be included, please ask for specific quotes for different times of the year.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>•\tAll of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by a zoologist (where available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) as well as local naturalist guides, drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>•\tWe can offer you spotlighting trips around some of the places visited on the trip - where the local authorities allow after dark activities.<br/>•\tWe can also bring thermal imaging and night vision equipment as well as spotting scopes (on request) to also aid in finding the nocturnal mammals after dark and scan the horizon for harder to see species.<br/>•\tWe use camera traps (where available) which will increase the chances of getting close up pictures and movies of rare animals and other rare nocturnal wildlife.<br/>•\tExplore a huge ranger of ecosystems and protected areas across two of the world's greatest wildlife watching destinations.<br/>•\tImmerse yourself into the wonderful life of the Maasai and see how their famous coloured beads are made and also see how they and their cattle interact and live alongside the wildlife of the African plains and valleys.<br/>•\tAll the above reasons give this East African safari holiday a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. <br/>•\tWe have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Eastern Africa so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the Big Five, gorillas, chimpanzees and hundreds of other species throughout Eastern Africa.

    "generalInfo": "This tailor made Masai Mara safari in Kenya is the perfect way to explore one of Africa’s most spectacular wildlife-watching destinations, where you can expect to enjoy a wealth of sightings at any time of year. <br/><br/>Between July and November Kenya bears witness to the Great Migration, as millions of wildebeest and other herd animals brave an epic round-trip journey between the Mara and the Serengeti, in the face of hordes of predators. Come outside the winter, however, and you can expect to share your sightings with far fewer people, though the wildlife is still in abundance.<br/><br/>As this is a bespoke holiday, the precise itinerary can be arranged to your specifications. You have unlimited potential for safaris in both the daytime and the evening, which give wholly different experience. There is also the option of a sunrise hot air balloon flight to admire the Masai Mara from above as it begins to stir – finish with a champagne breakfast and it’s a morning to treasure.<br/><br/>Beyond myriad opportunities for wildlife sightings (as well as being home to lions, leopard and elephants, the Masai Mara offers a cornucopia of birds, and some 95 species of mammals, amphibians and reptiles) this Kenya safari is also a way to learn about Maasai ways of life. Driver-guides are often from local Maasai communities and will be pleased to show you around. These visits enable you to learn about their culture while sharing your own, on an equal footing. But responsible safaris are not just about taking the odd village tour and perhaps purchasing a few handicrafts – besides cultural exchange they also create employment, and use accommodation that buys from nearby farms and villages.",

Stretching from the Dead Sea in Jordan down to Mozambique in Southern Africa, our first view is from the top of a steep escarpment. Overland trips through East Africa will allow you to experience some of the most dramatic scenery in the world, and the Rift Valley is a definite highlight. The valley floor seems to sweep on forever and is dotted with volcanic peaks, shimmering lakes and countless springs. Our journey takes us into the heart of the Rift Valley to Lake Naivasha. We camp near the lake shore where Hippos sometimes feed at night! Here you can walk to Elsamere, the house of Joy Adamson - of Elsa the Lion and Born Free fame, and enjoy a film of her life - and cream teas! You can also hire mountain bikes and cycle or walk through Hells Gate National Park - the only game reserve in Kenya in which you are permitted to do so. Or for a less active but equally enjoyable game viewing experience - visit the Crater Lake Game Sanctuary. Both offer excellent scenery and opportunities to spot hyrax, abundant bird and plant life along with several types of gazelle, impala and eland. Next we head to one of Africa’s most famous wildlife reserves, the Masai Mara. Famous for its dense concentration of animals and birds, and for its important place in the annual wildebeest migration (July to October), you will have a great chance to see lions, elephants, buffalo, leopards, cheetahs and also rhino if you are lucky. We include a morning and afternoon safari, while an additional evening safari may be available to arrange locally on our arrival day if we have made good time."

Permits need to be booked several months in advance, so please get in touch if you would like to add this experience. Only 12 permits are issued each day to minimize disruption to the animals, and a local guide will take you through the forest to find the group. You then have an hour watching and following them before returning to camp. You should see many other monkeys, birds and other wildlife during the trip too. If you don’t book the chimp trek, then various other walks are available in the forest to see waterfalls, birds, primates, and other wildlife. The forest has four main paths for nature walks, including the valley trail, the waterfall path, the river trail, and the Palm trail. These can all be arranged when you get there. After our day in the forest, we take a short drive to Katunguru on the edge of Queen Elizabeth National Park. We have a free morning here to take a wide range of optional village walks, learning about the culture of the Basongara, Bakonjo and Banyabindi who live in Queen Elizabeth National Park. Then in the afternoon, we include a guided boat cruise on the Kazinga Channel, where you can look out for hippos, crocodiles, elephants, buffalos, waterbucks and a huge range of bird species. Next, we spend the morning on a game drive on our truck, as we drive south through Queen Elizabeth National Park and on to our next stop, Lake Bunyonyi."

        "description": "Gorilla Trekking, to Kigali We have a whole day set aside today to visit Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park and Mgahinga Gorilla National Park which are home to several families of Highland Mountain Gorillas. Getting up close to these amazing creatures is truly a once in a lifetime experience and one of the highlights of the trip. You have the opportunity to trek to see the Gorillas in Uganda (bookable as an Add on). It is estimated that only around 700 of these gentle giants remain. This mountainous area on the borders of Rwanda, Uganda and Zaire (now renamed Democratic Republic of Congo) is their only natural habitat and they are periodically threatened by poachers and political instability in the area. One permit allows you to spend about 50 to 60 minutes with one of the gorilla families. Trekking to find them in groups of 8 people can take anywhere from half an hour to 5 hours. The organisations and well-trained guides that continually monitor and protect the families are conscientious and responsible. We will base ourselves near the village of Kabale which will give you the opportunity to trek the Mountain Gorillas and visit the beautiful Lake Bunyonyi, where you will have the opportunity to visit a pygmy village. If permits are limited, we may adjust the itinerary slightly to spend an extra day here to give everyone in the group the opportunity to see the gorillas. After our latest forest adventure, we pass through mountain ranges and cross the border into Rwanda and continue to the capital, Kigali. Here we can visit the genocide memorial, which is a moving and humbling experience."

This park provides a unique safari experience, distinct from other national parks in Uganda. Its compact size means it's easy to explore, and its varied landscapes support a wide range of wildlife species. It is also one of the Ugandan parks to offer adventurous night game drives, which you will have the option to take. Starting at around 6.30-7pm and taking 2-3 hours, you can explore the savannah plains with an experienced ranger guide, using spotlight torches to view nocturnal animals, such as leopards, white tailed mongoos, bush baby, bush pigs, genet cats, hippos feeding as well as other animals like impalas, waterbucks, zebras, elands, giraffes and topi among others. A morning safari into the park is also available the next day. From Lake Mburo we drive on to Uganda’s capital, Kampala. Kampala has had a turbulent past, but these days it is a friendly and safe city. We have a free evening to spend in local cafes and nightspots where you can get to know the local people. Then we head north to see the spectacular Sipi Falls. There are three waterfalls here on the Sipi River as it cascades into the Kyoga Basin from the slopes of Mount Elgon. The highest is just under 100m and there is an exciting abseiling option available here."

This is a real contrast to other wild areas we’ll visit, and the forest is home to various mammals including colobus and Debrazzar monkeys, pottos, bush pigs and giant forest hedgehogs, as well as a great selection of colourful birdlife. A guided walk in the forest is included here. Next, we make our first border crossing as we cross from Kenya into Uganda and continue on to camp near Jinja - Uganda's adventure playground. Here, on the edge of Lake Victoria, the Nile begins its 6700km journey to the sea. We spend the next few days a little downstream from the source of the Nile. This is a spectacular area and a superb place to go whitewater rafting or kayaking. You can also organise quad biking, horse riding or a visit to a local education project."

        "description": "Kalinzu Forest Reserve & Queen Elizabeth National Park A long day’s drive now takes us west through swamps, patches of forest and fertile green countryside. As we travel through Uganda, we'll pass through a number of small towns and villages; Mpigi, where you will see roadside stalls manufacturing and selling traditional musical instruments; Kyazanga, where we can buy fresh rotisserie and roasted meat and vegetables, as well as roasted plantain bananas. We will also be able to make a photo stop where our route crosses the Equator. Our destination is Kalinzu Forest Reserve. Here we have a great opportunity to take an optional hike into the forest to see some habituated chimpanzee families. Permits need to be booked several months in advance, so please get in touch if you would like to add this experience. Only 12 permits are issued each day to minimize disruption to the animals, and a local guide will take you through the forest to find the group. You then have an hour watching and following them before returning to camp. You should see many other monkeys, birds and other wildlife during the trip too. If you don’t book the chimp trek, then various other walks are available in the forest to see waterfalls, birds, primates, and other wildlife. The forest has four main paths for nature walks, including the valley trail, the waterfall path, the river trail, and the Palm trail. These can all be arranged when you get there. After our day in the forest, we take a short drive to Katunguru on the edge of Queen Elizabeth National Park. We have a free morning here to take a wide range of optional village walks, learning about the culture of the Basongara, Bakonjo and Banyabindi who live in Queen Elizabeth National Park. Then in the afternoon, we include a guided boat cruise on the Kazinga Channel, where you can look out for hippos, crocodiles, elephants, buffalos, waterbucks and a huge range of bird species. Next, we spend the morning on a game drive on our truck, as we drive south through Queen Elizabeth National Park and on to our next stop, Lake Bunyonyi."

        "description": "Gorilla Trekking, to Kigali We have a whole day set aside today to visit Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park and Mgahinga Gorilla National Park which are home to several families of Highland Mountain Gorillas. Getting up close to these amazing creatures is truly a once in a lifetime experience and one of the highlights of the trip. You have the opportunity to trek to see the Gorillas in Uganda (bookable as an Add on). It is estimated that only around 700 of these gentle giants remain. This mountainous area on the borders of Rwanda, Uganda and Zaire (now renamed Democratic Republic of Congo) is their only natural habitat and they are periodically threatened by poachers and political instability in the area. One permit allows you to spend about 50 to 60 minutes with one of the gorilla families. Trekking to find them in groups of 8 people can take anywhere from half an hour to 5 hours. The organisations and well-trained guides that continually monitor and protect the families are conscientious and responsible. We will base ourselves near the village of Kabale which will give you the opportunity to trek the Mountain Gorillas and visit the beautiful Lake Bunyonyi, where you will have the opportunity to visit a pygmy village. If permits are limited, we may adjust the itinerary slightly to spend an extra day here to give everyone in the group the opportunity to see the gorillas. After our latest forest adventure, we pass through mountain ranges and cross the border into Rwanda and continue to the capital, Kigali. Here we can visit the genocide memorial, which is a moving and humbling experience."

This park provides a unique safari experience, distinct from other national parks in Uganda. Its compact size means it's easy to explore, and its varied landscapes support a wide range of wildlife species. It is also one of the Ugandan parks to offer adventurous night game drives, which you will have the option to take. Starting at around 6.30-7pm and taking 2-3 hours, you can explore the savannah plains with an experienced ranger guide, using spotlight torches to view nocturnal animals, such as leopards, white tailed mongoos, bush baby, bush pigs, genet cats, hippos feeding as well as other animals like impalas, waterbucks, zebras, elands, giraffes and topi among others. A morning safari into the park is also available the next day. From Lake Mburo we drive on to Uganda’s capital, Kampala. Kampala has had a turbulent past, but these days it is a friendly and safe city. We have a free evening to spend in local cafes and nightspots where you can get to know the local people. Then we head north to see the spectacular Sipi Falls. There are three waterfalls here on the Sipi River as it cascades into the Kyoga Basin from the slopes of Mount Elgon. The highest is just under 100m and there is an exciting abseiling option available here."

If we can, then expect basic conditions, but the views and experience of looking out the window and watching the world go by more than make up for it. Alternatively we will drive from Bulawayo to Victoria Falls, arriving late in the afternoon. For some, Mosi oa Tunya - The Smoke That Thunders, is the highlight of their African safari. From the main road, in the bush 20kms away, a cloud of mist and spray can be seen against the blue sky. As you get closer, a low rumble like thunder can be heard. When you arrive it is a surprise to discover the enormity of Victoria Falls. One mile wide and hurling over 5 million cubic metres of water a minute into the Zambezi Gorge this sight is breath taking at any time of year. The water levels vary hugely depending on the time of year, but it is always an amazing spectacle - in fact it can actually be better when there is a little less water, as there is less spray blocking the falls from view. The Gorge below the falls is also the setting for one of the most adrenaline fuelled grade 5 white water rafting rivers in the world. But there is also plenty to do here for the less active too. Why not take a day trip over the Victoria Falls bridge to view the falls from Zambia, take the Flight of Angels - a great way to get a birds eye view of the falls in a microlight or helicopter, enjoy a civilised afternoon tea at the Victoria Falls Hotel, join a Sunset Boat Cruise or a more sedate Canoe trip.

You stay at a wonderful camp on the river in the Reserve and elephants regularly visit and occasionally wander through.   <br/>Also you can visit Ololokwe, the sacred mountain of the Samburu, and stay at a delightful eco camp run by the local Samburu.  You can climb the mountain for the sunrise (or climb the previous afternoon and fly camp at the summit) with amazing views of the surrounding desert landscapes as well as Mount Kenya. You can also visit Reteti Elephant Sanctuary, well off the beaten track in the shadow of the Ndoto mountains.  This is an amazing experience and you may see many animal orphans such as young giraffe as well as the elephants.  The Reteti staff will show you the kitchen where they prepare the feeding bottles for the youngsters and you will witness feeding time and the elephants playing in their mud bath.<br/>Then you travel by air back to Nairobi and connect with a flight to Malindi.  It's a short transfer to Watamu with its contrast of both the ocean and a ‘creek’ (actually a mangrove-lined estuary). <br/>I would recommend snorkelling in the Coral Gardens and a sunset dhow cruise on Mida Creek. Dhows were used for trading in the past and there’s something rather magical about sailing along sipping your sundowner on one of these old-style vessels with its billowing sail. <br/>You can also paddleboard with dolphins. <br/>Best time to visit is mid-October to April. I would definitely avoid September when huge drifts of seaweed appear close to the shoreline.<br/>A really lovely, happy and special place to spend a few days at the end of your holiday!",

Owing to the terrain and need to explore to find the gorillas, our trek doesn’t follow a path; instead, our guides cut a route through the undergrowth. After a safety briefing, we are assigned to a gorilla family group and begin our trek. Expect a minimum of three hours of walking on irregular terrain; steep ascents and descents over muddy slopes are the norm. Strong footwear is essential and we recommend hiring a local porter to help you carry your bag/camera equipment and provide a steady, supportive hand (porters are arranged and paid for locally on the day). Seeing wild mountain gorillas in their natural habitat is an experience you will never forget. An adult male can weigh up to 430lb (195kg), a female up to 220lb (100kg), and a male can reach 5ft 7in (1.7m) tall. They are almost exclusively vegetarian and quite destructive eaters, which makes them unpopular with the farmers lower down the mountain as they have been known to wreck a whole field of crops just to eat one plant. For this reason, and poaching, the gorillas are very carefully protected. Gorillas are gentle creatures and are not known to attack unless very severely provoked. The family groups we trek to see are habituated to human presence but to prevent over familiarisation our time with them is limited to one hour. If the permits for gorilla families close to where we stay are unavailable, there may be more permits for other areas of the park, although this will mean a longer drive to the start of the trek.

    "generalInfo": "Travel through some of Kenya's least visited areas and see a side of this Safari haven that few people visit on safaris here. From thousands of flamingos to habituated baboons and of course all of Africa's best mammals this is the Kenyan Safari for you.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/><br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife tours in Eastern Africa which combine various different wildlife watching activities. In order to develop our unrivalled range of combined wildlife watching holidays, our guides and colleagues around the world have spent years searching out the world’s best wildlife watching locations as well as visiting some seldom visited areas. This dedication has led us to create this wildlife and cultural tour that explores some areas that are seldom visited by most safari goers to Kenya. <br/><br/>This tour starts at the wonderful Amboseli national park in the shadow of the stunning Mt. Kilimanjaro before exploring the southern Rift Valley and seeing how the local people live in harmony with the wildlife before spending time in the world famous and renowned Maasai Mara Game Reserve. Anyone who has wanted to experience an Africa safari, meet a Maasai or enjoy a sundowner underneath the silhouetted shape of Kilimanjaro then this is the perfect tour for you. Enjoy activities from traditional safaris around some of the world’s best national parks and night drives in search of rarer and nocturnal species to baboon tracking with a local Maasai guide and an habituated troop and hiking the Nguruman Escarpment. <br/><br/>All of our tours are guided by our own professional zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) so you are sure to be in the best hands possible for the best sightings. We also have a great network of local guides in East Africa who have developed a great range of wildlife watching locations where the rarest species are commonly seen. Also to try and make sure that we will see as many of the rarer and elusive animals when in Amboseli National Park and the Masai Mara Game Reserve we will spend many hours during the early morning and late afternoon on jeep safaris and also after dark each night we will head out with high powered spotlights and start the search for nocturnal species. <br/><br/>One of the reasons why our wildlife watching holidays are unique is that our background (as a company) is from a scientific and zoological standpoint and so have a great network of colleagues and contacts all over the world who are the people on the front line in search of the best new locations for wildlife watching. All of these reasons and many more make us experts in arranging safaris and are able to tailor a safari to any location to try to find your targeted species. All you have to do is to get in touch with your budget and your group size and where you would like to go to try and find rare and elusive species.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner). There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers and open top 4x4 vehicles for all safaris. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) will escort you on all your excursions and also very knowledgeable English speaking local guides who have decades of experience working and guiding throughout Eastern Africa. Your zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) escort is an expert in mammal biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge of where some of the most elusive African animals are; as well as having years of experience in bringing people out to see Africa’s big five and its hundreds of other species safely. We also include all vehicle safaris, guided walks, spotlighting drives, cultural performances, cultural activities, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the African bush or some other wildlife watching activity. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour.<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>We recommend April and May and the low season for East Africa. We recommend travelling to Kenya for this tour in the low tourist season, this is very good for wildlife as there are less people and it is the birthing season for many species, so there are lots of young animals and the chances of seeing hunts and kills is good at this time of year. The price quoted here is based on the low season, we can and do run this tour at other times of year, the wildebeest migration can also be included, please ask for specific quotes for different times of the year.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>•\tAll of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by a zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) as well as local naturalist guides, drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>•\tWe can offer you spotlighting trips around some of the many conservancies in the southern Rift Valley so that you can search for the rarer species and other nocturnal wildlife when they are more active. These conservancies are community projects which increase income to the local community whilst preserving the natural ecosystem.<br/>•\tWe can also bring thermal imaging and night vision equipment as well as spotting scopes (on request) to also aid in finding the nocturnal mammals after dark and scan the horizon for harder to see species.<br/>•\tWe use camera traps (where available) which will increase the chances of getting close up pictures and movies of rare animals and other rare nocturnal wildlife.<br/>•\tHike the stunning and Nguruman Escarpment and see the vegetation change dramatically as you rise to the top of this western wall at the southern tip of the Great Rift Valley.<br/>•\tEnjoy a morning walking with a troop of wild (but habituated) baboons with the help of a local Maasai guide who is helping establish baboon friendly policies with local farmers who traditionally do not get on with crop-raiding baboons.<br/>•\tImmerse yourself into the wonderful life of the Maasai and see how their famous coloured beads are made and also see how they and their cattle interact and live alongside the wildlife of the African plains and valleys.<br/>•\tAll the above reasons give this Kenyan safari holiday a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. <br/>•\tWe have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Eastern Africa so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the Big Five, gorillas, chimpanzees and hundreds of other species throughout Eastern Africa. Whether it is the Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda or Rwanda or any of the other many wildlife watching locations you want to visit we can arrange it. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>•\tUnlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour travels to Amboseli National Park and the Maasai Mara Game Reserve as well as visiting Nairobi, Lake Magadi, Lake Nakuru and conservancies in the southern Rift Valley.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The majority of wildlife watching is all done from the 4x4 safari vehicle so any fitness level can participate. Activities that do require walking are tracking the habituated troop of baboons and the optional hike through the Nguruman Escarpment, these activities are taken easy but you may be walking for a few hours so we recommend that people are used to hiking.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 Years Old.",

        "description": "Today, you’ll travel from Loita Hills to Maasai Mara. Most of the road there is tarmacked, but the final 5 km is dusty when dry and muddy when wet. The Maasai Mara, with its sparse open plains, dramatic skies and some of the world's most tremendous animals, is the quintessential African experience. After setting up camp, sit down for some lunch. Then, it's time to jump in 4WDs and go for a game drive through the wilderness of the Mara, looking out for all your wildlife favourites form the Lion King – think wildebeest, lions, leopards, cheetahs, buffalo, elephants and rhino."

The park covers an area of about 392 square kilometres and is home to the largest population of African elephants in Kenya, many of which are ‘big tuskers’ (elephants with large tusks). You may even spot a ‘super tusker’ – a male bull elephant with tusks that weigh over 45 kg each, usually so long they scrape the ground. If you're lucky to visit on a clear day, you'll be treated to amazing views of Mt Kilimanjaro. When you arrive, you'll set off on a game drive in your overland vehicle to explore the park and discover the wildlife that calls this place home."

The project plays a crucial role in improving the lives and working conditions of rangers, supporting local communities, and promoting conservation efforts where both wildlife and people can thrive. After your visit, travel toward the Kenya-Tanzania border, heading to Mto wa Mbu, a charming village that offers a glimpse into small-town African life. In the afternoon, join the local community for a guided walk around the village, visiting farms, milling machines, and homes.

Take in the spectacular views from the crater's rim as you make your way to the bottom, where animals roam the lakes, rivers, woodlands and hills. The animals here are less wary of humans and vehicles, and as a result, it's easier to watch them up close. Keep an eye out for wildebeest, lion, zebra, cheetah, buffalo, gazelle and the endangered black rhino. Later, head to the wide-open plains of the Serengeti. The Serengeti landscapes see a huge contrast of colours during the year – green after the rains, brown and burnt in the dry season. The never-ending landscape is home to thousands of animals travelling as herds across the plains. This region gets its name from the local Maasai word ‘siringet’, meaning the place where the land moves on forever. Enjoy a picnic lunch, then head to your campsite within the park. Tonight, listen out for the sounds of nocturnal animals as you drift to sleep."

    "tourName": "Tsavo safari in Kenya",
    "placesVisited": "",
    "generalInfo": "The name Tsavo evokes many different thoughts, maybe it is the historical aspect of when the railway was being built through the park and a pair of infamous man-eating lions started to kill the workers. Or maybe it is more recent and the huge numbers of elephants who were killed by poachers in the 1960’s-80’s; or perhaps it simply that Tsavo (split into two huge national parks) is one of the last safari destinations in East Africa that is not regularly visited by mass tourism.<br/><br/>Whatever the thoughts Tsavo is incredible to visit and this tour explores both sides of the park in depth.<br/><br/>The Mara and Amboseli are more famous and receive more visitors but Tsavo is larger and home to much of the same wildlife with less people and a more 'authentic' safari experience nowadays.<br/><br/>So join us on this special safari holiday to Kenya and experience the wild majesty of the both West and East Tsavo National Park in all of its glory.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/><br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife tours in Kenya which combine various different wildlife watching activities. In order to develop our unrivalled range of combined wildlife watching holidays, our guides and colleagues around the world have spent years searching out the world’s best wildlife watching locations as well as visiting some seldom visited areas. This dedication has led us to create this comprehensive safari which visits nearly all of the important wildlife watching locations within Kenya. <br/><br/>By visiting the grassland / savanna ecosystems of Tsavo West and Tsavo East you will combine the famous wildlife watching destinations with some of the lesser visited in Kenya. By visiting more than one protected area you will gain a larger appreciation for ecotourism and conservation matters, which is what makes this safari unique. <br/><br/>All of our tours are guided by our own professional zoologist (where available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) so you are sure to be in the best hands possible for the best sightings as well as a great network of local guides in East Africa who have developed a great range of wildlife watching locations where the rarest species are commonly seen. Also to try and make sure that we will see as many of the rarer and elusive animals such as hirola in Tsavo as well as the famous Big Five. On this trip we will spend many hours during the early morning and late afternoon on jeep safaris and also (where possible) after dark each night we will head out with high powered spotlights and start the search for nocturnal species. <br/><br/>One of the reasons why our wildlife watching holidays are unique is that our background (as a company) is from a scientific and zoological standpoint and so have a great network of colleagues and contacts all over the world who are the people on the front line in search of the best new locations for wildlife watching. All of these reasons and many more make us experts in arranging safaris and are able to tailor a safari to any location to try to find your targeted species. All you have to do is to get in touch with your budget and your group size and where you would like to go to try and find rare and elusive species.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner (where mentioned in the itinerary)). There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers and open top 4x4 vehicles for all safaris. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) will escort you on all your excursions and also very knowledgeable English speaking local guides who have decades of experience working and guiding throughout Eastern Africa. Your zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) escort is an expert in mammal biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge of where some of the most elusive African animals are; as well as having years of experience in bringing people out to see Africa’s big five and its hundreds of other species safely. We also include all vehicle safaris, guided walks, spotlighting drives, cultural performances, cultural activities, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the African bush or some other wildlife watching activity. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour.<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>We recommend September / October as a great time for this trip as the wildlife is abundant at this time of year and the weather is not too hot and drier than other times of year. But we can run the trip at other times of year; just note that the price quoted here is based on the low season, we can and do run this tour at other times of year, the wildebeest migration can also be included, please ask for specific quotes for different times of the year.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>•\tAll of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by a zoologist (where available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) as well as local naturalist guides, drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>•\tWe can offer you spotlighting trips around some of the places visited on the trip - where the local authorities allow after dark activities.<br/>•\tWe can also bring thermal imaging and night vision equipment as well as spotting scopes (on request) to also aid in finding the nocturnal mammals after dark and scan the horizon for harder to see species.<br/>•\tWe use camera traps (where available) which will increase the chances of getting close up pictures and movies of rare animals and other rare nocturnal wildlife.<br/>•\tExplore a huge ranger of ecosystems and protected areas across two of the world's greatest wildlife watching destinations.<br/>•\tImmerse yourself into the wonderful life of the Maasai and see how their famous coloured beads are made and also see how they and their cattle interact and live alongside the wildlife of the African plains and valleys.<br/>•\tAll the above reasons give this East African safari holiday a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. <br/>•\tWe have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Eastern Africa so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the Big Five, gorillas, chimpanzees and hundreds of other species throughout Eastern Africa. Whether it is the Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda or Rwanda or any of the other many wildlife watching locations you want to visit we can arrange it. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>•\tUnlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour travels to two locations, both of which form the greater Tsavo ecosystem. The park is split into two sections and this trip visits both Tsavo East and West National Parks (they adjoin each other) and the entrance and exit point for this trip is Nairobi.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The majority of wildlife watching is all done from the 4x4 safari vehicle so any fitness level can participate. There are very few walks involved and all do not require any special physical fitness.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 Years Old.",

Once we arrive in the eastern side of the Tsavo ecosystem we will have another short game drive as we drive to our lodge, on arrival we will have lunch and then head out for our afternoon game drive once the temperatures cool a little as the day progresses. The eastern park is 13,747km2 in area and is drier than the western side, previously known as Taru Desert the area is not a true desert but more a semi arid ecosystem. The whole ecosystem (and the two national parks) were renamed Tsavo after the Tsavo River that flows through the park. The park is also a biodiversity hotspot and over the nest three full days we will spend lots of time looking for wildlife; there are some animals which are found here which are usually restricted to the very arid regions to the north and into Somalia, such as desert warthogs, somali ostriches and hirola.

From the wandering animals in Nairobi National Park where zebra, lion, rhino and more graze along the infinite open space, to the collected wonders of the Nairobi National Museum, the city offers a diverse and endless amount of opportunity to explore Kenya’s natural beauty and historic wonders. Start your incredible adventures with a visit to the Giraffe Center, a stunning breeding center for the Rothschild Giraffe, which is found only in East Africa. The lush openness of the center is located in what was once the home of Jock Leslie-Melville. The air is fragrant with the acacias lining the outside of the center. Giraffes wrap their tongues around the thorny trees, tearing the sprung leaves from the branches. Their eyes are heavy and large, with eyelashes that curl and flutter. Sit down for a meal in the delicious dining room where the giraffe can be seen sauntering outside or, most likely, peaking their heads through the window and asking you to share."

Beside the road the trees rise and fall giving way to open plains, trickling water, villages, and back to plains. Arrive at the foothills of the Great Rift Valley where a natural wall made of trees and rock spring from the earth. The Great Rift Valley was formed by interactions between three major tectonic plates in the greater area giving rise to the flourishing green trees that glow against the yellow straw. The cliffs are breathtaking, having practically risen from nowhere and taken the world by surprise. Climb the western wall of the valley and enter the Serengeti Plains, known for its sensational wildlife and as a favorite destination for American author Earnest Hemingway. Venture into the expanse of the Maasai Mara. The sun spreads over the savanna giving the grass a glisten in the afternoon shine. The sweeping wash of grass leads into the foothills of the surrounding mountains growing farther in the distance. Acacia trees add a minty floral cologne to the air. The white and black stripes of zebra wander through the tall grass. The collective herd is almost hypnotic as they stroll together, their stripes mimicking a rotating black and white disk swirling inside itself. The heat of the sun turns into a soft glow setting behind the acacias. Settle into the night with the crackle of the fire and the soothing sounds of the wild in the cool of the evening."

The morning dew rises into the air with the sun. Step into the wild world of the Maasai Mara once again to scour the endless plains for its famous and stunning life. The road bumps and tumbles along while you glide over the pebbled throughway. Warthogs scamper through the grass while the dust from the vehicle sparkles in the sunshine behind you. The guide stops, points into the distance where lions laze in the risen sun. The male’s mane almost blends with the grass, his deep eyes brown and fierce. He yawns in the exhaustion of the post meal heat, his teeth sharp and intimidating. The breeze blows softly through his mane and you know it is a welcome respite from the heat of his fur in the sun. The sun glides through the air, the lion begins to sleep, and you continue your adventure through the plains to witness the rest of the Maasai Mara majesty."

The beauty of Lake Nakuru spawns before you, along with the sensational wildlife that calls the lake home. Travel through the sprawling trees where the brush sways in the breeze. The leaves rustle filling the area with an earthy scent of bark and freshly fallen water. Up in the trees just beneath the canopy sits the black and white fur of a Colobus monkey. Their white fur lines their cheeks looking more like 19th-century facial hair. Their wide, brown eyes scour the treetops for food, predators, or family while their tails swing freely in the air off of the branch they sit wily on. The trees open up to the wonders of the lake where the water glows with the reflection of its surroundings making the mountains almost double on the horizon. The marsh opens and the air is filled with the slight scent of saltwater. A pink shimmer ripples across the lake. You think it may be the reflection of the afternoon sun, but instead, the shore of Lake Nakuru is filled with flamingos. The dark black of their beaks stands prominently against their bright pink feathers. Their legs sway as they glide through the air, their wingspan impressive, the underside of their wings as black as their beaks. The quiet grace of the flamingos surrounds you until the quiet is broken with a snort that sounds like thunder. A White rhino traipses across the marsh. It’s girth impressive and stunning. Its ears rotate like satellites while it sniffs the air in search of the source of the unfamiliar scent in its territory. The rhino continues to amble through the marsh. You are quiet; you can feel your chest contract slightly, trying to hold your breath as much as you can to keep the rhino close. Soon the magnificence of the rhino fades behind the trees with the sun, the flamingos bury their heads into their feathers to sleep, and you relax in the luxuries of your hotel."

The flowers, from roses to tulips, fill the markets with a flourish of color as you pass the village center. The smell of fresh flowers mixes with the freshwater of the lake as you find the watery shores. Once settled in you will climb aboard a boat and tour the stunning waters of Lake Naivasha, known for its sensational birds and lively hippos. The grunts and bubbles of the hippos gurgle from the water. Their ears flick just above the surface. Their snorts cause mist to rise into the air. Their heavy bodies keep them from floating or swimming, which is why they are found in the shallower areas of lakes and rivers. Fish eagles glide through the sky, their wings spread wide in the cool lake breeze, as the eagle dips down, talons spread open, skating just above the surface, and catching a fish. The boat putters along; mountains decorate the horizon and a pod of pelicans serenely floats. You return to the dock and the water of the lake trickles in the evening quiet."

Whether you prefer to drive, walk, or cycle through Hell’s Gate the sights are sensational, the wildlife is vivacious, and the landscapes are breathtaking. The colorful cliffs shine orange and gold in the sunlight. The grass glistens as you pass by. If you prefer to glide through the park on bicycle, the open air feels cool on your skin and is aromatic with dry earth. Central Tower stands tall over the sunken valley of Hell’s Gate, a craggy rock formation over 80 feet tall standing alone amongst the plain. Travel into Njorowa Gorge where the layered rock undulates like pieces from a Jenga game. The gorges of Hell’s Gate are also known for their depiction in various scenes of The Lion King. From rock-climbing to bird watching, cycling to walking, Hell’s Gate offers a different view of Kenya where the wildebeest run along the dried earth, vultures glide high in the sky, and baboons stroll along the roadways. As your adventure through Hell’s Gate comes to an end you will return to Nairobi for the evening. Your final night in Kenya should be celebrated with a delicious meal to remind you of the stunning wonders of the country, from the vast savanna to the reflective lakes. For a wonderful treat try Talisman, located in the well-to-do and quiet neighborhood of Karen. The restaurant feels like a secret, a delicious secret tucked away in a suburb where local, sustainable, and organic food is the norm. The globetrotting menu brings you the flavors of coconut and local seafood soup packed with a sweet fragrance and briny punch.

It is also the best location for balloon safaris. You can capture some wonderful photos while soaring above the Mara plains at dawn in a hot-air balloon.

A short flight soars alongside Mount Kilimanjaro, touching you down beside the herds that roam with swinging trunks and insatiable smiles. The snow-tinged peak of Africa's highest mountain sparkles in the distance, providing the evocative backdrop for all your Amboseli adventure. Settle into the your picturesque camp and set off on two game drives today. Get even closer to the elephants by winding a trail through the acacia woodlands, then cross the plains for first sightings of buffalo and insatiable big cats hiding amongst the long grass.

Different ecosystems ensure intimacy with a myriad of Kenya's big game, from the scurrying hyenas in the scrub bush to those omnipresent elephants that bulldoze through the acacias. Like most safari days, the heat of the day is downtime, a chance to relax at camp and indulge in the luxury on offer. Wildlife also takes a rest at this time, although there's always a sprinkling of mammals gracing the horizon. As the afternoon trickles towards dust your second game drive continues the exploration and it culminates in watching an iconic African sunset from the top of Observation Hill."

        "description": "Solio Reserve epitomizes the exclusivity of this signature vacation. Nestled between the slopes of Mount Kenya, Solio is home to Kenya's greatest concentration of endangered Black rhino, as well as an abundant collection of the other Big Five. There's some 45,000 acres of game reserve to explore and there's just one lodge. You'll rarely see the handful of other guests and feelings of solitude abound. Grazing zebra and waterbuck are beside your spacious cottage, their delicacy bringing enchanting touches to languid evenings beneath the stars. Floor to ceiling windows ensure the lavish surroundings are maximized; you only need to open the curtains to marvel at Kenya's wildlife below. You'll fly to Solio from Amboseli, the aerial journey perfect for gaping at elephant herds and the scale of the parks. Then a range of activities are customized to you and your partner's preferences. Game drives seek out the big stuff; lions prowling, leopards hiding in the trees, and the Black rhinos that even safari aficionados may go months without seeing. But what's this? It looks familiar but the horn is different and the lip reveals that this is a White rhino approaching the safari truck. Parts of the reserve have been tailored to getting you onto the ground. Cycle and walk through the landscape, a skilled guide bringing stunning intimacy with the ungulate herds of Solio. After the excitement, tonight's itinerary includes a soothing in-room treatment by the lodge's massage therapists. But as you slip into serene heaven, remember to occasionally open your eyes and marvel at what wanders past the cottage."

Choose game drives or walking safaris, or gallop alongside zebra herds with an inimitable horseback safari. Tonight's treat comes in the form of darkness. Head out on a nighttime drive and the atmosphere is almost spooky, the landscape promising ethereal surprise. You can get even closer at night, the guide turning on the lights and revealing that you're barely a few meters away from buffalo, elephant, rhino, and the nocturnal treasures that scurry across the ground."

The canvas walls ensure you're enveloped in the sounds of the wild, but the interior provides the kind of opulence you would expect from an award-winning honeymoon suite. You're situated above nature's amphitheater and it's easy to laze away many hours watching everything pass by your verandah. Lewa's wildlife brings new delights to the safari memories; strange gerenuk stand on their hind legs and feed on the branches, dik-diks and eland avoid the attentions of nearby lions, and a range of indigenous species can be found at the southern reaches of the range. Of course, there are all the regular favorites, so keep snapping the Black and White rhinos, elephants, and reticulated giraffe."

They are places of solitude and seclusion that can simultaneously provide unrivaled safari experiences. The Maasai Mara is world-famous and a bucket list destination for millions around the world. It deserves its fame and popularity. However, this signature itinerary continues the paradigm of romantic exclusivity by revealing a unique angle to the Mara. Fly over the Great Rift Valley and a tiny airstrip welcomes you to the heart of lion country. Stretch out in a four-poster bed and soak up the space of your luxury camp. A tucked away private verandah overlooks the Mara River, and it's teeming with hippos wallowing beneath the sun. Wild sounds reverberate through the camp and still you don't see other people.

Spotted hyenas drift across rolling grasslands, giraffe leave distinct impressions on the horizon, and wildebeest clump together in great herds. A phenomenal collection of lion prides tuck into ungulate feasts, the acacia savannas seem to be without boundary, and there's always a dramatic hunting scene to be seen from a distance. Take a second drive and the same scenes repeat themselves. Take a third game drive and the herds keep multiplying, the cats keep hunting, and the plains keep dazzling with life. Spend three days exploring the Maasai Mara and these impressions of beauty begin to accumulate. One game drive here is a phenomenal sight. But over three days you gradually interpret impressions of scale. The abundance of herds and big cats is unrivaled; you're not merely appreciating intimate encounters with Kenya's remarkable wildlife, you're constantly engulfed in a vast ecosystem that seems to be without boundaries. Like always, the game drive itinerary is flexible and departure times are flexible. So there's always an option of a leisurely morning in bed with your partner opening the curtains to reveal the Maasai Mara."

        "description": "The Masai Mara's fame is easily justified and flying into the National Reserve, you quickly understand why this is one of Africa's most revered destinations. Elephants can be seen from the airstrip, wildebeest are scattered across the plains, and every angle is untouched by civilization. You don't need to look for animals; it feels like they're everywhere. On the drive to the camp, you might spot a dozen different species, from galloping kudu to the bizarre snarl of a spotted hyena. For the next three nights, you're staying in a camp elegantly perched above the Mara River. Throughout most of the day and evening, it's possible to lounge on your verandah and see a procession of wildlife drinking from the water. Today you'll be transferred to Nairobi Wilson Airport for the domestic flight by light aircraft. After touching down, the transfer to camp is also a game drive, a first snapshot of wildlife. Take lunch at the camp before an afternoon game drive starts to explore the evocative enormity of the Masai Mara. Surround yourself with wildebeest, the rampaging herds covering the grass with their antics. Find zebra at the river, over 100 drinking with an expression of fear. Further along the banks, you find a lion pride hiding in the long grass, two small cubs playfully interrupting their mother's sleep. An elephant roams past, a huge bull with resplendent tusks. A little later there's a large herd, the young calves curiously inspecting the vehicle. Giraffe grace the horizon, a buffalo herd can be seen and heard, and it's rare to go more than a few minutes without ticking another new animal of your list. The game drive concludes at sunset, and the camp provides a tranquil place to let the evening float away."

        "title": "Masai Mara National Reserve – Endless Herds of the Mara",
        "description": "The dream of a first safari day is to get a glimpse of the famous animals, particularly the big five. After coming to Africa, there's this wonderful expectancy, the sense that you'll encounter such iconic mammals in the wild. On the second day, there remains a wonderful aura about being so close to the animals. But you start to notice more. Gaze at an impala herd and follow their movements, admiring how sentinels keep watch while others graze. See a zebra herd, how couples rest their necks on each others' backs, so they have a 360-degree panorama between them. Watch how a cheetah carefully teaches her cubs, encouraging them to move slowly and furtively through the grassland. On a safari, you see animals in their wild habitat, which means you're constantly watching their behavior in the wild. Over these two days, you follow the classic safari program of twice-daily game drives. Start at dawn, the most active time in the Masai Mara. Big cats are on the move, hunting in the cool hours as sunrise colors flicker across the horizon. Lions, leopards, cheetahs, hyenas; this landscape supports an astonishing number of predators and it's rare that a game drive doesn't encounter at least some of these animals. Exploring at dawn enhances the chance of watching a hunt play out. Perhaps you spot a leopard stalking a wildebeest herd. Or lionesses trying to separate a zebra. The majority of hunts are unsuccessful, so the drama of the kill isn't an everyday sight. Sometimes you also arrive a little too late, and a bloodied carcass is being feverishly ripped apart. Whatever scene plays out, this sense of being in the wild is absolute. Morning game drives return around 10:30 or 11 am, giving you a few tranquil hours at the camp. Enjoy lunch, relax on the verandah, gaze at the water, watch the animals pass by, and softly drift off into a siesta. Then an afternoon game drive continues the adventure. Each drive will explore a different part of the Masai Mara, enabling you to piece together the subtleties of the habitat. Stop beside the river and spend 30 minutes watching the hippos; roam through scattered woodland for intimate elephant and giraffe encounters; cross the grass and surround yourself with thousands of wildebeest, zebra, and Thompson's gazelle. These afternoon drives return just before sunset, where a hot shower is waiting before dinner is served on a deck overlooking the river."

        "title": "Mara North Conservancy – Exclusive Luxury Safari",
        "description": "Kenya's Masai Mara and Tanzania's Serengeti are one ecosystem, stretching across an area that would dwarf many European countries. There are no fences. Some two million mammals wander freely here, some always on the move and others protecting their home territory. The Mara North Conservancy is along the northern fringes of the ecosystem. Tens of thousands of animals reside here, but only a few tourists get to see them. This is a private conservancy and access is restricted to guests staying in the conservancy. So the safari photos aren't interrupted by another vehicle. You'll fly here on a short hop north that immerses you in an exclusive safari destination. Safari here is a little different. On a game drive, you head off the trail, bumping across the grass until you're just meters away from the wildlife. A leopard in a tree, Grant's gazelle getting harassed by a hyena, a duiker carcass attacked by vultures; hypnotic scenes like these come with increased intensity when you get so close. Over the last decade, the relative lack of visitors has helped Mara North attract huge numbers of animals. It's more peaceful here, with far less engine noise, making it ideal for giant mammals to raise their young. Baby elephants splash in a river, bashful young giraffe lope behind their mothers, buffalos skillfully protect their calves when lionesses approach; and you keep getting closer and closer. New activities are available in this private conservancy. Step slowly onto the savanna, following Masai warrior guides who take you on a walking safari. By following animal clues, you approach the ungulates. Stand beside Grant's gazelle, their horns elegant and proud. Be just a few meters from wild zebra, appreciating how every set of stripes is unique. Wildebeest and Thompson's gazelles bound past, stopping quickly to inspect you. Even buffalo and elephant might be safely encountered on foot. Nighttime game drives add further drama, with the guide stopping the vehicle on the heart of the plains, surrounding you with the reticent grazing of the herds. Wait. Tune in your ears. Then flick on a spotlight and see just how close the animals are. Over these two days, you can create a personal program of activities, combining game drives, walking safaris and nighttime drives."

Grasslands glimmer softly in the sunrise light, rustic yellows and lavish greens spiraling beneath the balloon. You float slowly, crossing the Mara and absorbing the uninterrupted vistas. Spot the random rocks where lion prides hide, the large black herds that inhabit the plains, and the sense of a landscape that has no boundaries. This is one of Kenya's most iconic experiences, a sublime hour of cruising through the air. Touch down and the flight is followed by a champagne breakfast. You're fully assimilated into the Masai Mara rhythm. A wild soundtrack always keeps you company, birdsong sporadically bursting out as a rolling beat of galloping hooves reverberates. Pristine encounters come at any time; maybe an impala grazing next to your verandah, or an elephant bull feeding on the camp's trees just a few meters from where you're having a dinner. Safari is no longer about the tick list or photographing different animals. It's about the immense feeling of being in harmony with one of the world's most untouched and dramatic wild landscapes. Enjoy a final afternoon game drive today before a last night of dining amongst the wildlife silhouettes."

Like the Mara, the colors are never static, subtle hues blurring in and out of each other. Touch down and white becomes the dominate color, the blinding sand of the beach always requiring quality sunglasses. You're staying in the coastal Mombassa suburb of Nyali, which rises vibrantly along a long stretch of beach. Mombassa is Kenya's second city, but the beaches remain quiet, opulent sweeps of sand that provide a tranquil sight after the drama of the safari adventure. Your five-star hotel overlooks the ocean and maintains the tranquil atmosphere of the landscape. Then, you see another side to the coast, a guided tour bringing you to Mombasa Old Town, a small maze of Swahili coral houses. Boutique stores are filled with naval antiques while chai sellers shout vividly, their calls floating through narrow market lanes. Fort Jesus stands at the town's heart, a World Heritage site with an important slavery history. This is a town that has been through so many emotions, yet it's invariably a place of smiles and welcomes, providing a cultural connection to a lifestyle mostly unchanged through the centuries."

Instead, the emphasis and atmosphere are on space and privacy. The beaches aren't private, but they don't need to be as there's hardly another set of footprints in the sand. You're staying in a private villa which overlooks the sand, its verandah shaded by a tropical canopy of indigenous trees. And for these four days, you don't even need to wear shoes. An English-speaking guide comes with the villa and can arrange anything you require. Like barbecue lobster dinners on your verandah, renting a wooden dhow and sailing the coast, diving trips to Indian Ocean reefs, or ocean fishing excursions. Things like fresh coconuts getting delivered every morning come as standard. Meals can be arranged at the villa, but the guide can also drive you into Malindi to visit its collection of restaurants.

Elephants walk slowly across the landscape, their bodies silhouetted against the backdrop of Mount Kilimanjaro. Every morning in Amboseli brings this fairytale view, with elephants roaming wild beneath the world's highest freestanding mountain. Take in the panoramic from your beautiful lodge, admiring these majestic mammals as they freely wander past your room. You'll drive to Amboseli and arrive at the lodge in time for lunch and a long afternoon game drive. Game viewing is easy on these flat plains. Elephant interactions are everywhere. Small herds roll around in a swamp, youngsters struggle to keep pace with large herds, while melancholy old bulls stand lonely in the grass. Bushy haired buffalos head towards water, kicking up swirling dust as they plod along the dusty ground. Beside the dry salt lake of Ol Tukai, a collection of mammals provide memorable first safari moments. Giraffe, gazelle, wildebeest, and zebra; a colorful cast that grazes together, sentinels warning the rest if lion prides or cheetah are spotted nearby. Life slows down when the intense midday sun scorches the ground. But at dawn and dusk the park is at its most active. Predators roam, hippos emerge from the water, and the grazers are on full alert. After an early morning game drive on day three, you'll visit a local Maasai village and learn about the unique culture of Amboseli's other residents. For thousands of years the Maasai have coexisted with all these wild animals. This visit will reveal how their lifestyle and traditions have made this possible. A late afternoon game drive follows, and hopefully by now you'll have come face to face with the park's black rhino population. Back at the lodge the safari experience continues into the night, those magnificent elephants easily spotted as they cross the open plains."

From your elegant lodge, the jagged peaks of Africa's second highest mountain can be glimpsed through the trees. At 7,200 feet above sea level, on the thickly forested foothills, a new world of wildlife provides an atmospheric feast for the senses. Spotting game is not so easy in such a dense forest. So rather than battle through the trees, you just need to sit back and wait for the wildlife to come to you. Your lodge overlooks a waterhole and salt lick in the forest. Sounds give a clue as to what might be approaching. From your private verandah, loud rustling suggests that something large is nearby. It's a small herd of cape buffalo, and as you put your feet up they casually take a drink. Other animals arrive without warning, stealthy travelers like colobus monkeys and waterbucks suddenly appearing beneath you. A continual stream of new arrivals keeps you entertained; raucous baboons, scampering warthogs, genets, and tiny bushbabies calling from the tree branches. The waterhole is flood lit in the evening so you won't miss any of the action."

After breakfast you'll drive through the equator, stopping for a famous photo with your feet straddling this imaginary line. Palm fringed rivers and dusty red plains welcome you to Samburu National Reserve, an isolated land that offers a sanctuary to a rare cast of animals. Long necked gerenuk stand on their hind legs, this rare antelope craning to reach an elevated tree branch. Dik dik hide in the short grass; they are the smallest of Africa's antelopes and also one of its most charming. Reticulated giraffe tower above the arid land, slowly making their way to the life-giving Ewaso Ng'iro River. Samburu would be a lonely quiet place without this water source. But the river thrives with activity and the park's compact size makes game viewing easy. Rare beisa oryx are the next inimitable mammal to impress, their breathtaking horns always drawing enviable gasps. Blue-shanked Somali ostrich and Grevy's zebra wander through the trees, while great elephant herds frolic in the shallows. Samburu Serena Safari Lodge is surrounded by nature, and the park's residents could wander past as you enjoy a leisurely afternoon or sumptuous dinner. And that includes the big cats. Such abundant game in a small area was always going to attract predators. Leopards rest in the trees, always keeping one eye open for an opportunist meal. Lion prides seek shade in the afternoon, lazing beneath trees before the lionesses head out hunting. Cheetahs bide their time, looking to pick off one of the park's smaller residents. The Ewaso Ng'iro River brings life to the park but it also brings danger. Every cat knows that animals must come to drink, and lurking in the shallows are great numbers of Nile crocodiles. With two days in Samburu you've got a great chance of spotting all the park's residents. Adding to the enchantment are 350 species of bird, each clambering for attention. Ornithologists will love the variety of Samburu birds . Hornbills holler from treetops, Maribou Stork reveal monumental wingspans, and eagles show why they're kings of the sky."

        "description": "Now it's rhino time. On the rugged plains of this private game reserve, two males slowly approach the safari truck. Each stops to stare and evaluate the vehicle. They plod past deliberately, magnificent horns pointing skyward, great armored frames showcasing impressive power. This private reserve holds the greatest concentration of rhinos in East Africa. Over 100 critically endangered black rhinos live here, a remarkable figure that's thanks to the reserve's excellent conservation efforts. The full Big Five roam freely around this reserve and there are a numbers of ways to explore. Game drives, horseback safari, camel safari, and game walks are all possible in this thriving wilderness. Black rhino, white rhino, what's the difference? With both species in this reserve you'll gain first hand knowledge of how to distinguish them (clue – it's not by their color). In addition, a chimpanzee sanctuary and rhino information center ensure that this will be one of the most action packed days of your safari itinerary. Back at the lodge, your luxurious thatched-roof tent gazes down on a floodlit waterhole that is frequented throughout the night. Keep your camera on standby as you rest and relax. You never can predict what time the black rhinos will approach for a drink."

        "description": "Vivid colors welcome you to Lake Nakuru, the deep blue lake encircled by a bright pink blanket of flamingos. Millions of these birds wade in the shallows, a stunning spectacle when admired from a distance. Another 400 resident bird species surround the lake, ranging from cormorants and pelicans to tiny avocets and grebes. Lake Nakuru is one of Africa's most beautiful parks, the vibrant colors merging to form a picturesque landscape of water, savannah, and misty mountains. Clifftops provide idyllic viewpoints, as does your lunchtime stop at Lion Hill Lodge. Down beside the lake there is much to explore on your game drive. Rothschild giraffes stand proud and handsome, hyenas and jackals scurry through the grass, while white rhinos will need no introduction after yesterday. Herds of zebra and impala flourish in this abundant land, and the big cats are never too far away. After breakfast you'll drive through the Great Rift Valley in time for a game drive and a leisurely lunch. The game drive continues in the afternoon before you leave the park and stay overnight in the Rift Valley town of Naivasha."

        "title": "Maasai Mara - Unforgettable Safari",
        "description": "Approaching the Maasai Mara the grass begins. Vast plains extend beyond the horizon, the landscape punctuated by great herds of zebra and wildebeest. More than two million mammals thunder north from the Serengeti during the great wildebeest migration. They spend a few summer months grazing on the profuse grasses of the Mara before heading back south. During this time the grass almost disappears beneath a flurry of dust and hooves. But even outside the Great Migration, the Maasai Mara is one of the most abundant landscapes in the world. Get up close and the herds become a series of individual interactions. Zebra foals freely graze, oblivious to the surrounding dangers. Wildebeest roam wildly, a small herd seeking directions from a bearded elder male. Thompson's gazelle look perennially fearful, eyes and ears on full alert. They've got good reason to be fearful. Lion prides laze in the grass, those with full stomachs taking a day off from hunting. Other lionesses are surveying the dinner menu, surrounding a herd and looking to separate the young and the weak. From the safari truck another sight grabs your attention. A leopard is hiding in the grass, carefully approaching a herd of gazelle with slow deliberate steps. The startled prey sense something is wrong and quickly scamper away. The Maasai Mara is arguably the best place in the world to spot the big cats, and with luck you'll see an authentic hunting scene. Enjoy a long afternoon game drive on day nine before continuing your Mara submersion at your opulent safari lodge. Your private balcony gazes out onto the vast plains, ensuring a surreal continuation of wildlife throughout the night. This evocative landscape is one of the most unique on the planet, and provides an arena for an unforgettable safari experience. Take an early morning drive to hippo pools where large pods of playful beasts roll around in the mud. Watch giraffes elegantly wander along the horizon. Smile as young elephants test out their strength, scaring warthogs away from the waterhole. Enjoy quiet lunches with magnificent views of the plains and relax to the sounds of raw nature. The Maasai Mara provides a fitting conclusion to your safari adventure. By now you will have some firm favorites, whether that's elegant zebra, ferocious lions, or imperial rhinos. These two days offer the Big Five and its full supporting cast. But the Maasai Mara and this Kenyan safari experience is about far more than spotting animals. It's about the charming interactions that only you witness, the individual animals that linger in your memory, and the vast beauty of these great stretches of wilderness."

Later this morning you'll be transferred to the local airstrip for a scheduled flight to Nairobi. Please note that a strict luggage limit of 15kg is enforced on these flights. Upon landing in Nairobi you'll have a full afternoon touring some of the city's unique attractions. Savor a meat filled lunch at the famous Carnivore Restaurant, where crocodile and ostrich are among the rare things on the menu. Take an Out of Africa tour at the former farm of Karen Blixen, the author who wrote one of the continent's most famous books. You will have seen Rothschild giraffe earlier on the trip, but at the AFEW Center you can hand feed these gracious mammals. Finally, a farewell dinner marks the end of your African adventure and you will be transferred to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport for your flight home."

        "description": "A Masai Mara safari comes with many preconceptions. You may be expecting action and adventure, drama and dazzling wildlife scenes but few anticipate the serenity and the relaxation that comes as well. As you travel deep into the Mara, you will succumb to the rhythm of the wild as your senses slowly open to all of nature’s clues. You will see animals, but you will not need to bump around in a safari vehicle. Rather, you can just gaze out from your elevated balcony as the plains around you are liberally sprinkled with life, from elephants to buffalo to zebra. There is a pervasive calm that seeps into you as you settle in, and it is hard to think of a better place to overcome any jet lag or travel fatigue. After landing at Nairobi International, you will be transferred to Nairobi Wilson Airport for a flight to the Masai Mara National Reserve. Touch down and your airport transfer will be a game drive, bringing you your first impressions of the famous animals. If you came with a mental tick list, half of them are likely to be spotted on this first drive. Check in at the your first beautiful property and savor your views as on a clear day, you will be able to see 100 miles across the Masai Mara from your balcony. Situated on the rim of the Siria-Oloololo Escarpment and above the wildlife-rich Mara Triangle, this is the region’s newest luxury accommodation. Admire it all through the floor-to-ceiling glass windows and then head out on an afternoon game drive that will bring a succession of evocative sights."

        "description": "A lion pride draped across yellow rocks, cheetahs accelerating after their breakfast meal, and elephant herds squirting water at the river are all found on your first day in the Masai Mara. When the plains are packed with hundreds of thousands of mammals, the animals come thick and fast. 100-strong buffalo herds grunt and graze, giraffe lope elegantly past the vehicle, hyenas scamper around the riverbank, and sometimes it is difficult to know which way to look. Today you will go on both morning and afternoon game drives to immerse yourself in the best of the Mara’s scenes. It is the Mara River that will most capture your imagination and for a good reason. The Mara River is what the wildebeest must cross during their great migration in order to graze in the Mara from late-July to October. Even outside of these months, you will see the Nile crocodiles waiting patiently and the hippo pods barging around. This permanent water attracts nomadic mammals from miles around, and each herd stays within short reach of the daily drink. So by game driving around the Mara River, you are likely to find the exciting scenes that have made the Masai Mara so famous with lion pride on a hunt, herds battling for supremacy, and the contrasting emotion found between predator and prey."

Spending several nights in this region is recommended as it is a large area and there are many directions that a game drive can take. This area brings the classic and unmissable Masai Mara experience as you game drive around the Mara Triangle to follow the battles between predator and prey. As with your past two days, your program has some flexibility so you can stay out for longer drives or return to Angama Mara for some tranquility above the plains. Sunrise and sunset are the premier times as the cooler air sees most wildlife is at its most active. Spot a leopard descending from a tree, and then watch as she dips her neck with cold precision and stalks a Thomson’s gazelle herd. Admire the zebra couples that keep guard with their heads rested on each other’s back. Find hippos out of the water, barging their way around the banks, not caring about the crocodiles. Follow an elephant herd as it crosses the plains, old females showcasing the grace of matriarchs. Hyenas, vultures, impala, wildebeest on the run are all in motion around the Mara Triangle, and these game drives will bring an incredible range of highlights."

        "description": "The sun always looks bigger when in Africa as it rises like a flaming ball that sends out a layer of mirage as it rises into the sky. Elongated bands of red and yellow stretch out along the horizon and the grasslands flicker with a golden tone. You will be in a hot air balloon as you watch the Masai Mara come alive. Look below your balloon basket to see the herds in their black clumps scattered around the plains. From your vantage point, you can appreciate how they move and graze in circular patterns, leaving some of the grass lush and green as the rest turns brittle and yellow. You will float for a couple of hours and then touch down to a champagne brunch. From the landing site, a private game drive will lead you north to the Mara Naboisho Conservancy. Like your balloon ride, this will be another excellent showcase of scale as you discover the size of the ecosystem. It will not be just a few zebra herds; it will be dozens of them. You will not see just one lion pride on their rock; you may spot half a dozen on a good day. Mara Naboisho is also a very prolific wildlife area, and all of the sights from the National Reserve can be discovered. The only thing you will not see is other people as the Mara’s private conservancies are carefully restricted, so only guests at the camps can explore the area. So as you check in to your next camp, it will feel as if you have the Masai Mara all to yourself."

        "description": "Your camp is beautifully situated as it is hidden in a wooded valley that is many miles from any other camp. Although it is a high-end camp, it provides an authentic safari-under-canvas experience, with every hour bringing the evocative sounds of the wilderness. Animals wander past at incredible proximity, and sometimes you will be interrupted from your reading as an elephant or a giraffe strolls by. Wildlife is attracted by the nearby stream, and the wildebeest roam past at regular intervals. The camp is completely unfenced, and there is a genuine thrill in having such a private piece of such a famous landscape. Game drives explore the conservancy, and you will rarely encounter other vehicles. Expect to see a charming collection of animals and continue your experiences with big cats on the move. Mara Naboisho also brings new pleasures, and its quieter plains have become a favorite escape for cheetahs and leopards to raise their cubs. There is still plenty for them to eat, but the solitude helps them to nurse their young; you might even get to see a leopard or cheetah teaching her cub the basics of hunting and stalking. The Masai Mara is not just about the National Reserve as the private conservancies offer an exclusive perspective and are always recommended on a luxury Masai Mara safari."

Zebra are nearby, and you will slowly approach as the wildebeest gallop past oblivious to your presence. For thousands of years, the Masai tribe have shared the Mara with the wildlife, cohabiting the plains with the predators. Not only that, they have herded their cattle on these grasslands, using ancestral knowledge to stay clear of the big cats. These landowners will be your guides on this full-day walking safari in the Ol Kinyei Conservancy. Follow the spoor and get a glimpse of an elephant herd from a distance. Move slowly and watch the Thomson’s gazelle slowly disperse. Admire the guides’ knowledge as they keep you well clear of a herd of bachelor buffalo, yet bring you close to female buffalo. Along the way, you will stop at a Masai boma (homestead) and meet a whole community being welcomed with a spectacle of jumping and throaty singing. Wind back towards the camp, savoring your perspective on a walking safari as you will have seen all the animals before, but they look much different when you are also at ground level. This angle will help you to appreciate all of the intimate details of every animal, and without the sound of the vehicle, you can get much closer than before."

After a week in the Masai Mara, you will not mind this as it provides an advantage as the limited number of predators opens up the opportunity for walking and horseback safari. Spend the morning in the saddle, riding onto the open plains and coming up alongside zebra and wildebeest herds. Experienced riders can canter and even gallop with them, while beginners are able to walk onto the plains and savor the beauty of a pristine landscape. Your next safari camp is the most rustic of the camps you will stay in and is tailored for wildlife enthusiasts. You will still be very comfortable, and you will have a real sense of getting back to nature, especially as the nearby lions are roaring throughout the night. After the morning’s horse ride, you will head out on an afternoon game drive. The biggest highlight of the private conservancies is the opportunity to drive off the trail. Rather than stick to set routes, conservancies allow drivers to bump across virgin grassland, helping you get much closer to the animals, especially sometimes elusive sights like leopards."

Spacious tents lead onto en-suite bathrooms with flush toilets and hot showers and solar electricity provides the lighting. But as you admire the camp, you're fixated on the view. Like each carefully chosen accommodation on this itinerary, your room gazes out onto the landscape you came to explore, ensuring that safari is a 24 hours a day experience and there's always time for quiet moments together watching the wildlife drama unfold. After breakfast head out on a morning game drive, your guide exploring far flung reaches of these plains. The Maasai Mara is unfenced and seemingly boundless; look left and herds of topi, eland, and buffalo graze all the way to the horizon. Look right and a pair of cheetah uses an elevated rock to survey the scene. Gazelle skip past and with all the Big Five to find, few people recognize the 300 unique bird species that soar overhead and flutter across the tree tops. Return to camp for lunch, where snorting hippos continue their soundtrack. Then an afternoon game drive explores further; lions laze and yawn, a leopard emerges as the sun dips away, and an elevated vantage point is perfect for sundowners and kaleidoscopic landscape color changes."

Remember, way before safari, Maasai tribes lived alongside these immense creatures. Animal signs are everywhere and your guide points them out, using them as clues to guide a journey on foot through the bush. Slowly and silently you can approach the mammals, including elephants and the larger antelopes. Respecting animal clues also means avoiding any territory marked out by the predatory prides. Discover more about this unique way of cohabiting with an afternoon in a Maasai village. Wrapped in red blankets and wearing shoes made of used tires, the Maasai ignite the imagination more than any other tribe in Africa. They're herders and their wealth is judged by their number of cattle. Their customs have been living on for thousands of years. Young warriors head out into the bush for seven years as part of their upbringing, and this is just one of many narratives you learn about on this village visit. Return to camp and you're transferred to a secluded forest clearing, where the dinner table is illuminated by flickering candles.

Cruising above the landscape and seeing the plains covered in humongous herds provides new definitions of the Mara's beauty, especially when some of the herds are rumbling across the grassland, great clouds of dust floating behind.

A light aircraft takes you north to Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, catapulting you into a fresh big game landscape that sprawls over the Laikipia plains. Two characters immediately raise their heads; rhinos. But they look different. Lewa offers a rare chance to spot both Black and White rhinos in the wild, their powerful frames belied by an inherent grace and beauty. With horns protruding and armored bellies falling into the brittle grass, these rhinos offer a perfect introduction to what Lewa can offer. Then you come upon some zebra. Again they look different. These are Grevy's zebra, the world's largest single population of them. Cheetah and giraffe bring flashing coats of color that contrast the parched land, and the game drive continues to find what hides in the forest. Elephants, leopards, lions, all the popular favorites are here. Tour the different habitats and there's new sights; sitatunga stand on their spindly legs, tiny dik dik are half hidden by the grass, and then a nighttime game drive reveals the nocturnal predators. It's eerie in the dark and you get much closer, often just a couple of meters from a buffalo herd or tower of giraffe. After landing in Lewa in the morning you'll enjoy a long game drive before resting at the lodge in the afternoon, and then starting a nighttime game drive just before dusk."

A horseback safari is the final piece in your Kenyan wildlife jigsaw, another angle that reveals subtle impressions and nuances of the country.

Keep walking slowly, yet bursting with excitement. A shock of black contrasts the green and you stop. Keep walking and there's more, the rest of the troop hangs out between the canopy of overhanging branches and creepers. Gorilla trekking is carefully controlled, ensuring conservation of the natural environment and respect for the world's few remaining gorillas. You're allowed one hour with the troop and it's important to respect who you've come to see. Making a gorilla angry is not wise, so leave the camera flash and ecstatic hooting for when you return. Instead, stay silent and admire. A large male beats his chest with trademark power, an inquisitive youngster pokes its head through the branches, and a few others sit and munch on their jungle lunch.

Approach the troop and you will see that there are immediate differences. The male is much larger, a real majestic brute, standing proud and towering above your small group. Each female seems adoringly transfixed, but there's another cute youngster finding intrigue in the clicking of camera shutters. Romantic vacations are all about the special and unique experiences that can be found around the world. Few can match going on two gorilla treks and then watching the primates swing past at a secluded forest camp."

The city is modern and green, which is a place where elephants and skyscrapers are juxtaposed along the same horizon. It is a capital that confounds most visitors’ preconceptions. Yes, you can find the bustle and color to be synonymous with urban East Africa, but you can also discover a wonderful sense of space and wildlife conservation. After landing at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, you will be transferred to your upmarket lodge that overlooks Nairobi National Park. From your balcony, you can listen to the various animals, most notably giraffes and elephants. The famous Carnivore restaurant is nearby your accommodation, and you can also order food to your room."

After two hours on the road, volcanos will begin to take over, and their iconic shapes will guide you into Meru National Park for a full afternoon on safari. First impressions are likely to be of how quiet it is here. Meru was one of Africa’s pioneering safari destinations, but it lapsed into disregard during the 1980s and 1990s. The last 20 years have witnessed a strong recovery, especially in terms of cheetah numbers. On your first Kenyan game drive, you can encounter a wide variety of large mammals that patrol their natural habitat. Elephants and buffalos will be very common and are typically spotted in large herds. Wildebeests and zebras may graze the open plains, and these will most likely be your first of many sightings. Down by a river, you can spot hippos as they wade and wallow in the water before encountering lions and hyenas on the woodland fringes. Hopefully, this first game drive will bring some cheetah experiences or sightings of Meru’s leopards. Afterward, you will return to your accommodation and spend the night at a small camp inside the national park, where you will be surrounded by the sights and sounds of a revitalized wilderness."

        "description": "Few places in Africa can compare with Meru. Scarcely visited but thriving with life, this national park will immerse you in the true African wilderness. You can travel slowly through thick jungle in search of strange antelope. Reedbuck and hartebeest will be featured as you cross khaki-toned grasslands, and luscious swamps are a haven for birdlife. It is on the grasslands where you will find cheetahs. The spotted hunter tends to camouflage themselves in the grass before accelerating across open space. Cheetahs have lost over 90% of their range. Meru is one of those special places where their range is expanding because wildlife corridors are reopened and an ancient wilderness is returning to its former brilliance. Today’s game drives should provide you with some personal moments along with an appreciation of how and where the species can thrive. You should note that your game drives in Meru will be private, and this provides you with the flexibility that is necessary when searching for a specific animal. Game drives in shared vehicles tend to be more generic because they must satisfy the curiosity of everyone on the drive, but throughout your Kenyan cheetah safari, you will have private guides and a private vehicle."

Luxuriant jungles and green mountain slopes will soon give way to arid tones and a flatter landscape. Samburu is the beginning of a wilderness that extends all the way to Southern Sudan and Ethiopia, which are landscapes that connect Saharan nature with the dense foliage of the East African plains. You will arrive in time for lunch before spending the rest of your day on a game drive with Samburu guides, who are people that have grown up alongside wildlife. Even more so than Meru, Samburu is a haven for some of Africa’s rarest species. Reticulated giraffes will be memorable for their incredibly bright markings, and Grevy’s zebras can be seen as they graze alongside Burchell’s zebra, which is one of the only places in Africa where the two zebra species overlap. The spectacular new antelope that you will encounter is probably a Beisa oryx with spiraled horns that point skyward and a beautiful face. You should also spot gerenuk, which is a bizarre antelope with a neck like a giraffe and a body like a gazelle. You will continue your drive into the evening in search of some nocturnal behavior before indulging in dinner and downtime at the lodge."

        "description": "It is difficult for wildlife to thrive in an environment as arid as Samburu, but it covers a vast area and creates a home for adapted animals that are able to move. Elephants march large distances in search of water and ungulates move with the rains and are always in search of fresh pastures. Cheetahs hideout along wildlife corridors, hunting the animals that pass. These corridors are currently being threatened by habitat degradation. Habitat fragmentation would be devastating for Samburu’s cheetahs because their prey would no longer move freely through the hunting grounds. You will spend today with wildlife conservationists to gain an excellent understanding of the challenges and opportunities that face cheetahs in Samburu and elsewhere in Africa. By game driving along important wildlife corridors, you will search for cheetahs and witness how the habitat is being preserved. Cheetahs will not be the only highlight as you can go off the trails because you will also witness the tail of lions, hyenas, and leopards. After a long day yesterday, you will probably be back at the lodge around mid-afternoon, so you can have time for the superb views over Samburu plains in addition to stealing some of that time to rest and relax."

Three remarkable species will provide highlights this afternoon. Chimpanzees are not native to Kenya, but a chimpanzee sanctuary has been offering refuge for orphaned chimps from areas of rampant poaching with the long-term aim of returning them to the wild. Peering into their enchanting faces, you will be able to witness how precious these mammals really are. Rhinos are native to this area, and Ol Pejeta is one of the few places where black and white rhinos roam side by side. Black rhinos are browsers, so they mostly inhabit bushland and forest fringes; white rhinos are almost double the size and graze, so they are typically encountered on a more open savannah. Luckily for you, both species move in sight of each other here, and you will even be provided with the opportunity to walk in the rhino sanctuary. This is possible in the middle of the day when the rhinos are at their least active. By late afternoon, you can see more diverse rhino behavior, including mothers as they nurse their babies."

Rhinos are always a highlight here because they are so rare elsewhere. Elephants and buffalos are the norm throughout every Kenyan safari, and lions are usually the easiest of the big cats to spot because they bask and bathe out in the open. Cheetahs and leopards are solitary and spend most of their day hiding away, so they are always more difficult to find. Still, your expert guides have spent years studying these hiding places and can usually get you very close, especially because Ol Pejeta allows off-road driving."

It is home to Africa’s densest cheetah population, and the entire Serengeti-Masai Mara ecosystem contains more cheetahs than anywhere else on the continent. Put simply: for the best cheetah safari, you need to visit the Mara. You will fly here from Ol Pejeta, passing a couple of volcanos before touching down on an iconic landscape. Grass will extend in every direction and will be punctuated by kopjes, which are clusters of rocks from which lions survey their realm. You will be staying in the Mara Triangle, which is as immersive as it gets on this world-famous landscape. After lunch, you will spend the rest of your day on a private game drive, crossing large swathes of the Mara in search of cheetahs and other legendary animals. Often, you will spot a cheetah as it relaxes in the grass with its exceptional camouflage only being betrayed by the flick of its tail. You can also encounter them when they are perched on rocks or moving stealthily through the high grass. Hyenas and lions will be common throughout today’s game drive, and when in the Masai Mara, you can never go far without seeing zebra and wildebeest."

        "description": "The great wildebeest migration is a year-round phenomenon that is dictated by the rains. It is important to remember that the Masai Mara is a superb safari destination even outside of the migration months. In fact, the migration months of July to September see a huge surge in visitors and vehicles, so it can be more enjoyable to safari here in non-migration months. Not all zebra and wildebeest migrate, and these animals are always abundant in the Masai Mara. Hyenas and vultures can keep up with the herds, and the other predators do not have the stamina to migrate but gouge themselves on a seasonal bounty that passes through their range. A hot air balloon ride is an excellent opportunity to witness how the migration works, even if the largest herds are hundreds of miles away. You will witness a patchwork of colors, indicating fresh, grazing pastures and areas that have been mowed by rampant ungulates. From the sky, you will be able to see how elephants and other giants move in addition to placing your guess to where the herds will move next. After your balloon flight, you will touch down to a champagne breakfast and spend a second day exploring the Masai Mara on the trail of cheetahs and so many other animals."

These are places where you can really explore diverse cheetah behavior. Males are known to form coalitions in order to hunt bigger prey and ward off singleton rivals. Mothers nurse their cubs, and you can often see them teaching their offspring how to hunt. Fathers have also been observed getting involved with rearing cubs, which is an extremely rare behavior that you can look out for today. It will be another full day of exploring before another leisurely evening at your safari camp, listening to the wild sounds from around the reserve."

Their continued survival is partially due to the Giraffe Centre, which is a conservation program that is helping to return these animals to their indigenous lands. Elephants have also faced tough times in Kenya, and a nearby elephant center is helping to return orphaned pachyderms to the wild. You will spend the day visiting these two conservation programs, which is where international conservationists will guide you through their challenges and successes.

Stretching toward Ethiopia and Sudan, the Samburu is an arid savannah that can appear inhospitable at first glance. Dusty colors dominate the landscape, and you can sense a brittleness to the land as if it is on the cusp of devastating drought. Anything that can live here must find a special way to adapt, and that is true of both the animals and people. Samburu guides will meet you at the airstrip and lead your three safari days in Samburu, which is their homeland. It will only take a few moments to realize that this arid land can provide a home for many thousands of mammals. Subtle clues can lead you to witness kudu, which is an elegant antelope with unique horns. Out on the plains, you can see gerenuk as well, which is an antelope that stands upright on its hind legs and uses an elongated neck to reach leaves. You can also see leopards and hyenas along with the telltale tracks that are created by elephants. Most of all, on your first day of safari, you will witness how the Samburu people live in harmony with this majestic, wilderness area."

Your accommodation will be elevated above the plains, so that you can listen and watch where the wildlife moves just like your Samburu hosts have always done. They share their land with the animals and have helped protect it through both colonial hunting and modern poaching. Their knowledge is spellbinding, and just to spend a day in the bush with Samburu warriors is one of Africa’s greatest safari highlights. With a single glance, they can analyze an indentation in a tree and tell you what animal passed through and when. In a moment of silence, they can pick up the distant call of storks and follow the storyline to find the reason for such rowdy stork behavior. Leopards are common here, and they stalk through the grass and blend into the background. Your Samburu guides will seek them out because these are the most precious of cats on a vast and seemingly unending landscape. Lions are rarely spotted here, but you can also track cheetahs and will certainly enjoy the antics of resident hyenas. Over these two days, you will venture out on morning and afternoon game drives. These drives can be incredibly varied. Typically, unpredictability is integral to every safari because your guides will respond to what they smell and see in the national reserve. Drives can also be designed around your personal interests, including following a specific animal that you are particularly interested in to really understand their behavior. For example, one game drive could follow herds of Grevy’s and Burchell’s zebras because the Samburu is one of only a few places where both species graze side by side. You can also spend an afternoon tracing enchanting reticulated giraffes. Maybe the guides will know of a leopard with cubs, so one drive may focus on moving close to this special family unit. You may follow one story over the three days, including an elephant carcass that offers food for many carnivores. It will also be possible to go on walking safaris with the Samburu. Again, these are flexible, so they can be long or short, depending on how you feel."

The Masai Mara is a very fertile landscape that can support a denser animal population. Here, you do not need to look for life, but you do need to know where lions and leopards choose to roam. After a safari flight, you will spend two nights in Olare Motorogi, which is a private Mara conservancy that is operated by the Masai community. The experience is more exclusive than in the Masai Mara National Reserve, plus you will be provided with a unique insight into how the tribe has coexisted with one of Africa’s largest big cat populations. On today’s first game drive, you are likely to have some wonderful moments with lion prides along with a gamut of other predators that make the Masai Mara such a famous safari destination.

        "description": "Zanzibar is serene. Palms send their iconic shadows across the sand each morning, the indigenous forest provides a green backdrop to a white beach, and at low tide, you can wade through almost a mile of knee-deep tropical water. Even at high tide, these waters are sheltered and safe for swimming. You will experience space here, and Zanzibar is a relatively undeveloped island, especially compared to others in the Indian Ocean. Dongwe is on the island’s undeveloped Eastern Coast, which is where small resorts are spread along a beach that can never seem to end. After being met at Zanzibar’s international airport, you will be transferred to the resort for the first of four nights."

In Dongwe, you will be staying in a two-bedroom villa that is perched on the beach with a wraparound balcony that overlooks the pool and ocean. Nothing needs to be planned before your arrival, so you can take time to rest and relax. Then, you can add in activities as you wish such as sailing on a traditional wooden dhow. The resort operates a small kids’ club, which means you will have an hour or two free of your kids to enjoy the spa or simply to relax and read a book. You should note that the sun is strong here, so sunscreen with a minimum SPF of 30 is recommended for all."

These next four days will be a real adventure, and it is excellent to begin your safari feeling fully rested. As mountains give way to the forest, you will enter Lake Manyara National Park, and rowdy storks may shout from treetops as you twist into a mysterious land. In the forest, you cannot see far, but you can turn a corner and be just a few meters from a giraffe or elephant. You can drive around another corner, and a lion may lounge peacefully on a tree, which is a scene that is typically only witnessed in a small handful of African safari destinations. Within the forest, you cannot escape baboons. They will yelp boisterously, bang on trees, and generally create a racket in displays of dominance. There are more baboons here than anywhere else in the world, and the troops are enormous and conduct running battles for territory. Hippos are another enchanting highlight, especially towards the end of today, but you will be safe and in a vehicle for these encounters. They will begin emerging from the lake, joining grazing buffalo and wildebeest, and by the time you have existed Lake Manyara and entered Tarangire, you should have encountered many of the animals from your children’s checklist."

Teenage males may lock trunks and tusks in playful shows of aggression while a baby runs about jubilantly, frightening a gazelle herd from their grazing place. Tarangire provides some of Africa’s ultimate elephant encounters, and you will experience their different behaviors throughout the day. Beyond these pachyderms, Tarangire safaris are always about surprises. An incredible variety of animals live in this park, but many are reclusive. So, you will learn how to look for clues and absorb the unpredictability of an authentic African safari."

Local families have always lived with giant animals as neighbors, and camps and guides use the same tactics that have been employed by indigenous tribes for many generations. One of these tribes is the Masai, and you will spend this afternoon with their local community. After a traditional welcome of jumping and singing, you can spend time with a family, learning about life on the East African plains. This can be a very eye-opening experience for children because it has the ability to transcend language barriers. You lodge for tonight will be inside Ngorongoro Conservation Area, which will allow for an early start tomorrow."

You will descend onto the floor of a volcanic caldera and have three hours of the most astonishing wildlife scenes. Black rhinos may bashfully march around, lions can be seen eating a carcass or prowling for a meal, and wildebeest will be galloping in displays of virility. You will even encounter some of the world’s largest elephant bulls. By nine in the morning, the wildlife action typically calms down. Many animals escape to the crater’s fringes, where there is forest and shade. The grazers remain, but their pace will have slowed. It is at around nine in the morning when the crater floor becomes crowded with safari vehicles. It gets noisy and somewhat uncomfortable, especially when many vehicles crowd around a single lion pride. The reason for this vehicle concentration is the location. Cheaper safaris use accommodation that is outside Ngorongoro Conservation Area, so they must pass through two park gates that have long morning waits before reaching the only road onto the crater floor. You will be staying close to the rim, which means that you can enter the crater at first light and enjoy three magnificent hours of Ngorongoro Crater at its best. Afterward, the afternoon will be at your leisure."

Due to border formalities, you will need to take two planes to reach the Masai Mara, but the process is very smooth because your second plane waits for the first. You will land in the Mara and will transfer directly to a family camp in Mara Naboisho, which will be a private conservancy that borders the Masai Mara National Reserve. You can gaze out from the camp, and the grasslands will extend to be seemingly endless. This is the landscape that inspired the Pride Lands in the Lion King , which is where lions perched on rocks and surveyed the endless plains. It is also where dozens of species march by, seemingly in harmony. Mara Naboisho is private, and there is no specific time for avoiding vehicles and other visitors. Instead, entry is restricted to those who are staying at a Naboisho camp, and there is a strict two vehicles per sighting rule. A private conservancy like this will give your family more of an authentic safari experience, especially during the peak season months of July and August. It can really feel that it is just the guides, the animals, and your family."

        "title": "Mara Naboisho Conservancy – Specialist Family Safari in the Masai Mara",
        "description": "The Masai Mara is famous for the wildebeest migration, which is when up to 2 million mammals arrive on the grasslands to graze after the rains. This seasonal bounty supports a year-round abundance of big cats, but none of the big cats are part of the migration. They must defend and extend their home territory and then fatten up when the wildebeest wander past them. These cats do not have the stamina to march long distances anyway, and no dominant lion will allow another male to hunt in his territory. Some spotted hyenas may follow the migration as these animals have an unwritten code of conduct and will allow rivals to pass through their lands but not stop. If you are in Mara Naboisho from July to September, you will witness large, grazing herds of wildebeest and zebra. During all the other months, you can encounter the same magnitude of big cats. Often, these big cat encounters are more dramatic outside the wildebeest migration because tension rises when there is less food. Over these two days, you will track leopards and cheetahs through the conservancy. Lions, you will already know well from Tanzania, and these dominant cats will continue to be a highlight here. Off-trail driving is permitted, so you can really get close to the cats, including those that use Naboisho as a nursery for their cubs. While big cats are a natural highlight of the game drives, the Masai Mara is also home to an excellent variety of life, very much like the Pride Lands. In one vista, you can see giraffe, elephants, zebra, Grant’s gazelle, Thomson’s gazelle, hippo, buffalo, and various others. When not on a family game drive, your children will be entertained at the camp’s specialized kids’ club. Local guides lead tailored activities that are focused on wildlife conservation, bush survival, and animal tracking. All these are essential to life as a safari ranger, and your kids can learn about the day-to-day life of working on the conservation. The kids’ club operates in conjunction with your family game drives, and each day’s itinerary can be adjusted to your timings and mood."

Looking out the window, the peak of Africa’s fifth highest mountain, Mount Meru, will poke through the clouds, signaling the final leg of your journey. Upon clearing customs and collecting your bags in Kilimanjaro International Airport, a representative will meet you in the arrivals hall. From here, we will drive you straight to your lodge tucked away at the foot of Mount Meru amidst a sea of coffee trees. This lodge is a converted colonial property, which pays homage to the homestead’s roots through its décor. Friendly and warm, the lodge has created an ambiance perfect for relaxation after days of long travel. You may choose to spend the afternoon wandering through the gardens, lazing beside the swimming pool or reading in front of your suite’s wood-burning fireplace. Energetic guests may have time to partake on a two-hour guided walk around the coffee plantation itself, learning about the growing, harvesting and roasting process.

        "description": "This morning you will wake to the aroma of fresh coffee, picked and roasted on this very plantation. After a couple cups – and perhaps a few beans for the road, you will set off in a private vehicle on route to the Ngorongoro Crater. Tanzania is packed with National Parks, and we will first detour slightly to travel through Lake Manyara National Park for your first African safari! Manyara National Park is built around a massive alkaline lake that sustains an impressive flamingo population on its shores. During the dry season, this lake is one of the few remaining water sources in the region, sustaining much of the resident wildlife. As you drive through the park’s mixed mahogany forests and grasslands, you will have the opportunity to see a wide variety of ungulates, baboons and monkeys. Be sure that you look to the trees during this section, as this will be your sole opportunity to see the rare tree-climbing lion! From Manyara, we will continue north towards the village of Karatu. Just outside the village lies your next destination, the Plantation Lodge. Set within a colorful garden of bougainvillea and jacaranda, this unique destination is only minutes away from the Ngorongoro National Park entrance. Arriving in the late afternoon, you will again either have the option to relax by the pool or – if feeling more energetic today – join lodge staff on a tour of a coffee plantation of local farms. You are, after all, in the heart of the Tanzanian coffee region. Both walks offer excellent opportunities for birding as well, with Fischer’s lovebirds and yellow-bellied sunbirds regularly flying by. In the evening, you will enjoy a locally sourced multicourse meal paired with a wine from the lodge’s cellar as you look out over the setting sun. Tonight you will want to retire early to your cottage since you will rise early tomorrow to catch the morning activity in the crater."

This epic crater is actually a volcano that collapsed in on itself two or three million years ago. Today the crater is a lush landscape, teeming with wildlife. As you drive down into the crater, watch for rare leopards and wild dogs that lurk discreetly in the shadows. Emerging out onto the grassy plains and marshes of the floor, the landscape will burst with ungulates, including zebra, gazelle, eland, wildebeest and waterbuck. The park is also home to one of the densest populations of lion worldwide, in part because the crater acts as a natural enclosure. Servals, an African wild cat, are also prevalent along the floor. As you weave along the floor of the crater, keep your eyes open for a perfect spot for a picnic lunch – perhaps on the bird-filled shores of the crater’s alkaline lake. In the afternoon, your van will climb back up the 2,000 foot crater wall where you will begin to traverse the surrounding plateau. Depending on the time of year, you may catch a portion of the Great Wildebeest Migration as it passes from the Serengeti on its annual migration north. As the sun begins to cool, the wildlife will liven once more as they begin their evening routines. You will have a chance to observe this activity before stopping on the crater lip to watch the sunset with a sundowner in hand. At the last possible moment, you will drive back to Plantation Lodge where you will enjoy another fresh dinner under impossibly starry skies."

From here, we will transfer you to your magnificent tented camp – the absolute best location for watching the wildebeest migration. This tented camp is designed to be fully mobile, ensuring that it always has the best possible location for the migration, which changes annually with rainfall patterns. The camp successfully combines luxury with nature, providing guests with a comfortable, yet authentic, bush experience. Each of the six tents is equipped with toilets and hot water safari bucket showers in the en-suite bathrooms, in addition to luxurious beds, high quality linens and plush bathrobes. This is no ordinary tent. Tonight you will join the rest of this intimate camp in the tented dining area for a delicious African-inspired meal.

Guides at your camp live in the bush nearly year round, and are intimately familiar with the resident wildlife. Not only will they show you lions, leopards, rhinos, buffalo and elephant – they will be able to teach you about their habits, patterns and lifespan. This ability will set the safari experience apart from the hundreds of other operators navigating the Serengeti today. After a quick drive, you will stop at a nice vantage point where your guide will lay down a checkered Masai blanket and pull your picnic breakfast from a wicker basket. This, for many, is one of the most special meals of the trip. As the sun rises over the savannah, you will set off from your picnic in search of the migration. Given the camp’s strategic location, it should not be long before you stumble upon thousands of wildebeest, gazelle and zebra as they journey across the rolling plains of the Serengeti. With two million ungulates completing the journey annually, you will spend the day surrounded by the herds – an indescribable feeling. Slowly you will drive further north towards the Kenyan border where you may have the chance to watch brave wildebeest trundle through the Mara River. Laden with crocodile and hippo, this is one of the more dangerous parts of the migration and is a thrill to watch. This afternoon you will return to the warm hospitality of the camp, enjoying a sundowner cocktail, appetizers and dinner with your guide and lodge managers. This camp has a longstanding reputation for creating a feeling of family with each guest, as they welcome you into the bush. Ubuntu does after all mean family, humanity and kindness in Zulu. While tonight you will sleep well – you can only hope to be awoken at least once by the roar of a lion or the grunts of a buffalo. Rangers patrol the camp at night, making these sounds little more than a fabulous reminder that you are deep within the bush."

Returning to the camp for lunch, you might wish to refresh yourself with a traditional outdoor safari bucket shower as you look out over the rolling plains of the Mara. The vista from your shower platform will make this one of the most exquisite bathing experiences you will ever have. This afternoon, you will have the opportunity to choose from a variety of activities should you want to take a break from game drives. The lodge will gladly organize walking safaris with one of the local guides, providing you with a particularly intimate experience in the bush. As you follow tracks and dung across the savannah, your senses will come alive as you learn about the patterns and behaviors that signal animal movement. The guide will also be able to highlight some of the smaller insects and plants that sustain life in the Mara North Conservancy. You may also choose to spend time visiting one of the local Masai communities that co-own the conservancy. The Masai belong to one of the world’s most unique and beautifully decorated tribes, and have thrived as nomadic pastoralists for centuries in the region.

Leaving as the sunrises, acacia trees will shrink in size and you will see sprinklings of elephant, giraffe and wildebeest below. Guests are often amazed by how still and silent the landscape becomes as they drift above it, being guided by the currents in the wind. After an hour of tranquility, you will descend into the Mara for a final touch of luxury over a champagne breakfast cooked right where you land. It is a magical once in a lifetime experience. Returning to the camp, you will enjoy the peak of the afternoon, lounging in the shade of the main lodge and library. As the day cools, you will venture out into the Mara for a final exploration of this phenomenal landscape. At this point, you will have learned much about the cultures and intricacies of the Mara. As a final send off, you may spend this afternoon in search of the impressive Big Five, and interactions among them. The lodge is located right in the center of a leopardess’ territory, and some guests have been lucky enough to witness her with her cubs. Others may stumble upon a pride of lion as they feast on a weak wildebeest, as vultures watch greedily from the sidelines. Having heard the buffalo grunt at night, today you may find huge herds of them, with tiny red-billed oxpecker birds hitching a ride on their backs. The wonders of the region are truly infinite and today will be a final opportunity to soak it all in. The game drive will conclude with sundowners in the bush as you absorb the final rays of sunshine, watching the sky transform theatrically. You will then return to camp for a final intimate dinner."

Here you will likely spend time with the gorillas made famous by American zoologist Dian Fossey, who dedicated much of her life to studying these creatures when their global population was only 300. Following Fossey’s tragic death, considerable research and conservation has been devoted to these beasts, which has included careful habituation to human presence. As you approach today’s family, your guide will signal you to begin making guttural ‘gmmm’ and ‘mmmm’ noises, communicating to the gorillas that you come in peace. It will be unbelievable and humbling, to stand steps away from a seven-foot tall male silverback while his family and children play around you. After a magical hour with the creatures, it will be time to leave them and return to the lodge. You will return from your hike to your private cabin, where a warm fire will roar in your personal fireplace.

Approaching today’s family, pay attention to the dynamics of the six-foot tall females, who weigh between 350 – 500 pounds. If lucky, you will have the opportunity to see them interact with their infants, children and ‘blackbacks’ – the adolescent males. Returning down to the park gates, it is worth walking near the guides who will teach of the various plants and their purposes in this dense forest. As today’s trek winds to a close, you will be one of the extremely lucky few to have visited these spectacular creatures twice in a lifetime. Returning to the lodge, you will then begin the trip back to Kigali by road. It will be jolting to arrive in a city after such a remarkable experience this morning – but the comforts of your hotel will help with the adjustment. The lodge is located on a wide and charming Rwandan boulevard, and features a variety of beautiful local art. You will spend the afternoon relaxing by the pool before joining the lodge for a buffet dinner and then bed."

        "description": "Arriving today at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi, you will connect with your representative in the arrivals terminal. Without wasting a minute, you will load your baggage into the truck and drive towards the famed Maasai Mara National Park. Over this six-hour drive, the landscapes will transform dramatically, as you move through the Great Rift Valley and into the heart of the Maasai Warrior homeland. The town of Narok will be the final city before you enter into the farmland that surrounds the Mara. Shortly after, you will pass through the park gates and drive towards your safari camp located on the banks of the Talek River. The final two and a half hours of the drive is on a rough bush track through the park. Driving this road is often a game drive in and of itself, with zebra, impala and wildebeest dotting the roadside. The expansive camp offers a variety of accommodations, with options to stay in anything from a tented camp overlooking the hippo-filled river, to a private cottage in a quiet forest. Monkeys frequently scamper around the property, with a few bold individuals sneaking into the spacious dining area at mealtime. Arriving late in the afternoon after a long day of travel, you will spend the remainder of the day unwinding at your leisure. We would recommend strolling along the edge of Talek River in hopes of spotting some of the resident crocodile. Return to the dining area for a buffet dinner and drinks, before heading back to your tent or cabin. Tonight you will fall asleep to the grunts of hippos and buffalo grazing on the shores of the river. A lucky few may even hear the cackle of a hyena or the roar of a lion off in the distance, welcoming you into the bush."

        "description": "For those interested in learning about the Maasai culture and heritage, it may be of interest to add in a detour to the Maji Moto Hot Springs onto this trip. Located between the town of Narok and the Mara park gates, this quiet sanctuary revolves around an authentic Maasai settlement, in a forest of aloe vera trees and cactus. With natural hot springs only a few steps away, this is an idyllic location to unwind from your international flight before continuing into the Maasai Mara. Spend the afternoon learning about this semi-nomadic Africa tribe. The Maasai have survived in these plains for centuries, and base their livelihood off instinct, skill and a fierce loyalty to their cattle. Some may wish to spend a few hours exploring the region on foot with a warrior, learning how to throw a spear, mix a deadly poison and identify medicinal plants. Others may be more interested in spending time at the boma (homestead), fetching water with women and children, watching a traditional dance performance and examining some of the intricate beadwork. A highlight of spending time with the Maasai is inevitably watching the remarkable adumu (jump), which is practiced competitively among men as a marker of social positioning. The heights reached through a series of jumps and chants are truly unbelievable. Tonight you will join the camp for an inventive dinner that fuses Maasai cuisine with international standards before retiring to your private tent in this tranquil oasis. If you have chosen this extension, you would then carry on to the Maasai Mara in the morning, arriving early to your safari camp in time for a full day safari. Tomorrow’s safari will inevitably be enhanced through the knowledge gained at Maji Moto."

Driving in a shared vehicle with an experienced guide, you will set out in search of the Mara’s quintessential wildlife, while learning some of the smaller features of this unique eco-system. As the camp is located within the park boundaries, the safari will begin immediately upon leaving the camp perimeter. Wildebeest and zebra often gather around the property in the morning, creating an inevitably exciting start to the day. Over the course of the morning, you will drive south towards the Tanzanian border and the Mara River. You will pause to watch as lions doze in the shade, as elephants snack from acacia trees and as cheetahs yawn sleepily in the morning light. Giraffes are often seen popping their heads out of the forest canopies, while ostrich roam the grassy plains around you. As a vulture circles overhead while a leopard watches a herd of gazelle from a tree, you will feel fully immersed in this remarkable landscape. Reaching the hippo and crocodile-filled Mara River, a lucky few may have the opportunity to watch nervous wildebeest as they are pushed across the river by the herd. Otherwise, you may want to drive along the riverbank at midday, observing the wildlife that comes to the shore for a drink. As the sun heats the land, you will seek shelter in a shaded picnic area for lunch surrounded by monkeys. In the afternoon, you will slowly meander south towards the camp in search of additional wildlife encounters. After returning to the lodge at the end of the day, head towards the tree house for a spectacular view of the sunset with a cocktail in hand. After dinner, gather round the fire with other guests to swap stories of the day’s adventures before sleepily returning to your tent or cabin."

        "description": "Many find that a couple days in the Mara is not quite enough time to soak up the magic and beauty of the region. For those with a little extra time, or a passion for the African bush, we would recommend staying an additional night in the Mara. This day can be spent entirely on game drives, though it may be of interest to explore the park through a few alternate ways. One of the most romantic and luxurious ways to experience these vast and captivating plains is to sail above them in a hot air balloon. There are hot air balloons based right at your camp, and balloons depart nearly every morning. Lifting off in the early morning light, the balloon drifts with the wind across these endless plains, speckled with herds of wildebeest and acacia trees below. As the morning sky transforms around you, it will feel as though you have been transported back to the bygone world of early safaris. The elegance of the experience is rounded off with a champagne breakfast in the bush before you return to the camp. If you did not spend a night at Maji Moto with the Maasai, a village tour would be a pleasant way to spend a portion of the afternoon. There are a number of active Maasai communities living within the park, and your camp will happily organize a tour to one of them. During these tours, you have the opportunity to observe the homestead, purchase jewelry and watch a traditional dance performance – complete with traditional jumping."

This stunning journey will carry you away from the plains and high into the Rift Valley, where you will have sweeping views of the Kenyan countryside. As the vehicle begins to descend into a valley, you will be nearing the park gates of Lake Nakuru National Park. Immediately upon entering, you will notice not a blue lake, but instead a massive sea of pink. Lake Nakuru is an alkaline lake that sustains a spectacular flamingo population. The shoreline is nearly always coated in pink, while over 300 species of birds fly overhead and through the surrounding woodlands. Before exploring this park further, you will drive into the surrounding hills where you will find your lodge. This tented camp offers impressive views of the entire park from its hilltop location. We recommend spending the peak of the afternoon on the lodge property, refreshing yourself with a dip in the pool or indulging with a professional massage. In the late afternoon, you will set off to explore the shores of Lake Nakuru more thoroughly. It is possible to walk towards the shoreline of this shallow lake on foot, which makes for striking photo opportunities amidst the thousands of flamingos. Moving around the lake in the vehicle, you will inevitably see herds of buffalo and numerous black and white rhinoceros, which thrive in this particular park. Climbing higher into the wooded hillside, keep an eye out for playful troupes of baboons, along with warthog and gazelle before you emerge on a rocky outcropping overlooking the park. These outcroppings are the perfect place for a final bush sundowner as the sky lights up over the lake below. Return to Flamingo Lodge for a fresh and local dinner in the dining area before retiring to your four-poster bed in your canvas safari tent. Try to squeeze in a few final moments admiring the starry night sky of the southern hemisphere, before drifting to sleep as a breeze blows through your tent."

Elephants and giraffe will poke their heads through the acacia trees, while a rich variety of birdlife circles in the skies above. Towards the southernmost part of the park, you will stop for a picnic lunch in a small forested area.

This afternoon you may choose to set out on another game drive, and perhaps visit the neighboring Maasai community. The Maasai warriors are fundamental to this region, with their culture and décor providing much of the inspiration for the lodge’s development. It is encouraged to spend an afternoon amongst them, learning about their history and heritage.

With less than 800 gorillas living today, approximately half live within Bwindi National Park. Sightings are of course not guaranteed, however most guests are able to visit these majestic creatures, which typically congregate in groups of 10. As you weave and wander through the forest, your guides will brief you on appropriate protocol for approaching the gorillas. With females growing up to 6 feet tall, and weighing between 350 and 500 pounds, these truly are spectacular ‘gentle giants’. Males, referred to as Silverbacks, tower well above their female partners, standing roughly 7 feet tall when full grown. Over the course of the 40 – 50 year life span of a mountain gorilla, trackers and conservationists work with particular families in a delicate habituation process, exposing them to human presence ensuring maximum possible security for tourists. Guests say there are few experiences more breathtaking or surreal than spending an hour observing these gorillas. Their human-like tendencies, their epic size, and their thoughtful facial expressions allows for connectivity rare with any other species. However – much more detail and we would detract from the surprise and awe! This afternoon might be a nice time to relax with a massage. Tonight will be your final dinner in Africa – somehow your eight days will have absolutely flown by.

Mara Naboisho covers 210 square kilometers of unfenced, wildlife-filled grasslands, yet the only people are those that are staying at one of the exclusive tents. It will feel as if you have the magic of the African bush all to yourself and for safari solitude there are few better places on the continent, especially as located one of Africa’s most revered safari destinations. Spend the afternoon relaxing at your camp, and then head out for a short game drive to admire the wildlife at close quarters before returning to enjoy the sights and sounds after dusk."

        "description": "The safari program is flexible. You may opt to spend the morning in your bed to listen to the sounds of nature and absorbing the serenity of the wild, or you may choose to leave at dawn on a morning game drive for the best time to spot lions and leopards on the prowl. In the afternoon, you might wish to go on a game drive that brings intimate moments with hippos, elephants, buffalos, and the cats, or you may want to set off on foot with a Masai warrior to wander across the grasslands on the trail of impala, zebra, and wildebeest. There are always options for adventure and options for relaxing, and whatever you choose, there is going to be a rich procession of wildlife. Mara Naboisho is adjacent to the Masai Mara National Reserve and has become a firm favorite of leopards and cheetahs. With only a few safari vehicles, these grasslands provide a quiet space for the spotted hunters to raise their cubs. Guides know their hiding places, and you will watch adorable young cubs taking their first steps. Herds of antelope always dot these plains, and you will see a huge variety of mammal species both from the camp and during safari activities. The concentration of lion pride is almost unrivaled, and your days spent here will provide a great chance to see them on the move with the lionesses hiding in the grass as they stalk gazelle and zebra. As game drives can take you off the trail, you may also be watching the big males crunch into a carcass after a successful hunt. The real magic of Naboisho is the exclusivity. Visit the Mara, and you are guaranteed to see elephant, giraffe, buffalo, hippo, lion, wildebeest, zebra, Thomson’s gazelle, and more no matter where you are staying. But in Naboisho, your views are not interrupted by other vehicles. It will feel surreal to see so much wildlife before you ever encounter another person. This itinerary is not just a getaway as you are in the heart of one of the world’s most unique natural experiences."

        "description": "Crossing the Mara on a game drive is an extraordinary experience. For three days, you have been admiring all of the little details like the unique stripes of a zebra, two warring buffalo, a baby elephant’s trunk swinging on the ground. Now you will be admiring the scale as you learn that the Mara is not just about the thousands of animals you have seen so far. Rather, it is packed with millions of mammals, and the herds seem to continue long past the horizon. From July to November, the great wildebeest migration is in the Masai Mara, but throughout every month of the year, these grasslands support a baffling abundance of life. On your morning game drive, you will wind into the Masai Mara National Reserve to take in all of the sights on route to your new lodge. Perched on the banks of the Talek River and hidden by trees, this stylish tented camp has a wonderfully relaxed ambiance. Swing in a hammock as hippos frolic in the river below, and then lounge on your day bed and watch different antelope coming for a drink. Enjoy some fine dining beneath the stars as elephants are hooting from the nearby woodland, as although it is within the main Masai Mara National Reserve, the Naibor provides serenity and exclusivity and surrounds you with the herds but also maintains privacy."

        "description": "As wisps of mist rise from the plains you will follow four lionesses as they shimmy in and out of the trees, and then crouch low and disappear from view. On the brittle grasslands they can easily hide, but the small animals work together in the Mara. A baboon troop has spotted the pride, and they will start to shout vigorously from the trees to warn everything of the predators’ presence. As soon as it has started, the hunt is over, and the zebra will skip away, but on another game drive, you will watch transfixed as a leopard roams in and out of the grass only to take down a Thomson’s gazelle that had veered a little too far from the herd. With a Masai Mara safari, you are never watching the animals in isolation as you will see how everything is connected and your interaction is the real treat. You will not just get a snapshot of an elephant; you will watch two herds meet at the river for a tense stand-off as the young males eye up potential mates. Sometimes you will see lions draped across the rocks, lazing away in the sun but on other drives, you will watch a large male roar to frighten others, or find the pride setting off for their breakfast meal. Over these two days, you will enjoy morning and afternoon game drives, leaving plenty of time to savor the exclusivity of the camp. Your lodge is just two kilometers from the Mara River, and the location could not be more central, so you will never need to travel far to see incredible safari sights. Back at your camp there is a surreal tranquility easily found. In some ways, it will feel like a perfect getaway and it will be easy to rock back on the day bed or hammock to enjoy the serene space of the camp until the animals in the Talek River interrupt your slumber. They are always grunting and grazing and fill the atmosphere with the vibrancy of the wild. You are not alone here, and even the odd elephant or giraffe may rumble past the camp. You are experiencing the beauty of a safari getaway as you will have the chance to escape on your own, yet you are still enveloped by the dreamy authenticity of the animal world."

Access to the sand is done without shoes, and the beach comes from a tropical postcard. Coconut palms curl over the sand, coral reefs and exotic marine life is found just off shore, and the water has an alluring tone. For these seven days, this is the perfect setting from which to drift away and there is virtually nothing to interrupt the tranquility. Fundu Lagoon is a small lodge and you will not have to share the white sand with many other guests. When the beach is only accessible by boat, you know you will be far from any crowds. Set sail in traditional wooden dhows, the perfect vessel for enjoying sunset with a glass of champagne in hand. Snorkel off the beach and lose yourself in the vibrant marine world. Fundu Lagoon is close to some of the Indian Ocean’s finest dive sites and each day will offer you an opportunity to explore them. Perhaps one day you will walk around the island beneath the canopy of palms and across the hideouts of monkeys. On another, you will barbecue on the beach, fresh lobster and prawns with your feet in the soft sand. Each villa is generously spaced, so you can easily spend the whole day without encountering another person. Cocktails can be brought to the villa or your private pool, so it is easy to spend a day without encountering any other visitor.

        "description": "Touching down at Kenya’s Jomo Kenyatta International Airport marks the beginning of a spectacular tour of Kenya’s landscapes, cultures, and wildlife. Without wasting a moment, you will jump in a private vehicle, leaving the bustling city of Nairobi behind you. Driving northwest, landscapes will shift dramatically as you enter the Great Rift Valley. Stopping periodically to marvel at the plunging escarpments, volcanic mountains and pristine lakes, the drive on route to Lake Bogoria will be a scenic adventure in and of itself. Your vehicle will wind and climb a small portion of this massive valley that geologically connects Syria with Mozambique through a series of rifts and faults. Midway through the drive, you have the chance to stop for a fantastic photo opportunity as you straddle either side of the equator! Marked by signs, it will be impossible to miss this global landmark. Descending into the volcanic valley after approximately five hours, you will approach the saline Lake Bogoria. Pink flamingos positively coat this shallow alkaline lake, feeding off the alga that survives – remarkably – in this otherwise challenging environment. Gazing out onto this spectacular sight, the lake’s tranquility is interrupted sporadically by exploding geysers as they leap up to five meters in the air along the shore. As flamingo’s circle overhead while others walk the sidelines, you will bear witness to one of Kenya’s lesser-known, but truly magical, places."

        "description": "This morning you will wake to watch the sunrise over the escarpment before embarking on a guided game walk along the steaming shores of Lake Bogoria. Teeming with birdlife, you will have the opportunity here to observe kingfishers, herons and pelicans in addition to seemingly millions of greater and lesser flamingos. While the shores will undoubtedly captivate your attention, be sure to look to the surrounding plains and woodlands as well; lesser kudu, gazelles, zebra and warthogs are often seen meandering around the forest edge. Those with an especially keen eye – and a bit of luck – may even spy a leopard creeping through the trees. If at all tempted to dip into one of the natural hot springs, be sure to check the temperature first since they vary greatly. Cleverly, locals have developed a genius natural thermometer that protects their hands from burns: they hang an egg in a bag off a long stick and boil it in the waters to determine temperatures. Local populations also believe that exposure to the geyser’s vapors acts as a treatment for respiratory and dermatological problems – however, caution should be exercised if attempting this. The steam is very hot. As temperatures rise, it would be wise to seek refuge by a lodge’s naturally heated swimming pool. In this sparse landscape, the combination of the sun’s intensity and the boiling steam leads to fantastic temperatures in the mid afternoon. As temperatures return to reason, head back out to the shoreline for a sunset over the lush landscape with a cocktail in hand."

        "description": "This morning you will continue driving for three hours through the majestic Rift Valley, moving on to Lake Nakuru National Park. This park too revolves around a spectacular alkaline lake, painted pink and white by thousands of flamingos, pelicans and over 300 other species of birds, while enormous herds of buffalo graze on the shore. Woodlands surround the lake and are home to a greater diversity of mammals, in comparison to Bogoria. As you circle the lake and ascend into the forested slopes of the valley hills, you will likely happen upon some of the rehabilitated and ever-graceful black and white rhinoceros, who have successfully repopulated this park. Home to approximately 140 rhinos, most of whom live independently from the rehabilitation sanctuaries, Nakuru is a beacon of hope for African conservationists. Having suffered greatly from poaching in recent years, the rhinos in this park have been so well conserved that this park is actually over capacity for the species, and now populates other parks as well. As you observe a rhino gently scratch her back on an acacia tree against the backdrop of flamingos and hyenas, you will begin to understand the passion that fuels the rhino conservation movement. With some luck, you will also get to see a rhino run at impossibly quick speeds, given their enormous size. Climbing higher into the hills, keep your eyes open for troupes of playful baboons, warthogs and gazelle before you reach the spectacular lookout points over the park. Rocky outcroppings allow for sweeping views of the park as the sun sets – yet another perfect location for a sundowner before dinner and a bit of quiet reflection."

Before traversing these plains, you will detour to Maji Moto, an authentic Maasai settlement on the outskirts of the Mara. The Maasai Warriors are a semi-nomadic indigenous African tribe, world-renowned for their unique dress, intricate jewelry and their ability to jump to remarkable heights. They have roamed the plains of the Mara and the Serengeti for centuries, surviving off instinct and fierce loyalty to their cattle. Tonight you can unwind from a long drive in the natural hot springs beside the village. Surrounded by aloe vera trees and cactus, this quiet sanctuary is again an untouched and unique part of the Kenyan tourist circuit. Enjoy an evening meal that blends traditional Maasai food with European standards, and the hospitality of your Maasai hosts."

Some may wish to set off on foot with a warrior, learning the survival skills that have enabled this population to prosper through adversity. As you learn how to throw a spear, mix a deadly poison and identify medicinal plants, you will gain insight into a truly unique – and threatened – way of life. Others may prefer to explore the boma (homestead), learning about the role of women and children in this patriarchal society. Practicing beadwork, milking cows and retrieving water illustrates a life that sits in contrast to the world you left behind. Your time with this fascinating community will cumulate with a performance of vocals, percussions and dance. The Maasai incorporate song and dance into all major components of their culture, with particular performances associated with courtship, hunting and the coming of age ceremonies. Be sure to pay attention to the Maasai jump – the adumu – as this is competitively practiced amongst the men, and is an indicator of social positioning. The heights they reach in a series of jumps are completely unbelievable. The insight gained from conversations with the Maasai will bring depth into this afternoon’s explorations of the Maasai Mara National Reserve. As you cruise the gentle curves of the savannah in search of elephants, lions and leopards, you will be able to picture young boys as they set out on walkabouts, proving their status as a man and warrior. As you pass rivers and lakes, you will be able to imagine the Maasai as they led their prized cattle to water, ensuring survival for their families at home. Tonight you will camp in a tented camp on the outskirts of the park, where you will fall asleep listening to the sounds and rhythm of the bush, just as the Maasai have done for ages."

Hippos, vervet monkeys and rich bird life line the shore like spectators, watching the Great Wildebeest Migration trundle through these dangerous waters. As the sun strengthens, you will pause in the shade for a picnic amongst monkeys who will undoubtedly attempt to boldly snatch snacks right from your hands. Heading north as the sun lessens, watch as cheetahs and lions emerge from their shaded spots in pursuit of an evening meal for them and their cubs. Vultures will circle overhead, eagerly awaiting their opportunity to feast on the carcass of a kill. As you drive through tall grass, be sure to look low in hopes of spotting an impressive secretary bird, or perhaps even an ostrich! Of course, do not forget to look to the sky as it explodes with colors of the sunset while you return to camp for an evening of food and wine around the campfire."

Step, step, step, the graceful rhino will wanders over to the vehicle but then keep going, a full ton of power and charm leaving behind footprints and a wild scent. Rhinos are critically endangered, and the Northern white subspecies is the most precarious of all. Only three remain in the wild, and they are all found in Ol Pejeta Conservancy. Finding them is the highlight of any game drive anywhere on the continent, never mind a first African safari. This morning you will fly from Nairobi to Ol Pejeta, situated on the northern slopes of Mount Kenya. Their rhino conservation efforts have been groundbreaking, and the three Northern whites are joined by dozens of other wild rhinos. The rhino is one of the world's most elusive creatures, and you will be seeing many of them on the day's safari. Elephants and buffalo continue the safari experience, joined by lion pride and possibly a leopard. It's a compact and easy game drive, a great chance to discover the wildlife that makes Kenya such a revered destination. Follow your game drive with a short walking safari, often one that approaches wild rhinos on foot based on the analysis of the rhinos' behavior by your guide. Spend the night in a traditional bush camp where you can savor all of the sights and sounds of the savanna."

        "title": "Mount Kenya – Climbing to the Snow-Capped Summit",
        "description": "Mount Kilimanjaro is not the only 5,000-meter-plus snow-touched summit in Africa. The continent's second highest peak is an equally majestic volcanic cone rising above the plains and taking you on a journey through the habitats. First the woodlands, then the scorched plateau, and then onwards to a lunar alpine landscape as you move across the snow to the peak. You will pass buffalo, baboons and monkeys on route and enjoy stupendous views throughout as you savor the feeling of summiting the roof of Kenya. There is a crucial difference between Mount Kenya and Mount Kilimanjaro, and it’s one that really affects the experience. Both peaks are World Heritage sites, yet everyone opts to climb Kilimanjaro. Just a tiny fraction of the number climb Mount Kenya, meaning the trails have retained a blissful authenticity and tranquility. Weathered remnants cover this ancient volcano with a multitude of spires, ridges, and cliffs that rise above the African savanna. Every hiking hour is diverse, from crossing the moorland, and then yellowwood forests of wild baboons, and gazing down sheer cliffs towards isolated lakes. Accommodation on route is in basic huts, which provide comfort without thrills. A team of guides will take care of all the details, leading your journey along the trail as well as cooking filling meals. You will just carry a daypack filled with water, a few snacks, your camera, and an extra couple of layers in case the weather turns – porters will bring the rest. Before the climb, the guides will discuss a couple of potential options. The most common route is to take the Naro Moru route from the west, a steep yet rewarding journey focused on Point Lenana, the third highest of the mountain's peaks (16,354 feet). No climbing is required, although there is a scramble up the scree after you pass the snow line. A slightly longer option is to take the Chogoria trail from the east, a journey of spectacular alpine scenery that is longer in distance but a little easier on the legs and altitude changes. Both routes provide stunning views across Africa, and you will be able to see Mount Kilimanjaro on a clear day. The two highest peaks, Batian and Nelion, are reached on a bolted rock climbing ascent and bolted abseiling descent. While not suitable for novice rock climbers, they are okay for anyone with some rock climbing experience. On the first day, you will rise through the woodland and savanna, surrounding yourself with the wild animals that live on the lower slopes. Buffalo rumble past, baboon hoots echo through the trees, and you might glimpse a giraffe in the distance. Then the ascent, a steep and sometimes challenging journey up the face of the mountain for a tough second day that will leave you breathless in more ways than one. From here, the views are insatiable. An early-morning hike and scramble takes you across the snow to Point Lenana, a beautiful ridge that gazes hundreds of miles across Kenya and you will immediately feel that you are on the roof of the world. Breathe in the fresh alpine air, savor the achievement and take in the enormity of it all. Some will continue the journey to Batian and Nelion, but standing on Point Lenana is not an anticlimax. The ridge, the snow, the sweeping views, the shortened oxygen – it's one of Africa's lesser-known but most rewarding travel memories. The next day brings the descent, although you will start coming down earlier, regardless of the route. Just beyond the park gate, a luxury lodge will provide the place to rest your legs from this epic walk up Africa's second highest peak."

        "description": "From the great mountain to the great plains, your small plane will take you between the distinctive realms. Touch down, and it will be hard to look anywhere without sensing wild animals with elephant markings beside the airstrip, the loud grunt of a hippo and thousands of zebra and wildebeest covering the grass plains. You are in the Masai Mara and an ecosystem that hosts the world's greatest abundance of wild mammals. Regardless of the time of year, a safari in the Mara is packed with an astonishing quantity of animals. Zebra and wildebeest are joined by Thomson's gazelle, so many of them in one glance that you cannot even begin to count. After your challenging hike, these two days are all about resting your legs. Admire the view from your verandah as you watch a giraffe tower and buffalo herd amble past. Explore further on afternoon and morning game drives to follow the footprints to find big cats on the move. With so much prey around, the Masai Mara supports an astonishing predator population. Game drives start to reveal the revered scenes as you will pass a lion pride lounging beneath a tree as the sun crosses the sky. A little later, you will see lionesses on the prowl, hiding in the high grass as zebra graze nearby. As the afternoon draws on a hunt will begin to play out with the lions upsetting the herd and trying to isolate a young calf. Among the trees there are more predatory scenes ready to unfold. Perhaps a leopard carrying a carcass up a tree, hyenas battling over bloodied scraps, or jackals emerging from their hiding place. It's wonderfully authentic, and you are virtually alone as the Mara Naboisho Conservancy is only accessible to those staying there. You are driven off road towards a lion kill, listening to the throaty grunts of the alpha male as he chases off his male rivals. Admire a cheetah perched on a rock, and then follow her for an hour as she descends towards the herds. On a Masai Mara safari, you are never just spotting the animals as you are surrounded by the interactions and can admire the cycle of predator and prey as it has been for centuries."

        "title": "Mara Naboisho Conservancy – Exclusive Walking Safari",
        "description": "Through the night you will hear the lions roaring. You can sense the buffalo grazing and can smell the elephant herds as they pass by the camp. Predatory cats and giant mammals are seemingly everywhere, so it is safe to go on a walking safari? The local Masai communities have always coexisted with this wildlife, and they have raised herds of cattle and goats on plains that are filled with lions and leopards. The relationship between tribe and wildlife is a harmonious one, built upon an understanding of the landscape and how to survive within it. It is this ancient knowledge that will keep you safe as Masai warrior guides lead you on exclusive journeys across the Mara. There are only a couple of places in the Masai Mara where walking safari is possible, and Mara Naboisho is a community-led Conservancy where the warrior guides grew up on these plains. Start walking, and you will slowly begin to understand how the landscape is continually talking to you. Prints are obvious signs of animals, but with warrior guides, you will start to notice the intimate details, like indentations in the grass, fruit plucked from trees or guessing an elephant's age by inspecting the dung. Traverse the plains and approach a zebra herd, waiting for their cue to get closer, and sometimes you will walk to within a few meters. Wildebeest and Thompson's gazelle are everywhere, and you will begin to anticipate their behavior, using it as a basis for ascertaining whether larger mammals are near. Occasionally, you will encounter an elephant, and then a giraffe, and then a herd of hartebeest. The warrior guides will see a buffalo herd, and they will immediately know to stay clear of their testosterone, but later on, they will lead you closer to a female buffalo herd. Those first few steps are thrilling as your mind races with nerves and exhilaration. As you learn to decode the landscape's language, the walking safari becomes a relaxing and calm experience as you being top feel at home on the plains, walking where few Westerners have ever walked. Follow your guide to an elephant herd, stand among a tower of giraffe, walk on past the 100-strong baboon troop, and continue to feel the raw connection with nature. Throughout these two days, the program is flexible with options for full-day walks or shorter morning and afternoon walks. All of your journeys are done within the Mara Naboisho boundaries as walking safaris are not permitted in the Masai Mara National Reserve."

There is so much more than the Big Five here, especially when you look past all the elephants and buffaloes. That can be hard when you land, but after a short transfer to Nairobi Wilson Airport, you will fly directly to the Lewa airstrip, where these large animals are commonly spotted along the runway. Driving to your lodge will provide you with your first safari impressions because rhinos and giraffes are also among the animals that are very conspicuous in Lewa. Then, there will be the lions, and you may witness them as they menacingly prowl across the savannah or laze an afternoon away in the grass. After checking into your lodge, you will meet your guide and plan out a three-day program. Cheetahs will be your obvious focus, but this conservancy is home to so much more than cheetahs. Today’s game drive will probably be fairly generic, so you can gain an understanding of the many different animals that live here. The safari viewing is made better by venturing off-trail, and in private conservancies, you are allowed to veer off the trails and track animals more closely. This is essential for viewing predators, especially solitary and shy animals like cheetahs and leopards. Today’s game drive will showcase how off-trail driving is so important to your wildlife experience."

        "title": "Lewa Wildlife Conservancy – On the Cheetah Trail",
        "description": "Heading onto the cheetah trail, you will spend today with one of Africa’s rarest and most adapted animals. Lewa’s cheetahs are usually easy to find thanks to the expert knowledge of the local guides. The conservancy is relatively small, and the guides have worked here for many years, so they know specific hideouts where the cats like to hangout and can identify individual cheetahs through their markings. Such knowledge is harder to maintain in large wilderness areas, where there is too much happening. Cheetahs are native to this area, and their population has grown over the last 20 years due to rigorous conservation efforts in Lewa and the rest of the Laikipia Plateau. Unfortunately, this is not the case elsewhere. The world’s fastest animal has lost 91% of its range. Habitat fragmentation and habitat degradation continue to weigh heavily on the cheetah. Cheetahs need space to run, and they open landscapes, where they can creep close to their prey before launching an attack. Cheetahs can also accelerate up to 65 mph in about three seconds and can cover eight meters in a single stride. It is an astonishing sight to witness the cheetah’s four paws off the ground as it creates dust spirals in place of where it has just been. Special adaptions allow cheetahs to do this, including an oversized heart and veins that can deliver large amounts of blood to their muscles. Inflated nostrils and massive lungs are other adaptions, but these specialisms have made cheetahs vulnerable to change, and this incredible species is now highly endangered. On today’s game drives, you will be searching for cheetahs in their natural habitat, including an eclectic range of behavior that makes your safari so special. The world’s fastest animal does not run often, nor does it run far, so you really do need a full week in order to witness a cheetah reach its top speed. It is far more common to see cheetahs resting than on a hunt. They hide in tall grass, raise their cubs in secretive places, and wander elegantly across sun-scorched plains. Just to see one is a special experience, and during your one-week safari, you will witness far more than in addition to far more than cheetahs that just walk and hide."

Strange antelope species are also common, notably species that are nearly endemic to Northern Kenya, such as long-necked gerenuk and Beisa oryx. With three days in Lewa, you can discover the full range of sights from the cheetahs to tiny dik-dik and others. Another Lewa highlight will be your opportunity to participate in the many different safari activities. Game drives are the standard and best for covering large distances in addition to moving up close with dangerous animals. Other activities will provide alternative perspectives for you. You can walk across open Lewa plains into a landscape where many ungulates huddle. These walking safaris can be short, exploring life around the camp for sometimes only 30 minutes. They can also last for half a day with a chance to join up with moving herds and appreciate so many intimate details. Riding safaris are another option that you can consider, either on horseback or by bicycle. When riding across Lewa, you can often be among the herds, especially antelopes and zebras. Walks and rides can also encounter rhinos if your guide considers it to be safe. In Lewa, you will have a flexible and private safari program, so these activities can be included along with nighttime game drives."

You will touch down and instantly see that this is a landscape where cheetahs can thrive. There is space for the cat to accelerate along with high grass for hiding out and stalking prey. Nowhere in Africa has a denser cheetah population, and today’s game drives will seek out multiple encounters with the world’s fastest animal. During these drives, you will also be provided with a closeup of cheetah prey. Thomson’s gazelle is a favorite quarry, but these cheetahs have evolved to hunt larger animals, such as zebra. Another spotted cat is likely to provide different highlights. Leopards are typically solitary and spend most of their day hiding away. Like cheetahs, they are common here, so you can often see them out on the plains either stalking prey or resting up with their expert camouflage. Every Masai Mara safari should encounter lions. You need to have a really poor guide not to see the most conspicuous of predators. Lions hang out in prides either in family units or by themselves. They unwind in the open and sometimes come to sleep in the shade that is created by the vehicles. On today’s private game drives, you should experience many, if not all, of these cats and hopefully also a hunt."

This is close to your camp in the Mara Triangle, but a long drive away from camps that are far to the east. Therefore, your early start will not be that early. Rising at dawn, you can enjoy sublime views over the Mara, which will appear as bands of red and yellow that mark the horizon as the grasslands emerge from shadows. From the balloon, you can admire the famous Mara patchwork, with areas of high grass that contrast those that have been grazed. Elephant and buffalo herds will be among the other sights that you enjoy from the air before descending to a second breakfast and a game drive around the Mara River. This is the famous river that is crossed by wildebeest as part of their migration. Witnessing this spectacle requires patience and fortune, but the river provides a few spectacular safari scenes throughout the year. Predators lurk around its fringes, while antelope drink tentatively, wary of crocodile threats. Hippos barrel around, and you can often witness young males as they test their strength in tetchy battles. With a game drive along the river, you can also spend an hour or two enjoying a picnic and watching different animals that come to drink."

        "description": "There are strict safari rules in Masai Mara National Reserve. These are essential due to the large number of visitors. Vehicles must stick to the trails because if they do not, the landscape would be ruined by wheels. Private conservancies like Mara Naboisho have strict rules on the number of visitors and vehicles. In these conservancies, you can drive off the trails, which is important when desiring to move really close to cheetahs and other cats. As these conservancies see fewer vehicles, they have become more and more attractive to the cats, especially cheetahs and leopards. These cats do not necessarily come in search of food. Instead, they like the quiet grasslands for raising their cubs. Here, they can hideout with young cubs and are not be bothered by a crowd of vehicles. After driving to Mara Naboisho, you will spend these two days searching for cheetah and leopard families, and your driver will lead you far off the main trails. Often, you can spend an hour just watching a family unit. Then, you can search for other spotted cats. You may even encounter the rarely observed behavior of both a male and female cheetah as they raise their cubs. Watching young cubs as they learn to prowl and hunt can also be a magnificent safari highlight, especially when playful cubs do not share their mother’s sense of urgency. Another rare behavior that can be observed here has been cheetahs that form coalitions. Hopefully, you will also witness this over the next two days. Your guides will have been tracking the same cheetahs for many months, so they have an excellent understanding of where you need to go. Coalitions of two males are not that unusual, but by working together, two cheetahs can take down larger prey and dominate a larger territory that houses many species of prey. Three or four males who that hunt together is virtually unheard of outside of the Masai Mara. To see these coalitions on a hunt can be a very special experience, but you should note that it will require patience, luck, and extremely good timing. Walking safaris will complement your cheetah encounters. In this conservancy, you can go walking with Masai warrior guides, joining the people who have grown up on these animal-dominated lands. Their knowledge and understanding make it safe to walk in elephant country, and their experience means that it is safe to walk amid one of Africa’s largest predator populations. Walks will be thrilling as you cross open grasslands, where ungulates tend to gather. You should also note that you will not be walking with cheetahs, lions, or any other cats. You will also not walk with any hippos either. These activities are only safe because they avoid predatory encounters, which is an essential consideration as you really will be walking across one of the wildest landscapes on the planet."

This first day will provide you with a safari introduction on a game drive that introduces local specialisms. Gerenuk rises on their hind legs and use their elongated necks to feed on branches that other antelopes cannot reach. Their food is succulent, and they take almost all the water they need directly from the vegetation that they consume. Beautiful Beisa oryx have similar adaptions that the guides will explain. Common Burchell’s zebras and rare Grevy’s zebras can be seen side by side. Spectacular reticulated giraffes are another highlight that cannot be not seen in Kenya’s other parks, while elephants and hippos will provide regular entertainment throughout your safari experience.

They are one of the world’s most adapting animals and are capable of accelerating from 0 – 60 mph in less than three seconds. When sprinting at top speed, they can cover eight meters in a single stride as all their paws jump through the savannah; however, this speed cannot be maintained for very long. Cheetahs must grab their prey within 30 seconds, otherwise, they cannot keep up the chase. At less than 150 Ibs, they are also a relatively small cat. A lion or leopard could kill you in a couple of seconds, but cheetahs do not operate in this manner. Instead of using immense jaw strength or power, cheetahs trip their prey before delivering a killer blow. This hunting strategy has evolved on large open plains, where these cats have both a space to hide and an uninterrupted landscape for the chase. Unfortunately, Samburu suffered significant habitat degradation through the 1970s and 1980s in addition to the poaching and hunting that was brought by colonialists earlier in the century. Over these two days, you will explore efforts to preserve the habitat and nurture a new generation of cheetahs in Samburu. With Samburu warriors, you will walk across dusty plains, learning the signs of healthy and unhealthy land. You will discover crucial conservation efforts around Meibae, which is an area that provides prime habitat for cheetahs. Conditions for hunting are perfect here, and you can observe cheetahs during their day to day activities. Conservation is essential as the area provides a wildlife corridor for zebras and other prey. If wildlife does not use this corridor, the cheetah population has little to eat. Of course, while looking for cheetahs, you will also enjoy stunning experiences with Samburu’s other life, notably herds of elephants that march between water sources. As part of your safari, you can visit local Samburu communities and meet people who are on the conservation frontline. These communities live side by side with the wild animals, and part of the conservation effort is to generate income through safari tourism, thus reducing and hopefully removing the allure of poaching. You will see how communities have stood up to poaching and get to know a resilience for which the Samburu are well-known. Two days will provide you with flexibility, so you can track specific cheetah behavior. Local trackers know where the spotted cats hide, and you can enjoy anything from hunts to mothers with their cubs."

        "description": "After a short flight south, today will provide you with an iconic, Kenyan safari experience. Ol Pejeta is a compact conservancy and is far smaller than Samburu. Still, it is home to a remarkable density of wildlife, including the famous Big Five. There are few better places in Africa for rhino encounters, and you can spot both white and black rhinos on a single game drive. Lions may provide eternal moments on the plains, and leopards can be spotted regularly rather than just occasionally. After today’s enchanting game drive, you can continue to view wildlife directly from your lodge, where you will have an uninterrupted view of a watering hole."

        "description": "After flying to the Masai Mara, you will join a different team of conservationists and begin to see the contrasts between Samburu and Masai warriors. The Mara landscape shares similarities with Samburu, notably open plains and many fantastic places for cheetahs to hide. The difference in the Masai Mara is that cheetahs still thrive. There is no better place in Africa to encounter the world’s fastest mammal. The cats have abundant year-round food, notably the Thomson’s gazelle, which makes up much of their diet. They also enjoy seasonal abundance because zebras and wildebeests march upon the Mara plains between July and September. There are threats to the cheetah population here as well, and you will begin to discover these on today’s game drives. Joining Masai trackers and conservationist guides, you will safari around Mara North Conservancy and Masai Mara National Reserve. Like your first day in Samburu, this will be an opportunity to understand the ecosystem as a whole in addition to gaining close-up encounters with a diverse animal cast. Lions and leopards are also prolific here, and you will have the ongoing encounters with elephants, giraffes, buffalos, hippos, and dozens of other species. There are more wild mammals in this ecosystem than anywhere else in the world, and on today’s game drives, you will experience what that really means."

        "title": "Mara North Conservancy – Cheetah Conservation in the Masai Mara",
        "description": "These two days will be all about exploring the Masai Mara and tracking the behavior of different cheetahs. Game drives in Masai Mara National Reserve will provide you with an idea of the threats that these cats encounter. A high density of vehicles is bad for these mostly shy and reclusive animals. It can put cheetahs off a hunt, especially when many vehicles crowd around both predator and quarry. Noise from engines is not conducive to raising cubs, nor prowling around the savannah. The situation is different in Mara North and other Mara conservancies, where there are strict limits on the number of vehicles and visitors. In these conservancies, you can also go off the main trails, which allows for more unobtrusive proximity to these cats. In particular, these conservancies are providing a quiet space for cheetahs to raise their cubs. Over these two days, you should experience more than one young cheetah family with the chance to compare their behaviors out in the wild. Cheetahs all across the Masai Mara display many unusual behaviors. For example, males are forming coalitions in order to hunt larger prey. Two hunting together is rare, but three or four is almost unheard of, and you can witness this behavior and maybe even three cheetahs that expertly take down a wildebeest calf. By forming coalitions, male cheetahs can dominate the land and grow stronger than their rivals. There are stories and histories here that allude to coalitions not lasting for a long time. With conservationist guides, you can understand these stories, and during these two days, you will also meet with Masai herders and discuss the challenges of managing wildlife and traditional lifestyles on the same lands. Walking with the Masai will be a particular highlight of your adventure, especially when you cross grasslands that are populated by elephants. While cheetah conservation provides a focus to your excursion, a safari in the Masai Mara will always be filled by special wildlife moments. On these profuse lands, you can encounter all sorts of beautiful life from large lion prides to diminutive animals that hide from the world."

You will be greeted at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi and transferred to Nairobi's Wilson Airport for the local flight to Samburu. Cruising in the small plane is part of the safari experience, and it is possible to spot mammal herds on the plains beneath the wingtips. A luxury villa at your first property provides a dramatic view, with your living area gazing out on unspoiled Northern Kenya. One glance and the goosebumps will return.

Today's early morning game drive seeks out the Samburu Special Five , endangered wonders that only appear in this part of Kenya. Marvel at the tightly packed stripes of Grevy zebra, shake your head at the antics of Somali ostrich, then find the striking horns of beisa oryx. Reticulated giraffe poke their heads high above the acacia trees, while gerenuk stands on their hind legs to reach up to the bountiful branches. These wildlife highlights are always complimented by the big favorites as the Samburu also provides a haven for the Big Five with the lion, leopard, buffalo, elephant and rhino lurking somewhere to be found. You will stop for a picnic lunch by the river to lounge on the camping chairs as a pod of hippos splash through the water. During the afternoon, parents can unwind at the lodge's spa while children are entertained at the Warrior Academy to learn everything from bush survival to tribal dances, animal tracking to local handicrafts. It's not the typical kiddies club as Samburu warriors lead the activities and there is often a herd of wild animals grazing close to the lodge. As with all days on this safari, the exact program is flexible and can be adapted dependent on your family's interests and mood. For example, this afternoon could include another game drive, a walking safari, or even a helicopter flight above Samburu."

At first, you might just see animal dung but with one glance the guide will look at the same dung and tell you what animal, what gender, and what age. Prints lead you forward, and soon you learn the basics. Exhilarating and exclusive, these nature walks allow you to live out a Samburu adventure and creeps up on oryx and zebra that inhabit the plains. Local flora is discovered and understood, as is the history of the ancestors as found in rock paintings that fill a series of caves. Stay out for a picnic lunch and the afternoon is at your leisure. Perhaps take an afternoon game drive, go on a further bushwalking adventure or enjoy a tailored bird-watching afternoon, or continue your immersion with the Samburu Special Five. Just before dusk, you will head out in the safari vehicle to drive beneath the moonlight to a remote bush dinner beneath the stars. Often there is a thrilling silhouette that inhabits the horizon as an elephant or giraffe goes on its own nighttime journey. There is always a strange soundtrack of mysterious calls that echoing across the landscape as you dine in the middle of wild Africa. And your fire crackles, the Samburu warriors launch into dancing and reveal the beautiful steps of their ancient traditions."

After lunch, you will explore on foot as the Borana's lack of predators allows you to walk freely through antelope-filled plains. The limited numbers of lions or leopards is not a disadvantage here as less hungry mouths makes it much easier to have adventures outside the safari vehicle. By walking and horse riding slowly, you can approach to just a few meters of various antelope – as long as you stay silent.

Using private conservancies ensures that your safari always remains fresh for everyone in your family. This safari isn't about long days of game drives and bumping around the bush; rather the puzzles of wild Africa are slowly unraveled through the variety of activities. This afternoon you will explore on a mountain bike and rush across the trails as a tower of giraffe watch with interest. Ride past hippos in the water, follow the shouts of baboons and encounter half a dozen different antelopes from two wheels.

From the nearby Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, it is a 90-minute flight to the Masai Mara, one that offers excellent views of Mount Kenya and then the sweeping plains of the Mara. Elephants are spotted from the air and the strange black dots you see below are actually wildebeest and zebra herds. From the airstrip, your game drive will begin as a guide takes you deep into the Masai Mara. Herds are scattered across the grasslands, and there are far too many to count. Sometimes, there are over a thousand zebras huddled together as their black and white stripes are only revealed as you move closer. Other times, there are tens of thousands spread across the panorama with some galloping, others grazing, and each with a face cast in emotion. So many mammals mean excitement for the predators and the Masai Mara is one of the best places in Africa to spot the big cats. Your children will not count the number of lions, but they will count the number of pride. And every pride is different. Stay silent as lionesses stalk a Thompson's gazelle, the hunter hiding in the grass before pouncing in a flurry of dust. Drive off the trail and stop next to a leopard in a tree, her tail swishing beside a young and playful cub. Watch the tension build as hyenas and jackals try to disrupt a lion from its kill, then feel the fear as a maned patriarch lets out a rumbling roar. On a first Masai Mara game drive, the inevitable focus is these big cat encounters, especially as you follow the trail of the Mara River."

Special rules enable you to drive off the trail and get closer to the animals, while local guides have an exceptional knowledge of where particular mammals reside. Today you will drive into the main Masai Mara National Reserve on a full-day adventure. The Masai Mara is too big to see in a month, never mind a day. But as you lose yourself on the plains, it is easy to see why this is one of the world's most exciting wildernesses. Lions rest on rocks to survey their kingdom with a predator's cold stare. Buffalo congregate in their hundreds, huffing and grunting in comical harmony. Wildebeest gallop in the morning light, while elephants move serenely through the clumps of forest. Down at the river, there are hippos, including those that open their jaws for the iconic photo. Sometimes it feels like it never ends as the grasslands abound with wildlife and surprise. After the raw adventures, a private family villa at Saruni Mara offers a quiet space to rest and relax.

As you descend through the Aberdares Mountain Range, you will detour slightly to Thompson’s Waterfall at the base of the range. Here, you will have an opportunity to stretch your legs as you walk 20 minutes to the base of the majestic falls. Returning to the vehicle, you will continue to drive towards Lake Nakuru, a sparkling alkaline lake that sustains over 300 bird species, buffalo, gazelle, leopard and baboon. Driving towards the lake, you will come across an impressive flock of pink flamingos that quite literally coat the lakeshore. Interspersed with white pelicans, this will be a stunning and dramatically different landscape, complimenting the time in the mountains. Driving away from the shores and into the woodlands, you will have the option of staying in a luxurious canvas tent or in a cabin. Both properties offer sweeping views of the surrounding plains and landscapes from your personal porch, the main lodge and the swimming pools. After checking in and enjoying a buffet lunch, you will embark on a late afternoon safari through the park. In addition to flamingos and birdlife, Lake Nakuru is known for its successful rehabilitation of the black and white rhinoceros. The park is home to approximately 140 of the graceful creatures, which is noteworthy given the dramatic decline in numbers across Africa. In fact, the park’s rhino population is actually over capacity and conservations are relocating these creatures in hopes of repopulating other regions. Black and white rhinos are often spotted grazing in the shade of an acacia tree on the floodplains that surround the lake. Driving away from the lake and into the woodlands, you will have the opportunity to observe troupes of playful baboons, warthogs and gazelles as you weave towards one of the numerous lookout points.

After returning to your cabin, take a moment to listen closely for the grunt of a buffalo or the roar of a lion before falling asleep in the wilderness."

        "description": "This morning, after a final breakfast, you will return through the Rift Valley to the city of Nairobi. Depending on the time of your international departure, you may spend some time exploring this bourgeoning metropolis. We would recommend the Karen Blixen Restaurant for lunch, in addition to a tour through the Karen Blixen Museum. The museum is located on the farmhouse that belonged to this woman made famous through the movie Out of Africa. If however, you crave a few final moments in the wild, a visit to Giraffe Manor or the Daphne Sheldrick Elephant Orphanage may be the perfect farewell. All of these locations have various curio shops for a final bit of shopping before you board your international flight home. For those with an evening departure, you may enjoy a final meal at Carnivore – a famous South African restaurant that serves every style of bush meat imaginable in a unique atmosphere. Your driver will ensure that you return to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport with sufficient time to check in for your outbound flight."

Safari is thrilling and adventurous, yet it's equally calm and charming, especially in Amboseli. Whenever you're ready, an expert guide takes you on a private game drive. Hippos wallow in pools and rampage through the shallows. A lion pride is spotted beneath a lone tree, close enough for you to see teeth as it lazily yawns. Herds litter the plains; black and white zebra stripes mingling with the curled horns of buffalo and a colorful assortment of grazing antelopes. Today will run at a very easy pace dependent on your mood and energy level. Safari here isn't about long drives. It's about going slow and stopping everywhere to admire the beauty."

In the morning light the Amboseli plains are at their most active, the predatory cats sizing up the breakfast menu as you sip on mugs of fresh coffee. Now there's thrill and drama on the grasslands. Gazelle graze tentatively, aware of danger but unable to identify the lurking leopard. A tail moves, a neck dips, and the leopard is gone. You scan the grass. Nothing. Now your partner scans the grass with the binoculars and still there is nothing, the leopard's camouflage refusing to be betrayed. A yelp rings out and you instinctively grab each other. The gazelle also didn't see the leopard in the grass. After a long morning game drive you return to the sumptuous lodge for a lazy afternoon. Enjoy a huge buffet lunch in the lapa area, rest in a personalized version of safari paradise, and read a book on your private verandah, occasionally glancing from the pages at a friendly giraffe. While African safari always brings thrills, it's also wonderfully adept at removing stress and allowing both of you to fully decompress. As the day's heat rescinds you take a late afternoon game drive, getting intimate with the eclectic characters that call Amboseli home. It's probably left to the elephants to leave the final goodbye, a mother chaperoning her trunk-swinging baby past your balcony at sunset."

Hills roll beyond the horizon and every turn leaves you further alone with nature. Today you take a long, full day game drive across the Maasai Mara, exploring remote corners with a luxury lunch on board. Wildebeest charge across crocodile infested rivers, cheetahs inspect gazelle from elevated rocks, and you'll be going slow enough to take it all in. Four lionesses wander towards the safari truck, inspecting the wheels and returning your gaze. You instinctively step backwards, hands back in the safari vehicle. Don't worry, you're not on the dinner menu. The lions just wanted to rest in the shade beside the front wheel. Romantic getaways always feature fine dining and tables for two. But how many can include a picnic table perched above a small lake of marauding hippos? Admire their interaction over a glass of wine; males grunt, youngsters push, females wallow in peace, and a huge pod of snouts is raised above the water line. Your expert guide understands discretion, so while an informative narrative will have accompanied much of the game drive, now is a time for just the two of you. Today brings intimacy and touching moments with Kenya's wild mammals. But it's also about marveling at the scale of the Maasai Mara.

The game drives are tailored to your interests and you soak up a final day of Africa's famed wildlife.

You don't even need footwear as it's practically straight out of the gate and onto the sand. From the Maasai Mara you'll take a short hopper flight to Nairobi and a second short flight to Mombasa, less than an hour's drive from Diani. With your driver waiting in arrivals, the transformation from safari to beach should take less than three hours so images of wildebeest are fresh in the memory as you sip on a cocktail served in a fresh coconut.

Occasionally there's another guesthouse or hotel standing above the ocean. But it's mostly indelibly serene. Your piece of Diani is the most tranquil, the beach practically devoid of footprints. Spend the days lounging around, reading books beneath the palms, enjoying fresh lobster dinners on candlelit tables for two, and savoring another personal piece of Kenyan paradise. Many people visit the Seychelles or Maldives for their beach getaway. Diani offers the same clear warm Indian Ocean waters and the same shimmering white sand with the added benefit of being far more personal and individualized. A private driver is available for the duration of your stay. He'll take you to wine bars further up the beach, nature reserves filled with monkeys, or dive centers offering trips into the marine blue. Want the best restaurant in the area? He'll book you a secluded table for two and transport you to the door. Alternatively, the driver can go meet the fishermen and return with fresh catch to grill on the fire. You don't need the driver for a snorkeling adventure as the vivid coral begins from just off shore. Another option is to sail on a traditional dhow and cruise along the exquisite coastline, occasionally stopping in secluded bays for a quick swim and a hearty lunch. Gradually the unhurried atmosphere lures you into hibernation, time becoming irrelevant as you soak up this haven of tranquility. Beautiful sunrises and enduring sunset tones are sometimes the only means of guessing the time of day. Rest. Relax. Grill some fresh crab on the fire. And toast to yourselves with seemingly nobody else around for miles. The activities and setting may be different, but just like your two safari destinations, Diani Beach offers a private haven away from the rest of the world. After five days you'll be wishing that you could stay for five months."

It is the only operational lodge within the park boundaries, meaning that in addition to these sweeping views, you will also enjoy near exclusivity when exploring this unique and quiet landscape.

Life at this property is relaxed and the activities and schedules will depend largely on your whims and preferences.

The caracal, lesser kudu and aardwolf all live within this region, revealing themselves for a lucky few. Within the park, you will also have the opportunity to visit an important rhino sanctuary that works to conserve and reintroduce the threatened species to the wilderness, from which they were totally eradicated in the 1990s. Having returned to the lodge for lunch, you will now have your choice of activities for the afternoon. Home to a multitude of rivers, your lodge organizes fishing expeditions in search of catfish, tilapia and barbell while monitor lizards and kingfishers watch avidly from the shore. You may also be interested in visiting the nearby Tharaka community, with which the lodge supports through community development projects. This property prides itself on providing thoughtful tours to this special community, as well as opportunities for guests to become involved in supporting them. As you return from your afternoon activities, you will likely migrate towards the infinity pool with its unending views over the plains below. There are few better locations on the property to enjoy a sundowner before dinner with fellow guests and lodge staff.

Following animal tracks, investigating insects and learning of the micro-ecosystems offers insight into the minute dynamics and behaviors that sustain this truly spectacular ecosystem. You can also join one of the walks that climb to the top of Mughwango Hill, where you can experience great panoramic views. Alternatively, you may choose to spend the day exploring the shores of the Tana – Kenya’s longest river. Snaking through Meru National Park, the Tana provides water and nourishment for much of the parks’ flora and fauna. With a packed picnic lunch, your guide will take you on a day long adventure along the river as it climbs into the highlands and drops into the plains before it carries on to the Indian Ocean. As the sun sets tonight, you may choose to combine a sundowner cocktail with a nighttime game drive. Witnessing the bush transform under the moonlight is a unique and magical experience. In the evening, you are able to observe the impossibly adorable bush babies as they fly through the trees, graceful owls as they stalk prey and numerous predators that come alive to hunt.

This afternoon will be spent exploring the property and planning your days ahead. You can look forward to a top quality meal in the lodge’s tented dining room, before retiring to your private tent. Be sure to take a minute to admire the spectacularly starry African skies."

        "description": "Today you will begin to traverse the picturesque plains of the Masai Mara under the seemingly endless and ever-changing African skies. The conservancy itself is strategically located, bordering the Masai Mara, the Serengeti and Loliondo, and has some of the richest wildlife populations in Africa. With no fences and limited human interaction, your time in the region will truly send you into the bush. Led by some of Kenya’s most highly rated professional guides, you will begin a series of close encounters with Africa’s richest wildlife. They avoid the throngs of safari trucks, characteristic of some regions of the Mara, and encourage engagement rather than ‘animal box ticking’ during your days in the bush. As elephants gracefully walk the horizon, interspersed with giraffes, zebras and rhinos, you will witness that picturesque African imagery. Predators are also plentiful in the region, with lions, leopards and cheetah frequently stalking the numerous herbivores. If visiting between April and November, it is likely that you will catch parts of the Great Wildebeest Migration, which consistently passes this region of the Mara. During the afternoon, you will likely return to the bush as it livens as the sun sets. In true 1920s fashion, you will be well equipped with a small picnic and cocktails to enjoy as the sun sets over your first full day. Again, you will have the opportunity to watch as the bush transforms, with new life and behavior emerging around you. You will return to the lodge for dinner before retiring to your tent for the night."

        "description": "This morning, after being awoken by fresh coffee delivered to your tent, venture out into the bush to have a picnic breakfast beside the river coursing through the conservancy. From there, you can continue through the bush either by truck or on foot, depending on your preference. Again learning about the intricacies of the park from gold-standard guides, you will have an unparalleled tour through the bush. As the temperatures begin to rise, and the animals doze off in the shade, it is often nice to end the morning swimming at the nearby waterfall or fishing for catfish in the surrounding rivers with lines made of sticks and twine. In the afternoon, guests will have the opportunity to visit one of the local Masai communities with which the lodge works in partnership. The Masai are the original owners of the land, and as such, the safari property has made it a longstanding priority to support the development of these communities through aid, business opportunities and environmental conservation. Wrap up your day with an expertly made gin and tonic as you soak in the final rays of sunlight. Spend your final evening around the fire, or in the main lodge with other guests listening to stories from the bush over another delicious and thoughtful meal."

As your flight departs, you will have one final glimpse of the endless plains of the Masai Mara before returning to the rapidly developing Nairobi skyline. For some, it will be time to return home. However, consider a trip extension and modification to round out the ultimate Kenyan experience. A luxury trip to the shores of the Indian Ocean might be the perfect farewell after your explorations through the wilderness."

        "description": "From Nairobi you'll fly directly to Meru, where your guide will greet you at the airstrip and transfer you to your first camp. Meru's lush wilderness offers a stunning start to your safari. On a clear day, Mount Kenya dominates the skyline, its stark peak towering over undulating green hills. Meru's 13 rivers cut distinct paths through the landscape, the abundance of water supporting great casts of animals. Your is nestled into a beautiful riverine forest, overlooking the Bisandi River. A nonstop sequence of animals drink from the river, their actions eagerly witnessed from the comfort of the camp and its cooling swimming pool. Some sip tentatively, like lesser kudu or impala. Other stay and play, like the elephant herds that don't have to worry about waiting predators. In this beautiful landscape there are only a few other camps and very few other people. Your safari camp blends into the environment, the traditional wood features and en-suite tents not interrupting the animal world that surrounds it. Kerosene lanterns and evening campfires provide additional charm, while flushing toilets and hot showers ensure comfort in the bush. Large iron beds help offer a good night's sleep, but expect the intimate sounds of wild Africa to enter your tent. Breaking the silence could be a lion roar, a hippo wheeze-honk, or an elephant bull's ferocious grunt. Or it could be the wandering soundtrack of Meru's 300 bird species coming to life at sunrise. A variety of experiences will fill your three days in Meru. Morning and evening game drives explore the park, bringing you astonishingly close to the Big Five. Elephant herds smash their way through the forest, leaving great trails of uprooted trees. Abundant water has created numerous swamps, the ideal habitat for large pods of wading hippos. Lion prides come out at dusk, searching the waterholes for a meal. Tall grasses provide the perfect cover for big cats on the hunt, and the exhilaration of spotting a hidden leopard is unforgettable. Meru's overgrown wilderness gives every game drive an extra thrill. At first glance it appears that there is nothing to see. The forest seems quiet. But listen carefully and a telltale rustle suggests something is nearby. Be patient. Two minutes later and a pair of black rhino come into view, slowly crossing the path in front of the safari truck. Every evening you'll also have the opportunity to go on a walking safari with an experienced armed guard. Any of Meru's great animals could be lurking on the trail, and they all seem much larger when viewed at eye level. A visit to a rhino sanctuary and Koyiaki Guiding school is also included, as is the opportunity to experience a local Boran community. Enjoy barbecued lunches and bush breakfasts overlooking the river, and savor three days in pristine African bush."

        "title": "Laikipia Hills - Diverse Safari Experiences",
        "description": "From Meru you'll head west, crossing rural Kenya as you're driven to the Laikipia. While Laikipia isn't as famous as other Kenyan parks, it offers a totally unique safari experience. This vast rural expanse, between the Rift Valley and Mount Kenya, is home to a huge diversity of mammals and birds. And it can be explored on foot, on horseback, or even from the back of a camel. Of course, there are also the daily game drives that go deeper into this animal kingdom. Situated on a 24,000 acre private ranch, your lodge is a throwback to grand colonial homes of yesteryear. It's much more of a private home than a lodge, and all of the seven en-suite cottages have been individually decorated. Private verandahs offer sweeping panoramas of the plateau, while the encompassing serenity is a priceless experience. On an inimitable walking safari you can follow ancient wildlife trails, coming almost within touching distance of wild game. From a safari truck many antelopes seem small, yet at ground level they look different. Close proximity makes a kudu's horns far more impressive, while a hartebeest's shoulders have an almost unnerving power. Local guides use their knowledge to track animals and keep you safe. Wander through the forest before gazing down on the plateau from high rocky outcrops. Then the enveloping silence of walking in the bush is broken, and an impala glances at you before quickly skipping away. Out in Laikipia the big beasts roam. Rhinos and elephant can be spotted at close quarters, while great giraffe necks dot the horizon. Hyenas cover great distances each day, and their spotted fur scampers past the safari truck. On horse or camel back, the safari becomes even more exhilarating. There's an awe-inspiring feeling of being at one with nature as your ride wanders along the plains. You'll have three days to try it all."

        "description": "You will fly to the Maasai Mara from the nearby Loisaba airstrip. Arguably the world's most famous nature reserve, the Maasai Mara offers endless savanna and an astonishing concentration of wildlife. This is a version of Africa that almost seems fictional, as if it's been fabricated by Walt Disney or wildlife documentarians. But it's very real. Lion prides stare at the safari truck, then walk towards it and lie down in its shade. Elephants plod past the camp, great beasts offering a photographic interruption to your evening meal. Huge herds of wildebeest and zebra defy belief, dotting the plains and leaving a swirling trail of dust in their wake. From July to October, two million extra mammals arrive in the Maasai Mara, the Great Migration crossing the Mara River and entering Kenya. Wildebeest and zebra are accompanied by many hungry carnivores, but remember, these visitors are just in addition to the Maasai Mara's almost unbelievably abundant wildlife. Your camp is located just a few hundreds meters north of the Maasai Mara boundary, on a private reserve. Traditional en-suite safari tents feature handmade cedar beds, 24 hour solar lighting, hot bucket showers, and flushing toilets. Perforating the camp are the sounds of the Maasai Mara, from galloping wildebeest to roaring lions and sporadic bird song. The unobstructed views of the savannah linger long in the memory, and from the safety of the camp you can watch all kinds of wild game wander along the horizon. Having its own private reserve means that the camp can also offer activities that are unavailable in the Maasai Mara. Go on a walking safari, or take a night drive and discover nocturnal creatures that have left their hiding places. Game drives explore the Maasai Mara, offering some of the most memorable wildlife viewing on the planet. On the flat endless plains, animals are easy to spot. But which way do you look? At the lion pride lounging in the sun? Or do you look at the giraffes feeding from the trees behind you? Perhaps at the phenomenal herd of zebra that can make a photograph seem black and white? In the Maasai Mara everyone in the safari truck is usually looking in a different direction. Then they nudge each other and everyone turns around to savor a different sight. Hippos plod along muddy escarpments, black rhino offer the most spectacular of spots, while leopards dip into the grass as they stalk prey. With three days of game drives you'll have a great chance of spotting the big cats out hunting. You'll also be able to explore vast areas of the Maasai Mara. Your guides will use their local knowledge to bring you face to face with any African animals that haven't been ticked off your list. Cheetahs offer a mix of grace and power, endangered wild dog don't look like they should be petted, while the 500 resident species of bird use their vibrant wings to grab your attention. But for all the individual sightings, it's often the vast unbroken beauty of the Maasai Mara that stays longest in the memory."

Parts of Diani Beach provide seclusion and perfect relaxation. Others offer cute bars where cocktails and barbecued seafood are savored with your feet in the sand. Like all the accommodations on this itinerary, the private accommodations combines style with luxury. Set in its own grounds, it offers panoramic ocean views, an exclusive swimming pool, and huge double rooms. You'll be staying in one of the most deserted parts of the coastline, on a beach paradise that is shared with very few other people. Walk along the fine sand with your feet in the warm Indian Ocean, purchase fresh seafood from local fisherman, and enjoy the services of a private driver who will take you around Diani Beach. This tropical conclusion to your vacation reveals a different side to Kenya, one that's equally serene and beautiful. But instead of seeing wildlife from your window, you'll have views of gentle ocean waves and unforgettable sunrises that dance along the horizon."

Touching down at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, you will catch your first glimpse of this fascinating country. Upon clearing customs and collecting your baggage, you will be met by a representative who will whisk you out of the city and towards the bush. Driving north out of the city, you will move through the Kikuyu tribal lands of the central province. As the landscape becomes increasingly more arid, you will know you are approaching your first destination: Samburu National Reserve. Samburu is one of the most ideal parks for wildlife viewing, given that the landscape is composed largely of desert scrubland and distant mountains. Relative to the more southern reserves, Samburuland is seldom visited – providing you with near exclusivity in this unique landscape. Combined with the distinct Samburu and Turkana cultures, your time in Samburu will be a unique and atypical introduction to Kenya. While here, you will likely stay at the stunning Samburu Serena hotel, or at another similar accommodation. Arriving in the afternoon, you might enjoy spending the remainder of your day relaxing on the lodge grounds. With a spa on site, a massage may be the perfect way to unwind from all the travel. Alternatively, you may enjoy quietly relaxing with a book near the pool. However, if you are especially excited to get into the bush, it is always possible to join a late afternoon safari that will set out into the arid plains. The remainder of the day is spent entirely at your leisure. Enjoy your first bush buffet dinner with the lodge under the starry night sky, before returning sleepily to your bed."

        "description": "Rise early this morning to begin your explorations of Samburu National Park. Early mornings and late afternoons are the best times to venture out into the bush, given that these periods are when the wildlife are most active. The wildlife in these northern lands is among Kenya’s most unique, and we recommend scanning the plains for the ‘Samburu Special Five:' the reticulated giraffe, the gerenuk, the grevy’s Zebra, the Somali ostrich and the beisa oryx. An especially lucky few may even have the chance to see the endangered African wild dog. These packs of fierce spotted hunters are among the continent’s most successful predators, and are capable of tackling prey as large as wildebeest. They are, however, endangered as a result of a decline in territory, and their susceptibility to domestic animal disease. Elusive and ingenious, a moment with a wild dog would be a truly coveted sighting. As the sun climbs higher in the sky, you may enjoy stopping for a bush breakfast in one of the sacred shady spots in Samburu. There is an indescribable magic that comes with spreading a picnic blanket out over the grass, while sipping on hot coffee and munching on fresh pastries. Grab a pair of binoculars to spy on wildlife roaming in the distance, and take a moment to absorb the wonder of the region. At this point, you may wish to either return to the lodge for the hottest part of the afternoon – or carry on with a full day game drive. In either case, you will return to the bush as the sun’s strength lessens for a second game drive. As you drive across this quiet landscape, you will undoubtedly wonder why this park is not more frequently visited. Enjoy the solitude in the bush, embracing this authentic and untouched African wilderness. You will return in the early evening to the lodge for a candlelit dinner and wine round the campfire."

Pause on route to hop out of the truck on the equator, straddling yourself between the northern and southern hemispheres. Carry on into the shadow of the mountain, eventually arriving midday at your safari lodge. Located on the slopes of Mount Kenya with an ever-refreshing breeze, your time in Mount Kenya National Park will sit in perfect contrast to the dryness of Samburu. After a fresh lunch, spend the afternoon soaking in the tranquility and serenity of this forest oasis. Your lodge is situated near a waterhole, which makes for effortless game viewing from the lodge. Most guests here enjoy spending the afternoon on one of the numerous viewing decks, looking down onto the salt lick that inevitably attracts elephants and buffalo. If the view from the deck does not offer quite enough proximity, venture through a tunnel into a hide that is located mere meters away from the edge of the watering hole. If you are keen to stretch your legs after the days of driving, there are countless hiking trails that depart from the lodge grounds as well. Guides will happily lead you through the forest and alongside streams, giving you a taste of the country’s highest mountain.

Return to your private vehicle to continue on with your journey westwards, descending from the plateaus to the floor of the Great Rift Valley. After a couple of hours of this stunning landscape, you will approach the shores of Lake Nakuru – a flamingo-fringed alkaline lake on the valley floor. Upon entering the National Park, you will wind your way towards your next camp, which is perched perfectly on a hill in the region with panoramic views. You will arrive at the lodge just in time for lunch and a bit of poolside relaxation. As temperatures cool, venture out into yet another new landscape. Game drives here will carry you along the shores of a classic Rift Valley ‘soda’ lake, fringed with flamingos and pelicans. Drive towards the edge of the forest for an all-encompassing view of the lakeshore, often colored pink with the explosive number of flamingos feeding on algae. Traverse the floodplains of the lake in search of the park’s black and white rhinoceros population, pausing to watch as they scratch their backs against acacia trees. As the sun begins to set, venture into the baboon-filled forest and up towards a rocky outcropping for a perfect sundowner cocktail location. Return to camp for a delightfully fresh and organic meal in the open-air restaurant. Retire round the fire and enjoy the company of this intimate camp, swapping stories about Kenyan adventures and life in the bush. Retire to your private safari tent and collapse into your luxurious four-poster bed. As you drift to sleep, try to listen for the cackle of a hyena or the grunt of a buffalo."

For those with a passion for birdlife, this may be the perfect opportunity to borrow a pair of binoculars and set out on a guided nature walk in search of the prolific and unique birdlife. It is also possible to visit the neighboring Masai community, where you can learn about their semi-nomadic lifestyle while walking through an authentic homestead. As the sun begins to set, make your way to the outdoor restaurant for a dinner prepared fresh from the lodge gardens. The camp’s elaborate buffet includes numerous live cooking stations, enabling you to craft a meal that caters perfectly to your taste buds.

        "description": "You will undoubtedly wake early this morning in anticipation of a full day’s safari throughout the world famous plains of the Masai Mara. After sipping on warm coffee, set out in a private 4x4 vehicle with a packed picnic breakfast in search of the quintessential Kenyan wildlife. It will only be moments before you find yourself surrounded by herds of grazing gazelles and zebra, and only a few moments more before you see your first elephant. During these early hours, you will drive across the dusty trails that intersect the Mara, enjoying the cool air and the ever-transforming skies. If timed correctly, it will not be long before you find yourself at the edge of the Great Wildebeest Migration, marked by tens of thousands of wildebeest walking northwards towards greener pastures. Whether you opt to break today up into two safaris – or dive into the wilderness on a full day adventure – today will be spent intimately exploring this remarkable ecosystem. If you find yourself craving a new means of exploring the bush, be sure to enquire about walking safaris and hot air balloon rides. On the former, you set out into the bush on foot with an expertly trained guide. Senses come alive as you walk through the grasslands past herds of ungulates. Game walks provide the opportunity to learn the basics of wildlife tracking, along with time to observe the smaller creatures that are often missed when in the vehicle. The hot air balloon ride, by contrast, sends you high above the plains, enabling you to truly grasp just how expansive the area is. Shockingly quiet and unbelievably soothing, sailing from a wicker basket is one of the most romantic and luxurious ways to explore the park. Tours culminate with champagne in the bush before returning back to your private camp. For your final evening in the bush, you may be interested in indulging in a private bush dinner. Venture out to the traditional boma (open-air venue) to enjoy a customized meal, complete with traditional Masai performances. Lit with candles and starlight, this will be the perfect way to conclude your African adventure."

Depending on the timing of your outbound departure, you will either drive directly to the airport or will spend some time at a local hotel. Early morning travelers will likely spend a final night in the capital. At this point, however, it is also possible to extend your time in Africa by a few more days. Many clients opt to add on a few days on the aquamarine shores of the Indian Ocean before returning home. Assistance will be provided with any trip extensions or alterations, in order to build the perfect Kenyan experience."

Zebra huddles together, a black and white mass that includes a few hundred individuals. As you canter, you will scatter the Thomson's gazelle with hundreds of them gracefully skipping away. On the open plains, the visibility is exceptional. Dotted across the horizon you will see elephant herds, giraffe tower, and big collections of buffalo. The Masai Mara is big-game country and you will be right at the heart of it, riding a horse across the world-famous grasslands. It seems like the only thing you will not encounter are other people or vehicles. This horseback safari uses three private Masai Mara conservancies that carefully limit public access, so it will feel as if it is just you, the grasslands, and your horse. Earlier in the day, you will land at Nairobi International Airport and be met by a representative for your transfer to Nairobi Wilson Airport. From here, a short domestic flight will take off and then land at the Siana airstrip in Ol Kinyei Conservancy. After a short transfer to your mobile camp, you will enjoy a late lunch and get a comprehensive safety briefing. Move next to the paddock where you will familiarize yourself with the horses and choose one for your expedition. Your afternoon ride will be focused on getting used to the horse and the environment, including getting accustomed to riding in big-game territory.

Baby elephants will return your gaze, and you will ride past just meters away as your expert guides understand exactly how to keep a safe distance and respect appropriate boundaries. Emerge from the canopy and the open plains thrive with life. Eland antelope impress with their size and warthogs scurry around while the thin stripes of Burchell's zebra make for spectacular moments. You do not just see the animals as you are also sharing the ground with them. They will respond to you, usually having an inquisitive look at you before bounding away. Approach too quickly, and the animals will bound away at a quick canter; approach slowly, and you can get extremely close as the ungulates do not feel threatened. Take a mid-morning break at Marteo Rock then return to camp, following the Olare Lamun stream, an area rich with game. Your late-afternoon ride will take you to a traditional Masai manyatta (village), where you will be greeted by the Masai chief and welcomed into the community.

Cheetah and leopard are common here, and the region is favored for the spotted hunters to raise their cubs. You will not be getting too close to them, and your trackers will ensure a route that avoids the big cats, but you will sense their presence and find evidence of where they have been. Hyenas will scuttle around as you canter past and a pride of lions will occupy the rocks in the distance. Do not be afraid as the great advantage of the open landscape is that everyone can see everyone else from afar. This is one reason why such vast numbers of wildebeest, impala, zebra, and gazelle congregate here. Out in the open, there are fewer places to hide, plus hundreds of eyes that can help to raise the alarm. If you can see the big cats, is means they are not going after you. Keep riding, and pass some unique characters such as the white-bearded wildebeest and Coke's hartebeest, along with the little topi antelope.

Lion pride occupies the rocks, lazing the day away with bellies full. But another pride is on the move, the lionesses disappearing into the grass as they stalk a herd of zebra. Follow the hunt and the careful approach followed by the explosion of power and the separating of a young calf from the herd. As your game drive continues, you will get a real close-up of the hyenas. Hyenas may not be pretty, but they are always entertaining. Leopard and cheetah occupy Mara North in spectacular abundance, and the game drive provides a good opportunity to see these elusive cats.

A picnic lunch is taken on the fringes of Olomai forest, and then you will trot along the banks of the Mara River to admire the crocodiles that bathe in the mud and the hippos that fill the air with their grunts. There are hundreds, perhaps thousands of them, an enormous congregation of the bulky characters, some of them yawning and a few males fighting over wading rights.

The world’s fastest land mammal needs quite a bit of open space to hide and to hunt. They can reach up to 75 mph in just a few seconds and a few strides, which will prove to be a dazzling sight as clouds of dust follow their path. As their prey tries to zigzag from danger, cheetahs aim out a paw to trip their quarry. They are true sprinters and can only maintain a high-intensity chase for a short distance, meaning they need high grass, so they can get close before they attack. Meru has a gently undulating landscape, which mostly consists of grassy savannah and acacia woodland. It is an enchanting place to be even without the animals. Coming across cheetahs and other cats will provide defining moments, especially if you are fortunate enough to witness these cats on the move or hunt. Sometimes, you can encounter them by the water, and other times, you will witness a cheetah that is nestled into a hiding place, perhaps even with cubs."

Another Meru highlight will be a variety of wildlife that is almost endemic to Northern Kenya. Reticulated giraffes are resplendent animals with vibrant markings that really stand out from the savannah. Grant’s gazelles provide food for cheetahs, although the dazzlingly marked kudu is too much of a challenge. Also in Meru, you should come across the rare long-necked gerenuk and arguably the most charming of all antelope, the Beisa oryx. Ostrich and fishing owls are among the superb birdlife here although you will hear most of the birds rather than seeing them, which creates a soundtrack that continues from before dawn to after dusk."

Wild dogs can also be spotted although a profusion of hunters has meant a decline in hyena numbers. Wildebeest and Burchell’s zebras provide prey along with buffalo, Somali ostrich, sitatunga, and the beautiful Grevy’s zebra. Add in conspicuous giants such as elephants and rhinos, and it is easy to understand why the Laikipia Plateau has become such a popular safari destination. Over these two days, you will have complete flexibility over your safari program. Game walks are a major Laikipia highlight and are very safe despite the landscape being a popular home for predators and pachyderms. With expert guides and trackers, you will walk tentatively across undulating savannah. Then, your footsteps will become firmer and more confident as you appreciate how local trackers have been walking these wildlands since the day they learned to walk. These walking safaris are an excellent opportunity to venture closer to the ungulates, notably species that are very difficult to see outside northern Kenya."

Venturing off-trail is all about the close-ups and intimate encounters. In a national park, you may see a leopard or cheetah from 100 meters, only being able to see it move through your binoculars. By going off-trail, you can slowly inch toward the predator with your driver continually observing its reaction. Essentially, you can move closer, but this experience is not available to all. Private conservancies provide a high degree of exclusivity and restrict visitor access. Rather than vehicles crowding around a single big cat, it can feel that you are alone with a private wildlife show."

During every month of the year, you can spot enormous wildebeest and zebra herds. Plus, of all the predators, it is only the vultures and hyenas that follow the migration. All the cats are year-round residents who can really fatten up for a few months of the year. So, as you explore on today’s game drive, you should enjoy a vast abundance of predator sightings, which are not just relegated to cheetah sightings but leopards and lions as well.

Mara Naboisho has an unfenced border with the national reserve but is operated privately, so that it can only be visited by guests who are staying at a camp in the conservancy. Your local guide will know of many resident cheetahs and will help you explore their behavior. For example, you may spot a cheetah that is nursing young cubs or a mother that is teaching her cubs how to hunt. Coalitions of two males are relatively common, and you may see how their masterful hunting displaces resident singletons. You can track battles between cheetahs and hyenas along with unusual cheetah groupings that have both a male and female that raise their cubs. All these sightings will be complemented by the Mara’s other big cats and the generally massive zebra and wildebeest herds."

        "description": "As you head further north, the rugged Kenyan wilderness begins to fill every panorama. In this wild part of Africa there are no fences or built up towns. Animals wander freely across the landscapes. Great rivers ensure that life flourishes in this arid land. Before reaching Samburu you'll cross the equator, a famous signpost indicating that you've moved from the Southern to the Northern hemisphere. Straddle the line and take some memorable photographs before arriving at Samburu National Reserve for two action packed safari days. Beside the Ewaso Ng'iro River all seems quiet. Serenity drifts across the grassland, occasionally punctuated by an elephant bull or a reticulated giraffe that's coming down to drink. Skipping out of the riverine forest comes a herd of Grevy's zebra, their black and white stripes as distinct as a person's fingerprints. Monkeys are following them, tentatively looking for an opportunity to safely visit the river. Lion prides and cheetahs guard the open grasslands, eyeing the dinner menu from camouflaged positions. Leopards rule the trees, lone rangers who pounce with stealth and intelligence. Compared to the parks in the south of Kenya, Samburu is relatively small. It means that the wildlife is more concentrated, and from one seemingly quiet position a complex scene can unfold. Samburu also boasts a cast of animals that can't be found further south. Long-necked gerenuks stand upright on their hind legs, these bizarre looking antelopes stretching to feed from tree branches. Beisa oryx wander in small herds, their breathtakingly straight horns impressing every visitor. Tiny Kirk's dik-dik barely stand higher than the grass, the smallest of antelopes offering a cute break as you search for the park's predators. With two afternoon, and one morning game drive, you should have enough time to spot the park's complete cast, including hippos, elephant herds, waterbuck, and the big cats. Providing the soundtrack, there are 350 species of birds. Nile crocodiles emerge from the river every evening. As you settle into the safari adventure, you'll realize that spotting animals isn't limited to game drives. In Kenya's unique national reserves you're surrounded by wildlife, and who knows what will wander past the lodge as you're enjoying dinner."

Your camp is situated in the heart of a privately owned game reserve, surrounded by vibrant plains, and gazing out onto the glacial peaks of Mount Kenya. Rigorous conservation efforts have made this reserve one of the most abundant in the whole of East Africa. Watch the animal world unfold from your private verandah; buffalos wander past, giraffes silhouette against the mountain backdrop, and regal black rhinos offer an unforgettable sight. The reserve has both a chimpanzee and rhino sanctuary, and is justifiably proud of how it has been able to rebuild the populations of these creatures. Out on the grass plains you spot two black rhino. All is quiet in the safari truck, everyone carefully watching as the pair slowly move closer. They plod with a dignified arrogance, stopping briefly to inspect you and your eager camera. Being three meters from a critically endangered animal doesn't happen every day, and excited chatter fills the safari truck as the rhino walks on. But the guide quickly asks for hush. Nobody else had noticed that another rhino was approaching from behind. This one is bigger, gallant horns pointing skyward as he looks upon the safari truck with some disdain. This reserve is also home to a smaller population of white rhinos and your two days will provide first hand experience of the difference between the two species. Recall the day's safari in a quaint original farmhouse, where the dining room and bar provide an elegant setting for a relaxed evening. With any day on safari it's impossible to predict the unique sights. This is a raw landscape where wildlife lives in its natural habitat. However, skillful guides have an in-depth understanding of the local animal behavior. They know what times to visit certain waterholes. They're quick to pick up on evidence of lion prides being nearby. With the full Big Five on offer, these two days at will offer an unforgettable safari experience."

At first glance, your eyes are captivated by the lake, the juxtaposition of blue and pink offering a new sight on this safari adventure. Flamingos not the only birds to call this lake home. African fish eagles and Verreaux's eagles fly above the water, effortlessly gliding on the thermals and meticulously scanning for prey. Herons also wade in the shallows, while the indelibly cute Pied kingfisher stands watchful on a bare tree branch. Lake Nakuru is one of East Africa's most beautiful national reserves and its rugged cliffs provide perfect spots for panoramic photos. The Big Five can be found on the verdant green floodplains. White rhinos march, leopards hide in the trees, and elephants playfully bulldoze their way through the forest. Now a new sight, a scavenging hyena roaming great distances to find an easy meal. Perhaps a lion pride made a kill and fell asleep with bloated bullies. Or a lame waterbuck has been cast out from the herd. Like every game drive you'll be left with a trail of memories, unique experiences of wildlife that stood just meters away."

        "description": "Heading south, your safari adventure finishes with three days in the world's most famous game reserve. The Maasai Mara is an otherworldly experience with the sheer abundance of wildlife difficult to comprehend. These grass plains are not inhabited by thousands of animals; there are literally millions of mammals roaming freely. Wildebeest gather in humongous herds, slowly devouring the grass beneath their hooves. Thompson's gazelle and zebra stick close by, forming great packs of animals that cover huge swathes of the rich landscape. They provide a patchwork quilt across the plains, offering a constant reminder of why the reserve is named after the Maasai word for “spotted.” From a distance it's a sight of remarkable beauty. Get up close and the fun really begins. Interactions unfold as you study the pack. A couple of wildebeest square up to each other in a tempestuous show of testosterone. A female zebra gently rests her head on the back of another, a calming embrace that hints of romantic overtones. The gazelle seem to be permanently spooked, not trusting the sentinel abilities of each other. Now a flurry of dust, a small group of wildebeest quickly leaves their position and cause panic among the rest. A large lion pride is the cause of the herd's distress, and in the commotion they've made a kill. The Maasai Mara offers unrivaled opportunities to spot the big cats out hunting. Not every hunt is successful. Sometimes a long careful approach is spotted just in time, and a leopard or cheetah must wait for another opportunity. Sometimes nobody saw it coming. And by the time you've turned on the camera the zebra is already dead. The Maasai Mara isn't an experience to be rushed. You'll be enjoying long, morning and late afternoon game drives, the grass plains at their most active just before dusk. In the early afternoon, relax at the lodge as everyone takes a breather from sun, before heading off into a new part of the reserve. On day 11 you'll leave the lodge early in the morning, taking breakfast beside a hippo pool. As you tuck into your meal, these massive animals are wading along the muddy banks. Some have already found a prime spot in the pool, keeping just snout and eyes above the waterline. But the alpha male isn't happy. He raucously ploughs into the water, the pod groaning with discontent but obligingly moving out of the way. These three days will showcase a surreal world of wildlife. On every game drive there is a continual procession of unique sights. Maybe two bull elephants searching for water. Perhaps a leopard emerging from the trees and approaching a wildebeest herd. Beside the rutted trail a lion pride lazes in the sun, slow yawns revealing a set of savage teeth. Buffalos stand and stare, their curled horns and great bushy hair often dividing opinion. Some think they're ugly. Others reckon there's a strange beauty... somewhere . Everyone agrees that they're not to be messed with. After nine days on safari you'll have developed your own favorites amongst Kenya's cast of wildlife. And you'll have a succession of wild scenes implanted in your memory."

        "description": "Today your safari will begin with your arrival by micro-flight. Descend into the Masai Mara for your first impressions of a fabled patchwork as the black clumps below are the large wildebeest herds on the move. Swoop over the Mara River and touch down in the Mara Triangle, perhaps one of the safari's most dramatic arrivals as lions and elephants regularly inhabit the immediate vicinity of the airstrip. Extra excitement comes with the transfer, which includes a boat journey across a 20-meter stretch of the Mara River. To cross the river is hugely advantageous because it's something that safari vehicles cannot do, so the water creates an inaccessible enclave that's only shared by the guests at three camps in the Mara Triangle. Your safari camp is perched on a steep slope above the riverbank with indelible views that stretch over the river. The wildebeest will cross this river as part of their migration, although the exact point changes every year. Your stay on the river means that the game drives do not need to travel far to see the spectacle and provides a comfortable base with a focus on location and wildlife, rather than on the opulent extras. Your time here is an immediate chance to slip into the wild rhythms of the Masai Mara while you maintain some creature comforts. Think gourmet dining with an elephant bull roaming past the restaurant tent. You will take your first game drive immediately after arrival with a late morning excursion through the surrounding area. After lunch, a second game drive will skirt along the Mara River in search of the rampaging wildebeest herds."

        "description": "Wildebeest gather in the thousands and multiply by the hour on the southern side of the Mara River. Excitement and anguish fill the air as mammals are fearful of the crossing but expectant of the fresh grazing pastures. They will gather in the open clearings as they constantly try to get away from a big cat ambush. Sometimes it takes three or four days before one wildebeest will choose where to cross the river and create the charge. The herd will follow, and thousands of thundering hooves will splash towards the waiting jaws of crocodiles. A lion pride will lurk on the banks, anxious to pick off an exhausted crosser. Hyena waits behind the herds with hopes of an easy meal if anyone turns back. The torrent of mammals will keep coming as tens of thousands rampage over the river. The Mara River crossing is one of Africa's most famous and photographed scenes, but the crossing does not happen every day. Even at the peak of the migration, you could wait a few days before a group of herds pick up the courage to rumble across which is why extended Masai Mara safaris are recommended. Today's morning and afternoon game drive will focus on the wildebeest river crossing with hopes to provide the uninterrupted view of this iconic phenomenon. Don't worry if it doesn't happen today, as you might have already have seen it yesterday. Then there's tomorrow and the five days after that. There is still a lot more to admire; lion pride lounge in the grass, elephants roam past the vehicle, and dozens of the Mara's species are found on the open plains."

        "description": "Surreal and sublime, the great wildebeest migration stretches far across the grasslands. Herds clump together with great furry expressions scattered across the lush Mara colors. From the air, you can admire the patterns as the scorched yellows indicate grazed grass and the thick green indicates where they will go next. You will rise in a hot air balloon at sunrise to float west to east for an hour as you soar across the heart of the Masai Mara. Little Governors Camp is located next to the main balloon launch site, so your early start is much later than if you were to stay elsewhere in the national reserve. Herds extend in every direction, a mystical jigsaw puzzle that is not interrupted by roads or buildings. Nature expands, and the vistas will give you goosebumps as you gaze over it all. Touch down to a champagne breakfast on the plains before you follow the classic Masai Mara game drive itinerary. Like yesterday, morning and afternoon game drives immerse you in all the drama. Lionesses hide in the high grass, their camouflage betrayed by raucous storks that circle overhead. Large buffalo herds block the trail, and you will wait for them to pass. Giraffe elegantly lopes past to join the elephants in rising high above the vehicle. Vultures will circle, and you will follow their cries to find the scavenged remains of a buffalo carcass. Hyenas run past with bloodied mouths, and you will watch a 1000-strong herd of zebra carefully circumnavigate the scene. So much happens in the Masai Mara, all day, every day, so these twice-daily game drives get you close to it all."

        "description": "At your next property, you will just need to listen. Marauding hooves will echo across the grasslands, like a distant percussion that flickers in pitch throughout the day. At every moment you can hear that the wildebeest are close, and one look from your bed will confirm this as the wildebeest scatter across the plains of the Central Mara. This rich grazing land is what the herds have migrated for, and you will have two days surrounded by them all. Thompson's gazelle skip past the camp, delightful characters on their long journey. Sometimes it's zebra on the move, a mass of black and white stripes visible from your verandah. Like your first camp, this one is revered for its location as it places you in the heart of the wildebeest migration, especially in August and September, while providing an intimate space away from other tourists. Tucked in the trees to overlook a broad bend in the Mara River, it's an informal and laid-back camp in the thick of the migrating wildebeest. Sometimes, it's possible to look out from the tent and see herds as they cross the river. Game drives are filled with thrill here. Follow a lion pride as it sets up an ambush as lionesses separate a zebra from the herd. Then watch as black and white limbs are torn away and manes are splattered red. A leopard will furtively descend from a tree and slip into the grass on the trail of Thompson's gazelle. Next, a cheetah will accelerate ahead of its own trail of dust and cause panic in the wildebeest herd. On a muddy bank, you will find a stranded wildebeest as it sinks slowly with a face full of panic. Stay for 30 minutes, and you will watch the hyenas rip the carcass apart. The Central Mara is filled with these predator-prey scenes, and they are highly emotional, especially when you watch the vivid expressions in every face. You will not see all of the revered scenes in one game drive. Instead, a Masai Mara safari is about slowly piecing together the theater. Again, staying for longer gives a much higher probability of admiring the iconic hunting sights. There are other delights here, like the endangered black rhino with their horns a sign of purity and grandeur. Hippos bathe in the river and frolic in the mud beneath the camp to later emerge as silhouettes at dusk. Twice-daily game drives continue to reveal the Masai Mara great wildebeest migration and while the Central Mara is an undoubted tourist hotspot, the camp ensures that there is always a serene place to relax throughout the rest of the day to listen and look at the galloping herds."

        "description": "Continue your own migration as you cross the Masai Mara and leave the main National Reserve. For your final days on safari, you will stay in the Mara Naibosho Conservancy, a private concession with strictly limited visitor access. Only guests at one of the conservancy's handful of camps can explore these 200 square kilometers of raw bush and savanna. Some wildebeest will migrate this far north, and they are joined by the zebra of the Loita Migration, a journey east to west made by another large group of ungulates. Like everywhere in the Masai Mara, it will feel as if you are surrounded by wildlife, but you are never surrounded by other tourists. Lion roars flicker through the night as the Mara's largest pride occupy the grassland around your camp. Untouched savanna cascades from your luxury tent, and half a dozen species regularly fill the panorama as elephant and buffalo continually graze past. On game drives, you will get even closer. Spot a lion kill and approach to just a few meters, or find a leopard in a tree and drive to the premier vantage point. See a black rhino and trace its bashful movements through the grass. This private conservancy enables the guides to take you off the main trail, so you will never miss out on a sight. Even though you've been in the Masai Mara for almost a week, there is always something fresh as lion cubs playfully fight, giraffe swings their necks, baboons clash in the trees and kudu and impala skip past. This safari camp combines a little luxury with the charms of the savanna. Again, location is a huge part of the experience, but this camp has more premium features than the others used, including spectacular open-air bathrooms and wooden decks to relax on. New activities will further enhance the exclusivity of the environment. A Masai warrior leads the way and will walk you into the Mara for you to savor the vivid encounters with the plains animals as it is not uncommon to see distant lion pride and elephants on these walks. The afternoon game drive will not stop at dusk, but will keep going as you explore beneath the moonlight to reveal the atmosphere of the night. Throughout these three days, your itinerary is flexible, and you can create your own program of game drives, game walks, and nighttime drives. A visit to a Masai community is also possible."

From your elevated vantage point, you can watch the migratory herds or even enjoy a spa treatment as hundreds of zebra dots the grasslands below. This is a place for escaping the world except that you are never alone as this is one of the most prolific wildlife areas in the Mara. Your game drive program will stick to the private conservancy and be complemented by the option for short guided walks with Masai warrior guides.

Peer down and you may spot the cub, a little youngster being expertly cared for by a blue-eyed mother. A little later on the drive, you may find an elephant family that will hold you captive, the baby testing his strength by picking a fight with a baffled warthog. With a private conservancy, you can explore at leisure and spend the time to savor each of these sights. The challenge with visiting the Masai Mara for just a few days is that there is a pressure to tick off all the famous animals, but as you spend ten days, you can see them all without feeling like you are even trying. Your guides will connect the dots as so much is revealed when you stop and really watch a scene. Admire the playful battles between young lions, follow hyenas as they harass a gazelle herd, fall in love with an elegant giraffe.

Elephants pass close by, and you know not to be frightened. Zebra wanders past and you know to keep your distance. After two lodge experiences, your safari will conclude with three nights at a tented camp, where canvas walls will allow you to fall asleep to the Masai Mara’s natural orchestra. The tents are more like boutique hotel rooms with polished hardwood floors, excellent en-suite bathrooms, and four-poster beds. While you do not have a swimming pool, your camp is situated on the banks of the Mara River and a perfect place for watching animals taking a drink or making a crossing. Ngare Serian has its own private conservancy, located within the private Mara North Conservancy, which makes for an incredibly exclusive safari with virtually no limits on what to do and where to go. Game drive during the day and night, take walks that reflect your mood, head far off the trails, or follow the path to favorite waterholes. You will be assigned a private driver and guide for three days so that every activity will be personally tailored to your exact interests and ideas. As the name suggests, Mara North marks the northern edge of the Masai Mara ecosystem.

Find a wildebeest stuck on a muddy riverbank, and then return the next day to see the remains of the carcass being ripped apart by hyenas. A long 10-day Masai Mara safari does not give you a glimpse of the wild as much as it enables you to follow individual scenes and uncover the subtleties that are often unseen and unspoken. Staying at a mobile camp provides a new experience to the lodges and just reaching it is part of the adventure. You’ll need to cross a suspension bridge over the Mara River (it’s very safe), an indication of just how deep you’ve gone into the wilderness. Masai warriors escort you with traditional weapons while local guides have an intimate understanding of where the resident predators like to hang out. Like always, the days are personally tailored and accompanied by a sumptuous food and drinks menu. The idea is to give you a true taste of the wild, without forgiving any modern luxuries."

From the air, you will sense the enormity, and as soon as you land, you will savor the intimacy. Elephants and giraffe are seen from the airstrip, and there's a mythical rumbling of hooves, with tens of thousands of mammals on the move. Today you will land in the early morning at Nairobi International where you will be greeted and transferred to the Nairobi Wilson Airport for your majestic flight into the heart of the Masai Mara. Your safari starts straight away as your transfer from the airstrip to camp will bring immediate encounters with most of the Big Five. Big tuskers watch you pass, and bushy buffalo herds will stop and stare as a lion pride drapes itself across clumps of rock. After you check into camp, you can continue to watch the animals as your verandah provides a near mythical view over the Mara grasslands. A dedicated game drive will start in the middle of the afternoon, and you will be quickly acquainted with the iconic animals. As a first-day safari, it is hard to rival the Masai Mara as the plains showcase both mammal diversity and big game abundance. Ten days of safari will feature all the subtleties of Kenya's landscapes, but this first game drive is all about those first dreamy encounters with its big mammals: elephants, giraffe, buffalo, hippo, lions, and hopefully the Mara's black rhino."

The duiker has stopped grazing, so you wait as slowly, slowly, the leopard comes closer. And then it will jumps and throw plumes of dust as jaws will lock onto an old male on the edge of the herd. Two minutes later, and the leopard will be gone as it disappears into the grass with a limp carcass hanging from its mouth. Game drives in the Masai Mara are not only about seeing the big cats; rather they are about the battles between the species as the rhythm of life will vividly play out. Morning game drives are your prime time to see these hunting scenes and your early starts are rewarded. Return to the camp in the late morning to pass the heat of the day on your verandah as you snooze to the sounds of the wild. Over these two days you also enjoy afternoon game drives as each time you will explore a new piece of the Masai Mara. Kenya's most popular safari destination, the scale if Masai Mara helps to scatter visitors over a wide area. On one drive, you will watch the black rhino wander by with horns extended defiantly. On another, you will stop for 30 minutes along the river to watch the playful antics of a big hippo pod. The Masai Mara overflows with wildlife regardless of the month you visit. On all drives, you will find large clumps of wildebeest and zebra, even if it is not the great migration season of July to October. Lion pride is another constant as the landscape's kings prefer to lounge in the open. Leopards and cheetahs are more furtive than the lion, but their profusion makes sightings likely over these first three days. These days of game drives are partly about your adventure on a rough journey across these famous plains that teem with life yet they also bring serenity as the wilderness quickly wraps its blanket around you."

        "description": "You will begin at dawn as the sun is yet to pierce the horizon. Slowly, the Masai Mara will wake up as the iconic plains change color, come out of the shade and glow with the tones of sunrise. Your hot air balloon will rise as the kaleidoscope continues to play out below, the radiant grass interrupted by the patchwork of herds. From the air, you can get a sense of just how many mammals inhabit this land as the ungulates scatter far and wide across the plains. Float for an hour as the Masai Mara switches on for a new day of drama and admire how the herds gallop and lone elephants cross the plains with grace. Hills rise in the distance while the curves of the Mara River sweet as you drift east. A hot air balloon flight is one of Kenya's most iconic experiences as you gaze over the great Mara ecosystem. Touch down, and a champagne breakfast will complete your experience. From here, you will be privately transferred into the far north of the Mara and the exclusive Ol Kinyei Conservancy. The landscape will look the same: thick clumps of grass, sporadic acacia trees, wild sweeps of the savanna. The wildlife appears to be the same too, particularly the evidence of the big mammals. The difference will be that there are very few other tourists as this conservancy offers a very private and exclusive safari experience Your game drives will go off trail, meaning you can get up close with everything you spot. After you check in at the camp, you will take an afternoon game drive through Ol Kinyei with a Masai tracker who will lead you to the conservancy's resident prides."

        "description": "Swap four wheels for two legs to follow the spear-carrying Masai warriors. They will trace the land for clues as they inspect animal dung and lead you to a wide clearing, where the duiker and Grant's gazelle slowly graze. Stay in the open as you walk towards an elephant herd and with a respectful distance in place, you can feel the aura of the pachyderms. Giraffe will come past, followed by a small zebra herd. Next, you will encounter a buffalo herd, and the friendly females will be happy to let you pass. Up ahead, you will change the route to avoid the noisy grunting of a male bachelor buffalo herd. There are few places where you can walk safely with such a collection of wild animals. For well over a millennia, the Masai have herded their cattle on this big game landscape, so they know a thing or two about where to find wildlife and how to avoid the big cats. This morning safari is followed by an afternoon game drive in the conservancy."

        "description": "Your light aircraft will skirt the Kenya/Tanzania border, and you will cruise past the unmistakable summit of Kilimanjaro, the world's highest freestanding mountain. Touch down and you will quickly notice that Kilimanjaro isn't the only one of nature's giants here. Elephants march across the Amboseli savanna and swing their trunks beneath the mystical mountain summit. Giraffe provides another iconic panorama with long necks juxtaposed with steep slopes. In Amboseli, you will always have two perspectives: zoom in on the big game that occupies the national park, like lion pride and a wide assortment of antelopes. Or, refocus to watch these animals beneath Kilimanjaro's resplendent frame. Even from your luxury camp, there are always these two focal points that compete for your memories. Over these two days, you will follow the classic game drive itinerary and explore morning and afternoon with rest through the middle of the day. Amboseli is one of Kenya's most scenic destinations, and while the wildlife isn't as plentiful as the Masai Mara (virtually nowhere in Africa is), the charming mountain backdrop more than compensates. Often the slopes are photogenically green to enhance further the impression that Amboseli comes straight from the African safari postcards. Like in the Masai Mara, game drives bring thrill and adventure, yet they also imbue a sense of serenity in Southern Kenya; the wilder the landscape is, the more you feel the connection with it."

The boundaries are dictated by the natural changes in the landscape. Chyulu Hills is a volcanic sweep of hills and mounds with nothing flat or monotone as it tumbles away from Kilimanjaro. After the early safari starts, a day in this park helps you to reenergize as a variety of antelope skip around, and many of them surround your lodge accommodation. Rather than focus on the wildlife drama, the short day of driving is filled with nature's enchantment. You can also leave the vehicle and walk to follow trails over a park that always appears as fresh and green. It's the sort of place you want to photograph and then frame on your wall, so it's calming effect can continue through future decades."

        "description": "The green of Chyulu Hills will not last forever, and as you wind and weave over them, the dry savanna will appear; this is Tsavo West, a huge national park dotted with nomadic mammals. You will keep driving and cut across the savanna into Tsavo East, where signs of water are even more scarce. Just like the animals, you will drive in search of water and follow the clues to inspect the tense battle for survival. Tsavo East isn't a bountiful utopia for animals like the Masai Mara or Amboseli, as these local mammals must use ingenuity to survive, which creates a blanket of surprise over these two days of game drives. Elephants dig furiously on a dried riverbed and suddenly bring up a spurting fountain. Hyenas wait in the high grass beside a remote waterhole as they know the antelopes must eventually come and drink. One waterhole is more like a puddle that's fought over by the baboons and kudu until the lions arrive and everything runs away as the baboons vociferously shout their disapproval. Just like everything in Tsavo, the views of wildlife are unpredictable, which only makes it more magical. Turn a corner, and a tense struggle between elephant bulls will be playing out. Cross the savanna, and a wildebeest herd will gallop away from a desperate cheetah. Among the thick trees, you will find a baboon troop, with mothers wrapped with hairless babies around their stomachs. On these full-day game drives, the scale is wonderful, and there will hardly be another vehicle in sight, which helps to deliver your final memories of the wild Kenyan savanna."

Your journey across Southern Kenya is complete with your final destination a long beach that sees very few tourists. Wildlife continues to occupy the experience as the black and white colobus monkeys that inhabit the trees in your private villa's garden. And sometimes when you are sunbathing a troop of vervet monkeys will come past, ground dwellers that roam past your verandah. These three days are all about the beach and the Indian Ocean, along with the wild touches that only Kenya can bring. A private guide can arrange any excursions, both in the water and on land, as well as organize a private barbecue dinner for your verandah. While the beach is white and expressive, the indigenous forest gives the villa lots of shade and exclusivity. It's easy to go a day without seeing anyone but the monkeys but wander onto the beach, and a series of restaurants and cocktail bars are well spaced. Like so much of Southern Kenya, it's landscape from the postcards to provide the final inspiring vistas on your two-week journey."

This is the utopian landscape where almost all the famous mammal species coexist, and it is a landscape that can have you humming Hakuna Matata throughout your day. Not only did Ngorongoro inspire a corner of the Carefree Pride Lands, but the local Swahili language plays an integral role in the script. Simba means lion , Nala translates as gift , Rafiki is friend, and Kiara , Simba's daughter, is a word that means bright or clear . Mufasa means king in the Manazoto language, not Swahili. Hakuna Matata really does translate to no worries , but it is now an antiquated phrase. If you want to impress the locals, you should instead say Hakuna Shida , which is a more modern way to suggest trouble-free living. You will have the unique opportunity to do this while visiting Nto Wa Mbu village this morning. You can explore the local market, school, and some farms before continuing into Ngorongoro Conservation Area and one of Africa’s ultimate lodges. Although the safari will not have truly started, you can still see many animals that roam around the property, including the ubiquitous warthogs. Later in the afternoon, you will also visit the elephant caves by foot with a local guide."

Buffalos grunt and huff as they wander past the vehicle, and flamingos carpet one lake pink as another is covered with the peculiar behavior of hippos. Some 30,000 animals live in this ancient, volcanic caldera, and they represent almost all the famous African species. Giraffes will be the only conspicuous absentee as their legs are too long to descend the steep caldera walls. By early morning, it really will feel like the Carefree Lands as herds graze happily and a dozen different species that drink from the same lake. However, in the two hours after dawn, the scenes are more redolent of Taka's journey to becoming Scar. It is in the early hours when predators are most active, and it is very common to see prowling lions in Ngorongoro and the Serengeti. Sometimes, you can watch them hunt. Their slow and precise movements are usually followed by ungulate shrieks and clouds of dust. On other drives, you may see the aftermath, such as lions that are eating their fill or scavengers that are battling over scraps. Hyenas also hunt, and the game drives may find you reevaluating your perceptions of these impressive predators. After a full morning on the crater floor, you will return to the lodge for a relaxed afternoon that typically includes watching waterbucks and elephants march past."

Wildebeest stampede through the gorge and trample the king, which is a real scene that Olduvai will have witnessed many times in its history. After revisiting the movie, you will explore an even older heritage here. This gorge is home to the oldest human fossils that have ever been excavated, including the skull of a homo habilis , which dates back 2 million years ago. There is a fantastic story to explore in the recently redeveloped visitor center with Olduvai Gorge being able to provide definitive evidence that humans exclusively evolved from Africa. Olduvai is where we all originate, and the atmosphere will be inspiring, especially when wildebeest are also in the vista. After this morning stop, you will continue to the Serengeti for a luxury camp that is deep within the Pride Lands."

        "title": "Serengeti – Sublime Safari on the Pride Lands",
        "description": "The Serengeti can initially appear to be as fictional as the Pride Lands. Grasslands extend in all directions, and they are carpeted by hundreds of thousands of animals. Wildebeest move in large herds, kicking up dust as their hooves create a melodic drumbeat. Elephants and giraffes dominate the horizons and are sometimes silhouetted against a rising or setting sun. Birdlife and wildlife proliferate around watering holes, kindling joyous scenes from the movie. Hyenas snarl and harass the herds while monkeys clamber around the trees, shouting advice to other animals. In Mufasa, Rafiki is a trusted confidant of the lions, but in reality, monkeys provide an early warning system to the grazers, using their high perches to call out the whereabouts of lurking predators. Along with the animals, the other interruption to all seemingly endless grass is kopjes. You will witness one kopje and will exclaim that it is Pride Rock. Lion prides laze around sun-scorched boulders, dozing with one eye open. After an hour at one kopje, your game drive will continue and you see another. Here, there will be another lion pride. A little further along and you will encounter another kopje, another pride, and another incredible similarity between the Serengeti and the Pride Lands. This is one of Africa’s ultimate safari destinations, and the scale is unfathomable. More than 2 million wild animals live here on a landscape of a similar size to New Jersey state. You can spend 30 minutes driving slowly among a giant wildebeest herd, and in a single panorama, there can be more than 50,000 zebras. Over three days, it will be difficult to keep track of all the big cat sightings with lion prides being accompanied by cheetahs, leopards, jackals, and the abundant hyenas. Often, you must pause during your drive because the four-wheel drive trail is completely blocked by buffalos, elephants, or giraffes. Many of these animal sightings continue back at your camp as well. You are not watching the big screen but will be placed center stage on a landscape with more wild mammals than anywhere else in Africa. It is also here that you can follow the real animal stories such as lions that are searching for a meal, wildebeest bulls that are competing in a show of dominance, and warthogs that are scurrying away from trunk-swinging baby elephants. On both of these days, you will take a packed lunch and spend most of the daylight hours on game drives, piecing together a wildlife reality that is as surreal as Disney’s fiction."

By leaving to the west, you will also experience how the Pride Lands can become the Bad Lands. Not everywhere is luscious and green in the Serengeti. Large swathes have been grazed to nothing by the herds. Experiencing the contrast is essential, and in some areas, you will find lavish landscapes and ebullient wildlife behavior. In others, you get a sense of a darker, more dangerous side, where the battle for survival has a penetrating urgency. After a short flight back to Kilimanjaro, you will fly across the border to Kenya and indulge in a relaxing night in Nairobi."

In a zoo, you can see captive animals in a confined and humanmade habitat. In East Africa, you can discover how these animals truly move, running free across untouched landscapes. The area around Lake Naivasha was ideal for animators as they could really live among the animals since there are no lions or other dangerous predators. On day nine, you will take a beautiful drive through the Great Rift Valley to the shores of Lake Naivasha, where four-legged mammals roam around the lakeshore. Animals like zebras and wildebeests will move away from a noisy vehicle, but they are rarely perturbed by anybody nearing on foot. Over these two days, you can literally walk and cycle with the herds. These animals tend to appear to be far larger when you are not in a vehicle. Antelopes such as hartebeest graze close to you and gazelles skip past. Your walking safari on Crescent Island will be complemented by a walking and cycling safari in the nearby Hell's Gate National Park on day 10. As the park is not home to predators, the animals are much less skittish and bashful. Two animals are seen in abundance around your camp and will help you understand the character, Rafiki . On the screen, he is a mix of baboon and black and white colobus monkey. You will come to know both and will often see these primates as they swing through the trees above your lodge."

It is known as Mosi-oa-Tunya, or The Smoke That Thunders , and from miles away, you can hear the waterfall growl and see a cloud of mist that rises evocatively from the Zambezi River.

Trumpets alert you to elephants nearby as their orchestral trunks precede a rumbustious move through the forest. Hoots and breaking branches will guide you to a dramatic battle between two baboon troops, and a distant yelp may suggest quarrels between zebras, while an echoed crunch indicates that antelopes may be clashing. You will also smell the safari, especially when you stay for almost two weeks in Africa. On the first day or two, you will be checking off famous animals and scenes, much like re-watching The Lion King for the umpteenth time. However, by day 12, you will be seeking out subtleties behind the storylines. After a morning game drive, you will culminate your vacation with a Victoria Falls visit, where you will journey through the trees and can feel the mist as it rains down upon you. You can also tune your senses to the smells and sounds of a waterfall that befits its original name. Victoria Falls may be known as a site for adventure, but the prevailing atmosphere is very much like the movie’s opening credits. There is real tranquility here, as you stand in awe at the scale of Mother Nature. So, after the adventurous days in the Pride Lands and Carefree Lands, you now have some time to really kick back and absorb wild Africa for one final time, especially during a Zambezi river cruise this afternoon."

        "description": "Land in Nairobi with the excited air of the adventure to come. Arrive in style and be transferred to the delicate opulence of your accommodation. Nairobi is a city that reverberates with life and energy. The pulse of the city beats with more than the life in the sprawling savannah, but also within the history, food, and culture of the city itself. The delicious scent of samosas rises through the street; the flaky crunch of the outer shell lingers in the air. The city center bustles and is filled with colorful goods that range from everyday products to gently carved giraffes. Begin your exploration of Nairobi with a visit to the Dame Sheldrick Elephant and Rhino Orphanage. Dame Daphne Sheldrick is known for her work amongst the African wildlife and her book Love, Life and Elephants ; the orphanage was featured in National Geographic. Lush trees and shade surround the orange earth of the grounds. The elephants are all orphaned calves, victims of poaching and unable to fend for themselves. Walk through the little center and find an open space surrounded by a rope. The youngest elephants trot from the brush to meet their keepers who hold giant bottles of milk ready, both parties eager for feeding. Tiny calves gulp and burble their milk. The keepers nudge the babies through water, teaching the young calves how to play, hug, and frolic. Occasionally a crafty, curious calf will slip away, the keeper close behind chasing the calf back under the rope. The older calves are able to hold their giant milk bottles in their trunks, squinting their eyes with delight and chugging the milk until gone. When the calves are mature enough, usually around three-years of age, they are released into larger herds in Tsavo East National Park, transitioning back into the life of the wild. The elephants scamper back into the bush; you breathe in the air of the wild and know that the adventure has begun."

The museum is perfumed with history and the collection of assorted cultures. Statues and masks display the historical and spiritual connection to the land and the wildlife. From the splintered wood of a carved leopard to the smooth carving of a fertility sculpture, the museum brings you to the diversity of ancient life in a modern city. With more time in the day you can explore the deeper side of Nairobi for a unique tour of the sights that many are unable to experience. Kibera is the largest slum in Africa where the diversity of Kenyan tribes and surrounding war-torn or impoverished countries have made their home. A tour through Kibera not only helps the township but also brings new awareness to the city within the city. The life within the borders of Kibera is vibrant and active. Children giggle as they kick a soccer ball through the streets. The breeze carries the scent of roasted meats and fried dough. Local guides will tour you through the shanty huts and lively markets. The guides, having grown up and most likely still residing in Kibera, offer important and unique insight into the daily life of the city within the city.

Scour the horizon for signs of life; from elephants to giraffes, the wonders are endless. The vehicle turns a corner and you hear the awkward chirp of the African wild dog, frequently encountered in the valley. The wild dog is severely endangered and incredibly precious. The pack can be heard rustling in the brush beyond you. The alpha gives the pack warning, and eventually chirps the sound of safety. They frolic and play in the gentle sun. Their black and brown spots blend with the distant grass. Their playfulness is infectious. When the sun starts to set over the horizon the mountains change color and the colors of the grass glow in the dusky haze. The rich aroma of vegetables from the camp’s garden roasts in the dwindling light. The day ends beneath the stars filling the night sky like diamonds."

The soft singing of starlings rises from the beautiful shifting arrangement in the sky; their wings glide as the murmuration changes direction in midair, a delicate and impressive dance. It is easy to see vulturine guineafowl along the side of the vehicle, feeding in the dry brush. Their plumage is an iridescent blue fading into their black tail feathers, with specks of white strewn through. The elusive and prolific big cat, the leopard, may also make an appearance. The gentle breeze blows through the afternoon air, bringing the warm musk of the trees around you. Your guide quietly points to a tree nearby. A lone branch sways in the breeze and you realize it isn’t a branch at all but a tail. Along the strong, twisted branch above lies a leopard, lounging in the canopy. The spotted fur helps the big cat blend into the bark and leaves. You quickly learn why Sarara is recognized as one of the best places in Africa for quality leopard viewing."

The Samburu people bring their cattle to a known waterhole in the semi-desert geography. It is a rare spot where both humans and animals find respite and life from the wilderness. The singing wells offer an experience that is completely unique. Each family owns a single well and will sing as they bring water up from the source. The soft melody rises into the air; the cows recognize their family song and journey to their well for a drink. The morning sunlight makes the colors of the villager’s beads and the granite of the earthen rocks sparkle. Orange dust rises from the herd as their bells jingle in the brush. The sensational spectacle continues and you will realize that you are witnessing a tradition that hasn’t changed for centuries. After the astonishing experience of the singing wells you will be able to visit the Samburu village itself. The Samburu are a tribe closely related to the famous Maasai of East Africa. The Samburu are semi-nomadic, raising cattle, sheep, goats and camels. The Rift Valley province in Kenya is somewhat barren making the Samburu relocate around every five to six weeks to find fresh grazing grounds for their cattle. The huts are built from mud, hide, and grass mats threaded around poles. A thorny fence, known as a boma, is built to protect the family and the herd from wild animals. Their necklaces and bracelets shine in the sunlight with vibrant yellows and vivacious reds. From one loose necklace to hundreds of various sizes that build upon on another, connected in the center and wrapping around their shoulders, the uniqueness is breathtaking. Walk among the people as they continue to live their lives as they have for centuries and more. The goats bleat, the cows moo, and the villagers milk their animals, bead necklaces, and tend to their gardens. The sun drifts behind the mountains and another wonderful day of exploration has come to an end."

Standing tall and looming over the valley sits the table top of Ol Lolokwe.

The vast expanse of the savannah opens up to the foothills of the Mathews Mountain Range. The rustle in the trees in the distance comes from the giraffes grazing on lush acacias. Their tongues wrap around the branches, thorns included, and pull at the prickly stems of the tree. The giraffe takes long and calculated strides almost moving in slow motion. Their spots shine brown and gold in the afternoon sun. The treble of your guide’s voice bounces through the brush as they describe the variety of flora and the diversity of fauna, and as you witness the speed and grace of weavers flying through the air, chirping along the trees, and threading their nest along branches. Return to camp to experience what has been rated one of the greatest pools in Africa. The infinity pool glows clear blue along the verdant green of the tree line. The mountains spread along the horizon as the warm water cools you from the hot sun. Whether sitting on the deck or within the comforts of the water, the waterhole below offers ample wildlife to view in their natural, thirsty habitat. Herds of elephants linger along its shores and spray themselves with life-giving liquid. They bend their trunks and spritz the water into their mouths. Watch as they dip their feet into the pool to cool themselves in the afternoon sun, the babies often imitating their elders as they learn how to behave like an elephant. The sounds of the afternoon shift to the sounds of the evening; the open sky once again twinkles with stars."

The mountains beckon you closer. The ponies climb up hard rock and through the tough brush onto plateaus that offer a view of the flatlands below. The stunning coats of impala shimmer against watering holes, their horns large and mighty, the white puff of fur around their chest protruding. The horses meander along the bushes. Camel trains can be seen swaying beside the road. Open your eyes and ears and perhaps you can spot an elusive Black rhino. Black rhino are known for being independent grazers, meandering through the brush like lone cowboys. Their beaks come to a tiny point and their overall size is smaller than the White rhino. A rustle in the brush, a scamper through the grass, or a huff from their feeding could bring you closer to a rhino than you ever knew you could be. Return to Sarara with the wonders of the valley and the mountains forever majestic no matter how much time you spend exploring."

And the European explorers encountering wild mammals were preceded by generations of local Maasai and Samburu warriors. It's their intimate knowledge of the bush that guides this journey; every upturned stone or indented tree is a clue, and these clues are used to both enhance the intimacy with nature and ensure that you're safe from surrounding predators. These tribes have coexisted with wild mammals for millennia, so all you need to do is grab your partner’s hand and walk through achingly beautiful landscapes that dance with life. There is no need for expensive GPS systems; with one look at the landscape and a few minutes listening to the trees, your guides can predict exactly what's hiding in the surroundings. Today you continue the walk south, each step bringing another sublime panorama into wild Northern Kenya. Klipspringer and kudu are amongst the antelopes that share this trail in and out of the trees, and they're joined by a flurry of endemic bird song; white-bellied go-away bird, spotted thickknee, rosy-patched bushstrike, vitelline masked weaver, what flies above is unlike any winged character you will have encountered before.

Giraffe continue the theme of big mammals, and a raucous wheeze-honk alerts everyone to a hippo wading in the water.

Floor to ceiling windows provide a staggering view onto 45,000 acres of private game reserve, and once again, there's hardly another soul in sight. While many of Solio's animals will require no introduction, this wild bushland is a haven for the Big Five animals you've yet to encounter. A staggering abundance of wild rhinos cross before your eyes, both Black and White species seemingly viewable at almost every turn. You may have already spotted lions and leopards; Solio should make sure you leave Kenya with endearing memories of both famous cats. Buffalo herds block the trail, giraffe pick at trees beside your lodge, and the safari isn't limited to game drives. You can lace up the boots and enjoy another day of walking safari if you wish. Like every day on this itinerary, afternoons are relaxed times; they're for resting at your accommodation and gazing out onto Africa, marveling at the sights and sounds that continually pass by."

With just a handful of seats and a low cruising altitude, you garner stunning first safari impressions through the window. Pick out the medley of herds spread across the grasslands and land in a secluded piece of this world-famous national park. Take a deep breath. Look around. In all directions there is action, from skipping gazelle to giraffe necks poking above trees; zebra herds scatter at the whiff of nearby predators. After a relaxing lunch at camp, you take a late afternoon game drive, the first of many intimate experiences with Kenya's wildlife. Tonight's accommodation is an indication of what is to come. Your safari lodge occupies an enviable position in the Mara, tucked beside Leopard Canyon, and overlooking the hippo occupied Mara River. The proximity to numerous lion prides is legendary and the views from your River Suite provide the perfect backdrop to combat any travel tiredness. Regal interiors blend modern touches with indigenous style and old-world enchantment, and the hand-carved bed and seating is fit for royalty."

Pop the champagne corks and toast to your safari adventure on this private hot air balloon ride. After around two hours in the sky you gently touch down and spend an unhurried few hours admiring the wildlife from the elevated position of your camp.

Gazelle graze with alert ears, kudu join forces with zebra and appoint a sentry, and the wildebeest move their young to the center of the herd. You spot a lion pride in the long grass. They're observant but languid, still full from yesterday's springbok. A further two lion prides are found close by. Stop beside them and lucid eyes return your stare. Keep driving and another cat offers an iconic memory. A cheetah springs across an open plain, the zigzagging wildebeest not nimble enough to avoid a ravenous hunter. Weave back to the lodge and it seems that the cheetah wasn't alone in enjoying breakfast. On a concealed tree branch a leopard feeds on the remains of a bloodied carcass. While the morning brought thrills, most afternoons on this itinerary are delightfully serene. When the sun is high in the sky everything takes a rest. Hang out in the luxurious suite, gaze down at the hippos in the river, and raise your head from a book as an elephant herd crosses from periphery to center stage. Enjoy increased intimacy with the Mara and a third afternoon game drive, your guide always choosing a different route and responding to your interests. So if you and your partner share a fascination for hippos then the game drive can tour their popular hangouts and swamps."

The modern Land Rover provides comfort and space, as well as an elevated platform to admire Kenya's natural splendor. Nakuru is indelibly vibrant and combines an eclectic mix of the big and small. Some 400 bird species provide the ongoing soundtrack; cormorants and heron shout from the lakeside, eagles cruise on the thermals, while bizarre lovebirds and kingfishers always keep visitors entertained. These birds flutter above nature's great. Lions and buffalo are found and they share space with buffalo and giraffe. And now a new sight reduces you to silence. A large protruding horn is heading your way, an elusive Black rhino revealing an iconic moment that can sometimes elude those who've been on months of safari. Lake Nakuru is a rare haven for both Black and White rhino species and your afternoon game drive is likely to be focused on close-up encounters with these endangered greats."

Hell's Gate National Park isn't home to the big cats and this lack of predators opens up a fresh collection of safari experiences. Activities here are self-guided. Your guide will drop you by the park reception and from here you create your own private adventure. Mountain bike trails loop through the valley, the ground shared with gazelle, impala, zebra, and now a tower of giraffe that stand over your wheels. It's a hypnotic experience, just the two of you peddling across a landscape littered with hooves. A myriad of hiking trails also bring close quarters encounters with ungulate herds. Wander past the distinct lines of a zebra's fur, spot warthogs kneeling on their front legs, and keep turning corners to Africa's endemic species. On the morning of day six you blend further into the landscape by saddling up and riding a horse onto the open grasslands. This is Kenyan safari exploration at its most intimate. Most wildlife view the horse as merely another animal, and a few species are scared of its presence. They stand and wait, inspecting this new creature that inhabits their land. Experienced riders can raise adrenalin levels and gallop with their ride, the pinnacle of the enchantment coming when you run alongside a zebra herd."

After the adventure of Hell's Gate, Amboseli National Park is all about serene moments with nature. Your chic safari camp offers stunning vistas over the plains and onto towering Mount Kilimanjaro, the white peak a remarkable contrast to the brittle grassland. That's not all. Roaming beneath the plains are large elephant herds, their tusks proud, and their gray bulk a delightful addition to this iconic scene. This boutique camp ensures that these views are available when you're lounging on the bed. Just 12 luxury tents can be found here; each is well-spaced from the next and ensures solitude for you and your partner. Upon arrival, you can enjoy an afternoon game drive that explores more of Amboseli's beasts. Hippos are also abundant, as are all the big cats and the conglomeration of antelope species you've grown accustomed to seeing. Rest around sunset and then head out into Satao Elerai's private concession after nightfall. By now you'll have seen the full safari checklist. But a nighttime game drive is completely different. It's spooky and dark, the visibility squashed and the landscape taking on an increasingly primitive beauty. The guide stops and the engine is cut. Rustling sounds engulf you and goosebumps rise on arms. Turn on the flashlight and you're just five meters away from a huge herd of one-ton buffalo. Nocturnal creatures add new memories; jackals, a bat-eared fox, and diminutive ground dwellers take their chances in the dark."

There are a few miles on either side of the tarmac that's quiet and devoid of life. But journey just a little further and you're soon lost in rugged hinterland. There are no fences around here and there are very few other people. Roaming through camp are a resident giraffe tower, herds of impala that sleep beside the tents, and a charming collection of waterbuck, zebra, and even elephants. And that's just at the camp. Soak up the local residents and then head out on a long afternoon game drive. Today is about getting lost. It's about touring Kenya's wild savanna and savoring somewhere that's devoid of human development. Follow giraffe as they march to the river, take photos of yawning lions, and seek out the rhinos that dwell in this evocative landscape. Tsavo East borders Chyulu Hills so there's time for a full morning and afternoon of game drives today."

Yet turn another corner and a lion pride is feasting on an impala, or a rhino comes out of her forested hiding place. The full Big Five are abundantly found here and there are few other vehicles interrupting your photos. During dry season months the waterholes are always strong bets for action. Elephant herds arrive all day and night, while large buffalo herds scare smaller ungulates away from drinking. When the rains come the wildlife could be hiding anywhere. Searching for it is always an adventure. Tsavo West symbolizes this safari adventure. There's excitement and authentic encounters with nature. There are also lots of charming scenes and romantic moments that linger long in the memory."

With a deep bathtub in your private en-suite, a roaring fireplace and a private butler, this cottage will feel like a cozy home over the coming days. You may choose to spend the afternoon at the lodge’s bar and dining area, observing as resident elephants come to the surrounding wetlands to drink and play. Alternatively, you may wish to set out on your first game drive with your private guide, in search of the 50 species of mammals and 400 species of birds that call Amboseli home. Returning to the lodge in the late afternoon, enjoy a sundowner as the sun dips behind Kilimanjaro and the sky puts on a theatrical display of color. Dinner will be served under the starry night sky, and will revolve around local produce from the Amboseli wetlands, and spices from Kenya’s Swahili Coast.

It is during this period that the park is at its most active – and an early morning departure will ensure that you have a breakfast picnic surrounded by elephants, zebra, giraffe and wildebeest. The quintessential moment of an Amboseli safari is observing the prolific elephant population walk gracefully in the shadow of Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest peak in Africa. Elephants here grow to be among the biggest in the country, and are spotted easily in this flat terrain. Often herds are found splashing in the glacial-fed swamps alongside hippos, in the merciful shade of a papyrus tree. Flamingos and pelicans often dot the shore and fly above, creating a colorful postcard-worthy photo. It will be your choice whether you opt to spend the entire day roaming the plains of Amboseli, or returning to the lodge for lunch and a swim in the pool. As the sun sets, you may either pick a scenic vantage point in the bush for a cocktail, or return to your private cabin to watch the sunset from a warm bath.

There is a bourgeoning population of black rhinos, which is directly indicative of the superb conservation efforts.

As you are ready, enjoy an afternoon game drive in the conservancy, taking in the first impressions of all the famous Mara grasslands. Lions, elephants, zebra, giraffe, buffalo, and hippos are all seen nearly every game drive you take."

        "description": "Game drives in the Masai Mara can lead you in many different directions. There is no set route or typical trail as the guides respond to the movements of the wildlife and intimately tailor every part of your experience. On a privately guided safari, every activity is flexible. Spend the morning in bed, or explore the plains at dawn when the cats are most active. Take a bush picnic and stay out all day, perhaps with a lunch taken beside a pool of hippos. You could also split up your day with morning and afternoon drives to allow for lots of downtime at the camp. Tell your guides your interests, and the drive will be tailored for you whether you are interested in wildlife photography, baby elephants, cheetahs, birdlife, or anything else. A privately guided safari does not just mean there is only you in the vehicle as this is an organic landscape and the activities evolve with the land and the visitors. Head out and the Mara opens up. Lion pride lounge on rocks, while young bachelor lions pant in the sun on the open plains. Buffalo herds meet at the river, a mass of burly black and horns. Cheetah hide in the grass and your guide will know how to betray their camouflage. Huge elephant herds leave you speechless while congregations of zebra provide adorable moments. Take your time and enjoy the first drives on these expressive plains."

The grasslands glimmer a golden tone, and you will rise above them in your hot air balloon. Zebra and wildebeest herds are scattered around appearing as small clumps on the iconic patchwork that is the Masai Mara. When cruising low, you can also make out elephants and giraffe, possibly even buffalo and hippos. Touch down after your private flight and a champagne brunch is waiting, usually accompanied by nomadic animals roaming nearby. From here, you will be picked up by your private guide and the day’s plans are fully flexible, which allows you to choose your own path through the wild."

        "description": "Private conservancies cascade out from the north of the Masai Mara National Reserve. There are no fences and wildlife moves freely, meaning you will see the same animals in both the national reserve and the conservancies. The difference is in the intimacy and exclusivity of the experience. Private conservancies restrict visitor access, so the landscape is only shared with other guests at the camp, rather than day-tripping visitors. As these conservancies are privately managed, the driving rules are relaxed, so you will be able to veer off of the trails and bump across virgin grassland to bring you up close with the Mara’s wonders. This is particularly advantageous with the predators as rather than glimpse a leopard from far away, you are just a few meters away. When vultures circle, you can discover the carcass in the high grass. When a hunt has played out, you will have a prime vantage point as teeth crunch into bone. Ol Choro is one of the smallest conservancies and is exclusive to your next camp, so a maximum of 16 visitors can explore this portion of the landscape. Your privately guided safari continues here, and you will join with a new guide. Your spacious and individually decorated tent is tucked away in a shaded forest where you will regularly hear hippos and elephants through the night. This is classic safari under canvas, but there is also pure opulence experienced here. Expect roaring log fires, comfy armchairs to watch the zebra and all of the seclusion a couple could wish for."

Walk hand in hand onto the plains to follow the trail of zebra and then surround yourself with wildebeest. Wander past buffalos and giraffe, admire elephants from a distance, and follow Masai warrior guides to intimate encounters with a whole range of wildlife. These walking safaris can continue to a local Masai village, where you will be immersed in the world of the tribe. You can also focus on a particular animal (not the big cats for obvious reasons), which helps you to appreciate the intricacies of one of the Mara’s residents. As your safari is privately guided, you can create your own program. Game drives, bush walks, and nighttime drives are all available, so the day flows with your moods. Beneath the cloak of darkness, nighttime drives have a wonderful intimacy as your guide can stop your vehicle on the plains and allow your eyes to adjust to the gloom slowly. You can hear the animals as they graze, chomp, belch, and grunt, but you will not quite be able to see who is making the noise. But then the spotlight turns on, and you will find yourself surrounded by over 100 buffalo or perhaps a herd of elephants. Return to the camp to find dinner waiting on your private table beneath the stars."

You can also simply sit back at your camp and admire the wildlife that roams along the perimeter as so many four-legged characters are seen before you will ever see another person. On a couple’s safari, it is recommended that you enjoy three nights at each camp so that you can take your time and not feel as though you have missed out when spending one of the mornings sleeping in. With three nights you can relax, but still have lots of time to really explore."

Cottars 1920s Camp is ideally situated just a mile from the reserve so your private game drives can explore the national reserve, especially the area around the Mara River, or they can concentrate on the delights of the Conservancy itself. Designed in the style of the 1920s, your next safari camp has an iconic Out of Africa feel, evoking the adventures of early European explorers. It will feel as if you have stepped back in time, even down to the beautiful sepia photos and brass lanterns. You will be staying in the honeymoon suite, far from the other four tents at the camp. The shared area includes a swimming pool, and you will have a local escort for journeys around the unfenced area.

With the ungulates comes the predators with the big cats crowded in relatively close proximity. For encounters with the predators, there are few better safari destinations in the whole of Africa. By now you will have seen plenty of lions, and you should have spotted a handful of leopards and cheetahs. It will also sometimes feel as if hyenas are everywhere, the comical characters roaming about as they look for an easy meal. Hyenas are not just scavengers, but rather they are opportunists as they savagely bring down both the old and the young that are separated from the herd. Although the National Reserve can see a lot of tourist traffic, it is still well worth spending one or two of your safari days here. Your game drive is followed by the seclusion of your honeymoon suite. So just as on every other day on your itinerary, you can choose between a full day of adventure or a serene immersion in the wildlife around the camp. In the evening, you will enjoy a stunning meal in the bush at a private location away from the camp. Bush dining is just one of many luxurious extras enjoyed over this 10-day Masai Mara safari.

        "description": "As the morning's mist begins to clear, you will be trekking beneath the canopy. First, you will be following a marked trail, but soon you will veer off onto tracks made by forest elephants. With every step, the rainforest will seem to get darker and denser as the trees wrap themselves around the trail and the guides slice your path using their machetes. The gorillas have been located, but the last part of the journey is thrillingly slow. You are not on any particular trail, but every step brings you tantalizing closer to the sounds coming from up ahead. Through the branches, you glimpse a ball of black, but then you must clamber for another five minutes before the troop comes into full view. It can be challenging, but trekking through the thick virgin forest is a very authentic part of the experience, helping you appreciate just how remote you have to go when visiting the world's last mountain gorillas. As your guides clear your path, a gorilla will suddenly be standing before you fully upright and sidestepping with arms waving in the air. The female gorilla is making herself look big to showcase her power as she sends the message that you must respect the troop's boundaries. She isn't telling you to leave as these habituated gorilla troops are used to the daily hour of contact. Step a little closer, and you will see her smiling three-year-old baby that mischievously scampers between the trees. Fingers curl around the branches, and there is your first unforgettable look in the eyes as with these wild gorillas, there is an emotion to admire in every set of eyes. As your guide slices away a couple more branches, you will see the rest of the troop as a dozen of them fill the lush landscape before you. Soon another silverback will emerge and bound along on his knuckles, white fur shimmering on a broad back dominated by muscle. All of the sudden, there are three gorillas behind you and another four feeding beside you, making it impossible to know which way to look. Sometimes you have to refocus, baffled by the intimacy of the experience. At other times you will lose yourself in the detail, like the glint of a smile or the site of two infants playing hide and seek amongst the trees. After an hour, you must leave the troop and follow your steps through the forest to spend the rest of your afternoon relaxing at the lodge."

        "description": "Visiting one troop is an inspiring experience, but when you have come so far into the heart of Africa, it would be a shame only to do it once. Furthermore, a first gorilla experience has so much detail that it can pass in a blur. Gorilla trekking a second time helps you to relax and absorb the intricacies of the encounter. You will visit a different troop and take a different path through Volcanoes National Park. The actual time trekking is usually between 30 minutes and two hours in one direction, although that could be more dependent on the location and trekkers are divided into their interests and fitness levels, so older visitors are usually offered the easier of the treks. However, this is a rare opportunity to explore an untamed rainforest which attracts many visitors to a longer trek. As you approach the gorillas, you will feel the goosebumps rise as two blackback males will cause the ground to vibrate as they pound through the small forest clearing. This troop is larger with the up-and-coming males kept in place by a powerful drum roll on the chest of the silverback. Tension exists here, and you can feel it in the atmosphere, and sense it in the odd derogatory glance shared between individual gorillas. Perhaps in a year or two, the troop will have split, and the uneasy ambiance is in dramatic contrast to yesterday's gorilla trekking experience. Not that you will not still enjoy charms of it all, as when you spend an hour with a gorilla troop, there are always hundreds of little moments to take away. After returning from the trek, you will settle into your lodge for lunch and to freshen up before transferring back to Kigali for the night. The Kigali Serena is the city's premier hotel and an easy way to soak up the city."

Before noon, you will have touched down and settled into your camp to be gazing down at the famous Mara River. Situated in the Mara Triangle, this is one of the only Masai Mara camps on the southern side of the river, helping to bring certain privacy during the peak tourist season. Sitting back on your verandah, you can watch the herds and admire the patchwork of wildebeest and zebra that are scattered across the fresh plains. Occasionally, an elephant will amble past, or a waterbuck will come to graze right beside you. Every July and August, the great wildebeest migration crosses the Mara River and then the herds will spread out across the Masai Mara until September or October (note that for travel from January to June, you will need to safari in Tanzania's Serengeti to see the great wildebeest migration). From your camp, you can see the herds as they gather on the southern bank, meaning that you are in prime position to get close to the action whenever the wildebeest decide to charge. Dust spirals, water splashes, and crocodiles snap their jaws as tens of thousands of hooves make their perilous journey. The camp is engulfed by the enchantment of the migration, so today's afternoon game drive is likely to be a short one, bringing you beautiful safari moments yet keeping everything relaxed after your last few days of adventure."

A leopard will jump down from an acacia tree and crawl slowly across the plains in the light of dawn. As you game drive around the Mara River, you will follow their movements, not just seeing the predators but also watching them in hunting mode. Baboons shout loudly to alert a herd of Thomson's gazelle to a cheetah's camouflage. You will return to the leopard, and it has also been unsuccessful in its hunt, the wildebeest galloping away from the spotted predator. But up ahead, there has been a kill and a loud roar scatters the hyenas that were seeking to get close. Drive across to get close enough to see a black and white limb being tossed into the air. Ribs are exposed, and the pride tucks in, ravaging the carcass with a brutal intensity. Then it is back to the charm of the migration, the sight of a few thousand zebra huddled together, or the feeling of being surrounded by the miles of scattered wildebeest grazing away. But as you are getting lost in the serenity of the scene, there will be a flurry of commotion as you watch the cheetah continue her hunt.

It is impossible to know how many wildebeest and zebra are around you, but when you float above the Masai Mara in a hot air balloon, the scale is magnified. Now you realize is is more like a million as the herds fill the plains in every direction as great clumps scatter either side of the Mara River. Yours is one of the closest camps to the balloon launch site, so at dawn, you will take off early. After 90 minutes of flying across the plains, you will touch down to a champagne breakfast, before a game drive transfer takes you north across the Masai Mara. Bump across the grasslands and pass the bustling herds of buffalo before stopping to inspect the elephants that grace the trees. Find lions perched on the scorched rocks and then admire a baby giraffe that follows her mother's graceful steps. The Masai Mara is not just about predator versus prey as this ecosystem is packed with the all of the enchantment of the wild, from playful monkeys to unusual antelope, scurrying warthogs to exotic birdlife. Staying in the Mara North Conservancy helps to open your senses to these other highlights, particularly on a walking safari. A Masai warrior leads you on an animal tracking walk across the plains, pointing out the clues and bringing you close to a whole array of life such as the hartebeest, Grant's gazelle, a giraffe tower, even a buffalo herd. Much as you may have felt during your gorilla trekking, the wildlife feels so much more real when there is nothing between you and them."

They are on high alert, although none of them seem quite sure where the threat is coming from? In your safari vehicle, you will have a higher vantage point, and the guide manages to betray the cheetah's camouflage. The spotted hunter moves furtively through the grass until a muffled call rings out and the gazelle scatters, skipping across the airstrip right in front of your eyes.

        "description": "Strange calls flicker through the night and sound something like a throaty grunt with a pulsating echo. Over breakfast, the guides reveal that they came from lions with two quarreling males less than half a mile away. When the game drive starts, you will see them both irate and lost in their own troubles. A closer inspection sees a third male, his impressive mane flowing beside a lioness. On the Masai Mara, your game drive lion sightings come at regular intervals with the landscape's giants regularly basking on the open plains. Sometimes the pride is sleeping, perhaps with a couple of cubs play-fighting nearby. At other times, you will make out the stages of a hunt with either the lionesses on the prowl or the pride's jaws tearing through a zebra carcass. It's the profusion of big cats that makes the Masai Mara such a revered safari destination. Most lions, leopards, and cheetahs, lack the stamina to follow the migration. They stay to protect their territory and throughout the year, there is plenty food to support the large numbers. Then the great wildebeest migration arrives, and there is a bountiful feast indeed. So much prey enhances the opportunity to see these famous cats on a hunt, and that's usually the focus on your first full day of game drives. In some safari destinations, you are looking for the big cats. In the Masai Mara and Northern Serengeti, you will not need to look for the predators, and rather you will seek out the predatory action. As with all days on this itinerary, your safari program is flexible, and the guides will tailor the activities to your interests and energy levels."

With tens of thousands of them marauding around as the wildebeest are rutting, the zebra congregating, the hyena hollering and the are buffalo charging, you often cannot grasp the sheer numbers. You can sense the scale on a game drive, but you are happily lost in the exquisite details like the facial expressions of a herd being tracked by an unseen hunter. From a hot air balloon, the patterns begin to make sense. You will gaze down on the fabric of life with the grasslands freckled with black clumps of mammals. Color changes indicate where the herds have mowed the grass and where they will graze next. Elephant and giraffe are spotted on their nomadic journeys as the Mara River curves into the distance, and the patchwork stretches out in every direction. From the air, the phenomenon becomes understandable with the movement of the herds and the size of the landscape understood. After an early morning hot air balloon flight, you will enjoy a champagne breakfast before another flexible day of game drives and walking safari. Given where you are likely to land, this may be a good day to cover a large area by traversing the main Masai Mara National Reserve. Other vehicles and tourists are here, so the wildlife abundance comes with some popularity, yet it's a great opportunity to match the scale with the detail. The Mara North Conservancy provides an exclusive safari experience with access limited to those staying in the conservancy. Rules are relaxed here, and guides can take you off road. So when a leopard hides in a tree, or circling vultures suggest a kill, you can bounce across the grass until you're just a few meters away."

Masai warriors lead your walking safari and use their knowledge to pick up the animal clues to lead you onto the grasslands. Wildebeest herds rumble along and buffalo block the trail, their frames seeming much larger when you're both at ground level. By sticking to the short grass (long grass is where the big cats wait to pounce), Masai warriors can lead you onto the plains during the great wildebeest migration. Exhilarating and evocative, it's an angle that few people get to experience in the Masai Mara. Return to the lodge and spend a few hours relaxing in your cottage. Yours is the only small boutique lodge in the Masai Mara, and it's hidden in a secluded valley of the Mara North Conservancy. Your elegant cottage commands a glorious position above the plains, and it is possible to spot animals directly from your four-poster bed. A wooden verandah is consumed by the sounds of the wild, and the Masai warriors are on hand to guide you through the animal-engulfed lodge surroundings. Sometimes, the mood dictates that the afternoon safari is simply about sitting back and watching the herds below. Or it could be a game drive or further walking safari. Move into the evening and there is another treat as the Masai warriors lead you onto to the plains for a bush dinner beneath the stars."

So after a relaxed morning, you will stop at the Rhino Sanctuary on route to the airstrip to admire the rescued giants and their proud horns. Then fly from Mara to Migori Airstrip where you will be transferred to Tarime to cross through immigration. From there, hop another 20-minute flight to Kogatende Airstrip in Northern Serengeti with a total travel time of fewer than three hours. Enjoy the views on this side of your batteries, perhaps even with a luxurious bath that overlooks the plains."

        "description": "Lost in an untouched corner of the Serengeti, your camp is just a few minutes from the iconic Mara River. It's this river that the wildebeest cross, although the exact location changes every year. The herds prefer a place with low grass and limited currents, but occasionally they get it horribly wrong, and half of the herd falls to drowning, crocodiles, or big cat ambushes. Wildebeest start to gather for a few days on the edges of the river until one brave male will take the plunge and everyone else will follow. Witnessing the river crossing can never be guaranteed, especially if you only have one or two days in the area but with a stay of four days, you can track the movements and be in prime position for when the wildebeest decide to charge across the water. Not all of the wildebeest brave the water. Many opt to stay on the southern banks so the game drives will continue to reveal inspiring new scenes. A hyena cackle ripping apart a wildebeest stuck in river mud, a leopard nursing her young cub in an acacia tree, two elephants passing the camp at sunset, quarreling male hippos fighting in the river are all there to be seen. Game drives are flexible, and their sense of adventure is complemented by the serenity of your camp. The luxurious tented suites have floor-to-ceiling windows that overlook the plains with thick mahogany floors and huge bathrooms with baths for two. Enjoy it all as you close your eyes to hear the drumbeat of wildebeest hooves crossing the grasslands as you settle in."

Zebra appears close to tears as a leopard causes havoc amongst their numbers. Emotion fills the atmosphere as the tension of the landscape's battles nearly overwhelm your senses. As in the Masai Mara, your day is fully flexible, and you can create a program of walking safaris and game drives to suit your preferences.

With your two safari properties, the safari never stops as even during your quiet times in your suite there will be animals roaming past and perhaps even a strangled shout of wildlife being hunted nearby.

Mount Kenya dominates the landscape, its defined peak dominating green hills crisscrossed by rivers. Journey into the trees and your camp is tucked along a pristine space of riverine forest, elegant views of the Bisandi River greeting you on arrival. Check into a stunning en-suite tent and watch the river. Impala and kudu are drinking, tentatively sipping as they watch for predators. Elephants don't have the same fears. They charge down the banks and splash in the shallows, great water jets cascading out of trunks. Camping might not sound like preferred accommodation for a romantic escape. But this is camping, Kenyan style. Canvas tents ensure the immersion in nature feels absolute, but the rest of your accommodation is more like a grand home than a camp. Traditional wood features abound; flushing toilets and hot showers can be found in your en-suite bathroom in the bush, and luxuriant beds are raised above the landscape.

Long game drives get intimate with Meru's big game. Expect leopards and lions hiding in the tall grass, dozens of ungulate species dining on overgrown wilderness, and a dazzling collection of bird species providing a feast for both eyes and ears. You're watching and admiring, chatting away as you both experience the intimacy of African safari. Then silence. Conversation is cut mid-sentence and you stare at the forest edge. Slowly, almost painfully slowly, two Black rhino emerge from the trees. You stand spellbound, silently marveling at the elegance of two rare and beautiful animals walking your way. Sometimes, there really isn't need for words. Evenings provide dramatic opportunities to walk hand in hand. An armed ranger leads the way, taking you into this Big Five landscape as the sun relinquishes its power over the day. Follow ancient antelope trails and nothing is scared. Smaller wildlife may run from the sound of an engine, but ungulates aren't fearful of footsteps. Kudu and eland stand and stare, pointed horns belying gentle faces. Gazelle skip across the trail, and then an elephant bulldozes through the trees and you must quickly backtrack. Return to the camp and the evening's enchantment follows a similar pattern. It's just you, your partner, a kerosene lantern, and Meru's mesmeric soundtrack. Oh, and the full cast of Animal Planet drinking from the river below."

But the abundance of Kenya's plains is what keeps it in the premier position of African safari destinations. Game drives are merely the start. This itinerary unveils a multitude of authentic experiences to have with the Big Five and more. Laikipia's unique additions are horseback and camelback safaris. Experienced riders can gallop across these inviting plains, hooves thundering through the dust towards zebra herds. Horseback provides an unrivaled intimacy and thrill, the wind rushing through your hair as you gallop alongside a herd of black and white stripes. Stay calm as you trot past the elephants and then allow the horse to kick up dust and return to your cottage. Inexperienced riders can also take a horseback safari although it will be at a more sedate pace. Going by camelback really evokes the adventures of early explorers, the desert giant calmly plodding past all of Laikipia's remarkable wildlife.

Your camp is one of the Maasai Mara's most exclusive and a premier destination for a romantic escape. The camp has its own private concession, a vast area of the Mara that can only be explored by its handful of guests. Out on a game drive you spot a leopard. It's stalking, dipping into the grass and approaching an unsuspecting gazelle herd. Few scenes are as sought after, the interaction between predator and prey reaching its pinnacle. While the Maasai Mara's popularity often means that this kind of scene becomes surrounded by safari trucks, at your camp, the experience is only shared with your partner. Lion prides seem to be everywhere in the Mara. They drink from shriveled waterholes, inspect the plains from rocky pinnacles, and lounge in the grass with content bellies. Cheetahs and hyena have also found abundant heaven here, one using grace and speed, the other snacking on leftovers. Spotting these big cats from your verandah is a strong possibility. Watching bushy buffalo from the tent is even more likely. You're drinking a fresh morning coffee and a whole herd of them graze just meters away. As always, your tent is fabulously furnished, well separated from other guests, and complete with a hot shower with views onto the wilderness. The Maasai Mara isn't a one day destination. Appreciating its beauty requires an immersion in its scale. Long game drives cover vast stretches of the park, the interaction between predator and prey omnipresent. Grass keeps rolling, hooves continue to pound against the earth, and the immersion in nature's greatest theater becomes absolute. With four days here you get to explore at a relaxed pace, ensuring there's plenty of free time to sit back and watch the Mara unfold from your verandah.

Leopards in particular love the large and spreading acacia tortilis trees that are everywhere, using them as a refuge to stash their kills out of lions and hyena’s reach. Returning to the lodge in the evening, you will find it bathed in welcoming lantern light, and after a fireside cocktail below a sweeping gallery of stars, delicious aromas wafting from the kitchen draw you to the dining room. Enjoy a sumptuous three course meal accompanied by fine wines while gentle conversation and easy laughter fill the room. Later, as you slip between the covers in your suite, lie back and listen to the sounds of the African night outside as they gently lull you to a blissful slumber."

        "title": "Maasai Mara – The Magic of the Maasai Mara",
        "description": "After your final morning game drive, enjoy a delicious brunch on the terrace before departing for the airstrip. Fly southwards to the great open plains of the Maasai Mara that open out before you in a vista that seems to go on forever. This is the scene where one of the greatest wildlife spectacles on earth takes place- the Great Migration. At certain times of year, in excess of a million wildebeest, zebra and gazelles pass through this region on their endless circular trek in search of water and fresh grazing brought by the rains. Undeterred by voracious predators that follow, and treacherous river crossings teeming with enormous crocodiles, they march blindly forward, driven by an instinct older than time. Outside of the migration, a host of resident animals remain, and big cats sightings here are considered some of the best in Africa. The game drive gives you a taste of the wide-open spaces, gentle hills and epic plains of the Mara before you arrive at at your next camp. This intimate and eco-friendly camp sits with a light footprint in a grove of shady trees with sweeping views of the surrounding landscape. Although being extremely environmentally friendly, no concession to comfort and luxury is spared. Elegantly designed and gorgeously furnished with a blend of tribal fabrics and artworks mixed together with tasteful antiques, the lodge feels as much as part of the landscape as the surrounding trees that envelop it. In the company of an expert guide, you set off into the wilds to experience the magic of the Mara for yourself. The gentle hills are coated in acacia trees- the iconic, flat-topped trees that immediately bring the image of Africa to mind. The Mara River is the lifeline of the region and a source of fresh water for a multitude of animals, but it is also, however, a dangerous crossing point for the wildebeest and zebra during the migration. The masses build up along its banks, fervent with an almost palpable anxiety before the first animals take the plunge and begin to cross, spurring those behind into action. The raging torrent claims some of the weaker swimmers, and the Mara’s enormous crocodiles fight amongst themselves for their share of the bounty. The crossings are fraught with tension and drama, and few will fail to be moved by this incredible sight. If you are there outside of the migration period, you can expect to enjoy this untrammeled wilderness in almost total exclusivity- when the masses depart, they leave behind a host of resident animals that are bound to their respective territories. The lions of the Mara are famed for having large prides, and you have an excellent chance to encounter the cheetah, the most sleek and graceful of the big cats. After a day of exploration and wonder, you return to the welcoming embrace of the camp, bathed in soft lantern light, with a campfire blazing outside. Accept a cocktail and sit in its warm glow, gazing up at the glittering expanse of the Milky Way, listening to the convivial banter and tall tales of the bush from your hosts and companions. Delicious aromas from the kitchen draw you to the dining room, where an indulgent meal accompanied by delectable wines is a fitting end to a beautiful day. Slipping between your cool sheets later on, you drift off to sleep with the sounds of the African night echoing around you like a lullaby. On one morning, you have the option of taking a hot air balloon ride over the teeming plains. Drifting silently along like a bird of prey, you are treated to what must be the most spectacular view in Africa, the huge expanse of the Mara below you, and herds of animals everywhere you look. Coming back down to earth, you find a sumptuous picnic breakfast table set up for you in the shade of an acacia tree, with nothing but the wilderness around you. You are graciously offered a glass of champagne, and the bubbles in the drink quickly transport you back to the deliciously dizzying heights from which you have just returned."

Yes, there are skyscrapers and busy urban spaces, but they are combined with wandering giraffe and vast expanses of green. Nairobi has a rural location, an old colonial capital built upon rolling hills. Wildlife used to roam freely, and Nairobi National Park is now fenced to keep the herds of elephants and buffalos away from the streets. After landing at Nairobi International Airport, you will be transferred to The Emakoko Lodge, nestled in a valley that overlooks the Mbagathi River and the park's savannah.

        "title": "Chyulu Hills – Wildlife and Safari Luxury Beneath Kilimanjaro",
        "description": "Elephants roam on the lower slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro, marching across a seemingly endless sweep of rolling hills. Giraffe silently pokes their heads above acacia trees as a baboon troop raucously swings through. Buffalo congregate, dozens of them drinking from permanent waterholes. When you rise onto the higher hills, you spot the majestic backdrop, Mount Kilimanjaro's summit hanging above an evocative expanse of open plains. Remarkable wildlife stories play out here, and the cast is as eclectic as any in Africa as the primates, big mammals, curious antelope, exotic birds, and the prime animals from safari reverie come across your view. Chyulu Hills is located between Amboseli and Tsavo West National Parks in the south of Kenya, where Mount Kilimanjaro descends into rugged hills. This pristine wilderness is dappled with life, and you will quickly be engrossed. Head out on a game drive, stopping at the giraffe and elephant amidst the trees, and then pass the zebra and antelopes along the plains before winding towards the favorite hideouts of lion and leopard. Hippos grunt from the river while buffalo provide immediate impressions of scale. Such diversity makes Chyulu Hills an idyllic introduction to safari as you will not have to wait long to be seduced by the variety of wild Africa. Chyulu Hills is also surprisingly calm as birds flutter past, those with tiny wings contrast with the giant storks and circling eagles. From Ol Donyo Lodge, you will gaze down on the hills and watch the herds amble past. Spot them from the swimming pool, and then admire their transformation into silhouette form after the sun sets on the day. Monkeys often swing past your luxurious suite, jumping across the terrace with a bashful glance. Chyulu Hills does not have the same quantity of animals seen in the Masai Mara – nowhere does – but there is a charm and a serenity that eases you into the beautiful theater of Africa. You will fly to Chyulu from Nairobi Wilson Airport for three days of seamless safari. Enjoy game drives that bring personal encounters with the full suite of wildlife. Go on guided walks and get wonderfully close to impala, zebra, buffalo, and wildebeest. Get a new perspective as you drive at night, or as you visit one of the small Masai communities that share the landscape with the animals. Throughout the day, you can relax by the pool or lounge on the private terrace to watch the wildlife roam by. Everything will feel calm and easy with a combination of decadence and wilderness that effortlessly reflects Eastern Africa."

        "title": "Olare Orok Conservancy (Masai Mara) – Wild Mara Safari in a Private Concession",
        "description": "Your hour long micro flight to the Masai Mara is filled with icons, taking you past the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro before traversing the epic grass plains of the Mara. Gaze down, and you can spot the herds as massive clumps of black that indicate the tens of thousands of zebra and wildebeest. Kenya's Masai Mara and Tanzania's Serengeti are the same ecosystems, divided by a national border, an unfenced land that is home to the world's greatest concentration of mammals. Upwards of two million occupy these rich plains, mostly wildebeest, zebra, and Thomson's gazelle. Of course, such an abundance of prey maintains an abundance of predators, and there is nowhere quite like the Masai Mara for finding the big cats on the move. Touch down, and you will not escape the ungulates. While the great wildebeest migration fills the Masai Mara from July to October, these plains are packed with wildlife all year around. Wildebeest are everywhere, charging around with frenzied enthusiasm and a quirky charm. Zebra congregates and on the transfer to the camp you will find them in increasingly big numbers; ten, then a hundred, then over a thousand huddled together. Thompson's gazelle become a constant as they skip across the lush grasslands, dotting it with glimpses of orange-brown fur. Your views stretch far beyond the horizon as the open plains make it easy to spot elephant, giraffe, and buffalo in the distance. In your short journey from the airstrip to camp, you may have already seen tens of thousands of mammals. For these three days, you will stay at an exquisite camp in the Olare Orok Conservancy, in the north of the Mara. Only guests staying in the conservancy are permitted to explore it, so you will feel as if you have the great Mara plains all to yourself. Game drives start to take you closer as lionesses crouch in the grass to tracking the alert zebra. An elephant will be barely a meter from the vehicle as two nearby baboon troops clash beneath a baobab. Morning and afternoon game drives are available, and your experienced guides will know exactly where the big cats lurk. Because you are a guest at a private concession, your drivers can take you off of the main trails until you are just a few meters away. Find a cheetah skillfully hiding in the high grass before leaving behind a trail of dust as she accelerates across the plains. Hear the crunch as jaws snap into a carcass and blood is smeared across the lions' manes. Find snarling hyenas battling with bachelor male lions, the pack stealing a recent impala kill. Tension fills the plains and often you must stay patient, watching on as the cats stalk their prey. Sometimes it will be an unsuccessful hunt, but when the chase is successful, there is no better natural theater on the planet. And best of all, there are very few other tourists or vehicles in this private conservancy, so it is just you and the Masai Mara. Over these three days, the opulent camp offers an inclusive safari program. Choose from a variety of activities and enjoy your safari how you like it, whether it's a full day in the bush or a handful of shorter daily activities. The inevitable focus is the big cat encounters, and there are few better places to see them. There are also gentler charms to be found when you go on a walking safari and encounter the ungulates from close up, or by driving at night to find the cats on the move. And most importantly, the charms continue at your camp as your private terrace overlooks the plains and you can spend your evenings listening to the natural soundtrack. Often, you will open the curtains in the morning to see a dozen animals surrounding the camp."

        "description": "Begin with an early-morning start, and soon you will be soaring above the plains, looking down on the herds from a hot air balloon. Sunrise paints the sky, and the landscape stretches for eternity with swathes of green dappled with the herds in their great numbers. From the sky, you can appreciate the migratory movements and the dramatic scale of the Mara. Touch down for your champagne breakfast before a short transfer to your next property in the Mara Triangle. Stylish and spacious, this camp is all about a complete immersion in the wild as you will see and hear animals roaming past at almost every moment of your two-day stay. While this camp is not as opulent as other accommodation on this safari, the chance to be so utterly engrossed by nature's theater more than compensates. You will now be in the heart of the national reserve in the midst of the abundant plains that roll out from the Mara River. As it's a national reserve, you are only able to explore on game drives that stick to the trails. But with so many animals around, these safari outings are guaranteed to bring thrilling encounters. Stop for a picnic by the Mara River and admire the hippo pods. Watch as they are at peace for a long time, but then suddenly burst into disagreement as they follow a herd of elephants. Watch the hartebeest and kudu gallop clear of a hyena pack and then feel the goosebumps rise as a herd of bachelor buffalo stomp your way. Encounters with lions continue to happen each day, and you will never be more than a few hundreds meters away from the galloping zebra and wildebeest herds. When you are so central, sometimes you will not even require a game drive to see it all. You can just gaze out from your en-suite tent to see lions mating, zebra grazing, baboons fighting and elephants feasting, so simply relax and take it all in."

The water glistens blue and green and then blurs into wisps of white as rapids roll past islands and the odd hippo pod. On your 25-minute flight, you will soar over a game-dappled valley before you watch the Zambezi disappear into the abyss. A mile-wide sheet of water descends for over 100 meters, before rising back up in swirls of mist that fill Victoria Falls with enchantment. The helicopter flies and follows the gorge eastward before returning to the Falls to drop you down. The propellers will stop, and another sound will take over that convinces you why the locals call this Mosi oa Tunya - the smoke than thunders. You will walk alongside the raw power of the falls, wandering a trail that's dotted with baboons. Through the trees, you will get a close up of the cascade that rumbles insatiably as it soaks you to the skin. The spray comes down hard and will cause you to run across the trail. While the Victoria Falls aesthetics are inspiring, it's the power of the falls that will prove unforgettable. The spray rains down, and you cannot escape it. Much like on safari, you are given a complete immersion in everything this natural theater is about. After your guided walk along the falls, there will be an option to cross the bridge into Zimbabwe and see them from the other side.

Longer grass is best for hiding, but all three of the main cats are essentially the same color as the landscape, so they blend into their surroundings at all times of the year.

An overnight in Nairobi is usually unavoidable to make the itinerary work, but this capital city is not an inconvenient stopover. You will be greeted at Nairobi International and transferred to Hemingways, a boutique lodge in the peaceful suburb of Karen. Dependent on your arrival time, there are a handful of unique destinations to visit in Karen, including Karen Blixon's House to meet the rare Rothschild giraffe at Giraffe Manor, and the rehabilitated pachyderms at the Daphne Sheldrick Elephant Orphanage. A driver guide is at your disposal for the day."

        "title": "Ol Pejeta Conservancy – Thrilling Big Five Safari Including Majestic Rhino Sightings",
        "description": "In the midst of a dusty savannah, your guide will stop your vehicle. You will have already spotted five rhinos as these majestic creatures graze leisurely in the open before seeking solace amidst the thicker clumps of trees. But the two rhinos before you have an enhanced exclusivity as less than 20,000 rhinos remain in the wild. Only three of those are of the Northern white rhino subspecies, and as their two small horns point skyward there is an inspiring elegance that you would not expect to feel with such a bulky mammal. With small footsteps they wander past the vehicle, occasionally glimpsing up with a look of defiance. Conservationists hope that these rhinos will breed as if they do not, this subspecies will be extinct after this generation. Nestled beneath the cone of Mount Kenya, Ol Pejeta is a private conservancy with an excellent rhino conservation program making it the best destination in East Africa for seeing these majestic creatures. But the rhinos are not the only attraction, as only on a relatively small savannah ( relative being the choice word as everywhere is big in Africa), Ol Pejeta provides a home for the full Big Five. You can easily explore the conservancy on a long afternoon game drive to enjoy immediate impressions of the famous safari animals as lion, elephant, buffalo, giraffe, hippo, leopard and a scattering of antelope will walk into your view. On any safari, there will be a degree of tension as you dream of spotting the most famous animals. Starting off in Ol Pejeta enables you to encounter these mammals within the first day or two, an experience that's magnified by the uniqueness of the rhino population. You will fly here from Nairobi Wilson Airport, the first in a series of micro flights that hop across the country. Exquisite views extend from the window, and the safari starts from the airstrip, often with elephants and giraffe visible when you step off the plane. Over these two days, you can combine game drives and walking safaris, all complemented by the rustic beauty of Ol Pejeta Bush Camp, a quintessential example of luxury in the heart of the wilderness."

        "description": "From Saruni Samburu, the panoramas seem to stretch for eternity. Gaze out, and there are countless miles of the rugged African savannah, dappled with roaming herds and spectacular slabs of granite mountain. The sense of space immediately inspires with such an unbroken landscape extending before your eyes. Look closely, and this wilderness is not static. An elephant herd emerges from the trees, buffalo congregate by distant water, zebra and giraffe scatter across the plains beneath the lodge, and the red blankets worn by Samburu warriors contrast the subtle greens of the bush. While Ol Pejeta is compact, Samburu is an open realm of pure adventure, where the safari can take you in a thousand directions and no two moments are ever the same. For these two days, you will be guided by Samburu warriors, the ancient gatekeepers and protectors of this wild landscape. The opulent camp is built on the cliffs of Kalama Wildlife Conservancy, which shares an unfenced border with Samburu National Reserve. Visit the reserve on long game drives and explore this destination with few other visitors, if any. Follow the elephant prints to a waterhole and admire their resplendent journey through the savannah. Find lion pride resting on rocks, a scene from the safari imagination. Stop next to a buffalo herd and reel back at their fierce stare, and then discover a leopard whose spotted fur adorns the branches of a hidden tree. Within the Kalama Wildlife Conservancy, you will go on walking safaris with Samburu guides helping to bring an intimacy with rare and unusual species. Watch gerenuk stand on their hind legs and extend their phenomenal necks to a tree's lower branches. Stop beside the dik-dik as they graze with the impala. Find reticulated giraffe and approach to within ten meters of this rare subspecies, and then admire the equally inimitable stripes of Grevy's zebra. Somali ostrich and beisa oryx are the other rare characters that bring surprise on these plains. As always, you can personalize the safari program to your liking, both in the choice and duration of activities."

        "description": "The plane swoops into the Maasai Mara, and the grassland is speckled with zebra and wildebeest herds that are brilliantly observed from above. Touch down, and you will picked up by Maasai warrior guides in their flowing red blankets. They will lead you onto the plains, and you will pass the endless number of ungulates. Wildebeest are galloping in the morning light and make short sprints that are used as a showcase of virility. Zebra move slowly huddled together in herds of over a hundred or more than a thousand. At first, it is one black mass, but get closer, and all of the stripes distinguish themselves. Pairs rest their heads on each other's backs, and you will notice the young calves that are yet to develop the dark black stripes, and adorable eyes look back at you. Just on this quick transfer to Naboisho Camp, you will probably see many thousands of animals. The Maasai Mara is a land of abundance and nowhere in the world can rival this ecosystem for its concentration of wild mammals. For these two days, you will stay to the north in the private Mara Naboisho Conservancy, a realm that can only be accessed by those staying at one of the conservancy's camps. You will go on safari in the utmost of privacy without other tourists or vehicles to interrupt your experience. Local Maasai people share this land, and they are your guides, which adds another layer of authenticity to your safari. The Maasai will take you on exclusive walking safari, a very rare opportunity to wander onto the Maasai Mara and come close to the huge herds of wildebeest and zebra. Following their lead, you will step slowly and silently, gauging the mammals' reaction before approaching closer and closer. Exhilarating and inspiring, this is a unique angle in a world-famous destination. Game drives focus usually focus on the predator encounters, the Maasai Mara home to an exceptional profusion of the big cats. Lions lounge around, and it is hard to go an hour without seeing a pride. Leopards and cheetahs hide among the high grass, many of them nursing cubs on these quieter plains. Often, the cats head out to these northern conservancies, away from the tourists, where it is more peaceful as they bring the next spotted hunter into the world. In the heart of the conservancy, Naboisho Camp provides a true wilderness experience, along with an immersion in the world of the local Maasai. On most evenings, you will hear the calls of the wild mammals echoing across the landscape."

        "title": "Maasai Mara National Reserve – The Heart of the Famous Mara Plains",
        "description": "The Maasai Mara overflows with life throughout the year. While the reserve is famous for the great wildebeest migration from July to November, the other months offer an equally impressive safari experience. Wildebeest and zebra numbers swell during the migration, but so does the number of tourists. Visiting outside of the migration months helps to maintain privacy when you are in the Maasai Mara National Reserve. You will drive south, bumping over the plains to Rekero Camp, where the spacious tented suites offer an uninterrupted view onto wildebeest as they thunder around. The Mara River is visible from the camp and the evenings are spent watching the herds on either side of the water. During the migration, Rekero is the perfect place to sit back, relax, and wait for a dramatic wildebeest river crossing. In the national reserve, your safari itinerary is restricted to daytime game drives. You will rumble across the plains as a million mammals stretch out in all directions. One moment you will be surrounded by thousands of zebra, and then a few minutes later, the wildebeest will extend beyond what your eye can see. Thompson's gazelle continually skip past, and when you need a moment of serenity, the Mara River provides an idyllic spot for a picnic. Admire the hippos in the water as you spot the Nile crocodiles moving stealthily along the banks, and watch the herds drink nervously amidst the predatory danger. On any day in the Maasai Mara, the game drives are not about spotting the big cats as you will see them on countless occasions without even trying. Your iconic experience through the Mara is centered on finding the cats on the move, stalking their prey in the high grass or chomping through a recent kill. Hyenas will join the mix, hooting and yelping as they seek to steal a meal or pick off an ungulate too weak to continue. Even jackals search for scraps until they are boisterously scattered by the grunt of a male lion. When your vehicle stops, a lioness will come to rest in the shade that has been created. When all is silent in the trees, you will look a little closer to find a leopard neatly camouflaged. And when the wildebeest rumble past, you will spot a cheetah who had unsuccessfully tried to pounce. Such drama, such charm, and such beauty can only be the Maasai Mara."

        "description": "After your rugged safari adventure comes the pure serenity of a white beach that runs for miles and the Indian Ocean looking just like a postcard. Tucked away on Kenya's southwestern coast, the white sand is hidden by an indigenous forest filled with vervet and colobus monkeys. It will still feel as though you are in the wild, especially when the black and white colobus monkeys swing across the highest branches at Saruni Ocean Lodge. You will stay in a spacious villa with glorious ocean views, where one barefooted step will take you onto the gaping white sand. Kenya's white-sand coastline stretches for almost a thousand miles, so there is no competition for oceanfront space here. Beaches don't need to be private as they naturally become exclusive enclaves. A distant reef catches the waves, and the water will feel more like a lagoon than an ocean. At low tide, the water is nearly like a bath as it stretches out for miles with its mix of green and turquoise colors. Even at high tide, there is not a strong current, and you can float in peace. Over these three days, the serenity is the unmistakable attraction, especially after such an intrepid safari adventure. The lodge's excellent spa adds to the surrounding tranquility, fresh lobster and seafood is grilled on the beach, snorkel and diving trips head out to the reef, and traditional wooden dhows take you on sailing excursions up the coast. Like always, you will craft your own itinerary and enjoy a private piece of Kenya."

Maasai warriors lead their goats across the grasslands, carrying traditional spears and avoiding confrontations with lion pride. Their red blankets flow in the breeze as they pass huge numbers of zebra and wildebeest. Elephants also make their nomadic journeys while cheetah rises on rocks that protrude from the plains. Nothing is quiet here, and on your first journeys, it's hard to go a few minutes without an inspiring impression of old-world Africa with zebra galloping, buffalo on the march and giraffe loping past the camp. In many ways, it is all just how you had imagined. After landing at Nairobi International, you will be transferred to Nairobi Wilson Airport where a local flight will take you to the Mara North airstrip. Maasai guides will collect you at the airstrip, and your journey to your safari camp is a game drive that will quickly reveal so many of the dreamy Mara impressions. As animals fill your view, you will quickly realize that this is also a landscape of surprise. Unusual antelopes gallop past, hyena send echoed calls across the plains, and a baby elephant swings his trunk as he wanders directly past the camp. Relax in your spacious boutique tent and watch the charms unfold from your private wooden verandah."

        "description": "To understand the Mara and the Maasai, you must admire its detail. While this safari destination is famous for its scale, it's the nuances and subtleties that hold its secrets. In the light of dawn, you will begin walking across the Maasai Mara with your journey led by spear-carrying Maasai guides. For thousands of years, the tribe have lived harmoniously with the animals and have created a blueprint for ecological living. Using ancient techniques they track the presence of wild game to lead you safely across the realm of the big cats. Walking quietly, you will encounter large numbers of zebra and wildebeest and admire how the herds are filled with the emotion of individuals. Thompson's gazelle stop their skipping to return your gaze, while elephants can be spotted marching along the plains. A walking safari will force you to move slowly, and you can appreciate all of the landscape's clues. Fruit trees inhabited by rare monkeys, leopard and cheetah paw prints across your path or a walkway cleared by buffalo herds all assist in paving your way. Your Maasai guide understands this world in the same way you understand where to turn in your home city. Signposts are animal tracks, landmarks are baobab and acacia trees and the morning rush is thousands of ungulates galloping across the plains. After the morning's walking safari, you will return to camp for a relaxed lunch and some quiet hours through the heat of the day, and then a choice of walking safari or game drive in the late afternoon."

The ungulates are more than just extras, and their poignant emotion can be followed across the grasslands. Game drives explore it all, and you will not watch the theater from the best seats as you are the one on stage, overlooking it all. Gasp with surprise as a cheetah emerges from her hiding place and chases an isolated gazelle. Watch lions play out a detailed mating tale, with three males pining after a seductive lioness. Find a leopard in its hiding place and then watch it elegantly jump down from the tree. Even outside the migration, there are always thousands of wildebeest and zebra in the Mara, their antics the charming constant on your game drives. The Maasai Mara is Kenya's flagship safari destination, and your camp is ideally situated for exploring its many enchanting scenes. This boutique camp provides a luxury safari under canvas with all of the necessary comforts as you are fully enveloped by the wild. Maasai guards lead you around as wild animals regularly inhabit the grass around the unfenced camp as local Maasai techniques are used to keep the predators and larger animals to a safe distance. The camp is located on the boundary of private conservancies, areas of the Mara that are exclusive to guests staying at one of the conservancies' camps. Game drives are permitted to go off the trail here, enabling you to get as close as possible to the wildlife. Also, you can visit the main Maasai Mara National Reserve to explore the scale of the landscape.

Stripes of orange and red will reflect off of the grasslands and glisten against the kopjes (rocky outcrops). Wildebeest and zebra herds cover the Mara like a patchwork quilt as the black dots contrast against the rainbow of green. From above, you will also see the elephant and giraffe along with the Maasai as they herd their goats and cows. For over an hour your balloon will drift across the plains to offer an appreciation of the scale of it all to complement your previous experience with the detail. Touch down and a champagne breakfast is followed by a game drive back to camp. In the afternoon, you can select either a game drive or walking safari before the culture of the Maasai is further illustrated in the evening. A dining table is erected on the plains, far from the camp and engulfed by the calls of nocturnal animals. A campfire spits and crackles, the light and heat keeping away the hyenas. Maasai warriors protect the table, and they launch into a traditional mode when the dinner is complete, jumping and singing through a rendition of their dances. Throaty warbles provide the backing track as warriors jump high in the air, their blankets flowing softly in the breeze and they bounce above the plains. As they perform deep in the bush, this experience aptly connects the wildlife and cultural sides of the Maasai Mara."

Nothing is flat here as the undulating foothills of Mount Kilimanjaro stretch out beneath a volcanic dome. Maasai herders lead their cattle across this verdant land, and you will see various traditional bomas (homesteads) on the journey from the airstrip to camp. As in the Maasai Mara, local warriors will guide your experience here and teach you the ways of survival on a landscape packed with wild game. Learn how to launch spears and then watch how the locals perform Olympian-like throws. Discover the significance of color and how different Maasai blankets have different meanings. Enjoy rather uncensored accounts of a Maasai's journey from boyhood to warrior, including the encounters with wild lions. You will also enjoy an insight into how their proud culture is slowly changing, along with measures put in place to keep traditions firmly intact. The camp has a remarkable relationship with the local Maasai community, and much of it runs to a Maasai-informed ecological rhythm. You will stay in a secluded luxury tented cottage that's surrounded by exotic birdlife and wandering antelope.

Some species you will have seen before – zebra, buffalo, elephant, wildebeest and more – while others offer new safari memories, like the hartebeest and the kudu. Other than a handful of leopards and hyenas, there are not many other predators here which provide the option of a horseback safari. Ride beneath the forest canopy as baboons jump across the branches, and then gallop onto the plains and ride up to the herds of zebra and gazelle. Bush walks are equally intimate with further opportunities to trace the details of wild Kenya.

This is the home of rare and unusual species. Traveling here, you will marvel at how the scenery changes. Once on the Meru slopes, you will escape into a very intimate realm. As there are few predators, wildlife will be less skittish and more likely to get very close to you. On a walking safari, you can get even closer, especially when looking up at towers of huge giraffes. Like Lewa, the safari program will be adaptable and can be created using different activities. Long parts of each day can be spent relaxing, sitting at the lodge, and appreciating what surrounds you."

        "description": "With a short safari flight, you will swap the mountains for the plains, landing on the vast openness of the Masai Mara. Here, you will not be staying in the main national reserve. Mara Naboisho is contiguous, and the safari is far more personal then what you have experienced. Access is only permitted for guests at one of the camps in the conservancy. That means no day-trippers or overloaded budget safari vehicles. Furthermore, because guides will be able to take you off the trail, safari vehicles will be highly dispersed, and restrictions in the national reserve mean vehicles will tend to be clustered together. You will touch down, and Masai warrior guides will lead your first activity. You will venture across the plains, feeling your connection to the land. The Masai have coexisted with lions and elephants for millennia, so it will be very safe with these warriors that lead the journey. So, you will walk with the zebra amongst the wildebeest and with giraffes as silhouettes along the horizon. Later in the day, you will have your first Masai Mara game drive, the focus switching towards safe encounters with predatory cats. As this conservancy is much quieter in terms of vehicle and people traffic, it has become a haven for leopards and cheetahs to raise their cubs. Spotting them will be an unforgettable highlight of the safari."

        "title": "Mara Naboisho Conservancy – Full-Day Game Drive",
        "description": "To appreciate the Masai Mara, you must understand its scale. A hundred zebras are cute, but a herd of 10,000 is another experience entirely. Likewise, the quantity of wildebeest is astonishing, even outside the great wildebeest migration. Crossing the Mara on a full-day game drive, you will explore lush grasses that are covered in grazers. Clusters of rocks, which are known as kopjes , will be where the lions watch the plains, often in prides of 15 strong. Hippos and crocodiles will provide drama at the Mara River, and as the drive continues, it will be impossible to count the number of different species that you encounter."

        "description": "Lions will prowl the plains at dawn and will be elegant and enchanting as they move across the dew. Hippos will barrel towards the water, quarreling as they go. On a lonely acacia branch, a leopard may snooze and then open its piercing blue eyes at you. Returning from a game drive, you will find a wildebeest herd grazing around the camp. Thomson’s gazelles will mark the scenery with their numbers in the tens of thousands. There will be life everywhere, and such an abundance will help to make the safari even more escapist. When giraffes are your near neighbors, it will be easy to forget what a city or a street is like, and the more time you spend here, the more your senses will understand and appreciate the minute details."

        "description": "After a final morning game drive, you will fly from the Masai Mara to Mombasa. From here, it will be a 30-minute drive south to Diani Beach. Once the beach begins, it does not seem to end. Palms will rise the highest in the thick, overhanging forest, and monkeys will shout from the trees. The forest protects the beach, casting it adrift from everything else. So, when you walk on the beach, all you will see is the white sand and the trees along with the Indian Ocean. A reef will catch most of the waves about a mile offshore, so the tidal waters will be more like a lagoon: perfect for splashing your feet during your first day on the coast."

        "description": "For these three days, you will continue to feel cut off from the rest of the world. The thick forest will make Diani seem like an island, even if it is a 30-mile beach. With monkeys around, it can sometimes feel like you are back on safari, but mostly these three days will involve doing nothing at all. You will feel the silence, bask in the solitude, create the only footprints in the sand, and spend lazy hours gazing across the ocean. While Indian Ocean islands are small and very popular, Africa’s Indian Ocean coastline remains mostly unknown and hugely underrated. Perhaps, if it were somewhere else, this beach would be very busy. Instead, you can look around and hardly see another soul."

You will fly from Mombasa back to Nairobi where you will meet your international outbound flight."
