  "placesVisited": "",
  "generalInfo": "A short but highly rewarding safari, visiting one of the most famous safari destinations, the Masai Mara situated in South West Kenya renowned for being home to over a million wildebeest, zebra and antelope between July and October, when the migration of huge herds make a dash across the rivers. Lion, leopard, hyena and cheetah are abundant … this is the area of the Big 5 safari. <br/><br/>Travel across the ‘breadbasket’ of Kenya where acres of wheat and barley grow towards the Rift Valley lakes and Nakuru Park, home to black and white rhinos and the endangered Rothschild giraffe, together with abundance of flamingos and other waterfowl that frequent the lake. <br/><br/>Finally end your adventure with a boat trip on nearby Lake Naivasha before returning to Nairobi around lunchtime for your drop off at a city hotel or airport for your onward arrangements. If time and budget permits, why not fly on to the coast for a beach extension staying on the stunning Mombasa coastline, or even head to Zanzibar in neighbouring Tanzania for a little rest and relaxation to end this superb trip.<br/><br/>This superb 5 day/4 night trip includes airport transfers and night in Nairobi at the start, which can be omitted if not required.  A private tour can depart on any day of the week, subject to camp/lodge availability at the time of booking.<br/><br/>On a small group basis we offer 5 levels of accommodation ranging from small tented camps, up to larger lodge style properties and 3 weekly departures (Sunday, Tuesday &amp; Saturday).
