  "generalInfo": "Kenya is the birthplace of all safaris and in particular the wonderful Masai Mara Reserve is the pinnacle of wildlife watching. This trip visits one of the best known wildlife locations and also one of the least visited. From the Masai Mara and its abundance of wildlife this trip then heads to one of the last remnant stands of East African Coastal Rainforest at Arabuko Sokoke Forest National Park.<br/><br/>By visiting these two very different places you should see a varied amount of African wildlife. As with the little known and seldom visited park of Arabuko Sokoke a whole host of different species (some of which are only found in this forest) can be seen with luck. On this trip we aim to see both the common and well known Kenyan wildlife as well as the little known and more elusive species, overall giving a great overview of various species in this wonderful safari destination.<br/><br/>So join us on this two destination safari holiday to Kenya and experience the wild majesty of the Mara and Arabuko Sokoke Forest in all of their glory.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/><br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife tours in Kenya which combine various different wildlife watching activities. In order to develop our unrivalled range of combined wildlife watching holidays, our guides and colleagues around the world have spent years searching out the world’s best wildlife watching locations as well as visiting some seldom visited areas. This dedication has led us to create this comprehensive safari which visits nearly all of the important wildlife watching locations within Kenya. <br/><br/>By visiting the grassland / savanna ecosystems of Masai Mara and Sokoke you will combine the famous wildlife watching destinations with some of the lesser visited in Kenya. By visiting more than one protected area you will gain a larger appreciation for ecotourism and conservation matters, which is what makes this safari unique. <br/><br/>All of our tours are guided by our own professional zoologist (where available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) so you are sure to be in the best hands possible for the best sightings as well as a great network of local guides in East Africa who have developed a great range of wildlife watching locations where the rarest species are commonly seen. Also to try and make sure that we will see as many of the rarer and elusive animals such as Ader's duiker and golden-rumped elephant shrews in Arabuko Sokoke Forest as well as the famous Big Five in the Mara. On this trip we will spend many hours during the early morning and late afternoon on jeep safaris and also (where possible) after dark each night we will head out with high powered spotlights and start the search for nocturnal species. <br/><br/>One of the reasons why our wildlife watching holidays are unique is that our background (as a company) is from a scientific and zoological standpoint and so have a great network of colleagues and contacts all over the world who are the people on the front line in search of the best new locations for wildlife watching. All of these reasons and many more make us experts in arranging safaris and are able to tailor a safari to any location to try to find your targeted species. All you have to do is to get in touch with your budget and your group size and where you would like to go to try and find rare and elusive species.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner (where mentioned in the itinerary)). There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers and open top 4x4 vehicles for all safaris. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) will escort you on all your excursions and also very knowledgeable English speaking local guides who have decades of experience working and guiding throughout Eastern Africa. Your zoologist (- zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) escort is an expert in mammal biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge of where some of the most elusive African animals are; as well as having years of experience in bringing people out to see Africa’s big five and its hundreds of other species safely. We also include all vehicle safaris, guided walks, spotlighting drives, cultural performances, cultural activities, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the African bush or some other wildlife watching activity. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour.<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>We recommend September / October as a great time for this trip as the wildlife is abundant at this time of year and the weather is not too hot and drier than other times of year. But we can run the trip at other times of year; just note that the price quoted here is based on the low season, we can and do run this tour at other times of year, the wildebeest migration can also be included, please ask for specific quotes for different times of the year.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>•\tAll of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by a zoologist (where available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) as well as local naturalist guides, drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>•\tWe can offer you spotlighting trips around some of the places visited on the trip - where the local authorities allow after dark activities.<br/>•\tWe can also bring thermal imaging and night vision equipment as well as spotting scopes (on request) to also aid in finding the nocturnal mammals after dark and scan the horizon for harder to see species.<br/>•\tWe use camera traps (where available) which will increase the chances of getting close up pictures and movies of rare animals and other rare nocturnal wildlife.<br/>•\tExplore a huge ranger of ecosystems and protected areas across two of the world's greatest wildlife watching destinations.<br/>•\tImmerse yourself into the wonderful life of the Maasai and see how their famous coloured beads are made and also see how they and their cattle interact and live alongside the wildlife of the African plains and valleys.<br/>•\tAll the above reasons give this East African safari holiday a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. <br/>•\tWe have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Eastern Africa so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the Big Five, gorillas, chimpanzees and hundreds of other species throughout Eastern Africa. Whether it is the Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda or Rwanda or any of the other many wildlife watching locations you want to visit we can arrange it. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>•\tUnlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour travels to two locations, firstly the wonderful Masai Mara National Nature Reserve and then Arabuko Sokoke Forest National Parks (they adjoin each other) and the entrance point is Nairobi and exit point for this trip is Mombasa.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>The majority of wildlife watching is all done from the 4x4 safari vehicle so any fitness level can participate.

      "description": "Masai Mara National Reserve - Travelling & Wildlife Watching This morning after an early breakfast at the hotel your guide will begin the journey southwest towards the border with Tanzania and the vast wild plains of the Maasi Mara / Serengeti ecosystem (~5 hours). The Masai Mara National Reserve is arguably the most famous wildlife watching destination in the world and home to some of the world’s most spectacular wildlife. As with the vast majority of wildlife around the world it is the early mornings and late afternoons which are the best for wildlife watching and so as the sun begins to get lower in the sky we will have the best chance of seeing lions and leopards. The reserve should still be playing (during September / October) host to around 1.7 million blue wildebeest, 260,000 plains zebra and 470,000 Thompson’s gazelles as they are at the end of their migration and spend the dry season in the Mara. Today will be more of a brief introduction to the Mara and we will be opportunistically trying and see anything of interest at the various waterholes and known locations for targeted species. (all meals included today)"

      "description": "Masai Mara National Reserve - Wildlife Watching Over the next three full days you will explore the Masai Mara in both the mornings and afternoons. Heading out at dawn before breakfast; this is one of the best times to look for the predators such as leopards, lions and spotted hyenas. It is also the time of day that many of the animals in the reserve are most active, the reserve itself is huge with some 1,510km2 of plains there are many places we can go in search of wildlife. As well as the tail end of the Great Migration we will look for some of Africa’s most iconic species including the big five (African elephant, rhino (both black and white), lion, leopard and buffalo) as well as the cheetah. The rivers are also great places to look for wildlife too with lots of hippos and crocodiles all vying for the last remaining spots of water in the drying up rivers. The rivers also attract a huge array of bird life, more than 470 species of birds have been recorded from the Mara. During these three days we will hopefully see all of the common species and some of the more elusive ones too. (all meals included on these days)."
