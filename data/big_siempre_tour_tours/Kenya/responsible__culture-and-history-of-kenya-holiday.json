      "description": "Start your journey by arriving at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (NBO) in Nairobi. Here, your private driver will meet you and transfer you to your hotel in the heart of the city. Take time to settle in, adjust to the altitude, or enjoy a stroll through a leafy neighborhood or vibrant local café. This is your soft landing before the real adventure begins. Over the next few days, you'll explore Kenya's capital city. Step into Nairobi through the eyes of its youth with a powerful storytelling Nai Nami tour led by former street children, now community leaders. These guides don’t just show you Nairobi’s backstreets — they share how resilience, creativity, and brotherhood transformed their lives. Visit two museums that bring Kenya’s story to life: the Nairobi Museum, covering the natural and political history of the nation; and the Railway Museum, which follows the legacy of the railway that helped build it. Take time to shop at a colorful Maasai market where you'll find handcrafted beadwork, textiles, and carvings made by local artisans. -- Accommodation: 3 nights in a comfortable and centrally located hotel close to Nairobi’s cultural attractions within the city; a peaceful base."

      "description": "Board the scenic SGR Train bound for Voi — a modern train route that mirrors the colonial railway built over a century ago. Along the way, you'll hear about how this railway transformed trade, culture, and conflict across East Africa. Arriving at the edge of the Tsavo wilderness, visit a rarely explored World War I site where battles between British and German troops once raged. Learn about the African soldiers who fought, and discover preserved artifacts that reveal untold histories. Later, join a Taita family for a homestay. Help the family cook, share traditional meals, and learn about herbal medicine and local customs. You’ll also visit the community-led Taita Hills Wildlife Education Center that blends conservation and storytelling, shedding light on how people and animals coexist in this ancient land. -- Accommodation: 3 nights at a scenic safari lodge perched above the plains where wildlife roam freely below."

      "description": "Continue to Mombasa, a coastal city, where the pulse of Swahili culture invites you in. Begin with a visit to a traditional artisan workshop, where skilled craftspeople with disabilities carve wood, mold brass, or weave textiles using generational knowledge. Walk the narrow alleys of Old Town Mombasa on a guided food and history tour. Taste dishes that blend African, Arabic, and Indian influences — like bhajias, local coffee, spiced cassava, and fresh coconut water — while learning about the Omani traders and African dynasties that shaped this city’s layered identity. -- Accommodation: 2 nights at a breezy coastal hotel where you can unwind to the sound of waves."

      "description": "Head to Lamu (included), one of Kenya’s oldest and most culturally preserved coastal settlements. This car-free island feels like a step back in time, where Swahili, Arab, and Portuguese heritage intertwine. Wander the narrow alleyways of the old town with a local guide. Discover coral stone houses, centuries-old mosques, and bustling marketplaces. One evening, step aboard a traditional wooden dhow and cruise along the coast at sunset — the orange light casting reflections over still waters. -- Accommodations: 2 nights at a charming seafront guesthouse full of character, with verandas facing the Indian Ocean."
