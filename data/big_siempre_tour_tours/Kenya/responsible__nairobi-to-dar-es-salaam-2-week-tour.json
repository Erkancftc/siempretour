  "generalInfo": "On this overland tour you have the opportunity to get up close to the amazing wildlife in the Serengeti National Park and Ngorongoro Crater, home to Wildebeest, Zebra, Gazelle, Giraffes, Elephants, Rhino and big cats - the opportunity to spot wildlife on offer is second to none. As well as sight-seeing, you can chill out on the beautiful white sandy beaches of Zanzibar and explore the history and culture of Stone Town. Note: This is one of our Overland Adventures which are run using one of our specialist famous yellow overland expedition trucks. Trips are run on a participatory basis – you’ll be involved in the day to day running of the trip and have fun taking turns helping to shop and cook for the group. Expect to sometimes get dusty and dishevelled and not to be able to have hot showers every night. Groups of up to 24 people are led by our crew of two. Please note that the accommodation on this trip is predominantly camping, though there may be opportunities to upgrade this locally where rooms are available. Please see the trip inclusions for an approximate percentage of camping and room nights. Our Overland Adventures provide once in a life time experiences and whilst some safari activities may be included in the itinerary, or be available to book locally, this should not be considered a traditional safari holiday, though we consider that part of the fun!! The Serengeti safari section is run using specialist safari vehicles and guides",

      "description": "Nairobi to the Serengeti and Ngorongoro Crater We depart Nairobi early in the morning and immediately find ourselves in hot savannah grasslands with acacia trees providing the only shade. Various game, usually zebra and giraffe can be seen as we head south and cross the border into Tanzania. We spend the night at Meserani Snake Park, on the route from Arusha to the Serengeti. Over the next 3 days we head into the Serengeti and Ngorongoro Crater for a 2-night camping based safari with expert local guides and specialist 7-seat safari vehicles. These areas are one of the world's great wildlife hotspots, and you are sure to see a huge variety of different game species including Elephant, Lion, Cheetah, White Rhino, Buffalo, Hippo, Antelope, Crocodile and Pink Flamingos as well as vast herds of wildebeest roaming the plains. We'll be picked up early in the morning and driven into the Serengeti where we'll enjoy an afternoon game drive en-route to the Seronera area in the heart of the park where you will camp and stay overnight at Seronera campsite. The following morning you will have an early wake up & breakfast, before heading out to do an early morning game drive. After lunch, another game drive follows as you head towards the rim of the Ngorongoro Crater and overnight at the Simba campsite. The following morning we start early again and have a full morning exploring the Ngorongoro Crater, the largest intact caldera in the world. We will descend the forested crater rim into the central plains which teem with possibly the highest concentration of wildlife in all of Africa. Excellent sightings of a huge range of species are guaranteed. After a picnic lunch, we will then leave the park and drive back to re-join the truck. The safari is fully inclusive of all meals, transport in purpose built safari vehicles with maximum 7 people plus a driver/guide, park entrance and conservation fees to Ngorongoro Crater and the Serengeti, as well as camp fees. You will take your Oasis tent and your camping gear with you. The order of the arrangements and campsites used can change from time to time, with the same number of safaris always included."

We will stop off for a couple of nights at the village of Marangu where you have the opportunity to climb to Kilimanjaro base camp, or take a walk through the lush surroundings passing through coffee plantations, rivers, waterfalls, caves and visiting a local blacksmith. Leaving Marangu, a day's drive brings us to the coast and some welcome time on a beautiful Indian Ocean Beach at Bagamoyo before we continue to Dar Es Salaam. The truck will be based here for 4 nights while the group heads to Zanzibar."
