      "description": "Your safari experience begins at Mbulia Conservancy, a private sanctuary that borders both Tsavo East and Tsavo West National Parks. Established in 2012, the conservancy provides a safe haven for elephant while also playing a vital role in supporting local communities. By staying here, a portion of your lodge fees directly contributes to crucial conservation efforts, such as funding ranger patrols, building fences to reduce human-wildlife conflict, and protecting wildlife habitats. Beyond this, the conservancy also gives back to the surrounding communities by providing essential services, including school bursaries and water tanks. This unique partnership between conservation and community development ensures that your visit supports both wildlife preservation and local livelihoods, making it a deeply rewarding and impactful part of your safari adventure."

      "description": "Begin your day early, joining rangers on a patrol through Mbulia Conservancy. After a briefing on their conservation work, you’ll set out on foot or by vehicle to track wildlife like elephant and buffalo, learning to identify tracks and signs along the way. The rangers will share insights on protecting wildlife and how they balance the needs of local communities with conservation. You’ll visit fence lines, which help prevent crop raids, and stop at waterholes where animals gather. Throughout the patrol, the rangers share stories of their daily challenges, from poaching threats to resource shortages. By the end of the day, you’ll have gained a hands-on understanding of the vital role rangers play in protecting the ecosystem."
