      "description": "Each day at Sosian is shaped around your interests, but a sunrise ride ending with a bush brunch is a guest favourite - and well worth the early start. While the horses rest in the shade of an acacia tree, you’ll enjoy a generous, home-cooked spread in the heart of the wilderness. After a siesta back at the lodge, head out by vehicle in the late afternoon for a game drive, offering a new perspective on the landscape and its wildlife. Sosian is home to a remarkable diversity of species, including elephant, buffalo, hippo, giraffe, zebra, and a wide variety of antelope. Big cat sightings—particularly lion and leopard—are frequent, and the conservancy is one of the best places in Kenya to encounter endangered wild dogs. Riding alongside these elusive predators is a rare and unforgettable experience for those lucky enough to catch them. Overnight at Sosian Lodge. Riding time: approx. 4.5 hours"

      "description": "After a morning of lodge-based activities of your choice, set off on horseback - now well bonded with your mount - heading north across Sosian’s diverse landscapes towards your fly camp for the night. You’ll ride through varied terrain, finishing on the wide open plains typical of East Africa. Camp will be waiting with cold drinks, hot bush showers, and a three-course dinner under the stars. Horses are settled nearby on the picket line, and you’ll spend the night in simple but charming canvas tents - a wonderfully authentic experience. Overnight at Sosian Fly Camp. Riding time: approx. 4 hours"

      "description": "Wake with the sunrise and enjoy a hot cup of tea or coffee before saddling up for a ride east, stopping for a scenic breakfast under the shade of a tree. As you ride down into the valley, you’ll follow the winding path of the Ewaso Narok River, immersing yourself in the stunning landscape until you arrive at Suyian Soul - Laikipia’s premier eco-camp. After a delicious lunch, venture out on foot with an expert guide to discover the medicinal properties of local plants and how they are used by the indigenous tribes of the area. This is a rare opportunity to learn from the local community and deepen your connection with the land. Riding time: approx. 6 hours"

With plenty of opportunities for long, exhilarating canters and jumping obstacles, this is a highlight of the ride.
