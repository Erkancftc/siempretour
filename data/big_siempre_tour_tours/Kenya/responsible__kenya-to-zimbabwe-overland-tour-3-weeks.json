  "generalInfo": "On this overland tour you have the opportunity to get up close to the amazing wildlife in the Serengeti National Park, home to Zebra and the migration site of 1.5 million Wildebeest. Then, we move on to the World Heritage Site of the Ngorongoro Crater. As well as sight-seeing, you can chill out on the beautiful white sandy beaches of Zanzibar (home to turtles and dolphins) and Lake Malawi, the waters of which boast the largest number of fish species in the world. Option to finish in Lilongwe, Malawi. Note: This is one of our Overland Adventures which are run using one of our specialist famous yellow overland expedition trucks. Trips are run on a participatory basis – you’ll be involved in the day to day running of the trip and have fun taking turns helping to shop and cook for the group. Expect to sometimes get dusty and dishevelled and not to be able to have hot showers every night. Groups of up to 24 people are led by our crew of two. Please note that the accommodation on this trip is predominantly camping, though there may be opportunities to upgrade this locally where rooms are available. Please see the trip inclusions for an approximate percentage of camping and room nights. Our Overland Adventures provide once in a life time experiences and whilst some safari activities may be included in the itinerary, or be available to book locally, this should not be considered a traditional safari holiday, though we consider that part of the fun!!",

      "description": "Nairobi to Arusha and the Serengeti We depart Nairobi early in the morning and immediately find ourselves in hot savannah grasslands with acacia trees providing the only shade. Various game, usually zebra and giraffe can be seen as we head south and cross the border into Tanzania. We spend the night at Meserani Snake Park, on the route from Arusha to the Serengeti. Over the next 3 days you can take our optional Add-on to enjoy a safari into the Serengeti National Park and Ngorongoro Crater. These areas are one of the world's great wildlife hotspots, and you are sure to see a huge variety of different game species including Elephant, Lion, Cheetah, White Rhino, Buffalo, Hippo, Antelope, Crocodile and Pink Flamingos as well as vast herds of wildebeest roaming the plains. For those who don't want to add this safari experience onto the trip, there are options to visit the Snake Park, visit a local Masai Village to learn about their culture and way of life. You can also arrange day trips into the Serengeti or Ngorongoro Crater (bear in mind these will involve a lot of travel time to and from the park, and therefore much more limited time actually on safari)."

      "description": "Arusha to Marangu and Bagamoyo Beach After leaving Arusha we pass a number of small towns and villages along the way and, if the weather is clear, we may see the towering peak of Kilimanjaro. We will stop off for a couple of nights at the village of Marangu where you have the opportunity to climb to Kilimanjaro base camp, or take a walk through the lush surroundings passing through coffee plantations, rivers, waterfalls, caves and visiting a local blacksmith. Leaving Marangu, a day's drive brings us to the coast and some welcome time on a beautiful Indian Ocean Beach at Bagamoyo before we continue to Dar Es Salaam. The truck will be based here for 4 nights while the group heads to Zanzibar."

During our time there we'll visit the bustling streets of Stone Town and its famous spice markets, old slave forts and dungeons. We'll also spend 3 nights relaxing on Zanzibar's famous white beaches, where there are many options available locally to arrange scuba diving, snorkelling, and dolphin boat trips."

      "description": "Dar es Salaam to Lake Malawi After meeting the Zanzibar ferry we begin the journey through the interesting and mountainous hinterland of Tanzania. In the afternoon, after negotiating some appalling roads, we pass through the peaceful Mikumi National Park. African safari travel is synonymous with wildlife, and in this national park we usually see Elephant, Giraffe, Zebra and Antelope from the roadside. Passing through lush mountainous landscape and plantations - we enter Malawi which is dominated by its huge freshwater lake. Camping in Malawi sums up the spirit of an Africa overland trip with Oasis. We spend several days at friendly laid back campsites where most people choose to relax on the sandy beaches or try their hand at scuba diving, snorkelling or windsurfing as we follow the lakeshore south. If you are more inclined to just relax - then there is no better place than on the shores of Lake Malawi. This really is a warm friendly country - making it easy to wander off and meet up with your local hosts in one of the many villages or schools nearby. You can also view first hand the talent of the local artisans and purchase some exquisite pieces of furniture and carvings made out of ebony and mahogany."

      "description": "Through Mozambique to Harare From Lake Malawi, we continue on to the capital Lilongwe in the south of the country where you can check out the local markets. Our African Overland trip then leaves Lilongwe to cross into Mozambique and head for Zimbabwe. We follow the infamous Tete Corridor which was well known in the days of Mozambique's long running civil war as the Gun Run. Thankfully these days things are a lot different and we spend a few days passing through the country. We then enter Zimbabwe and travel via the capital, Harare. Arriving into Zimbabwe's cosmopolitan city, you can enjoy many of the sights in and around the city centre. There are many markets throughout the city from craft markets to the hectic local Mbare market, and you can also stroll through the botanical gardens, or enjoy the nightlife in one of the many bars throughout the city"
