  "generalInfo": "This exclusive flying safari showcases some of Kenya’s most famous and most diverse wilderness areas, while travelling ‘on the wing’ allows you to optimize every minute of your Kenya stay. <br/>Commencing in Amboseli, the fly-in Safari offers guaranteed sightings of large herds of elephant &amp; giraffes crossing vast open plains against the backdrop of Mount Kilimanjaro. During the dry season months from June-Nov, sightings of elephant, zebra, buffalo, giraffe and wildebeest are common. <br/><br/>Flying northwards to the unique and less populated Loisaba, an area of dry acacia scrub with stretches of open grassland and riverine forest.  This area is off the beaten safari track, but features good numbers of lion, cheetah, leopard and hyenas.  Walking safaris are permitted here. <br/><br/>Thereafter you fly south-west to the Tanzanian border where the Masai Mara and the Serengeti share the same massive eco-system, which is most famous for the annual migration of the wildebeest. Travelling on light aircraft with personalized meet and greet services throughout, this safari is light on travel-time and long on safari experiences. It also features some of Kenya’s most charmingly luxurious tented camps.",
