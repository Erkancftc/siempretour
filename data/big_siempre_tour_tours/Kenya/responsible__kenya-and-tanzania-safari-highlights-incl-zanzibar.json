Lake Nakuru lies across the equator and southward of Bogoria in the Great Rift Valley. It is known worldwide for its flamingos and is recognized as one of the world’s natural wonders. Lake Nakuru is also a rhino sanctuary, harbouring a population of over 40 black and over 60 white rhinos. The flamingos, of course, have always been the main attraction. There may be almost two million flamingos in residence at any given time, forming a stunningly beautiful deep pink band around the edge of the lakeshore.

This is one of the few places where it’s possible to see the big five during a morning game drive. Many cheetahs are so tame that they seek shelter from the hot sun under vehicles. Several climbs onto the roof to get a better view of prospective prey! For bird enthusiasts – almost 500 species have been recorded here. Among these include 16 species of eagle, many hawks, and falcons, six species of vultures, eight species of storks, four species of bustard (including the Kori bustard, the world’s heaviest flying bird), and nine species of sunbirds."

Lake Manyara National Park is small, stretching only some 330 square km (127 square miles) along the base of the escarpment, with two thirds of it’s surface taken up by shallow alkaline Lake Manyara.
