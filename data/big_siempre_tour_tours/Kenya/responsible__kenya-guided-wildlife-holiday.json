  "generalInfo": "A fabulous tour which starts off visiting the famous Masai Mara, situated in South West Kenya: renowned for being home to over a million wildebeest, zebra and antelope between July and October, when the migration of huge herds make a dash across the rivers. Predators such as lion, leopard, hyena and cheetah are abundant … this is the area of the Big 5 safari. <br/><br/>Travel across the ‘breadbasket’ of Kenya where acres of wheat and barley grow towards the Rift Valley lakes and Nakuru Park, home to black and white rhinos and the endangered Rothschild giraffe, together with abundance of flamingos and other waterfowl that frequent the lake. Continue your journey on to Amboseli park, for stunning views of Mount Kilimanjaro in neighbouring Tanzania.  The mountain is crucial in supplying the plains here with a steady flow of water for feeding the various swamps and wetlands, thus attracting a huge variety of wildlife, including elephant, zebra, buffalo, giraffe, wildebeest and various grazing antelope.<br/><br/>After 2 nights in Amboseli, you journey back to Nairobi for your drop off around lunchtime at a city hotel or airport for your onward arrangements. If time and budget permits, why not fly on to the coast for a beach extension staying on the stunning Mombasa coastline, or even head to Zanzibar in neighbouring Tanzania for a little rest and relaxation to end this superb trip.<br/><br/>This fabulous 7 day/6 night trip includes airport transfers and a night in Nairobi at the start. There are 5 levels of accommodation to choose from, ranging from small tented camps, up to larger lodge style properties, and 5 weekly departures (Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday).  This small group tour is guaranteed to depart with a minimum of 2 clients, max of 6 clients per vehicle and each passenger is guaranteed a window seat.  It can also be taken on a privately guided basis.<br/><br/>Transportation is provided in 4 x 4’s with a pop up roof and an experienced English/bilingual speaking driver/guide.",

      "description": "Following an early breakfast, depart on an exhilarating morning game drive: as the African sun rises, so the wildlife are on the move, herbivores seeking shelter from the sun and from predators. You may come across herds of elephant, zebras and antelope, or a pride of lion on the hunt. You return to the camp mid-morning. After lunch, and perhaps a siesta, set off on another game drive and visit to a Masai Village, to see how the Masai have lived for centuries, returning to your lodge as the sun sets for dinner and overnight"
