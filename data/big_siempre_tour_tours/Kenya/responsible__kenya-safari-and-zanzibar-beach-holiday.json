  "generalInfo": "This Kenya safari and Zanzibar beach holiday is a truly first-class experience: an activity-filled week in Kenya’s Masai Mara, followed by a relaxing week beside the stunning beaches and coral reefs of Zanzibar.<br/><br/>This holiday can be customised to suit your style and interests, so you’ll experience Kenya and Zanzibar in your own way. Our partner will recommend lodges and activities that not only deliver luxury but also positively impact the environment and support local communities.<br/><br/>Your first destination: the sweeping savannah of Kenya's Masai Mara. Here, safaris offer the chance to seek out the Big Five with expert guides, and you’ll stay at camps where you’ll learn about community-driven elephant and rhino conservation projects directly from those involved. Keen to watch herds of zebra from above as the sun sets over the plains? Trade the jeep for a hot-air balloon to take in a bird’s-eye view.<br/><br/>After a week of champagne breakfasts and night game drives, it’s time to swap your dusty boots for flip-flops as you head to Zanzibar. There’s no rush, with ample time set aside to delve into the history of this semi-autonomous island off the coast of Tanzania.<br/><br/>After exploring the alleys and markets of Stone Town, you’ll arrive at a beach hotel for the final days of your Kenya safari and Zanzibar beach escape – perhaps an eco-resort crafted entirely from local materials. Our partners will recommend snorkelling and scuba diving trips designed to respect the reefs – a vivid, colourful finish to your luxurious Kenya safari and Zanzibar beach adventure.",
