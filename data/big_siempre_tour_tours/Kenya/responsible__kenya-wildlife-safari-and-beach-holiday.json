  "generalInfo": "Enjoy a Kenya wildlife safari and beach holiday that explores one of the world’s most exciting wildlife watching destinations. <br/><br/>When it comes to safaris, Kenya has few equals. First stop is the Masai Mara National Reserve that every year between July and October forms the backdrop for the most thrilling wildlife spectacle on earth. The Great Migration sees vast numbers of wildebeest and other herd animals make their way to the grasslands of the Masai Mara from the Serengeti in Tanzania, a journey fraught with peril from teeming predators. Over cocktails around the campfire you can share tales of sightings with your fellow guests. Buffalos, lions and elephants roam the Masai Mara, as well as leopards, cheetahs, hippos and Nile crocodiles. For a memorable overview of this epic tapestry, why not take an optional hot air balloon flight, finishing with a champagne breakfast in the bush.<br/><br/>Leaving the Masai Mara, you’ll continue by comfortable minivan to some of Kenya’s most iconic locations for wildlife. At Lake Naivasha you’ll stroll by sunset, watching from a ridge as herds gather at the water’s edge. Meanwhile the sightings at Amboseli National Park are overlooked by Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa’s highest peak.<br/><br/>After a day in the magnificent Tsavo West National Park, which is one of the largest in the world, you’ll continue on to the coast at Kenya’s Diani Beach. Here at a waterside hotel you can shake off the dust, unwind and indulge in everything from spa treatments to scuba diving.<br/><br/>From arrival in Nairobi, you’ll be escorted throughout by an expert driver-guide. Not only can they take you to the finest viewpoints, but they also act as a bridge to connect you with local people. One of the great highlights of our Kenya wildlife safari and beach holiday is the opportunity to meet Maasai people and learn about their lives and traditions, while perhaps sharing some of your own. Our responsible partners also use modern, low carbon vehicles to get around that make little noise – less disturbance out on the plains means happier animals and, hopefully, more offspring for wildlife-watchers of the future to spy.",

      "description": "LAKE NAIVASHA After your breakfast, you will depart for Lake Naivasha to arrive in time for check in and late lunch followed by relaxation at your camp. This afternoon at an extra cost enjoy an optional boat ride to the crescent island - The Park where you walk with the Animals! There is just one “Crescent Island Game Park” and it is located on Lake Naivasha, Kenya in the Great Rift Valley. There are more animals per acre than any other Kenyan Park, hence many film companies have been to the Island to film the herds of Wildebeest, Waterbuck, Zebra and Gazelle. They are not fenced in, which allows the wildlife on the mainland to come in as they lose their habitat to development and the ever increasing population. Hippo graze all over us at night then sleep under the acacia or rest in the water by day. The giraffe who were born on the Island return to give birth; sometimes you see three generations at a time. Hyena come to hunt at night but are not resident on the island, the many python that live here can be seen occasionally with a kill. Groups of Buffalo come and go but they are always monitored. From the top of the hill there is a 360 degree view across the Lake from Longonot to Hell’s Gate to the Mau Escarpment to Eburu and onto the Aberdares. Walking along the ridge in the golden hour before sunset whilst watching the animals grazing with the water shimmering beyond is what Africa is all about. Take a boat back to the lodge."

      "description": "TSAVO WEST NATIONAL PARK Drive to Tsavo West National Park arriving in time for lunch, at just over 8,000 square miles; Tsavo is the largest national park in Kenya and one of the largest in the world. Because of its size the park was split into two, Tsavo West and Tsavo East, for easy administration. Located midway between Nairobi and the coast, the area boasts volcanic hills, four rivers, more than 60 major mammal species and 1,000 plant species. The northern part of Tsavo West is the most developed and has spectacular scenery with a rolling volcanic landscape carpeted in long grass and dense bush. Although the tall vegetation makes game spotting trickier than in some of the other parks, Tsavo West's bio-diversity is amazing. The landscape is a mixture of grassland and forest shrub vegetation. Thus driving and exploring the vegetation almost assures you close encounters with the following animals: lions, leopard, cheetah, zebras, giraffes, antelopes, kongoni, waterbuck, klipspringer, impala, gazelles, buffalos, and elephants. Apart from Tsavo’s elephant population there are many lion –some undoubtedly the descendants of the infamous and feared “Man-eaters of Tsavo” popularized in the film Ghost in the Darkness. In addition to lion the resident carnivores in Tsavo include serval, hyena, leopard, cheetah, and caracal. The landscape is dominated, especially off the hills, by the giant baobab, a tree which is reputed to live 1,000 years. Tsavo West is famous for the Mzima Springs. This star attraction is a pool of natural spring water with underwater viewing hides for observing hippos where a gushing supply of fresh, crystal clear water has created an oasis for wildlife. A specially constructed underwater observatory provides visitors with a unique view into the underwater world of Mzima. The water catchment is divided into two pools; here you can view hippos and crocodiles. The upper pool is occupied by the hippos and lower pool by the crocodiles. In your stay you will also visit the rhino sanctuary in Ngulia where most of Tsavo's surviving rhino, plus a number of re-located animals, have been moved and where a meter-high electric fence surrounds an area of 70 sq km now designated an official sanctuary for approximately 40 rhinos. The Sanctuary also offers shelter to a broad range of other threatened wildlife to include cheetahs and leopards and the rare frog (Afrixalus pygmaeus septentrionalis)."
