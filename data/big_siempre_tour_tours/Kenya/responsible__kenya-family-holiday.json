  "generalInfo": "Kenya is one of the most exciting destinations in Africa, a treasure trove of incredible wildlife, spectacular scenery and fabulous beaches. The children will adore everything about a safari, whether it is keeping their eyes peeled for 'the big five', eating dinner around a camp fire under a blanket of stars or taking a walking safari through a national park in search of some of Africa's less dangerous animals. <br/>Key to a successful family holiday in Kenya is the accommodation and this holiday uses a number of different family friendly camps which have been hand picked for their ambience and facilities. Many are in stunning locations, with great views over the surrounding landscape and a comfortable bed at the end of the night in a deluxe safari tent or chalet. Most have swimming pools so that you can relax during the heat of the day, recharging the batteries before another game drive in search of lion, zebra, elephant, rhino and more.<br/>Kenya also has some wonderful beaches with a wide variety of resorts ranging from large hotels with watersports, multiple pools and kids clubs to smaller and more informal boutique hotels with less facilities but a more personalised service. We will recommend a place that will suit your particular family.",

The views are gorgeous and the area also abounds with bird life. This morning for a change of scene and to keep the children interested, you will explore the lake by boat with excellent opportunities for spotting hippos and other animals that come to drink and wallow in the lake. In the afternoon you will take a guided nature walk through the yellow acacia forest around the lake; the children will really enjoy the chance to get up close with some of the smaller animals that are sometimes missed during game drives."
