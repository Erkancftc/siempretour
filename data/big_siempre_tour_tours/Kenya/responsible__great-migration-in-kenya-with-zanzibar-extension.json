      "description": "Lake Nakuru - Lake Naivasha. In the morning after early breakfast depart to Lake Naivasha, the only fresh water lake within Africa's Great Rift Valley, famous for its vast flocks of exotic bird life, hippos and fish. On arrival, check-in & pick up packed lunch and drive to Magahi Olorgesailie Prehistoric site and later return for dinner and overnight at Lake Naivasha Sopa Lodge. Lake Naivasha is a freshwater lake in the Kenya section of Africa’s Great Rift Valley, and is located north west of Nairobi with the town of Naivasha on its north eastern shore. At 1,890 meters (6,200 ft) above sea level, the lake is at the highest point in the Kenyan rift, and is set in a complex geological combination of volcanic rocks and sedimentary deposits from a much larger Pleistocene era lake. Because the outlet for this ancient lake, now called Njorwa Gorge, is today much higher than the lake, the original Lake Naivasha must have indeed been a truly vast expanse of water. The gorge now forms the entrance to the Hell’s Gate National Park which, for obvious reasons, today contains some spectacular examples of water and weather-worn rock formations as well as an abundance of flora and fauna to include some extremely rare, resident breeding pairs of Lammergeyers, otherwise known as Bearded vultures. Lake Naivasha is home to a wide variety of wildlife including a sizeable population of hippos which usually invade our property during their nightly forays for food. Being a freshwater lake, it also has a healthy fish population to include Black bass, Tilapia and Crayfish which attract a variety of fish-eating birds such as Long-tailed and Great Cormorants, along with Fish Eagles, Pelicans, and various types of Kingfishers. Naivasha is also a good place to see the Grey-backed fiscal. This bird replaces the Long-tailed Fiscal in areas with higher rainfall. Also to be seen in the area is the Black-lored Babbler. The Naivasha race tends to show pale tipped feathers on their heads which gives their appearance a somewhat frosty or haloed effect, and it is believed that this variation may be the result of hybridization with Northern Pied Babblers at some point in the past.

      "description": "Jambiani. Today you will visit The Jozani Natural Forest Reserve is in the central east region of Zanzibar island and is home to the rare Red Colobus Monkey. which is endemic to Zanzibar. These monkeys are full of character, and roam freely. They can also be seen at very close quarters just outside the reserve’s perimeter and are incredibly photogenic. Jozani is home to other species including Syke’s monkey’s, small buck and bushpigs. The elusive Zanzibar leopard (last sited several years ago) is said to feed here at night – perhaps this is why the reserve is only open during the day?! Jozani has an excellent nature trail. Jozani is the island’s only remaining complete forest. With evergreen thickets, mangrove boardwalks, succulents and broadleaf varieties, the forest is a botanists delight. Jozani Forest has a rich diversity of flora and fauna, with a huge variety of wildlife in and around the forest. There are large troops of the rare endemic Red Colobus Monkeys (Procolobus Kirkii) one of the most endangered monkey species in the world. Just down the road is the pioneering Zanzibar Butterfly Centre. Providing income for local farmers – who previously relied on mangoes and were over farming the forest- this small but delightful centre provides pupae to butterfly collectors globally. It generates valuable sustainable income for the farmers, and re-skills them. Next door is the Zala conservation park, a private conservation and education project, with details of the indigenous animals of the region. A small contribution is required on entrance to both places. The best times to visit are early morning or dusk, and the forest is at its most abundant between May- July and December – January.

      "description": "Stone Town. In the morning you will discover the Prison Island also known as Changuu Island, is situated only 20 minutes by boat from Stone Town. The Island was originally used as a Prison then later it was turned into a quarantine station for British Army. Although a newer prison was later built on the island it was never used. The Island has sandy beaches and is covered in lush vegetation making it prefect habit for Island and sea birds. The surrounding sea offers some lovely opportunities with beautiful coral formations. The island is perfect for nature lovers. The Islands most famous inhabitants are the giant tortoises. These endangered animals are not native to Africa but to the Seychelles and Galapagos Island. Originally the Prison Island tortoises were brought from Aldabra in the Seychelles to help increase the conservation efforts by starting a new breeding population. Tortoise populations started to decline many years ago when sailors used to collect them to carry on the ships as a fresh protein source as the tortoises could survive many weeks or months without food. Unfortunately, these days the tortoise decline is due to habitat destruction and poaching. Location: -Stone Town, Hotel: Serena Zanzibar, Room: Prime Room, Board: Breakfast"
