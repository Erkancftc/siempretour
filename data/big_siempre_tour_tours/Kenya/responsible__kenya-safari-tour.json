Set against a backdrop of the Eburru volcanic mountain range and lined by acacia trees, this lake is one of the most renowned in the area. After, you have a free day to choose from a variety of optional activities. Maybe opt for a trip to Hell's Gate National Park, which boasts beautiful cliffs, gorges, rock towers, volcanoes and a range of geothermal phenomena, or hire a bike for the day and make some of your own discoveries, venturing beyond the cacti and olive trees."

The Maasai Mara, with its sparse open plains, dramatic skies and some of the world's most tremendous animals, is the quintessential African experience. After setting up camp, sit down for some lunch. Then, it's time to jump in 4WDs and go for a game drive through the wilderness of the Mara, looking out for all your wildlife favourites form the Lion King – think wildebeest, lions, leopards, cheetahs, buffalo, elephants and rhino."
