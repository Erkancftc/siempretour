      "description": "The Inspirations of One Woman. Today we drive to a developing area in the west of Nairobi and visit a Women's Empowerment Centre, which is the first of the sustainable projects and communities that you will visit. It was started by Mary a Kenyan social worker, who developed a program to help struggling mothers undertake vocational and lifestyle training and get access to microfinance to open small businesses. The results have been phenomenal as the mothers are able to lift themselves out of poverty and transform into independent business owners and community leaders, and crucially support and keep their families together. Spend time with Mary to learn about her vision for the centre while you get the opportunity to meet some of the proud and self-sufficient women involved in the inspirational program."

      "description": "New Beginnings for Grandmas. There are many grandmother-headed households in Kenya who care for their grandchildren among other generations of their family in difficult economic circumstances. You will visit a pig farm owned by one grandmother where she proudly explains pig-husbandry and how her bio-gas system powers her home. This is the second of three sustainable projects and the initiative aims at improving the livelihoods of the grandmothers by economically empowering them through small-scale farming. Then sit down with the grandmothers while they cook traditional meals for their families and narrate their wonderful stories of life, change and progress."

      "description": "The Maasai Rites of Passage. Spend an amazing day with the warriors and women of a traditional Maasai village. It starts with a song and dance welcome where the wife of a village elder will offer to dress you in traditional Maasai shuka cloth or ‘African blanket’. Venture into the bush with her son, who will explain what it’s like being a young warrior in Maasai society, and join other men who are training for their rite of passage as they explain how they will go into the hills to complete qualifying tasks before they reach the circumcision ceremony. Take part in the challenge as they show you how to throw a spear and climb an acacia tree in lightning speed. Sit with the villagers as they share their stories of their fascinating culture with you while the women teach you how to make some traditional decorative beaded jewellery. And as the Maasai adapt to a semi nomadic future they have had to adapt some practices of land use by embracing bio gas systems. This program aims to eliminate the need to cut down precious forests for firewood for cooking and replacing it with the gas from the biogas. The gas saves the forest from being cut down and helps restore the raspatory health of the villagers caused by smoke inhalation"
