  "generalInfo": "This tour takes you on an adventure through the Serengeti, where you have the opportunity to get close to the incredible wildlife that lives there (Lions, giraffes, elephants, the list goes on). Then visit the awe inspiring Ngorongoro Crater National park - home to the world's largest inactive volcanic caldera. For those of you who dream of sea, sun, and sand, it does not get much better than chilling out on the white sandy beaches of Zanzibar and Lake Malawi. Once we reach Victoria Falls, why not try rafting the mighty Zambezi River or a Gorge Swing over it? Note: This is one of our Overland Adventures which are run using one of our specialist famous yellow overland expedition trucks. Trips are run on a participatory basis – you’ll be involved in the day to day running of the trip and have fun taking turns helping to shop and cook for the group. Expect to sometimes get dusty and dishevelled and not to be able to have hot showers every night. Groups of up to 24 people are led by our crew of two. Please note that the accommodation on this trip is predominantly camping, though there may be opportunities to upgrade this locally where rooms are available. Please see the trip inclusions for an approximate percentage of camping and room nights. Our Overland Adventures provide once in a life time experiences and whilst some safari activities may be included in the itinerary, or be available to book locally, this should not be considered a traditional safari holiday, though we consider that part of the fun!!",

      "description": "Nairobi Welcome to Nairobi! Today you. are introduced to the truck and all our camping & kitchen equipment etc., to get ready for the journey ahead.

      "description": "Nairobi to Arusha and the Serengeti We depart Nairobi early in the morning and immediately find ourselves in hot savannah grasslands with acacia trees providing the only shade. Various game, usually zebra and giraffe can be seen as we head south and cross the border into Tanzania. We spend the night at Meserani Snake Park, on the route from Arusha to the Serengeti. Over the next 3 days you can take our optional Add-on to enjoy a safari into the Serengeti National Park and Ngorongoro Crater. These areas are one of the world's great wildlife hotspots, and you are sure to see a huge variety of different game species including Elephant, Lion, Cheetah, White Rhino, Buffalo, Hippo, Antelope, Crocodile and Pink Flamingos as well as vast herds of wildebeest roaming the plains. For those who don't want to add this safari experience onto the trip, there are options to visit the Snake Park, visit a local Masai Village to learn about their culture and way of life. You can also arrange day trips into the Serengeti or Ngorongoro Crater (bear in mind these will involve a lot of travel time to and from the park, and therefore much more limited time actually on safari)."

      "description": "Arusha to Marangu and Bagamoyo Beach After leaving Arusha we pass a number of small towns and villages along the way and, if the weather is clear, we may see the towering peak of Kilimanjaro. We will stop off for a couple of nights at the village of Marangu where you have the opportunity to climb to Kilimanjaro base camp, or take a walk through the lush surroundings passing through coffee plantations, rivers, waterfalls, caves and visiting a local blacksmith. Leaving Marangu, a day's drive brings us to the coast and some welcome time on a beautiful Indian Ocean Beach at Bagamoyo before we continue to Dar Es Salaam. The truck will be based here for 4 nights while the group heads to Zanzibar."

During our time there we'll visit the bustling streets of Stone Town and its famous spice markets, old slave forts and dungeons. We'll also spend 3 nights relaxing on Zanzibar's famous white beaches, where there are many options available locally to arrange scuba diving, snorkelling, and dolphin boat trips."

      "description": "Dar es Salaam to Lake Malawi After meeting the Zanzibar ferry we begin the journey through the interesting and mountainous hinterland of Tanzania. In the afternoon, after negotiating some appalling roads, we pass through the peaceful Mikumi National Park. African safari travel is synonymous with wildlife, and in this national park we usually see Elephant, Giraffe, Zebra and Antelope from the roadside. Passing through lush mountainous landscape and plantations - we enter Malawi which is dominated by its huge freshwater lake. Camping in Malawi sums up the spirit of an Africa overland trip with Oasis. We spend several days at friendly laid back campsites where most people choose to relax on the sandy beaches or try their hand at scuba diving, snorkelling or windsurfing as we follow the lakeshore south. If you are more inclined to just relax - then there is no better place than on the shores of Lake Malawi. This really is a warm friendly country - making it easy to wander off and meet up with your local hosts in one of the many villages or schools nearby. You can also view first hand the talent of the local artisans and purchase some exquisite pieces of furniture and carvings made out of ebony and mahogany."

      "description": "Through Mozambique to Harare From Lake Malawi, we continue on to the capital Lilongwe in the south of the country where you can check out the local markets. Our African Overland trip then leaves Lilongwe to cross into Mozambique and head for Zimbabwe. We follow the infamous Tete Corridor which was well known in the days of Mozambique's long running civil war as the Gun Run. Thankfully these days things are a lot different and we spend a few days passing through the country. We then enter Zimbabwe and travel via the capital, Harare. Arriving into Zimbabwe's cosmopolitan city, you can enjoy many of the sights in and around the city centre. There are many markets throughout the city from craft markets to the hectic local Mbare market, and you can also stroll through the botanical gardens, or enjoy the nightlife in one of the many bars throughout the city."

Here you have the opportunity to take a hike through the mountain wilderness area, or hike to the nearby Bridal Veil Falls, or simply enjoy the stunning surroundings from this sleepy village whilst strolling through the village market. Our next stop is then at the Great Zimbabwe Ruins, the site of what was once the greatest medieval city in Sub Saharan Africa and where the name Zimbabwe is derived, literally meaning house of stone."

      "description": "Great Zimbabwe to Bulawayo We drive across Mashonaland to Gweru, where we visit a privately run horse and game ranch where one of the various options available is to game viewing on horseback. After a couple of enjoyable nights here, we move on and enter Matabeleland and the town of Bulawayo. You have the option of an exciting day's venture from here into Matobo National Park with a local safari company. You will have a unique chance to get out on foot to try and spot the elusive Black Rhino - amongst hordes of other game. This is one of the few places in Africa that this type of safari is available. There is also the opportunity to visit Cecil Rhodes' grave and Ancient Rock Paintings."

      "description": "Bulawayo Victoria Falls If we can, then from Bulawayo we like to follow a journey that is steeped in history and say goodbye to the truck for a night and take the overnight train from Bulawayo to the mighty Victoria Falls. However, in recent years the service has been unreliable at best, and not suitable for us to use. Your crew will update you whether we think we can include this on your trip. If we can, then expect basic conditions, but the views and experience of looking out the window and watching the world go by more than make up for it. Alternatively we will drive from Bulawayo to Victoria Falls, arriving late in the afternoon. For some, Mosi oa Tunya - The Smoke That Thunders, is the highlight of their African safari. From the main road, in the bush 20kms away, a cloud of mist and spray can be seen against the blue sky. As you get closer, a low rumble like thunder can be heard. When you arrive it is a surprise to discover the enormity of Victoria Falls. One mile wide and hurling over 5 million cubic metres of water a minute into the Zambezi Gorge this sight is breath taking at any time of year. The water levels vary hugely depending on the time of year, but it is always an amazing spectacle - in fact it can actually be better when there is a little less water, as there is less spray blocking the falls from view. The Gorge below the falls is also the setting for one of the most adrenaline fuelled grade 5 white water rafting rivers in the world. But there is also plenty to do here for the less active too. Why not take a day trip over the Victoria Falls bridge to view the falls from Zambia, take the Flight of Angels - a great way to get a birds eye view of the falls in a microlight or helicopter, enjoy a civilised afternoon tea at the Victoria Falls Hotel, join a Sunset Boat Cruise or a more sedate Canoe trip. For those who want to make the most of the adrenaline activities, get your fix with the Gorge Swing, Abseil or 'enjoy' one of the highest commercial Bungee Jumps in the world. Your trip ends after breakfast on DAY 34 and you can fly home anytime today"
