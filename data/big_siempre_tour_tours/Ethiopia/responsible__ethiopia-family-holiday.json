They are 'the last of the great civilizations of antiquity to be revealed to modern knowledge' according to Dr Neville Chittik. Aksum's astonishing Stelae strike you for their huge size, their incredible, almost pristine preservation and their curiously modern look. Sculpted from single pieces of granite to look like multistoried buildings. Though the stone is famously hard, Aksum's masons worked it superbly often following a set design."
