      "description": "After breakfast, visit Punakha Dzong, the “Palace of Great Happiness” built in 1637 by the Zhabdrung, the ‘Unifier of Bhutan’. It is situated at the confluence of the Pho Chu and Mo Chu (Male and Female rivers) and is the winter headquarters of the Je Khenpo and hundreds of monks who move en masse from Thimphu to this warmer location. The three-story main temple of the Punakha Dzong is a breathtaking example of traditional architecture with four intricately embossed entrance pillars crafted from cypress and decorated in gold and silver. It was here in 1907 that Bhutan’s first king was crowned. Afterward, transfer to Phobjikha Valley (5.5-6 hours). The drive takes you through the countryside and affords a glimpse of everyday life in this most remote Himalayan kingdom. Continue through the market town of Wangduephodrang, and up winding mountain roads through mixed forests and over high passes before descending into the wide and picturesque Phobjikha Valley. Phobjikha is one of Bhutan’s few glacial valleys, and chosen winter home of black-necked cranes (November – March) migrating from the Tibetan plateau. Dinner, and overnight at Gangtey Lodge."

      "description": "You will drive to Ramthangkha after breakfast, where your guide will get your entry ticket. For physically healthy individuals, the Taktsang hike takes around two hours each way. For those who have trouble walking, there is a pony ride to the halfway point, which costs about $35 one way or you can choose to walk which will take you around seven hours altogether. Remember it is worth it. The view of Taktsang Monastery built on a sheer cliff face 900 meters above the valley floor is a spectacular sight. The Monastery is also an important pilgrim site for the Buddhists. The great Guru Rinpoche is said to have flown here on the back of a tigress (Yeshey Tshogyal ) when he brought the teachings of the Buddhist Dharma to Bhutan in the 8th Century. He then mediated in a cave there for 3 years, 3 months, 3 weeks, and 3 days where the monastery was later built. Refreshments and lunch will be arranged in the cafeteria. If time permits, you can visit 7th Century Kyichu Lhakhang, one of the 108 temples constructed by the Tibetan king Songtsen Gampo. Dinner and overnight at Le Méridien Paro."
