  "generalInfo": "This tailor-made activity holiday in Bhutan perfectly blends cultural discovery with adventure, offering moderate hill hikes, scenic cycling routes, and exhilarating rafting—all set against the breathtaking landscapes and rich spiritual heritage of the Himalayan Kingdom.<br/><br/>Your journey will take you through lush green valleys, golden paddy fields, and dense forests that support the lives of many Bhutanese communities. Knowledgeable and friendly local guides will ensure every step of your trip is smooth and meaningful, deepening your understanding of the region and its people.<br/><br/>Cycling in the Himalayas can be a gentle challenge, but the routes are carefully chosen for travelers with reasonable fitness. Gradual climbs and manageable distances make each ride both enjoyable and rewarding—after all, this is your holiday!<br/><br/>Hiking in Bhutan is equally memorable, with trails leading to iconic sites such as Taksang (Tiger’s Nest) Monastery and Lungchu Zeka Monastery. These walks offer spectacular views and the chance to visit some of the Kingdom’s most sacred shrines. The climb to Tiger’s Nest is a highlight for many, as is exploring Bumthang, the spiritual heart of Bhutan, with its serene valleys, ancient temples, and centuries-old monasteries.<br/><br/>Midway through your adventure, you’ll cross the striking suspension bridge in Punakha Valley and enjoy a morning of river rafting. While some sections are a bit more energetic, much of the experience allows for gentle paddling, giving you time to soak in the scenery. Afterward, a catered riverside lunch awaits on a sandbar, followed by a visit to Punakha Dzong, one of Bhutan’s most magnificent fortified monasteries.<br/><br/>What truly sets this journey apart is the quiet serenity of Bhutan’s trails. Thanks to the Kingdom’s sustainable tourism policies, many destinations feel untouched and peaceful. Your local guides will help you connect with the villages, providing insight into life in these remote, tranquil communities.",
