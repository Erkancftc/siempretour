  "generalInfo": "Spiritual Bhutan is well known for its festivals – known as tshechus – which take place around the year. People flock to celebrate with their families in a fun atmosphere of music, dancing, and performances in spectacular costumes and masks – and you can be there too! <br/><br/>On this Thimphu Tshechu Festival holiday you’ll head to Thimpu, Gangtey, Punakha and then back to Paro and the Tiger’s Nest Monastery. You'll take in two special festivals in Thimpu and Gangtey, as well as monasteries and temples, nature hikes and plenty of incredible scenery.<br/><br/>Bhutan’s tshechus celebrate Guru Rinpoche, the saint who brought Buddhism to the country. The largest religious festival in Bhutan occurs in its capital and only city, Thimphu and draws a huge crowd. It is also a social event, where people are off work, and are able to gather with friends and family. For tourists, the celebratory atmosphere is infectious. <br/><br/>Next it’s on to Gangtey for a smaller, more rural experience in the Phobkikha Valley. The valley is also famous for being the winter home of black neck cranes – spot these and other birds on a two-hour nature walk whilst you’re in the area. <br/><br/>After time at each festival you will take part in other activities designed to immerse you in Bhutanese culture – whether that’s hiking to the iconic Tiger’s Nest Monastery, raising prayer flags at the Dochula Pass, or enjoying a traditional hot stone bath. This, alongside stays in locally-owned accommodation, a homestay, and the assistance of a local guide, will give you an authentic stay that stays with you long after the festivities have finished.  <br/>",

      "description": "Arrival at Paro – Thimphu (1 hour drive): Fly into the only international airport of the country at Paro International Airport in the beautiful Paro Valley. As the plane takes a dramatic sweep into the valley, you will see the inner Himalayan mountainsides with traditional Bhutanese house perched in the mountains and snowcapped peaks of the Northern Himalayas towards the Tibetan border. You will be met in Paro at the airport with a traditional sign of welcome, a white silk scarf with the eight lucky & auspicious signs embossed in it. Bhutanese culture revers symbolisms, so we believe that you must start our journey in Bhutan with an auspicious beginning. We will then drive (1 hour) to Thimphu (2300m), the capital of Bhutan. In Thimphu, we will head to the Buddha Dordenma Statue (Buddha Point) the largest seated Buddha statue in the world with a height of 51.5 meters, made of bronze and gilded in gold. The statue itself is the home for over 100,000 smaller statues of Buddha. You will be in awe at the size of the statue, as well as the artistry that it took to create it. We will then visit the Memorial Chorten (Stupa) at the center of the capital, dedicated in memory of His Majesty the Third King of Bhutan, Jigme Dorji Wangchuck. The stupa attracts many elderly Bhutanese daily for prayers, and is a window into the daily lives of Buddhist Bhutanese."

      "description": "Thimphu: The Thimphu Tshechu Festival (2nd to 4thOctober 2025) is one of the grandest of Bhutan’s festivals and attracts the largest audience. Featuring dances performed by trained monks and laymen in amazing masks and costumes, Tsechus (festivals) are one of the best ways to experience the ancient living culture of Bhutan. A Tsechu is a Buddhist festival in honor of Guru Rimpoche, the saint who brought Buddhism to Bhutan. The Thimphu Tsechu was established by the 4th Temporal Ruler, Tenzing Rabgye (1638-1696) in 1670. This festival also provides a great opportunity to witness locals gathered in their finest Gho’s and Kira’s in a celebration of their culture and faith.

In the late afternoon, we shall embark on a short hike to the Wangditse monastery. Wangditse hike is one of the easiest hikes in Thimphu. The hike takes less than one hour each way and is mostly a flat trail. The trail takes into trees of oak, pine, and rhododendron which accompany you throughout the hike while occasionally opening to the view of the Buddha Dordenma statue, Tashichoe Dzong and Thimphu valley."
