      "title": "Paro – First Impressions",
      "description": "Today’s flight into Paro will be spectacular, and you will follow a path through the Himalayan peaks. Soon, you will touch down, and your private transfer will greet and transfer you to your luxurious accommodation in the heart of Paro. Your first afternoon in Bhutan will be a feast for the senses. Almost all of the locals will be in traditional dress: the women in colorful ankle-length dresses and contrasting jackets and the men in knee-length robes with silk scarves. The streets are almost devoid of vehicle traffic, especially when you wander down the lanes of cobblestone. In the distance, you can spot temples peeking out from mountain slopes."

      "title": "Paro – Tiger’s Nest Monastery",
      "description": "Tiger’s Nest Monastery is the best-known image of Bhutan. The monastery is far more spectacular than the photos suggest because it is nestled high in the valley and cut into the rock. The only way to reach the locale is on foot or by pony. For the Bhutanese, it is the holiest site in the country, and you will be among the line of pilgrims who make their journey to this holy sanctuary. The hike is not overly challenging, but it can feel long. Access to the monastery has only just been made possible for foreign visitors, and there is a genuine sense of spirituality that will accompany your time in the sanctuary."

      "title": "Thimphu – Artisans and Locals",
      "description": "Thimphu is relatively more westernized than anywhere else in the country, and it is a perfect place to be immersed in the culture. The best way to explore is to spend time with the locals, which is something that is at the heart of all experiences in Thimphu. You will arrive in the morning and try out the national sport of archery before watching the locals show you how it is done. You will then visit a series of artisans who hail from all over Bhutan. After a traditional lunch at a small café, you will visit a monastery and meet those who live there. A surprising abundance of people can speak English in Bhutan, so you will not always need a guide to translate."

      "dayNumber": "4",
      "title": "Punakha Valley – The Himalayas",
      "description": "A majestic mountain journey will lead you to Punakha. Traveling by land is slow in Bhutan, and despite the country’s small size, it takes three days to travel from the eastern border to the western by road. Thimphu to Punakha is probably the best road in Bhutan, but it is far from a Western highway. You will enjoy venturing slowly and feasting your eyes on the Himalayan peaks. Today, you will leave your vehicle at the trailhead to visit Namgyal Khamsum Yulley Temple. Less than two decades old, the temple is a modern interpretation of tradition. You will descend through the villages and farmland, sharing greetings en route to the second most famous of all Bhutan’s highlights, Punakha Dzong."

      "title": "Punakha Valley – Bhutan’s Spiritual Capital",
      "description": "A day in Punakha will emphasize the need to explore slowly. There is the dzong with a string of small temples and monasteries that all exude a calming aura. Small stores wind around the streets between the market and village. With a full day, you will get to know how this spiritual city ticks. You will be able to recognize ministers and judges due to their orange and green scarves. You can also sit and drink a thick butter tea at a small cafe. You will also have the opportunity to venture to the surrounding valley, and your guide can lead you to a village that is mostly hidden by rice paddies."

      "title": "Punakha Valley – Black Mountains Day Trip",
      "description": "The Black Mountains are so wild and isolated that Himalayan black bears and snow leopards find a haven here. Other rare wildlife like black-necked cranes arrives during the winter months. A walk of pilgrimage will lead you through the forest to a small temple, where the head lama will welcome you with trademark serenity. At the Crane Center, you will get a first-hand perspective of the beautiful birds that journey here. It will be a three-hour journey to Phobjikha and the national park, which is another sublime journey through the open Himalayan landscapes. If you leave early, you can spend most of the day exploring."

      "title": "Paro – Across the Mountains",
      "description": "Wangdiphodrang is a lively place. It is a market town at a convenient crossroads and the meeting place for people who come from near and far. Some market stalls are squeezed into a tight space with goods that are spilling off tables. Other locals set up space on the floor with a pile of goods next to their cross-legged contemplation. Even after a week in Bhutan, this will still be another feast for the senses. It will also be a great stop on the way back to Paro through the mountains. You will make your way back slowly with opportunities for short hikes and village stops."

      "title": "Paro – Departure",
      "description": "As tourism grows in Bhutan, the government has opened new regions and towns to foreign visitors. One of these is Haa, which is a sparsely populated region in the far west of the country. You can spend your morning here and can expect a few intrigued stares because the people in Haa are as interested in you as you are in them. This new destination is a great place to end a Bhutan trip. You will then return to Paro to connect with your departure."
