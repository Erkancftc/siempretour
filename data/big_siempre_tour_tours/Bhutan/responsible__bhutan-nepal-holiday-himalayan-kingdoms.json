(Note - the Kathmandu-Paro-Kathmandu flights are not included in the tour price but may be purchased separately or added as an extra option. Please see the Options section and Tour Notes for more details). Paro airport provides a first taste of Bhutanese architecture and is surely one of the world's most beautiful.

It was later converted into the National Museum of the Kingdom and boasts a wide range of antique thangkha paintings, textiles, weapons & armour, household objects and natural and historic artifacts. You'll then walk downhill from the museum to Rinpung Dzong or the 'fortress of the heap of jewels' which is the seat of the district administration and the residence of the monastic school. The dzong is famous for its wall murals depicting Buddhist parables, symbols and the lives of prominent saints.

      "description": "Valley walk, Punakha Dzong, drive to Gangtey You will enjoy an early breakfast this morning, before getting back on the road for a drive through the valley to the north of Punakha. Here, you can experience a morning stroll to Khamsum Yuelley Namgyel Chorten. This chorten is a striking sight, situated on a ridge above the Punakha Valley. This unique sanctuary was inspired by the Buddhist treasure teachings of Thragthung Dudjom Lingpa. It is a sanctified religious retreat that aims to ward off negative forces and encourage peace and stability. This shrine also represents the positive forces that surpass the negative influences in the world. According to Lamas, this chorten is the epitome of Buddhism and promotes health and happiness for the people. When you have finished examining the temple, you can stroll through fields of chili, bean and wheat crops before reaching a riverbank. If you have the energy, you can continue to walk along the river to Punakha. Those who want to rest can be driven there. Upon arriving in Punakha, you will be guided to the charming Punakha Dzong, situated in the middle of the rivers of Phochu and Mochu.

      "description": "Phobjikha Valley walk, Gangtey The tour will leave from the Punakha Valley and return back onto the mountain roads through oak and rhododendron forests into the Phobjikha Valley (approx. 70km, 3hrs). These dense forests are also the winter roosting grounds for the endangered and famous black-necked crane. These cranes make an extraordinary high-altitude migration here from the Central Asiatic plateau to avoid the harsh winters in October. The arrival of the cranes is celebrated with a festival on 12 November, followed by the king's birthday. The birds depart from Tibet in February-March so the best months to view them are November, December and January. Your guide will take you into the valley so you can find some of these cranes, if it is the right time of year. That day you will also visit the Nyingmapa Monastery in the kingdom of Gangtey Gompa. | OVERNIGHT: Gangtey hotel | MEALS: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner"

      "description": "Taktshang (Tiger's Nest) walk, Drukgyel Dzong Breakfast will be eaten early this morning, as the tour will drive to the base of the Taktshang cliff. You will set off from here on a 2-3 hour hike, up to the monastery, set on a steep 800-rock face. Taktshang is one of Bhutan's most famous sites and means 'Tiger's Nest'. It is believed that Guru Padmasambhava flew to this location on the back of a tigress in the 8th century. The guru is thought to have meditated here, which makes this temple a sacred pilgrimage destination for Buddhists. You can have a break and tuck into your lunch at the Taktshang cafeteria positioned two thirds of the way up the mountain. In total this trip takes 4-5 hours and if you are tired, you can ride a pony up the incline. In the afternoon, the tour will visit the Drukgyel Dzong, the fort of victorious Drukpas. This fort was gutted by a fire but is still renowned for being the stand from which many Tibetan invasions were repulsed. If you look to the north you can see the dome of the sacred Mount Chomolhari or the 'mountain of the goddess'. The tour will also look at one of the oldest landmarks in Bhutan - the 7th century Kyichu Lhakhang, which was one of the 108 temples built in the Himalayas by King Songtsen Gembo. This sublime refuge is seen as one of the holiest shrines in Bhutan that exemplifies the arrival of Buddhism here. In the evening, you can take to the streets of Paro for a final stroll or relax back at the hotel in a hot stone bath. | OVERNIGHT: Paro hotel | MEALS: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner"

(Note - flight not included in the tour price). Formerly a capital of the Kathmandu Valley, the pedestrianised centre of Bhaktapur a World Heritage Centre and is full of squares and temples with some stunning wooden architecture.

You have a guided tour here, as well as time to explore the narrow winding streets which bustle with life. In the afternoon we make a short drive uphill to the village of Nagarkot, which sits on a ridge at the north-eastern edge of the Kathmandu Valley. Accepted as probably the best of the valley's mountain views, from the village lodges and hotels you can see all the way from Kanchenjunga in the east, past the tiny (from here!) peak of Mt. Everest, to Dhaulgiri in the west. | OVERNIGHT: Nagarkot hotel | MEALS: Breakfast | EXTRAS: Kathmandu-Paro-Kathmandu flights"
