As you will see at sacred sites such as Chimme Lhakhang and Gangtey Gompa Monasteries or Chendebji chorten. And then, last but not least, Jambay lhakhang where the Festival takes place and which, it is said, is one of 108 temples built by Tibetan King Songtsen Gampo in the 7th century on one single day.  It is also believed that this is the birthplace of Bhutanese Buddhism. It certainly is a spectacular place to immerse yourself in its unique culture, and the most perfect highlight to this fascinating cultural tour.  <br/><br/><br/>",

      "description": "Welcome to Bhutan! On arrival you meet your Bhutanese guide and driver who will greet you with a BIG Kuzu Zangpola (Welcome). We drive to Thimphu (approx 1 hr drive) and check into the hotel overlooking the Thimphu valley. This is the first proper glimpse of Bhutan but you should be aware that this is the most developed urban center in Bhutan, very unique from any capital of the world. Home to the government, the royal family and the head offices of all international organization Thimphu has changed radically in the last decade. After a quick freshen up we begin the Bhutan Experience by visiting the Buddha Dordenma, the largest sitting statue of Buddha in the World. This statue sits atop a hill protectively overlooking the Thimphu valley below. In the evening, our guide will conduct a thorough tour briefing outlining the trip ahead. Overnight: Hotel Riverview or similar"

      "description": "We have a day to explore the nation's capital of Thimphu and its plethora of historical museums and sites. Today's activities include visiting the Textile Museum, which showcases the renowned traditional textile arts of Bhutan and displays the royal robes donned by the King and Queen of Bhutan worn at the Royal Wedding in 2012. We also visit a folk heritage museum - offering an insight into the village life of a local farmer, the famed Thimphu Dzong, a magnificent structure that seats the Government and the office of his Majesty. Take some time to admire the architecture of this and other Dzongs as they were constructed without a single nail. Thimphu Dzong is the summer home of the central monk; during winter he moves to Punakha. The tour continues at a painting school that teaches students the thirteen traditional arts and crafts of Bhutan. Overnight: Hotel Riverview or similar"

      "description": "This morning we head off over the Dochu La pass at 3100m feet towards Punakha, where it is relatively warmer than Paro and Thimphu. Punakha is the ancient capital of Bhutan and is dominated by the impressive Punakha Dzong, which sits at the confluence of the Mo (female) and Po (male) rivers. The Central Monk Body moves from Thimphu to Punakha every winter as the lower elevation is more temperate. Enroute we visit the Chimi Lhakhang (temple) dedicated to the Divine Mad Monk - Drukpa Kuenley, and learn how this Buddhist monk was able to teach people the words of the Buddha through very peculiar and unconventional methods of teaching. Overnight: Khuru Resort or similar"

      "description": "Today’s day begins with a short hike through rice fields, chillies and cabbage, to the Khamsum Yulley Namgyal Chorten, a monument dedicated to the King of Bhutan, that offers commanding views of the valley floor and up to the high mountains of Gasa. This beautiful trek is about two hours return from the road. Once at the Chorten (stupa) you will be treated with spectacular views of the whole Punakha valley. We will plan a Picnic lunch today in an exclusive campsite by the riverside of Mo Chhu. Our next stop will be the magnificent Punakha Dzong built on the confluence of the Pho and Mo Chhu (male and female) rivers. The Dzong is the winter residence of the monastic order’s head, with numerous altar rooms and grand courtyards to be explored. Built by Zhabdrung in 1637, Punakha Dzong is one of the most impressive architectural monuments in the country. It houses some of the country’s most sacred relics, including Zhabdrung’s preserved remains. Bhutan has many trekking levels available, please speak with your guide for options.

      "description": "In the morning, we continue our journey to Trongsa. Here lies the largest fortress in the kingdom, the Trongsa Dzong, powerhouse of ancient Bhutan. Strategically located on the east-west mule tracks, the governors of Trongsa were the most powerful leaders in the medieval age that gave birth to the monarchial systems in Bhutan, which shaped the history of the country. We visit the precious watch tower known as the Ta Dzong, now converted into a museum. We venture inside to find a small chapel dedicated to King Gesar, an epic hero of Tibetan history, as well as an excellent museum dedicated to the monarchs of Bhutan.

      "description": "Early morning drive to Bumthang and onwards to Tang Valley - the most remote of Bumthang's valleys. Terton Pema Lingpa, the famous saint responsible for discovering many treasures as prophesied by Guru Rinpoche, was born in this valley. Tang Valley villagers herd sheep and yaks, at higher elevation. Tang Valley combines immense natural beauty with the mystique of playing host to the greatest collection of eminent spiritual practitioners. One such person, Longchen Rabjam and his descendants have built the Ogyenchholing Museum, which was restored in the 19th century. Today it houses the Family Museum, a place that will transport visitors to another world and time. The museum houses exhibits recreated to capture the ambience of the lifestyle of the Trongsa Penlop (Governor), Tshokye Dorji and his household. It also serves as a retreat for those engaged in religious history. Bhutan's history truly unfolds here. Afterwards, we drive to Pema Choling Nunnery where nuns undergo several years of religious studies and live celibate lives. We may be lucky enough to meet and interact with some of the nuns, or even sit in the shrine and hear them chant mantras with bells and drums. Towards the late afternoon we drive to Bumthang for the night. Overnight: Rinchenling Lodge or similar"

      "description": "This morning we drive to the festival ground of the 7th Century Jambay monastery dedicated to the future Buddha. The festival begins today with the ground purification dance and welcome folk dances by the women of Bumthang. The crowd will slowly pour in as the festival gains momentum. There are different local, national and Tibetan style masked and folk dances that will captivate your attention. Festivals offers an opportunity to immerse yourself into the spirituality of the atmosphere. Traditional Buddhist festivals in Bhutan are colourful affairs with dancers in elaborate traditional costumes and masks. The dances are designed to bring blessings to the spectators, instruct onlookers as to the Buddha’s teachings, and protect the monastery and the Kingdom from bad luck. Witnessing this important festival offers a rare insight into Buddhist culture. One highlight worthy of mentioning is the midnight naked men dance, Tercham, that requires you to be at the chilly grounds at the stroke of midnight. We recommend you wear warm clothes and many travellers have highlighted this event as something very unique. Enjoy the Tshechu. In the evening as the Tshechus nears the end, hike to Kurjey Lhakhang dedicated to one of the most important and notable saints, Guru Rinpoche, whose legacy also includes the famous Tiger’s Nest in Paro. Overnight: Rinchenling Lodge or similar"

      "description": "Today we will depart for the stunning Phobjikha Valley, and enroute we will stop at wonderful locations such as the Chendiji Stupa. We'll continue into the Gangtey Valley, home to Bhutan's black-necked cranes, now an endangered species. Conservation efforts by Bhutan and the World Wildlife Fund have been able to create a safe haven for these stunningly beautiful birds, which flock to the region's marshy wetlands in winter for roosting (mid-October to early March). If luck favours us, we'll have the chance to see a few of these flocks during our time in the valley. We plan to arrive by midday, and you'll have a chance to relax and enjoy a home-cooked picnic lunch. Afterwards, we'll reconvene for a visit to the Crane Centre to learn about the rare birds and efforts toward protection and community development. We'll get to meet their crane-in-resident, an injured bird that the centre cares for year-round. In the evening we’ll head out for a stroll, observing the beauty of the glacial valley and its communities, and stopping to admire the cranes, if they've made their winter arrival. You'll encounter local students on these walks eager to practise their English, an official language of education in Bhutan, along with the national language, Dzongkha. We'll have dinner together and spend the night at our hotel in Gangtey. Overnight: Hotel Dewachen or similar"

      "description": "This morning we embark on a short hike to Gangteng Gompa, a 17th century monastery overlooking the lush Phobjikha hills and wetland. Pema Lingpa, the famous 14th century blacksmith and Terton (treasure finder) from central Bhutan, chose this site for the Gompa; its head lama is an incarnation of this legendary lama. Within the complex you’ll find a central monastery, meditation hall, school, monks’ quarters, and a courtyard. Here we will meet a senior resident monk who has lived his life under strict vows of celibacy, discipline and meditation that are minimum requirements of being the teacher for the young novice monks. We can attend a prayer ceremony here dedicated to our loved ones, and for world peace and all sentient beings. From the temple we’ll hike to the surrounding villages, through forests and farmlands, basking in alpine scenery that is typical of Bhutan’s high country. After lunch, we will visit a farmhouse and interact with a farmer and his family. While you will notice that modern amenities such as electricity and road have improved the life and sanitation of the houses, the people still live the same as their forefathers, working on the fields and harvesting rice. The family will showcase to us how the famous Bhutanese dish, ema datse, the chili and cheese curry is prepared and get a chance to taste locally brewed ara (moonshine drink) made from organic grains grown from their fields.

      "description": "This morning embark on the challenging but very achievable walk to Taktsang Gonpa, one of the most iconic and venerated Buddhist monuments in the Himalayas. Set into a cliff face 800m (2600 ft.) above Paro, the Tiger’s Nest, as it's known, takes its name from a mythical journey made by Lord Padmasambhava (Guru Rinpoche), who flew there on a tigress’ back in order to meditate for three months and convert the valley to Buddhism. Since then, many of Buddhism's most influential figures have visited. The main building of Taktsang was badly damaged in a fire, and a major restoration ended in 2003. The view from the teahouse is well worth the climb, and it is possible to hike all the way to the Goempa for a further 45 minutes and visit the various shrines in the building. Towards late afternoon, we will visit the 7th Century wish fulfilling Kyichu temple, built at the same time as the Jambay Lhakhang in Bumthang where we witnessed the festival. We stroll the market place and the different handicraft shops to shop for souvenirs and gifts for loved ones back home. Finally, soak in the luxury of the hotel and enjoy a farewell dinner with our guide and driver."
