  "generalInfo": "Bhutan boasts a picturesque landscape of high mountain passes and expansive valleys dotted with temples and monasteries ripe for exploration. Explore the country on this private 12-day tailor-made holiday and discover a country with a foot strongly in its traditional roots but also striving to move forward in a responsible way. <br/>Stroll the streets of the sleepy capital, Thimphu and discover a harmony of old and new. Marvel at the valley view from the hilltop Buddha Dordenma, visit the National Memorial Chorten to watch Bhutanese people circumambulate the chorten and discover bargains in the weekend market. Pass over the Dochula Pass for sweeping mountain vistas and visit Punakha Dzong which sits at the confluence of two major rivers. Hike the lowland Phobjikha Valley and travel to the remote Bumthang Valleys to discover the spiritual heartland of the country. And no trip to Bhutan would be complete without the rewarding hike to Tiger's Nest Monastery. Officially called Taktshang Goemba, the temple seems to cling precariously to the cliff side and offers spectacular views of the valley below.",
