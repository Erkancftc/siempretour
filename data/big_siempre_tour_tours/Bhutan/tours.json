Our journey takes us across lands blanketed in rice terraces and scattered villages and, as we climb up towards the heights of Dochu La, the road becomes festooned with colourful prayer flags. On a clear day this meandering highway offers some breathtaking views across the Bhutan Himalayas towards the towering peak of Gangkhar Punsum (7541m), the highest mountain in the country. Descending towards the bewitching Punakha Valley the landscape changes; from forests of pine and oak, through rhododendron, alder and cypress, to turn more tropical as we approach the valley floor. In the warmer climate around Punakha we can find cactus, oranges and bamboo. The fertile valley, drained by the Phochu and Mochu Rivers, produces a perfect environment for farming. We will stop and visit the Chimmi Lhakhang Monastery, the \\ Mad Monk\\ monastery built at the end of the 15th century by the Lama Drukpa Kuenley, the revered and decidedly controversial saint who is believed to have subdued the demoness of the Dochu La. To say that this remarkable yogi's teachings went against the normal conventions of Buddhist dharma would be something of an understatement, given that he was prone to the most outrageous excesses to get his message over. The Lama believed that the rigid doctines of the day were isolating the priests from the ordinary people, so he set out to break down these barriers by deliberate provocation by, in his own words, using '...fair and foul words for mantras'."

We will also visit the temple of Kyichu Lhakhang en route back to the city, one of the holiest temples in Bhutan and said to have been built by the Tibetan king Songsten Gampo in 659AD. This temple was believed to have been just one of many, part of an incredible undertaking of over 100 temples, built to subdue a demoness that lived in this land.

Later today we also plan to visit the Temple of Pashupatinath on the banks of the Bagmati River, the oldest and holiest Hindu shrine in Nepal and regarded by many as the most revered temple of Shiva on the planet. The river is considered holy because its waters eventually flow into the sacred Ganges, and the ghats - steps leading down to the river - are regularly swamped by pilgrims bathing in the waters. This area is also one of the city's most important cremation areas, where both royalty and the common people are cremated and have their ashes sprinkled on the waters of the Bagmati, to make their way downriver towards the sacred Ganges. Please be aware that cremations take place here in the open and may be in progress during our visit. Returning back to the city we pay a visit to the stupa of Bodnath, at 40m the highest in the Kathmandu Valley and one of the largest on the planet.

The ancient centre of the town is a dazzling collection of temples, palaces and monasteries that have earned it a place on the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. A wander through this cultural gem affords an opportunity to take in its beguiling charms and enjoy the site of artisans going about their craft much as they have for generations. You can watch potters throwing clay on traditional wooden wheels, watch jewellers and artists as they go about their daily business and wander through the handicraft shops and stalls seeking out some exquisite bargains. Another alternative for this afternoon is a trip up to the nearby the hilltop temple of Swayambunath, the captivating 'Monkey Temple', whose all-seeing Buddha eyes gaze out across the Kathmandu Valley. The temple is aptly named and the cheeky monkeys that inhabit its ancient walls are not averse to trying to relieve passers by of food, bags and cameras, so be warned."

        "description": "Today we will explore the Thimpu City. Thimphu sightseeing will include visit to National Memorial Chorten: The building of this chorten was originally the idea of Bhutan's third king, H.M. Jigme Dorji Wangchuck (“the father of modern Bhutan”), who had wished to erect a monument to world peace and prosperity, but was unable to give shape to his idea in his lifetime due to pressures of state. Tashichhodzong: The “fortress of the glorious religion”, was initially erected in 1641 and rebuilt by King Jigme Dorji Wangchuck in the 1960s. Tashichhodzong houses some ministries, His Majesty’s secretariat, and the central monk body. It is open to visitors during the Thimphu Tsechu (held in autumn) and while the monk body is resident in its winter quarters in Punakha. We will take you to the local traditional market where all village people assemble to sale their products – vegetable, fruits etc. We will have lunch at a local town restaurant with typical Bhutanese red rice and curry. Later we take you to the city center to have your own time to explore. There are several Handicrafts shops: A wide assortment of colorful, hand woven textiles and other craft products is available for purchase at the government-run Handicrafts Emporium and many smaller crafts shops around the town. Back to hotel for freshen up and later in the evening we take you to a Bhutanese farm house where you can interact with the local host and experience a traditional folk show. After Dinner drive back to hotel and enroute see the beautiful illuminated Dzong of Thimpu from a distance. It is a good opportunity to take some nice night shots with a tripod."

        "description": "Full day in Paro - Excursion to Taktsang Monastery (Drive and Trek 5hrs in total). After early breakfast we take you to an excursion to Taktsang Monastery, also known as Tiger's Nest. It is believed that Guru Rinpoche, founding father of the Bhutanese form of Mahayana Buddhism, arrived here on the back of a tigress and meditated at this monastery. Taktsang was damaged severely by fire in 1998 but was restored again. It is a place really worth visiting in the Paro Valley. It needs a 3-hour trek from the road head. You first drive from Paro on the road to Drugyel Dzong for about 8 km and then commence your trek to the monastery. The monastery from the road head appears as inaccessible but it lures you can't stop yourself from reaching there. The monastery structure is a man made wonder and it is difficult to believe how this structure could be built on such a location. On our way back we will have a picnic lunch organized among the woods and then visit Drugyel Dzong that is where the road ends. On a clear day the towering peak of Mount Jomolhari, (7,314 m / 24,000 ft) appears as a backdrop. This mountain marks the frontier with Tibet, and is regarded as sacred. Drukyel Dzong, with a delightful village at its foot, is built on a rocky spur that blocked the Paro valley & protected it from invasions from the north - it means \"fortress of the victorious Drukpas\". In 1951 a butter lamp fell & started a terrible fire. Only the walls remained and Drukyel Dzong became no more than a dramatic silhouette falling into ruins. On reaching at your hotel you have a free evening. You can go for a short stroll in the down town market to observe the city life of Bhutan. Overnnight at your hotel."

There was a smaller building here called Dzong Chu (Small Dzong) that housed a statue of Buddha. It is said that Zhabdrung ordered the architect, Zowe Palep, to sleep in front of the statue, and while Palep was sleeping; the Zhabdrung took him in his dreams to Zangtopelri and showed him the palace of Guru Rinpoche. From his vision, the architect conceived the design for the new Dzong, which in keeping with the tradition, was never committed to paper. The Dzong was named Druk Pungthang Dechen Phodrang (Palace of Great Happiness). The war materials captured during the battle with Tibetans are preserved here.

On the approach to Gangtey there are wonderful views of the immense and remote Phobjikha valley and the black mountain ranges. On arrival in Gangtey, visit Gangtey Gompa, one of Bhutan’s oldest monasteries which has recently been restored, and explore the valley where the villagers live a traditional Bhutanese rural lifestyle. Enjoy a lovely nature walk starting from near the monastery taking you first downhill and then a nice flat walk through the forest to the valley floor. This is the area where Black-Necked Cranes visit in their hundreds in November each year after spending the summer in Tibet. Overnight Dewachen Hotel or similar (BLD) Note – the nature walk should take around 1.5 hours and is an easy stroll along a good trail."

From the National Museum, take a leisurely 1-hour hike along the forested hillside to Zuri Dzong and then down to the Uma resort. The walk passes Gonsaka Lhakhang and then Zuri Dzong providing wonderful views down over the valley and Dzong. Zuri Dzong dates from 1352 and is home to the valley’s local protector gods. Continue your walk down the Uma Reort junction where you turn right towards Paro Dzong and here again you should have a good view of Paro Dzong and town. Your driver will be waiting at the Paro bridge to pick you up. After lunch you can also visit the impressive Paro Rinpung Dzong, one of the finest examples of Bhutanese architecture.

    "generalInfo": "This Bhutan holiday is a tailor made tour, with many guests enjoying our carefully crafted itinerary which is around two weeks long, with travel time at either end. The Himalayan Kingdom of Bhutan is a very special place, where modernisation has been restricted, the Buddhist culture is at the core of the country’s ethos, and people still wear national dress.  <br/><br/>Bhutan has been isolated for years, only opening its doors in 1974. Its cultural remoteness is compounded by its physical remoteness, enveloped by the Himalayas and some of the most spectacular mountain valleys such as Phobjikha Valley and Bumthang. Here you will get to experience rural life in Bhutan, although we do also include some urban visits too, of course, such as Thimpu, the capital, and Paro which is home to the great Rinpung Dzong.<br/> <br/>Paro is also the main airport with connecting flights to Kathmandu and then onto Delhi. You can undertake an overland route from India too, but please be aware that the border is a long way from some of the country’s top spots to visit, and there are often problems with the mountain roads en route. So, we do recommend flying into Paro. <br/><br/>Travelling with your own driver guide, you are free to add on a visit here or there, to a rural village or a sacred spot along your route. Our local experts know the country inside out and will be happy to arrange things that appeal or are within your budget. As are we, in designing your itinerary and choosing your accommodation. However, do please note that travelling in Bhutan can be a little unpredictable at times, and a Buddhist festival or event might suddenly close down roads or places to eat, for example. But this all adds to the unique Bhutan experience. <br/><br/>What never changes in Bhutan, however, is the spectacular mountain scenery, with no shortage of walking trails into spectacular valleys such as Ura or Punakha, or up to beautiful monasteries. The highlight for many of our guests is Tiger’s Nest Monastery, otherwise known as Paro Taktsang, which is built into a cliff in the Paro Valley. <br/><br/>The best time to visit Bhutan is between October and May, when temperatures are higher and it is predominantly dry. However, because you are travelling in mountain terrain, the altitude does mean that temperatures are unpredictable and it can get cold at night. December and January bring snow and mountain passes are more likely to be mountain impasses. <br/>",

After early breakfast we take you to an excursion to Taktsang Monastery, also known as Tiger's Nest. It is believed that Guru Rinpoche, founding father of the Bhutanese form of Mahayana Buddhism, arrived here on the back of a tigress and meditated at this monastery. Taktsang was damaged severely by fire in 1998 but was restored again. It is a place really worth visiting in the Paro Valley. It needs a 3-hour trek from the road head. You first drive from Paro on the road to Drugyel Dzong for about 8 km and then commence your trek to the monastery. The monastery from the road head appears as inaccessible but it lures you can't stop yourself from reaching there. The monastery structure is a man made wonder and it is difficult to believe how this structure could be built on such a location. On our way back we will have a picnic lunch organized among the woods and then visit Drugyel Dzong that is where the road ends. On a clear day the towering peak of Mount Jomolhari, (7,314 m / 24,000 ft) appears as a backdrop. This mountain marks the frontier with Tibet, and is regarded as sacred. Drukyel Dzong, with a delightful village at its foot, is built on a rocky spur that blocked the Paro valley & protected it from invasions from the north - it means \"fortress of the victorious Drukpas\". In 1951 a butter lamp fell & started a terrible fire. Only the walls remained and Drukyel Dzong became no more than a dramatic silhouette falling into ruins. On reaching at your hotel you have a free evening. You can go for a short stroll in the down town market to observe the city life of Bhutan. Overnight at your hotel."

(Note - flight not included in the tour price). Formerly a capital of the Kathmandu Valley, the pedestrianised centre of Bhaktapur a World Heritage Centre and is full of squares and temples with some stunning wooden architecture. Unfortunately, Bhaktapur was heavily damaged during the 2015 earthquake, though restoration efforts have been substantial. You have a guided tour here, as well as time to explore the narrow winding streets which bustle with life. In the afternoon we make a short drive uphill to the village of Nagarkot, which sits on a ridge at the north-eastern edge of the Kathmandu Valley. Accepted as probably the best of the valley's mountain views, from the village lodges and hotels you can see all the way from Kanchenjunga in the east, past the tiny (from here!) peak of Mt.

    "generalInfo": "Bhutan is known as The Land of the Thunder Dragon, owing to its intense lightning storms that bear down on the valleys from above the mighty Himalayas, and also as the happiest country on earth, due to its commitment to cultural preservation, environmental conservation and spiritual well-being.<br/><br/>After some sightseeing in Kathmandu, Nepal, we take a flight to the fertile Paro Valley, gateway to Bhutan’s capital, Thimpu, which is also the country’s only city. We visit the magnificent Tashichhoe Dzong, a Buddhist fortress and monastery, home to the head of the civil government and the country’s official summer capital. Just outside of the city we take a hike to Tango Goemba, situated near the Cheri Mountains and an important centre of learning for religious leaders. We also visit a school for traditional crafts, as no visit to Bhutan would be complete without an insight into the plethora of protected arts and crafts that have been passed down over generations. <br/><br/>Heading out of the city, we drive towards Gangtey, described by locals as the most beautiful valley in Bhutan. This is our first taste of real, rural Bhutan, as we are isolated by towering mountains, with the modern world quickly feeling like a distant memory. We take in the simple beauty of Gangtey Gompa, overlooking the vast Phobjikha Valley before continuing to the heart of Buddhism in Bhutan, Bhumtang. Bhumtang is spectacularly positioned amidst the Himalayas and boasts a selection of historic temples, some dating back as far as the 7th century.<br/><br/>Moving on to Trongsa, we come across ancient watchtowers and fortresses belonging to ancestors of the ruling dynasty, and in Punakha we climb up to a Buddhist shrine, known as a chorten, affording wonderful views of the surrounding valley and Mo Chuu River. <br/><br/>Our return to Paro takes us to see some archery, Bhutan’s national sport, and we round off our trip with a hike up to the iconic Tiger’s Nest Monastery, before flying back to Kathmandu.   <br/><br/>For many centuries Bhutan was left undisturbed, shrouded in mystery, but leaving room for local traditions to flourish and thrive. Whilst the country is still largely undiscovered and proudly independent, it’s slowly opening up to tourism and opportunity, keen to establish itself as a ‘friend to the world’ and to share some of its wonders.",

This Festivals of Bhutan holiday takes you not only to spectacular mountain scenery but also to vibrant festivals, where monks perform masked ritual dances and people come from all around to enjoy the carnival atmosphere. Depending on your departure date you’ll either visit the Paro festival (spring), the Thimpu festival (autumn) or the Trongsa festival (December). <br/><br/>Attending a festival will be the highlight of your trip. At both Paro and Thimpu, hundreds or even thousands gather to see the monks dressed in colourful costumes and painted masks, re-enacting old stories and legends though music and dance. It’s not all about the festivals, though. You’ll also get to experience the country’s dramatic scenery and ancient architecture. Highlights include a drive through the dramatic Paro valley to enjoy views over the eastern Himalaya from 3050m, a visit to sub-tropical Punakha, the former capital of Bhutan, which has a remarkable fortress and is set between two rivers, and a hike up to both Lakhang and Taktsang Monasteries. <br/>",

This afternoon, we have plenty of time to explore the Phobjikha Valley, one of the most beautiful in Bhutan. This wide-open U-shaped glacial valley is home to barking and sambar deer plus wild boars, while Himalayan black bears have also been spotted here. It is also where black-necked cranes come to roost during winter. Usually arriving from Tibet towards the end of October, they announce their appearance by circling the monastery three times. Come spring, they again fly three times around the monastery before returning to Tibet. Today’s drive is approximately 78mi (125km) and takes four to five hours, although variable road conditions may mean we spend longer on the road. Accommodation: Phuntsho Yangkhil Lodge (or similar)"

Nicknamed the Divine Madman or Mad Saint, he was a maverick spiritual leader, who subdued a demon controlling the Dochu La. He built a chorten where the monastery stands and was reputed to have unorthodox ways of teaching Buddhism – he advocated for phallic symbols to be painted on walls and houses, which were intended to drive away the evil eye. Most of the houses in this area are decorated with highly ornate phallic paintings. We walk through the village to the monastery with a chance to see traditional Bhutanese-style farmhouses. We then continue to Punakha, which at 3,940ft (1,200m) is warmer than Paro or Thimphu. Punakha was once the capital of Bhutan and is still the winter residence of the monastic body. We visit the dzong, one of the most beautiful in Bhutan. This remarkable fortress between the Mo and Po Chhu rivers has survived many fires, an earthquake and several floods. Time permitting, we drive to the Khamsum Yuelley Namgyal Chorten at the end of the valley, which houses representations of the tantric form of Buddhist deities.

Made of wood and iron, this is the first bridge built in Bhutan. We continue our drive and come to the Dzongdrakha Goemba, also known as Mini Taktsang, a serene site above the village of Bondey on the western side of the Paro Valley. Often overlooked by tourists because of its rather old facade, this divine place comprises four shrines, while stories related to spirits, saints and magic are narrated here. Before arriving at our hotel, we stop at Kyichu Lhakhang. Built in the seventh century, it is said to be the oldest temple in Bhutan and therefore holds great spiritual significance to the country.

For the energetic, there is the chance to walk even higher to the actual monastery. This takes another two hours and involves walking up and down stone steps. We highly recommend a trekking pole or you can buy a wooden stick at the car park.

Since then, many of Buddhism's most influential figures have visited. The main building of Taktsang was badly damaged in a fire, and a major restoration ended in 2003.

The path snakes across the mountainside between these monasteries before reaching the gardens of Zangto Pelri (Heaven on Earth) from where if you are brave enough you can peer over the edge, straight down onto the ornate rooftops of Taktsang A monastery perched against the cliff-face far below. An hour later we cross the gorge from Taktsang Monastery following a steep descent to a waterfall then climb uphill for 10 minutes and reach the Tiger’s Nest. Historically, it is believed Guru Rinpoche, arrived here on the back of a flying tigress after defeating a troublesome local demon in the eighth century and spent months in meditation, Thus, the cave gets its name Lakhang meaning \"Tiger's Nest\". It has been a place of pilgrimage ever since. Inside of the Lakhang, the Dubkhang - the cave where Guru Rinpoche meditated, now sealed behind a shining golden door - sits at the heart of the main shrine, surrounded by richly decorated chapels and side chapels that fill every inch of the narrow ledge offering phenomenal views of the forested valleys far below. Retracing our steps, we begin the final descent of about 45 minutes to Paro Valley floor to reach our vehicle from where you will be transferred by road to your overnight stay at the hotel in Paro. Later in the evening, enjoy a hot stone bath to relax your muscles from the trek. Overnight at hotel in Paro;"

After arriving in Agra we'll make a stop for lunch at the Sheroes Hangout Cafe The cafe was set up by the Chhanv Foundation and is run by victirms of acid attacks. The cafe works to raise awareness of acid attacks in India and to empower those who have sadly been the victims of these heinous crimes. Prior to gaining employment in the cafe, many of the 'Sheroes' led solitary lives, rarely going outside due to shame associated with their scars. At Encounters Travel we're proud to support such an organisation, which has the sole aim of helping these women find acceptance, a supportive community and a means of income.

After visiting the museum, we will take a short stroll down to the Ringpung Paro Dzong (the Fortress of Jewels). Dating back to the 17th century, the fortress houses the district monastic body as well as the administrative center. Praying in that chapel is believed to bring about long-life. Explore Paro town."

The monastery hangs on a cliff at 3120 meters above sea level, and although it looks very steep and almost vertical, the monastery has a mule track leading to it. The trek is very scenic, surrounded by pine trees. The Trek will be about 5-6 hours round trip and lunch will be served at the cafeteria on the way. Upon your return form Tiger’s Nest, enjoy a relaxing dip in Bhutan’s hot stone baths. The bath comprises of fresh water infused with Artemisia absinthium (wormwood) leaves and other herbs. The water is heated using river stones that have been meticulously roasted over an open flame until they attain searing temperatures. In the evening, you will have time to stroll around and visit Paro town."

Tiny plastic chairs line the pavements, filled with customers drinking Indian tea. Chinese markets spill onto the streets while early 19th-century buildings stand majestically on corners. There's always a contrast here but little has changed for 100 years, the same atmosphere lining the central part of the city. You'll be picked up from the airport and transferred to a five-star hotel along the waterfront, one of the few colonial icons that has been restored to its old glory. Head out with your local guide, stopping first to admire the golden facade of Sule Pagoda, a compass point in the heart of the city. Wander through the nearby lanes of the Indian Quarter, atmospheric smells accompanying you through its vibrant market stalls. Dominating the north of the center is Shwedagon Pagoda, one of the world's greatest Buddhist landmarks.

You will stay in Old Bagan, where an abundance of the largest monuments is found. Vast golden Buddhas are sculpted inside Ananda Temple, murals lace the walls of Gubyaukgyi while the stupa of Shwezigon stands above the riverside. These are not restored and renovated, rather they are lost in the charms of their era, dating back from the building boom of the 9th to 13th centuries. Bagan's great mystique comes from its scale. The temples you might have heard of, those famous names and most spectacular facades, are just the start. Most monuments just have a number, yet they rise four stories high and are filled with giant Buddha statues or faded murals that cover the ceiling. Some temples are well known for watching the sunset. The guide knows always another nearby temple, where the views are just as good and there's hardly another person in sight.

This is probably Myanmar's most quintessential experience, an aerial flight that comes close to unraveling the astonishing scale of Bagan. At every angle there are dozens of buildings from a bygone era, each left in their mysterious state of softly fading decay. Descend and return to the hotel for brunch before an afternoon of meeting locals that reside in the temples. Bagan is not merely a historical place. Enter a small pagoda and red-robed monks are meditating, their lyrical chorus filling the mural walls with sanctity. An artist paints in another, using sand to create unique paintings of Bagan life. Young monks laugh and play in a monastery while traders bring home-woven fabrics to the edge of temples. The locals are eager to share and converse, reveling in the opportunity to learn something about your country and discuss cultures and lifestyle. There is certainly no sense of tourist saturation in Myanmar; people are keen to savor the opportunity to interact freely with foreigners, something that wasn't possible for many decades under the military regime."

Spend the afternoon exploring by boat, traveling through the canals that act as streets and discovering the traditional crafts still being practiced in this quiet corner of Myanmar. Perhaps it's the gardens that most impress, whole plantations that float as they're held together by bamboo poles--or it may be the fishermen, rowing with their legs and casting nets to the backdrop of sunset.

Even after a week in Bhutan, this will still be another feast for the senses. It will also be a great stop on the way back to Paro through the mountains. You will make your way back slowly with opportunities for short hikes and village stops."

This new destination is a great place to end a Bhutan trip. You will then return to Paro to connect with your departure."
