      "description": "Tour starts in Paro: Thimphu: On arrival at Paro airport (see GETTING THERE section below), we will be met and transferred to Thimphu, Bhutan’s capital, approximately one hour away. Although the Thimphu Valley has supported small settlements for many centuries and a dzong has existed there since 1216, the city didn't really develop until the King declared Thimphu the new capital in 1961. Thimphu has a youthful exuberance that constantly challenges the country’s conservatism and proud tradition. The ever-present juxtaposition of old and new is just one of its appealing qualities, and today, it is Bhutan’s most modern and developed city. On arrival in Thimphu, there will be some free time to settle in and relax after an introductory briefing."

      "description": "In the Tang Valley: Hike to Thowadra Monastery: We have a good hike today, which is both challenging and rewarding, to the revered and sacred site of Thowadra Monastery. The name means ‘highest rock’ and stands at an altitude of 3400m. It was blessed by the presence of Guru Rinpoche, who meditated here and left his footprints in the stone. The walk itself starts from the north end of the Tang Valley, at 2750m on a dirt road along the riverside until it crosses the river by a wooden bridge. The trail starts to climb up before a short descent and crossing another bridge. Upon reaching a chorten, the trail again ascends through pine forest and past several monuments in the mountainside. For the last section, the trail is very steep, with the monastery hanging above you on the cliff, motivating you to climb the last stone steps to the top. From here, we will enjoy the fabulous view of the Tang Valley on the horizon and visit the mysterious and exceptionally holy temple, which is built directly into the cliff walls. We will then retrace our steps down to the first bridge, where our host will be waiting with a hot picnic and a cup of chai before returning to the delights of our homestay.Hiking in Tang Valley & Thowadra Monastery: Approximate Distance - 8km.
