  "generalInfo": "Nestling between Catalonia and France, the tiny principality of Andorra makes the perfect location for an active family holiday. The Pyrenees are your playground as you raft, hike and bike. Explore beautiful Andorra and dip into Spain, too, trying new activities but also stopping off in pretty hamlets or just soaking up the mountain scenery.<br/><br/>You’ll be based in Soldeu at a friendly, family run hotel that’s only occupied by like-minded families and individuals who are travelling with us, so the atmosphere is extremely welcoming. Our experienced guides help every member of your family get the most from each adventure. There are activities to suit all ages, including scenic valley hikes and mountain biking. There is also the chance for some adrenaline-fuelled fun white water rafting down the Noguera River. This is considered one of the five best rivers in Europe for rafting, because it has plenty of safe exit points and long stretches of steady rapids. A free day gives you the chance to choose from lots of optional activities, including zip lining, horse riding, canyoning and fishing. <br/><br/>The activity schedule is really flexible, so if you’d rather relax in the fresh air for an afternoon, that’s no problem – it’s always possible to opt out – and activities such as biking are backed up by a support vehicle. Group sizes of up to 16 people are fine and we can split groups up based on fitness and ability, so everyone is completely comfortable with each activity and the level it’s pitched at. <br/>",

      "description": "This morning you will join your fellow travellers for welcome meeting before heading off on the first of many activities. Be sure to check with the hotel check-in staff to check the exact time of this meeting. Drive to the stunning Cortals Valley (approximately 30 minutes). Here you and the family will enjoy a full day of activities. Enjoy some easy riding on the only flat off-road track in Andorra, which leads to Engolasters Lake, glimpsing some beautiful scenery along the way. At the other end of the lake is the zip wiring and tree top centre. After a short briefing, you and your family will climb up into the trees and enjoy the thrill of crossing the area by zip lines and rope obstacles. After some time to rest by the lake and enjoy a picnic lunch, you'll enjoy stunning views head to a look out point over the capital city Andorra La Vella from a scenic look out.

      "title": "Salamandres Lake Walk.",
      "description": "Venture out for your first excursion into Andorra's mountains today. It's a short (10 minute) drive to Entorn at the base of the stunning Ransol Valley Ridge. Starting at 2000 metres above sea level, climb 250 metres to Salamandres Lake. Here lives the small yellow dotted amphibian, the Salamander which gives the lake it’s name. For the more energetic you can challenge yourself to continue the hike up to the Ransol Ridge at 2,500m. At this height, spectacular views can be enjoyed across the Andorran peaks. The rest of the day is a gradual descent back down going past the Roca del Home Dret, the rock of the straight man. This is a great way to ease yourself into trekking and to acclimatise to the altitude. Keep your eyes open for native flora and fauna, such as the griffon vulture, which can often be seen soaring overhead. Arrive in the beautiful Incles Valley where you'll cross the Incles river and take a gentle path back to the hotel. You'll arrive back at the hotel between 3 and 4 pm, giving you a chance to relax in the sun, explore the village or visit a neighbouring hotel’s spa centre."

      "title": "White-water rafting on Noguera River.",
      "description": "Crossing the border into Spain, take the high mountain pass over the Port de Canto through very some Mediterranean scenery, still at 1,000 metres high. You can stop at the Port de Canto lookout point to take in the lovely foothills of the Spanish Pyrenees. Continue down to the village of Sort (Catalan for 'luck') where at the rafting centre you and the family will be kitted out with wetsuits, helmets, life jackets and a paddle. From the top of the Noguera River, enjoy 14 kilometres of exhilirating white water rafting. Noguera River is renowned as one of the top five rivers for rafting in Europe, thanks to nice stretches of continuous but not too rough water, and many exit points. After a fun ride over a weir and through the Olympic kayaking course, arrive back at the rafting centre to take a shower. The centre has a beautiful garden with a swimming pool and a bar, so you can spend some time here before heading back to Soldeu."

      "title": "Walking in Incles Valley.",
      "description": "Walk from the hotel to the nearby Incles Valley for today's walk. Set off along forested mountain slopes and along a single track through the woods where there are beautiful flowers, rhododendrons (in June), wild fruit (midsummer) and wild mushrooms (in September). The gently climbing path zig-zags up to the stunning Cabana Sorda Lake, which sits below an impressive semi-circular amphitheatre of rock – an ideal stop for lunch. If the weather allows, you can take a refreshing dip in the cold mountain water. At the beginning of the Summer it is likely there will be snow around the lake, and later in the Summer it is possible to walk around the lake or perhaps watch the fishermen catching mountain trout. After lunch, descend through beautiful meadows and woodland to the valley floor, where you head back to the hotel."

      "description": "Today has been left free for you to choose from the many activities that are on offer in Andorra. You may decide to go horse riding, or perhaps visit the thermal baths of La Caldea. If you have a head for heights and a good level of fitness, you can try your hand at ferrata climbing. This is a style of climbing that uses handy equipment such as rungs and a steel cable to traverse tricky and rugged terrain. Further cycling or mountain biking are also options for today, as is canyoning. Otherwise, simply relax and enjoy the sunshine, or do a spot of duty-free shopping."
