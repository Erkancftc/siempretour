  "generalInfo": "Oman is slowly emerging from its hermit shell, revealing a land of friendly people and dramatic landscapes, peppered with forts. Oman is distinctly Arabic and offers many old-world wonders.<br/>Swimming in the turquoise waters of Wadi Bani Khalid and then driving across the dramatic red dunes of Wahiba are both adventures to be remembered forever. Embrace the curious traveller within exploring Bedouin desert culture, visiting ancient tribal forts and mountain mud homes, small plantations and fishing villages. And show your considerate side by staying in locally owned hotels, supporting the green turtle sanctuary at Ras Al Jinz, being guided by local experts who advise on cultural sensitivities as you head way off the usual tourist trail. All of which can be summed up in two words: Oh. Man.",
