  "generalInfo": "An enticing pairing of two exciting destinations, this Oman and Zanzibar beach holiday introduces you to the Arabian culture and warm hospitality of Oman followed by a relaxing beach break on beautiful Zanzibar. Here you can snorkel, explore the island’s capital Stone Town and learn about its history as a key player in the spice trade, or simply make the most of the gorgeous beach.<br/><br/>In Oman, you’ll be based outside the capital Muscat in a beautiful hotel on a private bay. The Shangri-La Barr Al Jissah Resort has three hotels linked by gardens, all offering warm and welcoming Omani hospitality. Enjoy the beach and the warm sea, the pool, spa, snorkelling and diving, and take a guided tour of Muscat, too, a contemporary city which retains a strongly local feel and a great deal of traditional character – you’re always aware that you’re in the Arabian peninsula. <br/><br/>After enjoying three nights in Muscat, fly over to Zanzibar for a seven night stay at Breezes Beach Club &amp; Spa. It sits on one of Zanzibar’s most beautiful beaches where you can try kite surfing, pedal boating, kite buggying and guided cycling and snorkelling trips. You can also learn to dive, at the on-site PADI dive centre, which offers lessons for beginners and guided diving trips on the reef for experienced, qualified divers. There is also a spa and a yoga and meditation sanctuary to enjoy, and the chance to explore Stone Town or enjoy a spice tour.<br/>",
