      "title": "Pattaya – Along the Gulf Shores",
      "description": "The days are bright and colorful in Pattaya, a bustling city on the shores of the Gulf of Thailand. The vibrant scent of fresh seafood rises through the street, wrapped around simmering curry or grilled prawns. A private transfer will take you to your hotel situated near the shore, where the outlook along the coastline is an opulent panorama. Strolling along the seaside promenade brings the cool shade of palm trees and a look at the city beyond the rushing streets. You can see the skyline in the distance while people from all over the world linger on the sand and listen to the gentle lull of the water. The diverse city has stretches of cityscape and open greenery, whether sitting along the sandy beach of Chomtian that was once paddy fields, or wandering through the temple Khao Chi Chan at the summit of the looming mountain, there is endless grandeur along the city’s streets, beaches, and surroundings."

      "title": "Pattaya – Floating Four Regions",
      "description": "Today is a perfect day to rise in the early dawn to see the sensational Floating Market known as the Four Regions Floating Market. The market covers an area over 300,000 square-feet, separated into four parts that range from all four corners of Thailand, the north, northeast, central, and south. There is an abundance of aromas that range from fresh produce bursting with citrus, like bright rambutan, to luscious seafood, such as chili prawns cooked right before your eyes; you can even sit and enjoy coconut pancakes and thong yip , a regional dish of sweet egg yolk. Boats crowd the waterway, filled with vivacious goods, from textiles to more food, handcrafts to toys, filling the morning with an almost overwhelming exuberance and delight. The hundreds of wooden houses that line the river offer insight into the variety of culture within Thailand’s four regions. Back in the city you can explore the stunning architecture of the Sanctuary of Truth. The entire structure was made of wood, including abstaining from the use of metal nails, complete with an otherworldly view of the sea. The temple itself rises over the bay with intricate pagoda style architecture and tall, thin spires that took 30 years to complete. It is more than just a building; it is also considered a devout work of art rising 20 stories high and covered with woodcarvings that depict characters of both Hindu and Buddhist belief."

      "title": "Pattaya – Active Artistry",
      "description": "Today is at your leisure to discover the hidden gems of Pattaya, filled with remarkable nature in the Botanical Gardens and opulent devotion at Wat Phra Khao Yai, also known as Big Buddha Hill. A unique and fun way to spend your day is with a visit to Art in Paradise known as a 3D interactive museum. The museum feels more like a playful palace for adults, filled with laughter and eccentricities that make you want to jump into the paintings or, as you will soon notice, have the paintings jump out at you. Through clever uses of shading and borders, artists were able to create images that look as though they are smashing through the wall in various ways. Part of the exhibition’s beauty is the encouragement to interact with the art. You can make it look like you’re drifting along the canals in Venice or being regarded by Rodin’s The Thinker . There is a piece of playfulness in Pattaya that allows you to enjoy more than just beaches and a wealth of food, but lets you appreciate the all too often overlooked pleasures of fun."

      "title": "Pattaya – Within the Canopy",
      "description": "The gentle aroma of breakfast livens your morning spirit, filled with fresh squeezed orange juice and a smattering of sweet fruits from divine bananas to gargantuan jackfruit. After breakfast you will make your way out of the city with a celebrated experience on the Flight of the Gibbon. The experience brings you into the jungle canopy to see life in the way that a gibbon might, spreading almost two-miles through the trees with 22 ziplines and two stations that will have you abseiling as if you were a professional at monkeying around. Your semi-private transfer will have you at the park in no time, filling your eyes with the panorama of the treetops from above and below. The scent of pine surrounds you. The wind rushes past as you journey from one tree to another along the buzzing sound of the ziplines that range from over 65 feet to 900 feet in length. After your tour of the treetops you will visit the Khao Kaew Safari Park, where the wilds of the jungle come to life, such as gibbons and rhinoceros. The day is filled with anticipation and freedom, the exhilaration of flying and the open splendor of the wild."

      "title": "Bangkok – Peace and Piece of Coral",
      "description": "Pattaya is an endless rush activity, filled with hidden pockets of peaceful respite within the endless energy of city life. Today you will journey to serene Koh Larn, known as Coral Island, where a change of pace from the big city will bring you to the translucent waters that shimmer blue and practically overflow with aquatic life. What was once a sleepy fishing village is now a revered beach filled with peaceful powder-white sand, calm glowing water, and expansive lush jungle. Once on the shore you can see why it is called Coral Island, as reefs pocket the glass-like water offering tremendous places to snorkel just off the beach. The water is cool and comfortable, while the sun is hot and embracing. Long-tail boats drift in the water and the soft sand feels like a pillow. Whether in the water or on the shore, you will have the day to settle into the comforts of the island life before making your way back to Pattaya and transferring to the capital city of Bangkok in the evening."

      "title": "Bangkok – Royal Grounds",
      "description": "Bangkok is an incredible rush of a city, similar to Pattaya in its endless energy but bursting with more life and culture, from remarkable temples to the historic Grand Palace. After breakfast you will venture along the famous Chao Phraya River, winding along the once busiest highway in the city, coming to the grounds of the Grand Palace. Built in the late 18th century the palace was the home to the Royal court for over 150 years. The lavish architecture displays the importance of the palace as the spiritual heart of the past and present kingdom. The palace’s Inner court shows the contrast of styles, constructed and decorated with a European design but topped with a markedly Thai roof. On the palace grounds also sits Wat Phra Kaew, the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, and is considered the most important temple in the country. The iconic green glowing image of Buddha dates back to the 15th century and was carved from a single jade block. The structure itself is filled with an atmosphere of elegance and integrity, with the slight air of incense wafting along the halls. The building is unique in that it doesn’t contain monks’ living quarters and is entirely meant as an elaborate and holy decoration dedicated to Buddha. From the golden images of the Garuda, a mythological creature that is part bird and part man, to the flowing robes wrapped around the icon’s shoulders, the immeasurable detail and grace of the temple and the palace will leave you inspired."

      "title": "Khao Yai National Park – The Wild World",
      "description": "The morning sun hits the Temple of Dawn and brightens the city and the chedi with effervescent glints, as if winking at the daylight. After breakfast you will be met by a semi-private transfer who will take you past the gates of Khao Yai National Park, a refuge to the celebrated wilds of Thailand, where you can find monkeys and even tigers. The third-largest national park in the country, the evergreen forests and grasslands drape over the landscape making a home for pig-tailed macaque and Asian black bear. The mid-afternoon brings you to the Buddhist cave temple situated within the dripping earthen and reverberant walls. A large Buddha image is built into the distant wall sitting in a reposed nirvana state, poised posture, legs crossed with a stoic stare. Outside of the cave the natural world comes to life in the quiet whisper of the trees. The over 6,500 square-feet of national park is filled with rustling leaves while the animals rest in the tropical afternoon warmth. The panorama shows you the undulating mountains and rippling branches that rush over the landscape. Nearby you will visit the tremendous Khao Luk Chang Bat Cave where wrinkle lipped bats cling to the cavernous ceiling and storm through the sky in a winding stream."

      "title": "Khao Yai National Park – The Trails of the Jungle",
      "description": "The wildlife of the jungle offers tremendous insight, not just into the life of the animals but also the culture of the people that have been in touch with their natural surroundings for centuries, if not longer. After breakfast you will venture into the dense jungle, a place where the trees spread over the skyline and cast shades of light beneath them. Along the upper branches you can see the playful and rambunctious acts of gibbons, as they are most active in the cooler hours of the morning. The branches bob and weave as you make your way to Haew Narok Waterfall. The water spills over the highest point of 240 feet spreading over three separate tiers. The powerful falls can be heard from quite a ways away, but when you come to the viewing platform there is little that can prepare you for the exquisite rush no matter the season, pouring down in what looks like a raucous curtain made of beads or an endless blanket of movement pressed against the rocky terraces. In the evening you will watch over the salt licks, where the open plain spreads to the horizon."

      "title": "Bangkok – Colorful Days",
      "description": "The wildlife-clad mornings are endless as you journey through the park en route to a cultural market at Pak Chong. The town is filled with local goods and items that showcase the culture and the surrounding region, specifically the fresh food. From local farms and straight from the earth, the vibrant market is filled with the scent of herbaceous spices, remarkable curry, and colorful vegetables. Continue on to the labyrinth made of sandstone decorated by ancient rock art that represents human beings and animals, both domestic and wild, marking the history of a people and how far back the story goes. The reddish hue bursts from the rocky surface with familiar images, as fig trees seem to hang off of the cliffs in impressive displays of persistent nature. After lunch you will return to Bangkok and let the endless energy of the city carry you into the evening."

      "description": "Today you will taste the sweetness of the pineapple and the richness of the fresh coconut before meeting your private transfer to the airport. The delights of Thailand are as simple as the fresh flavors and as grand as the national parks, whether on land or sea. You have tasted the food and delighted in the landscape, found joy in the artwork and elegance flying through the trees. You have stepped into the jungle and jumped into the sea, finding the wonder of Thailand in and out of the blue."
