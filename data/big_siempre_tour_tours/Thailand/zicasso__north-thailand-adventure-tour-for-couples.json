      "title": "Golden Triangle – Exclusive Luxury Camp on the Riverside",
      "description": "As the sun rises, the mist clears; the Chiang Rai landscape is filled with an evocative sense of mystique. Enjoy a leisurely breakfast and then weave into the green valleys towards the Golden Triangle. Decorous scents guide you through the Doi Tung Royal Flower Garden and then the road winds towards the Mekong River. Look across the jungle valley. Over there is Myanmar. To the right is Laos. And before you is Chiang Saen, the last remains of an ancient kingdom along the irrefutable river. Relics are lost in the sand, the temple ruins standing in a wonderful sense of decay. Yet some pagodas stand revitalized and restored, proud monuments that recreate the feeling of a once powerful city. Wander through these remains and absorb the 500 year old narrative from your guide, then stop at the Opium Museum for an insightful look at the region's battle with addiction and illegal crops. The Mekong River is flanked by beauty, the jungle extending from the shore and the mountains dominating the horizon. Board a long-tail boat and gently head into the wilderness, the charms of local life ever-present along the riverside. Your destination is an exclusive retreat in the heart of untamed nature. Settle into your secluded luxury tent, the canvas exterior ensuring nature's resonant soundtrack accompanies your every moment. The interiors are like a five-star hotel, the custom wooden furnishings and huge beds carefully completing the submersion in nature. Now it's time to really relax...in one of the world's only open-air jungle spas. An indulgent 90-minute treatment is included for both of you. With the renowned therapists working on your body, you will find unrestrained Thailand luxury at its most unique."

      "title": "Golden Triangle – Sailing the Mekong River",
      "description": "Your day will begin at the edge of the Mekong River, where you will board a traditional form of transport, a private long-tail boat. The calm waters will rush beneath lush bordering reeds. You can admire the local life by the riverside where men fish from tiny wooden canoes, women wash clothes in the shallows, and waving children seem to come at increasingly regular intervals. The scent of the grass will fill the air as you drive along the warm waters. Cruise along to the exact point where three countries meet to view the natural landscape at the Golden Triangle to find the borders of Thailand, Myanmar, and Laos. You will continue to explore a local market, where the baritone shouts of traders will accompany the aromas of limes and pineapple as you float between stalls of fresh produce. There's even time for a temple visit before you return to your luxury camp. Every romantic escape should include some memorable candlelit dinners. Tonight you walk into a jungle clearing and sit down amidst the trees with silhouettes of the forest fill the distance against the soft moonlight to create a sense of bliss. A sumptuous five-course dinner is served as nature's organic chorus accompanies this private piece of paradise."

      "title": "Chiang Mai \u0000– An Intimate Journey to Chiang Mai",
      "description": "Wake again to the sounds of nature and savor the last moments in this tranquil tented camp. After a short long-tail boat journey you rejoin your guide for the spectacular journey to Chiang Mai. Meander through the mountains, each corner bringing fresh vistas and ongoing beauty. There's half a dozen stops en route, each concealed from the road and lost amongst the trees. Wander through a forest clearing to the Mae Kong hot spring, visit local factories specializing in Thai silk, and admire the soothing elegance of temples hidden in the greenery. There's always picturesque brilliance along the riverside, so stop to relish the vistas and enjoy lunch. Just on the other side of Chiang Mai is the Padong Long Neck Hill Tribe village. Dazzling brass rings cover women's necks here, the gleaming metal contrasting colorful pieces of cotton that dangle from hair and arms. Girls as young as five wear the rings, this unique practice maintaining a millennia-old tribal tradition. Explore this small village and wander past the quaint wooden houses, ubiquitous children's smiles accompanying almost every turn. Then keep wandering to the nearby Mae Tang River where a cute bamboo raft floats you downstream to the waiting vehicle. You're lost in the wilderness, cruising through untamed jungle at a pace that befits the rural beauty of Northern Thailand. You'll arrive in Chiang Mai by mid-afternoon and check in to your hotel. It might be the last stop for the day, a romantic deluxe room the perfect place to relax for the evening. But your guide and vehicle are always waiting outside should you wish to explore Chiang Mai in the evening."

      "title": "Chiang Mai – Serene Enchantment",
      "description": "Early risers are rewarded in Chiang Mai, your 6 am wake-up call bringing the city's most evocative sight. Red-robed monks wander barefoot in the dawn light, a procession of spirituality moving through the streets. Participate in this daily alms giving ceremony by placing food into the monks' bowls, then continue the spiritual slant by climbing the 309 steps of the Golden Naga staircase. You're now standing above Chaing Mai at Wat Doi Suthep, one of Thailand's most famous temples. Admire the fabulous murals and pagodas, feel the enchantment of incense filled temple rooms, and listen to the monks' soft chanting as it floats on the mountain breeze. The tour continues at Wat Umong, a mysterious temple hidden beneath moss and trees, standing in an indelible sense of decay. Slowly wander beneath the greenery and through the transcendent hallways, holding hands as you follow the incense smell to a darkened temple room. A monk waits for you, softly reciting mantras and conducting a private blessing ceremony. This unique and rare experience brings the architectural relic to life, epitomizing the blend between aesthetic exterior and hypnotic interior. Return to the Chedi Chiang Mai for lunch and a leisurely afternoon. Then an evening discovery tour unveils further enchantment; join the monks in their nightly chanting and stroll through the vivid stalls of the Waroros Market."
