      "description": "HEADING TO KOH KYE CORAL ISLAND - As the sun begins to rise, you’ll arrive at Chumphon Railway Station, where your friendly guide will greet you and lead the way to the start of your unforgettable island camping adventure. Before we set off, we’ll stop at a local resort to freshen up and prepare for the journey ahead. Here, you’ll have the chance to store your luggage securely and pack light for the next two days—just the essentials, including your swimsuit and sunscreen! After enjoying a light lunch at the resort, get ready for a truly unique expedition to Koh Kye, a remote and pristine island in the Chumphon Archipelago. Chumphon remains one of Southern Thailand’s most unspoiled beach destinations, offering an off-the-beaten-path experience far from the crowds of more popular provinces. Your guide will provide a quick briefing on island safety and the dos and don’ts of preserving this natural wonder. But first, we’ll visit a traditional fishermen’s village, where you’ll receive your camping essentials: a tent, sleeping bag, pillow, headlamp, and even some beach games for the evening ahead. Stock up on any last-minute snacks or drinks at the local market before boarding a traditional longtail boat for a scenic 30-minute cruise to Koh Kye. Koh Kye is unlike any other island—a serene sanctuary shaped by history and nature. Its most striking feature is the “coral graveyard,” a dazzling white sand dune created by corals washed ashore after Typhoon Gay in 1989. Over time, rainwater has naturally bleached the corals, transforming the island into a stunning, otherworldly landscape. Beyond the shore lies a vibrant coral reef teeming with marine life, while the island’s interior is a lush, untouched jungle. This idyllic setting will be your home for the night as we set up camp right on the beach. Upon arrival, the island is yours to explore! Pitch your tent and claim your perfect spot, creating your own little haven in this untouched paradise. Once your camp is set, dive into the crystal-clear waters for a snorkeling adventure among vibrant coral reefs or enjoy a friendly game of beach volleyball as the sun dips below the horizon. A light lunch of local delicacies will be served to keep you energized for an afternoon of fun and relaxation. As twilight sets in, gather around for a delicious barbecue feast featuring freshly caught seafood and seasonal vegetables sourced from Chumphon’s farming community. Share stories, laughter, and a sense of camaraderie around the campfire, as the starlit sky and gentle ocean waves create the perfect ending to an unforgettable day."

      "description": "BACK TO THE MAINLAND - Rise and shine! Start your day with a delicious breakfast, savoring the tranquility of the island one last time. Take a refreshing dip in the pristine waters or simply bask in the morning sun before packing up your camp. Once ready, board the fisherman’s traditional longtail boat for a scenic ride back to the mainland. From there, hop into a comfortable minivan to Chumphon Pier. This bustling hub makes it easy to catch a ferry to the idyllic islands of Koh Tao, Koh Samui, or Koh Phangan. Thank you for joining us, and we look forward to welcoming you back for your next journey. Until then, safe travels and see you soon!"
