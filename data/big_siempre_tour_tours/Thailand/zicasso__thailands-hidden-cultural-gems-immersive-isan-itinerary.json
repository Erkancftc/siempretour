      "title": "Bangkok – Where Thailand’s Sacred Heritage is Highlighted",
      "description": "Before you explore the elaborate Isan region of Thailand, you will uncover the cultural roots that underpin Bangkok’s timeless traditions. Your discovery of this diverse destination will begin as you land and transfer through the dazzling streets toward your luxurious accommodation. An enchanting ambiance will exude from your premier suite, where uninterrupted spectacles of the cityscape stretch as far as the eye can see. These spectacles will lead you along enthusiastic roads, where local markets express the city’s lively spirit, and grand temples highlight its rich heritage. In the evening, you will begin to feel Bangkok’s lavish embrace as you dine on artisanal Thai cuisine at a prestigious rooftop restaurant that will provide you with a view of the divine skyline. Wat Pho stands as a beacon of sacred history and highlights the country’s unending devotion to Buddha. The walls of the complex's spiritual constructs are embellished with precious jewels that glisten under the tropical Thai sun, and its halls are home to a wealth of history that is represented in intricate murals that your experienced guide will decipher. The apogee of nonsecular appreciation within the grounds is a monumental Buddhist image, whereby the iconic figure reclines 46 meters in length and is completely gilded. The beloved Grand Palace stands adjacent to Wat Pho, and you will soon experience its striking presence. A variety of intricately designed buildings constitute the entire Grand Palace, and among these revered establishments is Wat Phra Kaew or the Temple of the Emerald Buddha. The venerated Emerald Buddha image, which was sculpted from a block of jade in the 15th century, is enshrined within the temple and is accentuated by golden robes that are seasonally draped over its body by the king in hopes of good fortune for the country. Vendors will have constructed their stalls, and locals will flock to morning markets at the first sign of light the following day. Within the meandering aisles of the bustling market, you will indulge in traditionally prepared Thai cuisine. Each delightful delicacy originates from years of culinary customs and will introduce your palate to the indelible flavors for which authentic Thai cuisine is famous."

      "title": "Ayutthaya – Ruins and Restoration from Bygone Days",
      "description": "A regal voyage on board a resplendent riverboat will reveal the rural beauty of Thailand’s remote countryside as you venture toward the ancient city of Ayutthaya, which is situated just beyond Bangkok’s borders. The boat will gently cruise across the calm Chao Phraya River while you witness vistas of the prolific banks that are covered in banyan trees that teem with wildlife. Your journey will reach Ayutthaya when the sun begins to wane, and after you have checked into your luxurious resort that will be thoughtfully decorated in Siamese motifs, you will capture the heavenly orange sunset over the boundless landscape, while world-class Thai dishes are served to your table. Ayutthaya is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and a tour of the Historical Park will instantly highlight why it has been awarded such a distinguished certification. Archeological sites sprawl across the length of the park in great numbers, and among them are fascinating temple ruins that date back thousands of years. These pivotal points of interest represent a dramatic and turbulent past in which Thailand both suffered and triumphed during the Burmese-Siamese War. The temple ruins, which are in varying stages of devastation, will share insight into these trials and tribulations that hold major significance in the country's heritage. You will discover the remains of ancient Buddhist images amid the imposing remnants of the temples that once housed them. Moreover, you will visit semi-restored palaces that survived the tumultuous, historical episodes and discover archaic artifacts that formed an intrinsic part of the age-old lifestyle. Wat Phra Mahathat, which is your final stop within the perimeter of the park, will share an iconic photo opportunity of the renowned stone Buddha head as it is entwined within the roots of a large banyan tree. While its Historical Park is established as the highlight of Ayutthaya, the charming town is certainly not void of other noteworthy attractions. Bang Pa-In Palace, which is a former royal Thai residency, stands out as a significant landmark because of its flawlessly shaped park grounds that surround the jewel-encrusted edifice. Furthermore, the riverside restaurants are some of the finest in the country, and revered chefs serve succulent river prawns that you will feast on before you depart for Nakhon Ratchasima."

      "title": "Nakhon Ratchasima – Escape to an Evergreen Forest",
      "description": "Your first steps on Isan soil will be in Nakhon Ratchasima, which is a city within the immense province of the same name that is recognized for its tranquil terrain and Khmer-era heritage. These unique characteristics reinforce its abundant, cultural experiences and will make your stay utterly worthwhile. Additionally, other travelers are few and far between, which will give you a taste of what it is like to walk among the indigenous people as well as allow you to truly wallow in the rural simplicity of it all. In the evenings, you will retreat to the comfort of your luxurious hotel, where you may enjoy Thai haute cuisine of an exceptional caliber, treating you to the perfect blend of authenticity by day and luxury by night. Though Nakhon Ratchasima features a collection of temples, the sought-after adventures lie on the outskirts of the city, where humanmade development gives way to prospects of the lush green peaks. This countryside, which flanks the city, is endowed with staggering mountains that are home to thousands of wildlife species, and there is no better place to completely immerse yourselves in the natural splendor of Thailand than Khao Yai National Park. The park’s emerald-topped jungle sprawls upwards from the roots of ancient trees to the canopy, where gibbons soar from its epicenter to cover an area of 2,168 square kilometers. Colorful birds flutter from branch to branch and sing beautiful songs, elephants show off their majestic presence as they proudly march across grassy fields, and young macaque monkeys cling to their mothers who hang from the evergreen trees. Within the expanse of dense rainforest and vast grassland, you will search for these aborigine animals and more as you are accompanied by an experienced ranger from the safety of a spacious 4x4 safari vehicle. Your tour will culminate at the foot of a pathway that leads up to the park’s world-famous waterfalls, where powerful streams of silver water flow over moss-coated cliffs. Thailand’s decorated Khmer culture is intricately detailed in the intriguing museums and temples, which are set along the spirited roads that wind through the city. Ready yourselves and your cameras for endearing images of elephant-shaped shrines and impressive Buddhist statues as you uncover the time-tested folklore of Nakhon Ratchasima just before you depart."

      "title": "Ubon Ratchathani – A City Glowing with Culture",
      "description": "Today will take you deeper into the Isan region as you transfer to Ubon Ratchathani, which is a charming town that offers raw beauty across its rarely visited topography. The name Ubon stems from the English meaning of royal lotus city, and this descriptive definition could not be further from the truth. Although it does not boom with colorful energy like Bangkok, it oozes priceless allure in all directions of its sweeping scenery. As you peer out from your stylish accommodation, you will capture the endless appeal of Ubon’s lofty sandstone cliffs and extensive plateaus, where the placid Mun River will be gently flowing across. The following day, you will swoon over Ubon’s historical eminence as you transfer to Pha Taem National Park, which is a peaceful park that is slotted into the untamed natural environment and sits between the borders of Thailand and Laos. The ancient heritage of Thailand’s native dwellers will be depicted in the red cave paintings that cover the walls of rock formations and date back over three millennia. These paintings, predominantly crafted from quartz, showcase early animals, which the locals would have lived alongside and relied on for resources. As you and your knowledgeable guide investigate these prehistoric scenes, you will feel as though you are unraveling unrecorded mysteries of forgotten days within a habitat that emanates a mesmerizing atmosphere. Your journey will only be further heightened by the unobstructed vistas from atop Pha Chanadai’s peaks and the breathtaking waterfalls, where you can refresh your minds and bodies. Ubon Ratchathani illustrates the country’s immeasurable constancy toward its cultural roots, and this will be highlighted when you explore the exalted temples and rustic markets today. These temples are some of the most stunning in the country and Wat Phu Prao, which was aptly dubbed the Glowing Temple, trumps the list for its jaw-dropping Tree of Life carving that radiates a luminescent green. Before you marvel at the magnificent structure beneath the twinkling stars, you will traverse the lengths of the charming towns of Ubon to discover the vivacious vendors who will assemble genuine Thai meals for you to enjoy."

      "title": "Khon Kaen – Through Caves to Serenity",
      "description": "Being the site of Isan’s largest university and comprised of a collection of revered landmarks, Khon Kaen delivers on every cultural and historical aspect that you will wish to experience over the course of your adventure in Thailand. From the heights of your reputable penthouse within an award-winning hotel, you will absorb sublime views of this admirable location that you will soon have the luxury to tour. Your immersion will begin the following day after you have had the opportunity to unwind and polish off a plate of gourmet Thai cuisine at a renowned authentic restaurant. Preserved within the walls of Khon Kaen City Museum lie a multitude of treasured texts and artifacts, which embody cultural ideas that you will be pleasantly astonished to discover. Each exhibit represents its specific contents in a manner that is as engaging as it is educational, which will keep you thoroughly enthused as you eagerly trace back Isan tradition to its archaic origins. Your adventurous exploits will be enhanced as you transfer to the cliff-riddled landscape of Phu Pha Man National Park. A cool jungle breeze will lift off of the forest floor as you peruse the park's tropical terrain en route to the sloping caves, which lead to the mountain’s crest. Stalactites, which drip from the cave ceilings, and stalagmites, which reach up toward their roofs, provide plenty of stellar photo opportunities and a first-hand look at history's influence over the ancient area. The cave's exit will reveal unspoiled vistas above the park’s surroundings, where you will feel the embrace of the beating sun and hear the sounds of fluttering bats as they fade behind you into the depths of the crevice."

      "title": "Udon Thani \u0000\u0000– A Farewell Surrounded by a Sea of Flowers",
      "description": "The final leg of your Isan tour will lead to Udon Thani, which is a destination of tremendous tropical charm that serves as the border between greater Isan and the rest of the country. The enchantment of Udon Thani is expressed in its fragrant flower fields and tranquil lakes, which you will be revealed to you after a peaceful first night within your luxurious accommodation. As the sun rises above your room and glimmers of light peek through your blinds, you will awaken with a yearning for more picturesque adventures. Your private tour guide will collect you in the morning and will lead you to the Red Lotus Sea in Kumphawapi, which is a calm stretch of lake that seasonally transforms into a sea of hot pink lotus flowers. Flowering season is best observed between the months of December and March. From the middle of the lake, you will share in the surreal magic of being surrounded by these larger than life flowers. Your leisurely day in and around Udon Thani will then continue to Phu Phra Historical Park in Ban Phue, where gargantuan boulders rest in unusual formations and are seemingly placed there long ago by passing giants. These peculiar sights house historical Buddhist sculptures and cave paintings, which offer insight into the sandstone cultures that once prevailed. The folklore, which your experienced tour guide will share, shares stories of monks who would use these natural arrangements as shelter from the wild, and this is showcased in what appears to be houses built into the rocks. Your final evening in Udon Thani will bring with it an immaculate sunset vista as you slowly snack on a multiple-course meal of phenomenal Thai cuisine. You can soak up your last rays of sunshine as the stars begin to emerge from the night sky and you say your bittersweet goodbyes to this land of enormous cultural wealth."
