Our songthaew will take us to the river where we’ll board our rafts and start our descent into the forest for a breathtaking experience to appreciate the unspoiled natural beauty of Umphang. When we moor our rafts, our songthaew will be waiting for us to take us to Southeast Asia’s largest waterfall: Thi Lor Su. Before heading down to the waterfall, we’ll eat lunch and then spend a couple of hours taking a refreshing swim and, if the water level permits, cliff jump from the top of the waterfall! So don’t forget to pack a towel and a swimsuit in your overnight bag! From Thi Lor Su, we’ll trek through the forest for a few hours to reach our campsite before sunset and set up camp next to pristine Ko Tha waterfall. Your guides will help you set up your tents and cook your dinner over a roaring fire. Remember facilities out in the wild are basic, so we suggest taking advantage of the nearby waterfall to wash up!"

Before we set off, we’ll stop at a local resort to freshen up and prepare for the journey ahead. Here, you’ll have the chance to store your luggage securely and pack light for the next two days—just the essentials, including your swimsuit and sunscreen! After enjoying a light lunch at the resort, get ready for a truly unique expedition to Koh Kye, a remote and pristine island in the Chumphon Archipelago. Chumphon remains one of Southern Thailand’s most unspoiled beach destinations, offering an off-the-beaten-path experience far from the crowds of more popular provinces. Your guide will provide a quick briefing on island safety and the dos and don’ts of preserving this natural wonder. But first, we’ll visit a traditional fishermen’s village, where you’ll receive your camping essentials: a tent, sleeping bag, pillow, headlamp, and even some beach games for the evening ahead. Stock up on any last-minute snacks or drinks at the local market before boarding a traditional longtail boat for a scenic 30-minute cruise to Koh Kye. Koh Kye is unlike any other island—a serene sanctuary shaped by history and nature. Its most striking feature is the “coral graveyard,” a dazzling white sand dune created by corals washed ashore after Typhoon Gay in 1989. Over time, rainwater has naturally bleached the corals, transforming the island into a stunning, otherworldly landscape. Beyond the shore lies a vibrant coral reef teeming with marine life, while the island’s interior is a lush, untouched jungle. This idyllic setting will be your home for the night as we set up camp right on the beach. Upon arrival, the island is yours to explore! Pitch your tent and claim your perfect spot, creating your own little haven in this untouched paradise. Once your camp is set, dive into the crystal-clear waters for a snorkeling adventure among vibrant coral reefs or enjoy a friendly game of beach volleyball as the sun dips below the horizon. A light lunch of local delicacies will be served to keep you energized for an afternoon of fun and relaxation. As twilight sets in, gather around for a delicious barbecue feast featuring freshly caught seafood and seasonal vegetables sourced from Chumphon’s farming community. Share stories, laughter, and a sense of camaraderie around the campfire, as the starlit sky and gentle ocean waves create the perfect ending to an unforgettable day."

For those arriving on time today, your Tour Leader plans to meet you in the hotel reception at 6pm for the welcome meeting and to take us on a tour of Bangkok's street food. Embarking on the impressive metro system, we take in the city's frenetic energy. We'll weave our way through the bustling stalls of Chinatown while our Tour Leader fills us in on the area's backstory, helping us make sense of the wild and colourful sights around us. If you're feeling peckish, there's tons of street food to sample. And for the daring among us, you can even try the local specialty - crispy fried bugs. If you would like to receive a complimentary airport transfer today, you'll need to arrive into Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK), which is a one-hour drive from our hotel. Should you miss the welcome meeting, your Tour Leader will inform you of any essential information as soon as you catch up in the lobby at 8am on day 2.

One of the city's main highlights is the Grand Palace, built in 1782 and home to Thai royalty for more than 150 years. The complex is admired for its intricate carvings, striking artwork, and gold-covered architecture. It also houses the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, one of the most important religious sites in Thailand. Nearby is Wat Pho, or the Temple of the Reclining Buddha, which features a 46-metre-long golden Buddha statue. Alternatively, you could explore Bangkok's klongs - a network of narrow canals that reveal a quieter, more traditional side of the city. Travel by long-tail boat, passing stilted houses and local markets, and stop at a riverside temple that's home to the largest Buddha image in Bangkok. Another great option is a cycling tour through Bangkok's lesser-known neighbourhoods. Ride along backstreets and hidden alleyways, passing local homes, small temples and vibrant markets. It's a relaxed and authentic way to see everyday life in the city, away from the busy main roads."

Here, we'll board one of Thailand's classic trains - a slow but wonderfully authentic experience with open windows, ceiling fans, and a lively local atmosphere. The journey to Kanchanaburi takes around three hours, offering a glimpse of rural life as the cityscape gradually gives way to rice paddies, small villages, and palm-lined countryside. Vendors stroll through the aisles selling everything from snacks and cold drinks to unexpected trinkets you never knew you needed. If you've never travelled by local Thai train before, this scenic ride is the perfect introduction. While most visitors are busy photographing the Bridge over the River Kwai, we'll be riding across it. Feel the weight of history as the train crosses this iconic landmark - part of the infamous Death Railway - and continues through some of its most picturesque stretches, hugging the river with sweeping views of jungle-covered hills and towering limestone cliffs. We'll disembark at Namtok Railway Station, the final stop on the historic line, before continuing by road to the Hellfire Pass Museum, a poignant memorial dedicated to the prisoners of war who built the Burma-Thailand Railway. Overlooking the rugged Hellfire Pass cutting - carved by hand through solid rock - the museum offers a deeply moving insight into this tragic but significant part of history. From here, the journey continues to your floating accommodation, tucked away within a national park and far from the more touristy sections of the River Kwai. Family-run for generations, the property offers an authentic, off-the-beaten-track experience. The simple yet comfortable floating bungalows are moored along the river and reached via a small suspension bridge. Each room i ncludes quality bedding, a fan, and a mosquito net, with electricity available in the evenings. Staying here directly supports the local community and helps preserve this peaceful, little-visited area of Thailand.

        "description": "TEMPLES, WATERFALLS, REMOTE COMMUNITIES AND KAREN HILL TRIBE CAMPING You’ll be picked up at 8:00am from the CHIANG MAI GATE HOTEL in Chiang Mai city and our team will transfer you by minivan to the Tuk Tuk base in Mae Wang, around 45-60 minutes South West of the city. On arrival at the base you’ll be introduced to your trusty Tuk Tuk and driver and get settled in for the adventure ahead. Note – our Tuk Tuks are specially modified to not only cope perfectly with the winding mountain roads but also to give extra comfort and views from the back seat. There are Bluetooth speakers for you to play your road tip selections and you can even roll back the roof if you fancy catching some sun! You’ll start the journey by heading through fantastic winding lanes passing through small farming communities (think classic SE Asia photo ops) and up and visiting stunning remote (and almost never visited) Temples, and at one of them we’ll even make a small blessing for the adventure ahead. You’ll have a simple but hearty lunch at a cool local restaurant and then start to head up to the serious mountains. Stopping to trek to a waterfall and explore a tiny Karen community, we wind up the hairpin bends to our overnight destination of a remote Karen village where we’ll camp and have a real ‘Hill Tribe’ experience. Don’t worry – there are showers and toilets available and the ‘mattresses’ provided in the tents are super comfortable too. In the evening we’ll learn how to cook jungle style with an open fire and lessons from our Karen hosts before spending the night under the stars – a proper Thailand adventure. Inclusions: • Transfer from Chiang Mai Gate Hotel to our ‘base camp’ • Full Tuk Tuk orientation • Professional guide and driver • Lunch and Dinner (jungle cooking class included!) • Overnight camping in a remote Karen Hill Tribe village"

This is a fantastic journey through spectacular mountain scenery along rarely travelled roads giving you a real insight into Thailand, well away from the tourist trail. You’ll stop for a late lunch at a small roadside restaurant – the real deal in terms of local Thai country fare – and then head on to the small community of Ban Mae Khlang Luang, your overnight base. Your overnight accommodation in the village is surrounded by mountains and rice terraces and is the perfect setting for the second night of the adventure. Once you’ve checked in you’ll explore the village, see how the community live and get to sample some of the best freshest coffee around in one of the coolest coffee shops we’ve ever come across! In the evening it’s time for a traditional Thai style BBQ in the rice fields! Great fun and a real Thailand tradition.

Your guide will be in the lead Tuk Tuk and everyone travels in convoy with the support vehicle at the rear (the support vehicle takes all your luggage, spare parts for the Tuk Tuks – always best to be prepared! – and huge amounts of water!). And note that each Tuk Tuk has a walkie talkie so not only can your guide let you know all sorts of information but you can also ask anything you need or simply chat to your fellow travellers! The first 20-30km of the route is simple with gentle curving roads but we soon hit stunning switch back bends, incredible scenery and tiny Karen hill tribe villages as we make our way towards the National Park. Enjoy the look of complete surprise from everyone as they see Tuk Tuks this far up in the mountains – trust us, novelty doesn’t not even begin to cover it – and you’ll stop frequently to have a look at different villages / views and of course to sample some of the great coffee and snacks in small villages. Lunch will be in a roadside snack bar – hearty Thai fare! You arrive at our accommodation mid-afternoon in the village of Mae Khlang Luang before jumping in another classic Thai mode of transport - a ‘Songtaew’ - a shared taxi adapted from a pick up truck, which drives us to the summit of Doi Inthanon (over 2,500 metres) where you’ll explore some of the trails and take in the views. This evening it’s time for a traditional Thai BBQ eaten over the rice fields as the sun sets over the mountains. Not a bad location to end the day! Inclusions: • Tuk Tuks and support vehicle • Breakfast, lunch and dinner • National Park entry fees • Twin / triple / quad shared accommodation in Doi Inthanon (single occupancy rooms can be requested for a small additional fee) – this is the most ‘basic’ of the accommodation but intentionally so to ensure you’re located in the most stunning area and perfectly located for the trek tomorrow.

There are a number of spots where you can cool off with a dip in the pools under the waterfalls and you’ll have a packed lunch (wrapped in leaves) in a clearing in the forest. The hike ends with a walk back down into the village where you stayed last night and there’s the chance to enjoy the freshest coffee around at a local old-style mountain coffee shop (it’s such a cool place we couldn’t possibly do it justice here!)

Our first stop is the Grand Palace complex (home of the Thai royal family) followed by Wat Phra Kaew, where the Emerald Buddha resides, one of the most venerated images in Thailand. Another highlight we encounter is Wat Pho, the largest temple in Bangkok, housing a 151ft (46m) long, 49ft (15m) high gold-plated reclining Buddha. Please note, when visiting the Grand Palace, clothes covering your shoulders and knees are a requirement for entry. We then board a longtail boat for a tour of the canals - Bangkok was once known as the Venice of the East because of its intricate canal network. Please note, there may be a possibility of larger groups being accommodated in a bigger boat. Afterwards, we return to our hotel to freshen up before departing the capital; it will be possible for groups to share a few rooms back at the hotel to shower and change. Later, we transfer to Bangkok Krung Thep Aphiwat station where we board our overnight sleeper train (approximately a 12-hour journey) to Chiang Mai. Accommodation: Sleeper train"

This practice, performed with reverence, allows individuals to accumulate merit and support the monastic community, making it an integral part of Thai culture and daily life. After breakfast, we'll set out on our journey down south to Uthai Thani, a tranquil province in central Thailand known for its traditional rural charm. It offers visitors a glimpse into authentic Thai culture with its historic temples, serene riverside settings and local markets. To see some of this, we take a boat ride on the Sakae Krang River past lush riverbanks, local wildlife and traditional riverfront communities. Before checking into our hotel, we'll explore the city centre and visit Wat Chantaram, renowned for its crystal sanctuary - a mesmerizing hall of mirrors where walls and columns are adorned with reflective surfaces. This area of Thailand is less frequented by tourists, offering a more authentic local experience. While the hotels here may have fewer amenities compared to those in larger cities, our hotel provides a warm welcome. Our total driving time today is around four hours."

We'll have a walking tour of the city's historical landmarks, after which the afternoon is free to explore the temples or relax at our riverside hotel.

The Maeklong Railway Market was established in 1905 to better transport fresh seafood from the nearby port to the city and surrounding provinces. The market has been built, quite literally, on top of the railway and each time the provincial train rumbles through a mind-boggling spectacle unfolds; the shades and canopies are all folded back, produce is deftly rolled away from the tracks and the train slowly passes through, mere millimetres from the surrounding markets and vendors. We plan to arrive in time to witness this bizarre event. Upon arrival in Bangkok, we'll check in to our luxurious hotel before heading out on a boat ride from the hotel's dock to explore the iconic Chao Phraya River, gliding past temples, markets, and Bangkok's glittering skyscrapers.

You’ll arrive back at base in the late afternoon in time to freshen up and head out for a fantastic traditional Thai dinner at a local ‘country – pub’. Great food, live music and a very special place. Inclusions: • Transfer from Chiang Mai Gate Hotel to our ‘base camp’ • Full Tuk Tuk orientation • Exploration of remote Temples, rural communities and off the beaten track locations • Lunch and dinner • Twin / triple share accommodation in a beautiful resort in Mae Wang – air-conditioning, en-suite rooms (single occupancy rooms can be requested for a small additional fee)"

        "description": "WATERFALLS, HILL TRIBE VILLAGES, ELEPHANTS AND BAMBOO RAFTING After breakfast you’re back into your Tuk Tuk (we guarantee you’ll already be possessive about which Tuk Tuk is ‘yours’!) and you’ll head North in convoy up the valley to the remote region of Mae Sapok. Think ‘classic Thailand’ – rice terraces, water buffalo, the odd elephant handing out by the river and small wooden houses dotted around. You’ll hike through the forest to a cool waterfall and then explore the local Karen village You’re then back in your Tuk Tuk as you head through small country roads to a fantastic elephant home that is leading the way in taking elephants away from a life of trekking and instead creating an environment where people can learn about and spend time with elephants on their terms, not ours! We’ll head slowly in convoy for the 20km or so to the elephant home giving all the opportunity to get some ‘road time’ and confidence. On arrival you'll get to meet the elephants and learn about their lives and the history of the home and what the team are doing. And then, after a tasty lunch at the home, it’s time to enjoy the company of these wonderful animals. You’ll be able to help feed them, get to know them and then walk with them (no riding allowed!) to the local river where you’ll be able to watch them enjoying themselves in the water. In the late afternoon we’ll have a change of pace as we float gently downstream on bamboo rafts before it’s then time for a late afternoon convoy as we head back to the base camp for dinner and getting ready for an adventurous day tomorrow. Inclusions: • Tuk Tuk and driver • Visits to waterfalls, a remote Hill Tribe village, elephant home experience and bamboo rafting • Breakfast, lunch and dinner • Twin / triple share accommodation in a beautiful resort in Mae Wang – air-conditioning, en-suite rooms (single occupancy rooms can be requested but a surcharge applies)"

        "description": "AND WE’RE OFF – DOI INTHANON HERE WE COME After an early breakfast you’re hitting the road and heading along small country roads towards Thailand’s highest mountain, Doi Inthanon. Your guide will be in the lead Tuk Tuk and everyone travels in convoy with the support vehicle at the rear (the support vehicle takes all your luggage, spare parts for the Tuk Tuks – always best to be prepared! – and huge amounts of water!). And note that each Tuk Tuk has a walkie talkie so not only can your guide let you know all sorts of information but you can also ask anything you need or simply chat to your fellow travellers! The first 20-30km of the route is simple with gentle curving roads but we soon hit stunning switch back bends, incredible scenery and tiny Karen hill tribe villages as we make our way towards the National Park. Enjoy the look of complete surprise from everyone as they see Tuk Tuks this far up in the mountains – trust us, novelty doesn’t not even begin to cover it – and you’ll stop frequently to have a look at different villages / views and of course to sample some of the great coffee and snacks in small villages. Lunch will be in a roadside snack bar – hearty Thai fare! You arrive at our accommodation mid-afternoon in the village of Mae Khlang Luang before jumping in another classic Thai mode of transport - a ‘Songtaew’ - a shared taxi adapted from a pick up truck, which drives us to the summit of Doi Inthaon (over 2,500 metres) where you’ll explore some of the trails and take in the views. This evening it’s time for a traditional Thai BBQ eaten over the rice fields as the sun sets over the mountains. Not a bad location to end the day! Inclusions: • Tuk Tuks and support vehicle • Breakfast, lunch and dinner • National Park entry fees • Twin shared accommodation in Doi Inthanon (single occupancy rooms can be requested for a small additional fee) – this is the most ‘basic’ of the accommodation but intentionally so to ensure you’re located in the most stunning area and perfectly located for the trek tomorrow.

Starting with a quick transfer by truck you then walk up into the forest led by a superb local guide (who knows everything about every tree and plant – and can spot a snake from miles away!) and then hike past stunning waterfalls, babbling rivers and under towering trees. There are a number of spots where you can cool off with a dip in the pools under the waterfalls and you’ll have a packed lunch (wrapped in leaves) in a clearing in the forest. The hike ends with a walk back down into the village where you stayed last night and there’s the chance to enjoy the freshest coffee around at a local old-style mountain coffee shop (it’s such a cool place we couldn’t possibly do it justice here!) NOTE – the trek / hike is suitable for all. The total distance is around 5-6km, we take it at a gentle place and after the initial uphill, the majority of the hike is flat or downhill This evening it’s time for another superb feast – again overlooking the rice terraces – and perhaps one or two well deserved cold beers!

Towering trees, steep hills and more than a few sharp curves are the order of the day and you’ll, as always, take frequent stops to enjoy the area, let the Tuk Tuk cool down and to allow traffic to pass (and see all taking photos of you as yet again everyone is stunned by the site to Tuk Tuks up here). You’ll arrive in Mae Sariang around mid-late afternoon and check into your superb riverside accommodation for the night – complete with lovely swimming pool by the river!

        "description": ": Wake up to the gentle sound of the waves before taking the ferry back to the mainland, where we continue our journey to Phnom Penh. The contrast is immediate, leaving behind the calm, palm-fringed beaches of Koh Rong Sanloem for the bustle and vibrancy of Cambodia's capital. The drive takes around three to four hours, bringing us into Phnom Penh by early afternoon. After checking into our centrally located hotel, we begin exploring the city in the most local way possible - by tuk-tuk. Our first stop is a serene local pagoda. Here, we take part in a private monk blessing ceremony, a meaningful and spiritual experience offering wishes of good health, happiness, and safe travels. In this tranquil setting, we'll learn about Buddhist rituals and receive a symbolic red blessing thread from the monks. From there, our tuk-tuks weave through the city streets to the Central Market (Phsar Thmey), an iconic Art Deco landmark alive with local life. Wandering its bustling aisles, we'll discover handicrafts, textiles, souvenirs, spices, and fresh produce. Along the way, we'll pause for a seasonal fruit tasting, sampling tropical favourites like mango, rambutan, mangosteen, and longan. And for the adventurous, when in season, the famously pungent durian - the 'King of Fruits' - awaits."

        "title": "Learn how to cook Khmer dishes and spend the afternoon exploring Phnom Penh",
        "description": ": We start the day with a visit to the local market, where stalls overflow with fresh herbs, fragrant spices, tropical fruits, and seasonal vegetables. Guided by a local chef, we'll shop for ingredients before learning how to prepare a traditional Khmer meal together. Cambodian cuisine is all about balance - sweet, sour, salty, and bitter flavours combine in dishes like fish amok (a coconut-based curry). Cooking and sharing this meal is a wonderful way to experience everyday Cambodian culture. The afternoon is free to explore Phnom Penh at your own pace. You may choose to visit the Royal Palace, with its gleaming golden spires and the Silver Pagoda, home to a stunning collection of Buddha statues. Nearby, the National Museum houses an extraordinary collection of Khmer art, from Angkorian statues to delicate carvings, offering insight into Cambodia's ancient heritage. For those who wish, a sobering but important visit to the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum (S-21) reveals Cambodia's more recent history under the Khmer Rouge - please note that the content can be emotionally challenging and not recommended for younger children. In the evening, you have the option to unwind on a sunset cruise along the Mekong River. Watch the city light up as the sun dips below the horizon, casting golden reflections on the water, a perfect way to close the day."

        "description": ": Today, we travel approximately five hours to Siem Reap, the gateway to the world-famous temples of Angkor. The drive offers a chance to take in the changing Cambodian landscape, from bustling towns to stretches of rice paddies dotted with sugar palms and traditional stilted houses. On the way, we stop for a boat cruise on Tonle Sap Lake, the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia and the lifeblood of the Cambodian people. As we glide across its waters, we'll see entire floating villages - complete with houses, schools, and shops - rising and falling with the lake's seasonal tides. It's a fascinating glimpse into a unique way of life that has existed here for generations, sustained by fishing and an intimate connection to the water. Once we arrive in Siem Reap, we visit the APOPO Visitor Centre, an inspiring and educational stop. Here, we'll learn about the organisation's incredible work using specially trained African giant pouched rats - nicknamed 'HeroRATs' - to safely detect landmines and unexploded ordnance. The visit includes a live demonstration where you can see the rats in action. It's a powerful, interactive experience that highlights Cambodia's resilience. In the evening, don't miss a performance by the Phare Cambodian Circus. More than just a circus, this is a powerful mix of theatre, acrobatics, dance, and live music - performed by talented young artists from disadvantaged backgrounds. It's a highlight for many visitors and a memorable celebration of Cambodian creativity and resilience."

        "description": ": Today is dedicated to exploring the magnificent temples of Angkor, the heart of Cambodia's ancient Khmer civilisation. We begin at Angkor Thom, the walled city and final capital of the Khmer Empire. Walk through the South Gate, lined with statues of gods and demons, and explore the Bayon Temple, known for its 54 towers covered with over 200 giant carved faces. Next, we visit Ta Prohm, the famous jungle temple, where ancient stone structures are intertwined with massive trees, showing how nature has reclaimed the temple over centuries. Wander the corridors at your own pace, observing the intricate carvings and dramatic root-covered ruins. After lunch, we continue to Angkor Wat, the largest religious monument in the world. Explore its galleries, spires, and detailed bas-reliefs while learning about the history and significance of the temple. We end the day there to watch the sunset, when the light casts soft shadows across the temple, highlighting its architectural details and giving a sense of the scale and craftsmanship of this historic site."

        "title": "Free day in Siem Reap",
        "description": ": Today is free to explore Siem Reap at your own pace, with several enriching optional experiences available. You could spend the morning in a local farming village about 10 km from the city, interacting with families and taking part in hands-on activities such as planting, harvesting, and watering crops. Travel around the village in a traditional ox and cart, moving gently along narrow paths, and enjoy a homemade lunch with the family. Alternatively, you might visit the Lotus Silk Farm just outside Siem Reap near Phnom Krom. This project provides vulnerable women with meaningful employment and sustainable income. Guided by experts, you can witness the process of transforming lotus fibres into silk and clothing, take a serene boat ride through the lotus fields, enjoy lotus cake and tea at the rooftop lounge with panoramic views, and even participate in hands-on workshops to create your own handicrafts, supporting the artisans' economic independence. For those wanting a full-day cultural excursion, travel to Kbal Spean, the 'River of a Thousand Lingas', set deep in the jungle with carved riverbeds and a refreshing waterfall. Continue to Banteay Srei, the 'Citadel of Women', built from pink sandstone and adorned with some of the most intricate carvings in the Angkor complex. The day concludes at Banteay Samre, a temple showcasing Khmer and Hindu architectural styles. Finally, art enthusiasts may prefer a visit to the Khmer Ceramics and Fine Arts Centre, where skilled artisans craft pottery and ceramics using traditional techniques. You can interact with the artists, try your hand at making your own piece, explore the gallery of sculptures and paintings, and browse the shop for unique souvenirs that reflect Cambodia's rich artistic heritage."

        "title": "Fly to Bangkok and experience the city on a tuk-tuk food tour",
        "description": ": Today, we say goodbye to Cambodia and our tour leader as we board a flight to Bangkok, Thailand's bustling capital. Upon arrival, we are warmly welcomed by our Thai tour leader, who transfers us to our hotel located in Chinatown. After settling in, our tour leader shares valuable tips for exploring the city. For those looking to experience the city in a more active and immersive way, one exciting option is to join a guided bike tour through Bangkok's quieter neighbourhoods. This ride takes you along narrow alleyways and peaceful canals, offering a glimpse into everyday life far from the tourist crowds. It's a unique way to see a different side of Bangkok, full of character and charm. Another fascinating way to explore the city is by taking a traditional longtail boat through Bangkok's intricate network of klongs, or canals. Gliding along the water, you'll discover a quieter, more authentic side of the city, where wooden stilt houses line the banks and life moves at a slower pace. As evening falls, we head to the Golden Mount, or Wat Saket, one of Bangkok's most revered temples, to enjoy panoramic sunset views over the city. The peaceful atmosphere and rhythmic chants of the monks create a sense of calm as the city lights begin to twinkle below. From there, we drive through the historic Rattanakosin district, passing some of Bangkok's most iconic landmarks beautifully illuminated against the night sky. Our next stop is Khao San Road, famous for its energetic vibe and lively mix of travellers, street performers, and vendors. We then cross the river to visit Wat Arun, the Temple of the Dawn, which looks breathtaking at night with its illuminated pagodas reflecting on the Chao Phraya River. The glowing temple creates a magical backdrop for photos and a moment of quiet admiration. Afterwards, we enjoy a delicious local street food dinner in Bangkok's Old Town, sampling some of the city's most beloved dishes from vendors who have perfected their recipes over generations. To end the evening, we make one final stop at the Flower Market, where the air is filled with the fragrance of fresh jasmine, orchids, and marigolds. The market is alive with activity as vendors prepare intricate floral garlands and bouquets for temples, hotels, and local households. It's a colourful and lively finale to a day filled with rich experiences and contrasts - the perfect introduction to the charm and rhythm of Bangkok before returning to our hotel for the night."

If your flight is departing later in the day, luggage storage facilities are available at our hotel. If you'd like an airport transfer today, you'll need to depart from Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK), which is a 45-minute drive from our hotel.

During this strictly hands-off experience, you’ll learn about the animals’ individual personalities and their complex social structures."

    "generalInfo": "Fly in to Bangkok to begin your adventure through Thailand, your first day on arrival will be at leisure to relax after your long-haul flights.<br/> <br/>Venture out in to the bustle of the city today with your guide to enjoy a food tour, sampling the famous street-food delicacies of Bangkok from stalls, markets and small shops. This evening you may like to visit Asiatique night market, a busy and vibrant entertainment area on the river, packed with market stalls, restaurants, and live entertainment. <br/><br/>Today explore the highlights of the city such as Wat Po and the Grand Palace, using a selection of public transport options; this is both a great introduction to the city and the country, and a chance to ask questions, as well as a good way to get to know the best ways to travel around the city. As the traffic is very busy in Bangkok, using the public river boats, the BTS sky train and tuk tuks locally are much more time and cost effective, as well as more eco-friendly. <br/><br/>After the busy centre of Bangkok, today enjoy some time in the surrounding countryside as you visit Bangkok's most unique markets. Whilst Damnoen Saduak is the most famous of Bangkok's floating markets, unfortunately it has now become very touristic and busy, losing much of its original charm. <br/>Because of this, instead you will visit Tha Kha floating market for the Authentic Thai Floating market experience and to see the locals selling their wares in this lively and visually exciting adventure. Overnight you will stay out in Amphawa, offering a chance to stroll around it’s canal walkways in the evening. <br/><br/>Travel down from Bangkok today to Kui Buri National Park. Upon arrival into Kui Buri you will enjoy a lunch and learn more about local village life in Thailand. Drop off your bags and freshen up before continuing to the National Park in a 4x4 open-air truck. Spend the afternoon in Kui Buri National Park with a local guide who will point out wildlife on the drive and search for herds of wild elephants. For dinner you will join a local farming family under the stars and stay overnight in a charming homestay. <br/><br/>This morning is an early start to enjoy sunrise from the rangers station, before enjoying a local tour to the village temple and a chance to meet some of the locals and learn about the community. After lunch you will transfer on to Kanchanaburi and the famous River Kwai. <br/><br/>After seeing wild elephants in Kui Buri, today you will have a chance to support their conservation and get a little closer to a small herd of rescue elephants at Elephants World - a sanctuary for sick, old and rescued elephants. Sure to be one of the most memorable days of your trip, this educational day offers the chance to meet these gentle giants as they go about their day. <br/><br/>The Kanchanaburi region is best known internationally from its history in the 1940s, when thousands of allied prisoners of war lost their lives building the Thai-Burma railway under Japanese occupation. You have some flexibility today with what you are most interested to do and see in the region to learn about the atrocious conditions and the tough work that these soldiers endured; you may want to visit the JEATH museum, Thai-Burma railway centre, or the interactive Hellfire pass museum – you will be able to discuss this with your guide. You may like to take a train across the infamous Bridge Over the River Kwai itself, as well as the Tha Kilen viaduct; the bridge was bombed in 1945 after just 22 months of use but has been rebuilt for use by tourists and trains since.<br/><br/>Departing Kanchanaburi, you will transfer on to Koh Samet by private car and boat to enjoy a few days of luxurious relaxation on this gorgeous national park island, located conveniently just 3 hours from Bangkok for your return flights home.",

The elephants are free to roam as they please - this is what sets this sanctuary apart and what makes it meet our animal welfare policy. It's worth bearing in mind that this is a working facility centre so our visit will need to fit around the elephant's daily needs. We're sure to get our fill of these majestic animals, spending time observing them from the viewing platform and taking a walk down the river, guided by the centre's staff. There are no elephant shows or riding here, the experience is all about spending quality time with these beautiful creatures and observing their natural behaviours while they're with their herd. After our visit, we'll return back to Chiang Mai to explore more of the captivating city. Founded in the 13th century, it's steeped in history - the old town is particularly charming thanks to its ancient walls and moats, filled with traditional temples like Wat Phra Singh and Wat Chedi Luang.

After visiting the site, we'll make our way to the small community of Naton Chan, a rural village set amongst lush rice paddies where we'll experience the warm hospitality of a homestay for the night. After being greeted by our hosts and having time to settle into our rooms, we'll head out to explore the village on foot. The villagers here still practice cottage industries, and as we walk from house to house we'll see how clothes are stitched on a bamboo sewing rig, cups and chopsticks are made from surrounding bamboo and ornaments are skilfully carved by local artisans. There will be plenty of opportunities to engage with the villagers whilst each of them demonstrates their craft. We'll return to our homestay for a sundowner and a hearty meal cooked by our hosts.

The market has been built, quite literally, on top of the railway and each time the provincial train rumbles through a mind-boggling spectacle unfolds; the shades and canopies are all folded back, produce is deftly rolled away from the tracks and the train slowly passes through, mere millimetres from the surrounding markets and vendors.

If you can pull yourself away from the curving coasts, Phuket also has a range of activities to fill your day, from Thai boxing exhibitions to cabaret shows. If you love getting out on the water and exploring the islands, then perhaps use your last day to take a daytrip to the Phi Phi Islands and Khai Nok – a tiny island surrounded by white sandy beach, perfect for swimming and snorkelling. If you want to spend some time with Thailand’s elephants, maybe visit the Phuket Elephant Sanctuary. Here, you can see the elephants in the safety and security of their natural home and get an insight into the behaviour and personal history of each elephant. Tonight, maybe get together with your fellow travellers for dinner and toast to a trip well travelled."

    "generalInfo": "On this Thailand wildlife holiday, elephants and waterfalls, just some of the highlights of this fantastic itinerary are exploring a vast nature reserve, getting up close and personal to elephants and swimming in waterfalls. This nature and cultural trip to Thailand is packed full of activities but by exploring a few areas, rather than being constantly on the move like many other adventure holidays, you’ll discover more of the country and get a bit of time to relax too. As a private tour, it can be taken at your own pace eg. walking<br/><br/>A perfect family adventure holiday, it is popular with families with younger children, as well as teenagers. It can be taken as an adults break, for friends travelling together or a couple, even a honeymoon with a difference. <br/><br/>The two-week tour starts with a whistle-stop visit to Bangkok to tick off the main sights before you venture into the nature and lush landscapes of northern Thailand. First stop, just outside Chiang Mai where you'll explore 10-tier waterfalls as songbirds and butterflies flit around you. You'll spend two days at a unique sanctuary for elephants, a far cry from the usual tourist experience - you'll learn how to care for elephants and fall asleep to the sound of them snoring. The next part of your trip is further north. Here, you'll trek up a mountain for spectacular views over Laos (Thailand's neighbour), bathe in hot springs and dine outdoors, under a blanket of sparkling stars. You'll also get to meet locals of all ages as a welcome friend (not a tourist). The last part of your holiday will be at Khao Yai National Park. This UNESCO World Heritage Site is a nature reserve, spanning over 2,000 square kilometers and is home to herds of wild elephants, clouded leopards and monkeys, as well a vast array of flora and fauna. You'll see over 2 million bats swarm out into the night, walk through the jungle and drive to the summit in an open-topped jeep. <br/><br/>We have included a summary of the tour (see below), please contact us to be sent the full itinerary via email. We have put a lot of thought into designing this trip, the itinerary can be customised. We can also happy to add a few days at a handpicked boutique beach resort. <br/><br/>All photos except the first two with thanks to our traveller Neil Spence (of Neil Spence Photography, London).",

There is opulence in the decoration but tranquility within the hall itself as the image overlooks with the gallery in the nirvana pose. In the morning, you can hear the harmonious chants of monks in dedicated piety echoing amongst the pillared interior."

In the early hours of the day, you will find yourself in the rush of the Floating Market at Damnoen Saduak. The aroma of the market is immediate, filled with fresh produce, from bananas to jackfruit, giving a creamy and semi-sweet scent to the air. The atmosphere is vivacious, as people on the riverbank shout to vendors on long-tail boats—their vessels almost overflowing with fruit and vegetables, seafood, and flowers. Over the exuberant crowd of locals that come to do their daily shopping, you can hear the sizzle of woks frying up coconut and bananas, prawns, and more. The vendors place the food within a bag, hook the bag to a long stick, and guide the sumptuous cuisine to the happy patron. In the early afternoon, you will come to the peaceful town of Kanchanaburi known for its quiet river that was once home to egregious Japanese occupants during World War II. The movie The Bridge Over River Kwai highlighted the contemporary history of the town whose beauty was once overshadowed by its past. The JEATH War Museum gives a remarkable account of the city, the soldiers, and the Prisoners of War during the city’s occupation. JEATH stands for Japan, America, Australia, Thailand, and Holland, which represents the nationalities of all prisoners, and more, who were forced to work on the railroad system meant carve through the treacherous pass into Burma. Found within the temple Wat Chai Chumphon, the current Chief Abbot is responsible for the museum’s upkeep, from the bamboo stages to the photos documenting the infamous project. The river is calm and gentle, forging the stunning countryside, reminding locals and visitors of the promising future that can arise from a questionable past."

Along the summit of Doi Suthep, you will come to the fabulous temple where over 300 steps, flanked by colorful serpents, will guide you to the lower terrace of the stunning religious center that overlooks the cityscape.

Samut Songkhram is the coconut plantation district where the fields of lush crop stripe the sky. The sweet scent of coconut milk surrounds the district. You can watch the locals demonstrate how to make coconut sugar. Although sugar cane and brown sugar have all but replaced the coconut sugar, you can imagine the enhanced curry, or the sweet tea, just by the way the fragrance of the drying fruit beckons you. As you come closer to Bangkok you can see the remarkable salt farms that stretch along the marshes. Pools of water are partitioned, eventually evaporating leaving salt ready for the harvest.

A visit to the Death Railway Museum is an interesting way to witness the history of the city, international troops, and the way that the past can be remembered. Around 61,000 Allied prisoners were transferred to the city throughout the war for the purpose of building a railway for the Japanese from Bangkok, Thailand to Rangoon, Myanmar. The museum houses many photos and personal stories from prisoners of war that give greater detail to the tragedies that befell the area.

Situated within Khao Luang National Park, the lavish landscape of the mountain’s peak is only the beginning as you make your way into the stellar natural scenery that is home to tigers, cloud leopards, and over two hundred types of birds. The bright coloration of orchids, from pink to white, yellow to purple, blossoms throughout the canopy. The scent of fern and rhododendrons is inescapably blissful. Soon you will find yourself at Krung Ching Waterfall, an impressive display of nature that sweeps between the crevice of the pressing mountains. Just after the rainy season the waterfall is an empowering display of nature, with a sound that resounds beneath the canopy and a rush that shrouds the mixture of craggy greenery. In the dryer season the falls are still lovely in their magnitude if not their force, winding down into the pool below as the sounds of the jungle combine with the splash."

After breakfast you will venture out into the city to find the spectacular culture of Bangkok’s history and modernity thriving all around you. Cruise along the river, wading between the wide shores of the city and arriving at the shimmering temple of Wat Arun, built between 1809 and 1851. The atmosphere is quiet and welcoming. The architecture breathes life into the city. A moment ago you couldn’t see past the skyscrapers; now before you is an immaculate façade with concentric circular shapes speckled with glass giving it a sparkling quality that mesmerizes you as you look upon its towering frame. Once you reach the shores of the Grand Palace the manicured garden sweeps around stunning temples and grandiose royal lodging. Construction began under King Rama I and has since displayed such spectacular culture such as Wat Phra Kaew, housing the famous Emerald Buddha, the symbol of Thailand. On a pedestal at the center of the far wall you will once again discover a shining example of the country; the Buddha sits poised in enlightenment, draped in one of three different robes that the king replaces with the seasons. The air is calm and touched with incense as every moment brings a new and wonderful encounter."

Visiting Wat Saket brings you to the steps of the Golden Mountain, an artificial hill that is gilded by a 260 foot pagoda. The inspiring golden spire was once the highest point in the city and dates back to the empire of Siam and was restored in the late 18th and early 19th century. The greenery is like an oasis, offering pleasured shade within the warmth of the city’s overlaying heat. The tranquil atmosphere brings you to a lining of brass bells rung for blessings and prayer and eventually to the temple itself. The temple of Ratchanatdaram is also known as Loha Prasart , meaning, “Metal Palace.” With no shortage of splendid temples, you will find the elegance of the Metal Castle to be amongst the wonders of the city. Inspired by temples in India and Sri Lanka and built in the mid-19th century, the temple rises over 118 feet with 37 metal spires that represent the various virtues of enlightenment. The structure rises in concentric square levels on geometrically supporting pillars. Stroll through the alleyways that have been created by the vast amount of pillars and where history, from architecture to religion, resides. After your tour, you will make your way to the airport and arrive in Chiang Rai by afternoon. Let yourself get acquainted with the comforts of your hotel, situated within the open space of a jungle-clad city. The pool is decorated with lily pads, rushing like an infinity pool that overlooks the river. Each room is plush, whether overlooking the pool or the greenery where the northern expanse is never too far away."

However, outside the city you can still find the traditional communities that persist in their villages throughout the countryside. The Akha is originally from Tibet and can be found along the rolling plush hills throughout Southeast Asia. The villages tend to rise on stilts, climbing and falling with the landscape, draped in woven straw. The women have colorful dress, from dangling strings to graceful headgear. They thread cotton with a hand spindle and eventually dye their clothing with indigos and vibrant colors. Along Mae Sai, the most northern point of Thailand, you can see the point where Burma and Thailand converge; there are also wonderful goods from the market to be found that have crossed from Laos and Burma."

The village itself resembles many others in the countryside sweeping across the forested landscape; however, the people are remarkably diverse in their traditions. There is a scent of cooking wood and timber that fills the trees. Many women have worn the brass rings since the age of five giving a giraffe-like shape to their shoulders and upward, all while wearing colorful and rosy headwear.

Whitewashed pagodas are built in Lanna style with exquisite detail that gives a shimmering quality to the façade. Step into the assembly hall, an open air-pavilion with low comprehensive roofs and sweeping terraces. Assembly halls are generally closed-sided; however, the open-sided structure gives a unique quality and superb view to the structure where two focused Buddha images face opposite directions, one meditating, the other standing. Sitting at the top of Doi Suthep Mountain is the sacred site of Wat Prhathat, also known as temple Doi Suthep. Built in the 14th century, the temple stands at the mountain’s summit and watches over Chiang Mai like a vigilant protector. Stand at the first of over 300 steps, flanked by vivacious greenery and snarling serpent creatures that run the gambit of the stairway.

Monks stroll through the streets in orange robes giving a spectral atmosphere to the towering, powerful stone ruins. The reddish hue that colors the concentric spires of Wat Chai Wattanaram display a collective uniqueness in what time and the elements can do to what were once grandiose creations. There is a scent of warm earth and drifting leaves. You will also notice Wat Mahthat, where the famous tree roots have enraptured a sole head of a Buddha image, enshrouding the semi-smiling face within the earth. As you make your way back to Bangkok you will board the Grand Pearl, a river cruise which will have you drifting along the Chao Phraya River beside wonderful landscapes displaying Thailand’s everyday life.

For a unique experience in Krabi you can step out of Railay Beach, where the powdery white sand helps bring the heat beneath your toes and a soothing touch from the cool water, and into Ao Thalane. The water curves its way around towering limestone karsts with a cold touch and gentle current. The trees hover over the water, dangling down and brushing the water’s surface. The bay tends to shift from dripping limestone and deep crystal surface to jungle branches and vivacious monkeys. When low tide brings the water to a non-traversable low you will see one of the most impressive displays of nature: the walking fish, or ambulatory fish, which uses its fins to walk from puddle to puddle in the dense mud of the bay.

The mountains overlook the cityscape while the trees add vibrant greenery sweeping through neighborhoods and along the old fortress that brings the past to life. You will be met at the airport by a private transfer and taken to your hotel where you can get situated, acclimating to the new city and the diverse streets. You will soon be picked up at your hotel by a traditional trishaw that will take you outside of the city walls to Wat Phra Singh, Temple of the Lion Buddha. The temple was constructed in the 14th century and continues to house two medieval Buddha statues. The complex is a major monastery accommodating around 700 monks who are always eager to practice their English with visitors. Step into Viharn Luang, the largest building on site, where you will find a three-aisled interior with a high red roof that stands out against the large white pillars. At the distant wall you can see a large Buddha cast in gold and copper seated in the enlightened position and glistening in the light. The monastic library seems small in comparison to the previous large hall but is interesting in its intricacy and architecture. The stone base helps protect manuscripts from pests and floods and is decorated with reliefs of Buddhist spirits and adorned with a wooden top tier. Continue onward to a White Hmong village tribe known as Chang Khien. The lush greenery wraps around you and the scent of fresh jungle lifts into the air. The children are shy, wrapped in their vivacious clothing of colorful tapestries shimmering against black cloth. Flowers often grow in vibrant, wild colors around you as you learn about the traditions of the village and the people that have persevered over the centuries of regime, border, and cultural changes. Just before dusk you will come to the steps of Doi Suthep, the mountain overlooking Chiang Mai and the jungle beyond. The temple at the summit was built in the 14th century. The cool breeze brushes through the trees as you come to the snake figures that guard the 300 steps which lead to the temple’s base and line the stairway. At the center of upper terrace you will find the great chedi , a later expansion of the original ornament where a gold plated temple resembles what was once considered the greatest temple in the area, Wat Phra That Haripunjaya. From the lower terrace you can watch the sunset blaze a classic orange over the horizon."

In the village you will witness traditions that date back over 300 years from the mountains of Tibet. The village sits along the rolling jungle landscape, often rising over the land on stilts and climbing up the hillside. Although the people are found in northern Thailand they maintain their traditions and culture that date back to their roots, which also means stemming the tide of western influences. Along the ride you will venture through the fabulous trees, which open up to effervescent fields, before arriving at the Mae Taeng River. Enter an elephant sanctuary, where you will meet a fantastic elephant that will be your new guide within the jungle sprawl. The elephant continues to be a treasured symbol of Thai culture, thought to bring luck and prosperity to the people. Elephants in the sanctuary are often rescued from the logging industry or from circus and riding camps. Visiting a sanctuary offers the remarkable experience of hand-feeding, petting, and trekking in the jungle alongside the herd, as well as the opportunity to bathe them. Once at the river’s edge, you will have an easy course in safety before boarding a rubber raft and enjoying the adventure downriver. The rush of the river, and of adrenaline, combine to bring the family together in an awesome display of nature, from whitewater to landscape. Follow your guide’s instructions as you dip into the water, run over slippery rocks, and slide down rapids. In the calm expanses, you can jump into the water for a refreshing soak, drifting next to the raft and downriver.

The locals are friendly, quick to smile, and always ready to help. You have found a slower pace to life within the streets of Pai, where almost every café has a section of hammocks and the food is as important as air.

A small fence runs the length of the crack where you can look over into the crevice. Stroll next to the land crack and beyond to see the gorgeous landscape in the distance, the fragrant trees and pillow-like landscape, including a reflective lake. Whether en route to or from Pam Bok Waterfall, you can enjoy a relaxing moment with a friendly smile and the fresh air. Pam Bok Waterfall is a perfect representation of Pai, a spot easy enough to find if you are looking for it but hidden from those that are unaware of its beauty. The water tumbles down between towering rocks into a pool situated below. You can sit in the pool, nice and deep in the rainy season, and watch the water flow off of the high cliff.

The river’s prominence is illustrated by the location of Bangkok’s most important historical attractions. Almost all of them are on the water, from the Royal Palace and Wat Po, to the towering Temple of Dawn that you will cruise past this afternoon. Public boats run up and down the river, bringing with them a riot of color and enthusiasm. Narrow long-tail boats carry everything from vegetables to monks. On the riverbank, you can still find iconic bamboo buildings, even if the other riverbank features contemporary hotels and towers. After an airport meet and greet plus time to relax in a five-star riverside hotel, you will immerse yourself in Bangkok with a river journey. You will cruise in luxury on a floating restaurant that is occasionally visited by royalty. Inside air-conditioned comfort, you will watch the city roll by. This as an excellent and effortless way to gain first impressions. You can take in all the wonderful colors and sights without being overawed by traffic and noise. Entertainment will be provided during intervals between courses, taking you on a journey to various Thai regions. Think dancing, singing, and theatrical shows that involve people and puppets.

Getting around all three places will take approximately three hours. You will return to the hotel for lunch by the pool and relax, taking a break from the noise and heat. Bangkok can be an overwhelming city if you try to do too much, especially for senior travelers. It is better to go out exploring in the cooler and quieter morning hours before resting up along the river. Stay on the water this afternoon with an experience completely different from yesterday. This time you cruise in a long-tail boat, which is a narrow, streamlined vessel that can access the city’s back-canals and historic waterways. In this area, you pass floating markets and other long-tail boats laden with fruit and goods for the market. Bamboo and wooden houses may roll by, occasionally covering a water buffalo beneath them. One stop is a puppeteer, where you will admire the puppets as they narrate a poignant Bangkok tale. You will be back at the hotel by dusk time, and there are many good restaurants in your vicinity."

This northern city has also been central to evolving Thai massages and spa techniques, which makes it inconceivable to come here and not enjoy the spa experience. This afternoon you will tour the old city and will cover key sights and stories that lay within the crumbling city walls. Visitors love Chiang Mai’s unpreserved feel. While some monuments are slowly being returned to their complete grandeur, you will get a real sense for old this city is, along with how it was cut off from the rest of Siam for most of its history. Evenings are always relaxed here, so after the guided tour you can try one of the small terraced restaurants, or you can take a walk through the night market."

This remote and somewhat inaccessible land is the home to a dozen different hill tribes, each with a culture that is quite distinct from the city itself. Influence comes from all over, and some of the hill tribes have populations in neighboring countries as well. The most numerous are the Karen, who are internationally famous for their long-necked women, particularly their elaborate neck decoration that sets them apart from others. Other hill tribes are not as glamorous or immediately photogenic as the Karen. With a local guide, you will visit three different hill tribes and meet with a community leader in each. This is not a point-and-shoot camera exercise, as there are certain hill tribe villages that invite tourists purely to have their photo taken in exchange for a fee. Instead, you visit traditional communities that provide an eye-opening look into a life that is beyond modern comprehension. Exploring how these cultures are changing is another vital part of the experience. Back in Chiang Mai, there is time for another spa treatment before heading to Doi Suthep, which is a glowing temple atop a hill above the city. There are hundreds of steps to the summit but don’t worry if you can’t manage them, it is still impressive to check out the atmosphere and chedi at the site’s base. You will witness monks chanting, bells ringing, prayer wheels spinning, and a sunset ceremony that sends incense spiraling through the air."

Animals rest, sounds evaporate, and you can relax in the spa, or wherever strikes your fancy. This afternoon you will meet jungle giants, as you join an elephant herd that lives around the camp. These are not working elephants, and they have free reign to explore the jungle; however, they are fed and cared for by hand, which makes them open to regular human contact. The experience can be as active or as laid-back as you wish, from simply admiring elephants meandering through the jungle, to feeding them fruit and receiving a soft trunk pat on your head.

Wat Mahathat is over 600 years old and was once the home to the Supreme Patriarch leader of the Thai Buddhist monks. The manicured grass gives a manufactured structure to the sandstone, where the colors of the ruins shift from white to deep brown stone and back again. The Temple of the Great Relics, as it is called in English, continues to inspire with the elegance of its remains. A Buddha sculpture proudly sits on a platform, legs crossed, and hands placed by his knees. A large swath of yellow cloth is draped across his body as he is forever poised in the moment of enlightenment. A large tree has its roots dangling and tangling out of the ground; it looks as though the tree’s trunk is made of a collection of vines. Look deeper within the tangle and you can see the famed Buddha Head hidden within the niches of the tree. No one is certain how the head became wrapped up in the vines but, as Buddha’s slight smile peers at you from within the dangling roots, there is an ease to the moment, where the sun dimmer, the shade feels cooler, and the world offers you a moment to take a deep breath.

The water is three shades of blue, ranging from nearly clear to sapphire, sitting beneath the rising green of the jungle island. With many shores to visit, you first step along the sands of Monkey Beach where the primates hide within the trees and lurk within the branches. Over the years they have become less shy and coarser, scouring for food within the visitors. The long-tailed macaque monkeys are dark gray with faces like sour men, and they reach for bananas or chocolate, taking their treasures and jumping nimbly onto the rocks, scared of the surf. Along the shores of Koh Phi Phi Leh you can see the familiar beach that was home to Leonardo Dicaprio in the film The Beach . Enter into Maya Bay where the limestone karsts are bright and majestic, capturing your imagination and making you wonder if you may be dreaming. The natural beauty is unparalleled, from the clear water that allows you to see to the ocean floor to the rising precipices that are capped with stellar greenery, and powdery white sands that make the beach nothing but inviting. The beach faces the entrance of the bay where you can dive into the water and watch the colorful fish swim in huddled schools.

Others are cracked or laying in pieces, suggestive of their 13th-century origins. There are almost 200 in total, and your photographs will be very impressive, especially in the light of the morning. Mosaic patterns are faded, yet impressive, on the temple walls. Some temples have been expertly restored, Wat Sri Chum showcasing the grandeur of the kingdom’s first capital, with Buddhas sitting serenely in structures of moss-scorched rock. After lunch, there will be time to rest before you continue the historical experience, wandering through columns to Wat Mahathat and its 200 subordinate stupas. Find a dreamy place for sunset and finish the day with a real understanding of what it must have been like to be here 800 years ago."

Rich details line the facade, with mosaic stories sculpted into rock. Once inside, it is simple and spiritual with aromas of incense casting Buddha images into a slight haze. This Wat Phra That Lampang Luang temple is an easy stop on the 3 ½ hour journey north to Chiang Mai, where you will check into a spa retreat just outside the city. After a few days on the road, it will be time to indulge. But not before watching the sunset from Chiang Mai’s famous hilltop temple, a cacophony of ringing bells marking the transition from day to night."

        "description": "Chiang Mai is Siam’s cultural heart. Until the 1920s it was cut off from the world, hidden in a forest that was only accessible on elephant back or a tortuous upriver journey. The city walls still stand, protected by a moss-filled moat as red-brick temples meet whitewashed pagodas and locals ring their bicycle bells. Life is slow and serene here, illustrated by the lines of monks you always see on the streets. Ballooning over Chiang Mai provides an excellent understanding of the city’s location, and you can cruise above the mountainous forest with nothing but nature beyond the city boundaries. As you drift, there will be more. Beneath your feet, there are temples, their abundance almost baffling when seen from the air. This slow mode of sunrise travel leads into a leisurely day spent around the spa, and then at some small villages in Mae Taeng. Traditions live on in this region, and a community host will guide you through basket weaving, farming, cooking, and music. Although these villages have turned to tourism in recent years, they remain a hospitable and accessible way to explore old Siam culture. Plus you can easily take a hike through the nearby rice paddies, past buffalos plowing fields to small waterfalls."

They are asking for alms, an evocative morning scene of local people supporting the city’s monks. It will be worth the early alarm call, and you will have the rest of the morning to lie down again, perhaps with another spa retreat or just around the pool. This afternoon will bring another evocative scene as elephants wander the forests of Doi Suthep as gibbons swing through the trees. Rather than ride the elephants, you will walk with them in the forest and connect with giants while searching for primates."

There is a Nemo and a Coca-Cola can as well alongside all manner of figures and icons from the contemporary world. Head inside, and the artistic style continues as an allegory of past and future, good and bad, spiritualism and commercialism. The temple itself is more like a palace, shimmering an intense white hue. Serpents and tridents are carved into this stone, marking a bridge you must cross to reach fictional superheroes. This temple is more an art gallery than a place of worship, and is completely unlike any other in Southeast Asia, something that has attracted plaudits and critics in equal measure. Stop at the White Temple on your two-hour drive north to Chiang Rai, a small and authentic border city that is ideal for your final day in Thailand. Like Chiang Mai and Bangkok, Chiang Rai has night markets, temples, tuk tuks, colorful storefronts, and the country’s exotic allure, but it is not yet too popular. There are not many other travelers at the night market, and you can get a sense of how Thailand used to be, before its popularity. Chiang Rai has now been connected to the country with a domestic airport, making it an even more appealing proposition."

The edifice represents the spirit of Thai Buddhism, united in the holy image of the Emerald Buddha. The temple was consecrated in the late 18th century after the capital moved from Ayutthaya to Bangkok. 178 murals depict the Ramakian, the Thai version of the Indian epic. Once inside the temple, you will find the scent of incense lingering in the air as the Emerald Buddha sits atop a golden shrine to create a striking figure within the flickering candles and natural light."

Rice paddies line low-lying slopes, which are ferociously green for eight months of the year. If you land in Bangkok, it is hard to see much of the smog. Chiang Mai is cut adrift from the bustling city life; it was cut off from the rest of Siam until the 1920s, which means its culture has survived invasions from the Burmese, among others. When you touch down it will seem like you are in a small town, as you will experience a handful of quiet streets nestled beside a shady canopy of trees. Chiang Mai is much larger than it initially seems, however, you will probably only see the interesting old neighborhoods and a tranquil areas along the river. After a long flight, this is an ideal place to land. You will be greeted at the airport and then transferred to a hotel on the riverbank, which is a five-star retreat that is hidden away from the rest of the population. Check in to the suite and relax. You may also wander to the on-site spa and settle into a one-hour couple’s treatment, which has an array of packages to choose from. Chiang Mai is Thailand’s spa hub, and there is a variety of traditional and contemporary treatments, as well as Thai fusion options. You will continue to relax around the pool and in the suite, perhaps just laying back on the balcony as the river curves before your eyes. Chiang Mai is considered Thailand’s cultural hub as well. In reality, Bangkok has just as much to see, but other destinations must contest the claim. The attraction in Chiang Mai is how easy it is to experience this culture. It is an old walled city with pedestrianized streets that lead to night markets and ruined temples. This is a city where you will walk through the culture rather than drive to isolated attractions. Such a way of exploration will really help you feel immersed in the Thai culture, from a spiritual history to an enthusiastic way of life that continues to be based on traditions. You will find old Chiang Mai is a beautiful place to get lost while walking hand in hand."

It is a giant more than twice your height and many times your combined weight. Yet, the elephants here are incredibly timid and peaceful. They live a slow, relaxed life and have a long connection with their mahout (elephant driver). Later, you will meet with the mahout and learn a handful of signals to be used when you are aboard the pachyderm. Greet your elephant and ride into the jungle that both of you will ride. It is a safe and intimate connection, as the elephant will effortlessly carry your weight. From this vantage point, you will enjoy views into the jungle where monkeys and gibbons swing about the canopies. You will stay on the elephant as it trods into the water and playfully squirts water aimlessly. Bath-time is always cause for excitement and enthusiasm as this is one of the most intimate experiences you will have with these magnificent creatures. Then, on your way back to base you will stop at a small waterfall for a romantic couple’s picnic deep in the trees. After most of the day in the jungle, you will visit a monastery late in the afternoon. Incense tends to linger, as the aroma will then entice you into a simple room.

Here, a monk will greet you. Sitting cross-legged in front of him, you will receive a couple’s blessing; regardless of your religious beliefs, this is always an interesting and eye-opening experience.

        "description": "A different world awaits in Railay. Railay is home to palm trees and vertical cliffs where white beaches hide and become cut off at high tide. Getting here is simple. You will fly directly to Krabi before you will be transferred privately by car and boat to a resort that feels impossibly opulent. You will be staying at one of Thailand’s ultimate beach retreats, which is a retreat that is far enough away from the popularity of Railay’s main beach for some romantic seclusion. Tucked away here, you will have everything you need: just the two of you, a sublime setting, all the modern amenities, yet none of the crowds. So, check in, indulge, and relax. Here, you may descend steep steps to the mostly private beach, find personal viewpoints along the cliffs and between the trees, and relax in your room with endless Andaman Sea views from the patio."

You may wake up late, order breakfast to the room, take a barefooted stroll to the beach, and dip into calm turquoise waters. You have gone from experiencing the culture to walking along the beach, and it is time to indulge in Thailand’s classical offering. Most couples that stay here choose to do nothing. There is no need to search for activities when so much is on your doorstep: white-sand beaches, thick jungles, tropical waters, and a feeling of privacy that you will not even be able to get at home. All meals will be included in your package, and these can be ordered to the room with a wide-ranging menu to pick from. If you can sacrifice an hour of lounging around, there are beautiful and secluded places to go and to see. You can strap on a decent pair of cross trainers and hike up to a viewpoint where there are stunning views over Railay and nearby Krabi. If you climb down the other side, a lagoon awaits, and its waters are a soft turquoise hue. Local food stalls litter the lagoon entrance that specializes in condensed milk pancakes. You can also book locally-guided activities on land and water that are arranged easily at the resort on the day you would like to go, so there is no need to book ahead and reserve a spot. When it is a romantic retreat like this, there is no need to plan too much, especially when the atmosphere is so tranquil and serene."

You will be greeted at the port and head to a small boutique cafe for coffee, perhaps a cake, or even lunch. The guide will introduce you to the island and the experiences that can be had there. You can plan a day that is as active or a relaxed as you like. Stroll around Lanta Old Town in the South, where you will follow the sea breeze to street-side restaurants and charming old architecture. You may wander among old fishing houses that are built out of sticks that jut out into the Andaman. Most couples like to spend the afternoon on the island’s beaches, and there are plenty to choose from. Some are lively, especially geared for sunset cocktails and dancing with your feet in the sand, while others are more escapist driven, which specializes in getting away from the world.

        "description": "This morning, you will head out by speedboat to a famous island. Koh Samui was the first Thai island to really grasp international attention, and it has become one of the country’s most popular destinations for backpackers, couples, families, divers, and just about every other possible visitor. Fortunately, the island is large enough to absorb them all. Over the last two decades, Koh Samui has developed specific enclaves that are popular dependent on who you are. It is on the quietest side of the island where you will find the smaller, boutique resorts, as well as those more suitable for couples. From Krabi, there is a direct flight to Koh Samui. From here it is a 45-minute transfer to the resort. Check in, check out the view, remove your shoes, and forget about the world. From the room, you will walk barefoot on to the beach, where the white sand twinkles beneath the sun. There is snorkeling available right from the beach, as well as more adventurous snorkeling by boat. Palm trees provide shade even during the sunniest of days so you can rest up on the sand or choose the privacy of your personal terrace. The beach is not private per se, but it is cut off from the road and difficult to reach unless you are staying at the resort. All meals will be included in your package, and there will be flexibility over when and where you would like to dine. This could be on the beach, beneath the stars, surrounded by lanterns on your terrace, in one of the restaurants, or another romantic spot that you and your partner have developed an affinity for. These two days are left completely free, and most couples staying at the resort do not go further than the beach. You can walk nearby jungle trails without a guide, or you can book something locally, such as a jungle safari tour, visits to mountain farms and waterfalls, or the crimson temple of Wat Sila Ngu, which stands directly on the cliffs above the ocean. It is all up to you, and Koh Samui is the sort of place where you never feel guilty about spending a long time doing nothing: this is what a romantic vacation is all about."

Small bamboo houses will line the water as boats chug tenderly towards the market. Many of the long-tail boats are punted or paddled, especially as you get deeper into the canals.

Its night market is a wonderful place to hang out with aromatic food stalls, live dance performances, and the social atmosphere of a city that loves to socialize.

Other hill tribes dot these hills, and you can spend an afternoon with two of them. The Kayan are the most numerous, who famous for their long-necked women. You will need an excellent guide and community host to understand their culture, especially if you wish to experience more than a few photos. Later, compare the Kayan’s rather extravagant style to the less showy style of a different tribe. As with other days on this tour, you will see how old traditions are being proudly kept alive and turned into vestiges of culture that is then passed through many generations."

        "description": "Onwards you will travel through Northern Thailand, connecting the old with the new, and always having an eye on tradition. Just outside Chiang Rai lies the White Temple, a fantastic art piece designed by Chalermchai Kositpipat. Super heroes are painted on the temple wall, which is part of an allegory to religion in a changing time. A dazzling white bridge will take you there, and then you will wander through a gallery of rich art works. A sacred cave can be found here, and it is very atmospheric and alluring as it extends into a mountain. You can imagine people worshipping thousands of years ago, or perhaps you may even see people worshipping within the gloomy space. It’s 2 ½ hours by road to Chiang Mai, although the journey takes most of the day. There are many rural hill tribe villages to be seen along the way, and the guide will customize the trip to your interests, stopping at villages and cultures that are of most personal interest. You will check into Chiang Mai and head straight to northern Thailand’s most important temple, Wat Phra That Doi Suthep. As bells ring and prayer wheels turn, you will get lost in the spiritual ambiance. The views are exceptional from this mountaintop temple, but it is the energy you remember, so many local believers turn Wat Phra That Doi Suthep into a very moving and emotional place to be."

Instead, you will have most of today to explore a city that was cut off from the rest of Siam until the 1920s. The city remains behind walls, even if these walls are aged and cracked. Once inside, there is little traffic. It is a low-slung city, dotted with small temples and interesting back lanes. With a guide this is a place of stories, and just like every day on this seven-day Thailand tour, the stories make the destination come alive. Late check-out will be arranged, so after a day of exploring you can freshen up before departing."

Surrounded by green and tucked between mountain folds, this old city was cut off from the world for most of its history. Only by elephant back or tortuous upriver cruising could you reach it, meaning Chiang Mai was saved from the Burmese and Angkor raids that devastated cities like Sukhothai and Ayutthaya. It was only in the 1920s that Europeans made it here, but small hill tribes have always used Chiang Mai as a trading post, giving the city an ethnically diverse flavor. You will see many different faces and clothes along the streets, a testament to Chiang Mai’s continued domain as Thailand’s cultural hub. You will be greeted at the airport and transferred to your hotel that is within the old city walls. Most of the surrounding area is pedestrianized, characterized by narrow cobblestone lanes, small shops and cafes, and the odd, intriguing temple. The city is a quiet place for easing into the Thai experience, with monks on the streets and many cafe corners for watching the world go by. Your guide will take you to Doi Suthep this evening. Walk up a few hundred steps, see the spinning prayer wheels and listen to chiming bells as you go. Sunset is magical up here, especially as pilgrims help create a spiritual atmosphere."

        "description": "Head north this morning, and the road to Chiang Rai is covered with small wooden villages and the peculiar outpost that is Wat Rong Khun. This modern temple appears more like the palace of a snow queen, dazzling white and connected by bridges. Strange sculpted flourishes mark the exterior, with serpents and other creatures not typically seen in Buddhist temples. The interior murals are an allegory to modern life, stretching from enlightenment down through commercialization and the idolization of false heroes, as illustrated by Superman and Nemo among other painted characters. There really is no other temple like this one, and it is changing every year as artist Chalermchai Kositpipat adding more to his controversial creation. Continue north to the Golden Triangle, a misty swathe of jungle where Thailand meets Laos and Myanmar. With a short boat ride across the Mekong River, you can reach Laos, bringing another stamp in the passport and a local market experience. Back in Thailand, the Hall of Opium Museum tells a harrowing tale of the Golden Triangle’s important role in world history, particularly how it helped to fund colonial empires. This is a relatively long day, but it’s worth making the drive back to Chiang Mai rather than spending the night. You should arrive back in time for the night market, where hundreds of small stalls cook up regional gastronomy."

Or sleep in, ignoring the chime of temple bells – there will be plenty of monks with seven days in Thailand. In a small yellow tuk tuk, you can take a tour of the city, your guide helping to connect the historical eras as you piece together Chiang Mai’s seven centuries. There is nothing too ostentatious here. The temples you visit are working, breathing places of worship, where monks and locals can be seen beneath Buddha images. Step inside one of these temples, and its cavernous red-brick design will bring respite from the midday heat. In a small aromatic room, you can sit cross-legged with a monk, receiving a blessing as swirls of incense cascade through the air. Regardless of any religious beliefs, this is a powerful experience and a chance to glimpse into the everyday life of a temple and the equanimity of those who reside there. The rest of the afternoon and evening are left free so that you can determine your plans at your leisure. Chiang Mai is also well known for its spas, so several options abound if you would like to go that direction, or you can visit the night market as it moves locations through the week, so you should be walking a different street of traders and food stands tonight."

Each is a little different from the next, and some have particularly unusual traditions. Perhaps the most famous are the Karen, those of the elongated necks. The Karen are also the most numerous people here, and it is essential to have a good guide. Some villages are little more than amusement parks with tourists happily snapping photos, while other villages are less photogenic, yet far more authentic with a chance to really understand the history behind the traditions. Karen are just one of many. As the road twists towards Lampang, you can stop at two other hill tribe villages as your guide offers a selection of experiences depending on who and what you want to see. By mid-afternoon, you will be in Lampang, where a grand 15th-century temple is covered in mosaics, and another temple hides the most exquisite Buddha images. As before, the sights will continue as you travel onwards to Sukhothai and a hotel on the edge of the UNESCO World Heritage area. By now, it will be dusk, and the temples will be seen as silhouettes, proudly cast against a changing night sky."

Temples rise from the shadows, suggestive of an early medieval century. Most of this city was built between the 13th and 15th centuries, a time when it was capital of a kingdom by the same name. At first, you will admire a handful of temples. But as this day continues, you will be in awe at the scale of Sukhothai. Wat Sri Chum and Wat Sri Sawai are temples on a phenomenal scale while Sri Satchanalai is more than large enough to hide its secrets. You will have options today, and it is good to combine different modes of exploration. A bicycle is the most relaxing way to get around the entire site in a day. Walking is possible and best combined with the tram so that you can disembark to clusters of temples and important sites. It is also worth taking a break in the middle of the day to let the heat pass and reflect on what you’ve seen.

Begin with Wat Po as monks wander and a breathtaking Buddha reclines with well over 100 feet of sculpture shimmering softly. Move next to the Royal Palace, opulent yet simple in its own way for an insight into regal tastes that is entirely different from those in Europe. There is also the Emerald Buddha, an exquisitely carved symbol of Thailand. By the time you have finished with these three sights, you can check into the hotel and freshen up, and have lunch with a beautiful view over the Chao Phraya River. While Bangkok has become a giant of a city and is more developed than the rest of the world gives credit, it retains a local feel. To head out into the city’s outskirts, you must travel by water, first down the Chao Phraya and then switching onto a small boat that can navigate a maze of canals. It is here that you will see impromptu markets inside boats, and bamboo villages that overflow with waving children and roving buffalo. In just an hour, you will be a million miles from skyscrapers. Put your feet up, watch the world slowly roll by, and drift into the depths of old Bangkok.

The June Bahtra eases through the glass-clear water where various shades of blue shimmer in the morning light. The rocky edges of Phuket have glistening limestone that peeks beneath the carpet of trees. At the edges of James Bond Island, named for its cameo in The Man with the Golden Gun , the limestone karsts are as magnificent in person as they seemed in the movie, almost unreal in their magnitude. On Panak Island and Hong Island you will explore the varied labyrinth of mangrove swamps. It’s almost as if you have stepped back in time into the Louisiana bayou, with dangling barren vines and remarkably clear water that reflects the green canopy. Monkeys run along the branches, birds chirp in their hidden niches within the leaves, and you have found a flavor of Thailand that you had yet to have tasted."

The limestone dangles down from the powerful and imposing cliffs, with edges that look like they have melted and frozen over time. It is easier to see the clarity of the water as you drift and paddle along the soft cool surface. In the evening you will come to the final tastes of Thailand cuisine at Aziamendi in Iniala where the essence of tradition gives a decadence to the light flavors. Your final dinner in Thailand will be memorable in everyway, offering you one last taste of the country’s fresh quality."

        "description": "Chiang Mai reflects so many preconceptions often thought about Thailand. The city sits serenely beneath a mountain, deep in the north of the country. Crumpled city walls still stand, enclosing 700 years of history. Although the streets can be a little dusty, they are mostly pedestrianized with hardly any traffic once you cross a bridge and wander between temple remains. Until the 1920s, the only means of reaching Chiang Mai was to ride an elephant through the jungle or take a boat upriver through various rapids. This cultural hub was hidden from the world and was able to preserve its culture, incredible in comparison to other great Siam cities that were razed to the ground by invading armies. Touch down, and it will be an easy transfer to your centrally located hotel. You can then stretch your legs with a wander on a lane of stupas and small shops before a tuk tuk provides your first genuine Thai experience. Squash into the back together and travel slowly through the streets, gazing out at red-brick temples and orange-robed monks. Thailand, especially a city like Chiang Mai, can be an enormous culture shock for adults and kids alike. In a tuk tuk you are anonymous, so you can just sit back and soak up all the new impressions with colorfully-dressed locals, swirling incense, temple bells, other tourists, market stalls, ornamental architecture, city walls. A tuk tuk is also an iconic means of travel and one that confirms that you have landed in Southeast Asia and are setting off on an exotic adventure together. Don’t take just our word for it - consider reading some of our travelers’ reviews of Thailand , and see how you can customize your own dream vacation."

Ears flapping and trunks swinging, the elephants traverse the trees with elegance to their gait and a sense of mischief in their eyes. You will be walking alongside in the shadow of these giants as you notice their calls, gestures, and movements. Enjoy the ambiance of the jungle as the elephants move through the trees to a river, where the pachyderm will stop for a bath squirting water wildly from its trunk. Your elephant experience will be at a widely regarded ethical elephant sanctuary in northern Thailand. After a morning spent with giants and lunch in the forest, you will continue to explore. Drive, and then walk, among the trees to a small village cut off from the world. The Karen people live here, traditional in their ways and surreal in appearance. While many Karen communities once lived here, only a few remain, so they use tourism to supplement an otherwise meager income. Meeting them is an authentic experience that will be eye-opening for all. Children everywhere tend to be curious souls, and younger visitors typically end up playing with Karen of similar age. It will be a great opportunity to experience a different way of life with a chance to meet with a shaman before returning to Chiang Mai."

You will soon stand on the street, and a line of orange will come towards you, the monks barefoot and holding small bowls. This is the city’s daily alms ceremony, a surreal and serene experience, and beautiful to take in. Back at the hotel, there will be time to rest, perhaps around the small pool. Chiang Mai can easily be explored on your own as well, the pedestrianized streets and quirky shops good for families out together. This afternoon you will be in the kitchen, gaining dirty hands and food-stained faces. It is a Thai cooking workshop tailored towards children, with lots of tasting and an introduction to the wide variety of flavors and spices."

Rice paddies surround Pai, locals appearing like colorful dots in the fields. Small temples and chedi (Thai stupas) stud the landscape, along with villages of bamboo houses. The best way to explore is by bicycle, taking you off the main road and along ochre-hued lanes. A support vehicle follows so you can leave the saddle at any time. It’s a 12-mile cycle loop to a string of Shan villages and back, although this can be shortened or lengthened dependent on how your family feels. Peddle up then down and rest in one of the Shan villages, meeting a family and comparing their lifestyle to the Karen. Lush landscapes mark the forward path as you cycle to natural hot springs and pass innumerable rice fields. Returning to Pai, you cross a Japanese World War II bridge then descend through Pai Canyon, returning elated and perhaps exhausted. Pai is a small place, and there are dozens of eating options within walking distance of your hotel."

After lunch the action intensifies, a handful of class three and four rapids meaning everyone gets thrown around a little in the raft. It’s very safe, even if the rushing water provides plenty of thrills and perhaps a spill. After 15 more rapids, you reach the jungle camp, a place that’s hidden from civilization.

Koh Samui was the first of Thailand’s islands to really become known to the world, a tropical paradise reported by intrepid travelers of the seventies. While half the island has developed into a bustling resort-style destination, the other half remains low-key, true to the island’s origins. These two days are at your leisure and activities can be organized locally should you wish. Scuba diving and guided snorkeling are popular, but do not expect to find any of the loud motorized water sports here, as this corner of Koh Samui is for tropical birds, not banana boats and jet skis. You can take cultural trips to temples and markets on the island, along with guided excursions in the forest. However, you will have done a lot of this already, so these two days are likely to be spent between the resort and the beach, experiencing why Thailand’s islands continue to be among the world’s most escapist destinations."

The boat will gently cruise across the calm Chao Phraya River while you witness vistas of the prolific banks that are covered in banyan trees that teem with wildlife. Your journey will reach Ayutthaya when the sun begins to wane, and after you have checked into your luxurious resort that will be thoughtfully decorated in Siamese motifs, you will capture the heavenly orange sunset over the boundless landscape, while world-class Thai dishes are served to your table. Ayutthaya is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and a tour of the Historical Park will instantly highlight why it has been awarded such a distinguished certification. Archeological sites sprawl across the length of the park in great numbers, and among them are fascinating temple ruins that date back thousands of years. These pivotal points of interest represent a dramatic and turbulent past in which Thailand both suffered and triumphed during the Burmese-Siamese War. The temple ruins, which are in varying stages of devastation, will share insight into these trials and tribulations that hold major significance in the country's heritage. You will discover the remains of ancient Buddhist images amid the imposing remnants of the temples that once housed them. Moreover, you will visit semi-restored palaces that survived the tumultuous, historical episodes and discover archaic artifacts that formed an intrinsic part of the age-old lifestyle. Wat Phra Mahathat, which is your final stop within the perimeter of the park, will share an iconic photo opportunity of the renowned stone Buddha head as it is entwined within the roots of a large banyan tree. While its Historical Park is established as the highlight of Ayutthaya, the charming town is certainly not void of other noteworthy attractions. Bang Pa-In Palace, which is a former royal Thai residency, stands out as a significant landmark because of its flawlessly shaped park grounds that surround the jewel-encrusted edifice. Furthermore, the riverside restaurants are some of the finest in the country, and revered chefs serve succulent river prawns that you will feast on before you depart for Nakhon Ratchasima."

These unique characteristics reinforce its abundant, cultural experiences and will make your stay utterly worthwhile. Additionally, other travelers are few and far between, which will give you a taste of what it is like to walk among the indigenous people as well as allow you to truly wallow in the rural simplicity of it all. In the evenings, you will retreat to the comfort of your luxurious hotel, where you may enjoy Thai haute cuisine of an exceptional caliber, treating you to the perfect blend of authenticity by day and luxury by night. Though Nakhon Ratchasima features a collection of temples, the sought-after adventures lie on the outskirts of the city, where humanmade development gives way to prospects of the lush green peaks. This countryside, which flanks the city, is endowed with staggering mountains that are home to thousands of wildlife species, and there is no better place to completely immerse yourselves in the natural splendor of Thailand than Khao Yai National Park. The park’s emerald-topped jungle sprawls upwards from the roots of ancient trees to the canopy, where gibbons soar from its epicenter to cover an area of 2,168 square kilometers. Colorful birds flutter from branch to branch and sing beautiful songs, elephants show off their majestic presence as they proudly march across grassy fields, and young macaque monkeys cling to their mothers who hang from the evergreen trees. Within the expanse of dense rainforest and vast grassland, you will search for these aborigine animals and more as you are accompanied by an experienced ranger from the safety of a spacious 4x4 safari vehicle. Your tour will culminate at the foot of a pathway that leads up to the park’s world-famous waterfalls, where powerful streams of silver water flow over moss-coated cliffs. Thailand’s decorated Khmer culture is intricately detailed in the intriguing museums and temples, which are set along the spirited roads that wind through the city. Ready yourselves and your cameras for endearing images of elephant-shaped shrines and impressive Buddhist statues as you uncover the time-tested folklore of Nakhon Ratchasima just before you depart."

The name Ubon stems from the English meaning of royal lotus city, and this descriptive definition could not be further from the truth. Although it does not boom with colorful energy like Bangkok, it oozes priceless allure in all directions of its sweeping scenery. As you peer out from your stylish accommodation, you will capture the endless appeal of Ubon’s lofty sandstone cliffs and extensive plateaus, where the placid Mun River will be gently flowing across. The following day, you will swoon over Ubon’s historical eminence as you transfer to Pha Taem National Park, which is a peaceful park that is slotted into the untamed natural environment and sits between the borders of Thailand and Laos. The ancient heritage of Thailand’s native dwellers will be depicted in the red cave paintings that cover the walls of rock formations and date back over three millennia. These paintings, predominantly crafted from quartz, showcase early animals, which the locals would have lived alongside and relied on for resources. As you and your knowledgeable guide investigate these prehistoric scenes, you will feel as though you are unraveling unrecorded mysteries of forgotten days within a habitat that emanates a mesmerizing atmosphere. Your journey will only be further heightened by the unobstructed vistas from atop Pha Chanadai’s peaks and the breathtaking waterfalls, where you can refresh your minds and bodies. Ubon Ratchathani illustrates the country’s immeasurable constancy toward its cultural roots, and this will be highlighted when you explore the exalted temples and rustic markets today. These temples are some of the most stunning in the country and Wat Phu Prao, which was aptly dubbed the Glowing Temple, trumps the list for its jaw-dropping Tree of Life carving that radiates a luminescent green. Before you marvel at the magnificent structure beneath the twinkling stars, you will traverse the lengths of the charming towns of Ubon to discover the vivacious vendors who will assemble genuine Thai meals for you to enjoy."

Each exhibit represents its specific contents in a manner that is as engaging as it is educational, which will keep you thoroughly enthused as you eagerly trace back Isan tradition to its archaic origins. Your adventurous exploits will be enhanced as you transfer to the cliff-riddled landscape of Phu Pha Man National Park. A cool jungle breeze will lift off of the forest floor as you peruse the park's tropical terrain en route to the sloping caves, which lead to the mountain’s crest. Stalactites, which drip from the cave ceilings, and stalagmites, which reach up toward their roofs, provide plenty of stellar photo opportunities and a first-hand look at history's influence over the ancient area.

As the sun rises above your room and glimmers of light peek through your blinds, you will awaken with a yearning for more picturesque adventures. Your private tour guide will collect you in the morning and will lead you to the Red Lotus Sea in Kumphawapi, which is a calm stretch of lake that seasonally transforms into a sea of hot pink lotus flowers. Flowering season is best observed between the months of December and March. From the middle of the lake, you will share in the surreal magic of being surrounded by these larger than life flowers. Your leisurely day in and around Udon Thani will then continue to Phu Phra Historical Park in Ban Phue, where gargantuan boulders rest in unusual formations and are seemingly placed there long ago by passing giants. These peculiar sights house historical Buddhist sculptures and cave paintings, which offer insight into the sandstone cultures that once prevailed. The folklore, which your experienced tour guide will share, shares stories of monks who would use these natural arrangements as shelter from the wild, and this is showcased in what appears to be houses built into the rocks. Your final evening in Udon Thani will bring with it an immaculate sunset vista as you slowly snack on a multiple-course meal of phenomenal Thai cuisine.

Your guide will greet you at your hotel after breakfast and lead you to the entrance of the Grand Palace for deeper insight into the customs and history of Thailand. The complex was erected in 1782 and remained the royal residence for generations. Spanning approximately 2,351,000 square feet along the banks of the Chao Phraya River, you will have no shortage of things to explore. The Temple of the Emerald Buddha hosts a series of murals that decorate the interior to depict the epic of Ramakien alongside commentary made by King Rama V inscribed into the nearby marble plaques. Nearby, the temple Wat Pho is located south of the Grand Palace and was built during the reign of King Rama I. The soothing ambiance emanates from lit incense accentuating the temple’s promise as a place for healing and highlighting its position as a great pharmacy and as the location of Thailand’s first university. You will enter the main gallery to view the impressive Reclining Buddha, which reaches nearly 148 feet long and over 49 feet tall as the precious stones in the Buddha’s feet reflect the 108 signs of true faith. For lunch, you can stop at a traditional restaurant known for serving the dish “Chicken Movie with See Ra Cha.” This delicious favorite of the restaurant involves crispy fried chicken skin topped with Sriracha, with this homemade sauce that is close to the original recipe first introduced in the early 1930’s. Experience one of the main highlights of this tour as you meet the family that first produced the original Sriracha sauce, known as the Gold Medal Brand Sriracha, which has won a countless number of awards throughout its history. While the boutique brand of Sriracha sauce is less famous worldwide, it is renowned among local chefs for having the best flavor, as well as being the first Sriracha sauce ever made. Based on an interview conducted by Zicasso in September 2018, the current owner, Mr. Lakut Suwanprasop, is 81 years old. He’s the 2nd generation of this family business that was started in 1932 by his mother, Madam La Orr Suwanprasop who was born in the town of Si Racha (Sri Racha, Sriracha) and where she first began producing the sauce out of her home. She later met a man from Bangkok where they moved to the Capital city after getting married. Madam La Orr used to make small batches of chili sauce for her friends in Bangkok when they encouraged her to make more for sale. She also found better quality of fresh chili in Bangkok compared to her hometown. After consulting with a monk, she was given the blessing to start a small business, and it was the monk who told her to name the sauce Sriracha Sauce, after her hometown. So in 1932, La Orr started producing her sauce for sale in Bangkok. Subsequently, word of mouth spread in Bangkok about this artisan homemade chili sauce and it became very popular among local chefs and restaurants. They started entering annual competitions and was awarded multiple gold medals for their outstanding quality, hence they decided to label their Sriracha sauce as Gold Medal Brand. After multiple wins over the years, they brought their multiple medals to the government food department in Bangkok to prove they are the original creator of “Sriracha Sauce”. But this was impossible for the government to prove as there were already other “copy cat” brands by then in the market, but no one else has claimed they produced Sriracha sauce earlier than 1932. So the food department advised them to change the design of their logo (current design) that includes the wording in Thai & Buddhist year that translates: produced in 1932. Another way to tell people Gold Medal was the first and oldest brand. All subsequent brands are copied from them, calling their versions Sriracha Sauce too, but none of them can recreate the exact same recipe as the original Gold Medal. Lakut Suwanprasop still follows in the tradition of his mother by visiting the market personally to inspect and purchase the chilis before producing the mouthwatering mixture of spice and sweetness in Old Bangkok in the small humble workshop that has been operational since 1932. Mr. Lakut’s son helps run the day-to-day operations of the artisanal workshop kept a secret by locals for decades. The producers make the sauce in small batches and offer samples and jars to select shops. The mellow spiced aroma brings a flavor that ranges from mild to very spicy but with a looser consistency than you expected that packs a fantastic flavor absent of the general tartness found in many American hot sauces that rely heavily on vinegar. In the evening, you can venture to the Yodsay neighborhood located near Chinatown, taking you away from the bustling crowds of tourists that collect around Khao San Road and instead surrounding you with locals. The fried noodle dishes in Yodsay are incredible with vendors accompanying the variety of noodles on offer with chicken and often a unique version of Sriracha sauce. Three separate vendors in the neighborhood were listed in Michelin Guide Bangkok for 2018, and worth finding amidst the abundance of choices."

In the morning, the familiar aroma of stir-fried noodles fills the air with breakfast vendors across the city offering noodle soups and grilled skewers. You will make your way to Si Racha to find a unique blend of modern architecture mixing effortlessly with heritage homes and continued tradition. Fishing boats wade along the sparkling sea to reflect great colors while tall residential apartments overshadow the traditional structures around the city center as stilt guesthouses and a quiet park decorate the heart of the picturesque waterfront. Over lunch, you may become an even greater Sriracha aficionado as you participate in a private cooking class with a local celebrity chef known for cooking sensational oyster omelets and making her own special Sriracha sauce. You will learn how to make Sriracha sauce and 2 dishes that go well with the sauce (likely special Pad Thai and oyster or mussel omelet known as hoi tod ). The traditional dish known as hoi tod , has a soft interior, crisp edges, and a burst of umami from the fish sauce added while cooking. The dish originated with Chinese immigrants to Thailand, localized around the seaside towns before transferring inland approximately 100 years ago. The consistency provides a nice contrast between the crisp edges of egg and the burst of briny flavor from the oysters. The homemade Sriracha pacts the final punch with different levels of satisfying heat through a delightful mix of sweetness, garlic flavor, and vinegar resulting in a tangy bite. After lunch, you will continue to the nearby city of Chonburi, the capital of Chonburi Province and popular for beach getaways and a thriving nightlife. The sea breeze carries the scent of the salt water while the lush trees on Khao Sam Muk, a 147-foot tall coastal hill, contrasts with the cobalt waters that wade against the sand. Local fishers continue to bring in fresh seafood daily from the Gulf to sell their catch at Ang Sila Seafood Market, so the pier hosts vendors with their showcase of delectable squid, mussels, and prawns, as well as other local delicacies found deep in the local waters. Before a seafood dinner feast, you will visit the famous Nong Mon Market, your guide will lead you through the aisles lined by traditional Thai goods. You can find large bamboo tubes hosting sweet custardy sticky rice known as Khao Lam, and enjoy the common Thai dessert made from coconut cream, sweet red beans, and sugar. The aroma of the sweet coconut mixes with the herbaceous scent of the bamboo for a subtle, yet enticing, fragrance."

        "description": "In the early morning, you will venture to Wat Phra That Doi Suthep long before the crowds arrive. The temple complex was founded in the 14th century, and according to legend, a white elephant carrying a shard of Buddha’s shoulder bone climbed the hilltop, trumpeted three times, before dying resulting in the construction of a temple on the exact spot the occurrence happened. You can climb the 309 steps to reach the top of the summit and find tranquil pagodas, statues, bells, a museum, and a collection of shrines that lead to an incredible panoramic view of Chiang Mai. Colorful Naga guard the temple gates and a green glass Buddha statue models the former resting place of the Emerald Buddha on display in the Temple of the Emerald Buddha in Bangkok. Monks wrapped in their ritual garments perform their morning alms offering while you enjoy a picnic breakfast in the serene ambiance of the hilltop temple. After exploring the beauty of Wat Phra That Doi Suthep, you will venture next to the shops and vendors of Warorot Market. The great marketplace combines the heritage of a Thai bazaar with the ambiance of a Chinese arcade inside an antique building. The Warorot Market draws food lovers from around Thailand and the world eager to sample the ready-made meals, local snacks, fresh produce, and hot cuisine within the three-story building on the riverbanks. Locals shop within the confines of the market that also includes both casual and upmarket fashion for lower prices, as well as insight into the traditional northern-style foods of Chiang Mai like sai oua sausage and curries set within the aromatics of spices and sweet curries, chili dips and khao soi noodles.

        "description": "Start your day with a remarkable gourmet coffee experience outside of Chiang Mai in the Mae Rim District. The local Lahu people have taken to producing coffee beans in the ripe climate of Northern Thailand by growing, processing, and slow-roasting Arabica beans. The organic, sustainable farm helps preserve the viable highland lifestyle of the Lahu community while rehabilitating the cultural and scenic resources through coffee sales. When wandering through the plantation, you find flowers resembling jasmine growing on the ripening coffee plants. Instead of coffee grains dangling from the vines, you will find bright red cherry bushels. The coffee bean derives from the cherry seed after a period of harvest, desiccation, and roasting. The roast brings out the natural oils in the coffee bean allowing the different flavors and caffeine to emerge. Your local guide combines the importance of the coffee plantation and coffee-making with the unique heritage of the Lahu community, which can be traced back to the ancient Qiang historical accounts approximately 2,000 years ago. At the end of the tour, you can sample the coffee produced on the plantation to find nutty and chocolate notes with a medium acidity and lasting, buttery flavor. For lunch, you will settle into a restaurant popular with locals and unknown to most visitors to the region. The dining room once belonged to the wife of a Thai literary master and paid tribute to her late husband with superb cuisine rising from classic recipes. A lush garden accentuates the delightful ambiance of the friendly restaurant with captivating aromas of browning garlic and roasted chili. After enjoying it all, you can explore some of the local shops in Chiang Mai before dinner. For the evening you have a reservation at a restaurant made famous for its chef using French cooking techniques with traditional Thai recipes with a satisfying modern twist inspired by the beauty of nature.

After landing, you will venture to the restaurant Bun Cha Huong Lien for lunch, which became internationally renowned after celebrity chef and travel enthusiast Anthony Bourdain bought the United States President Barack Obama a noodle dish there in 2016. The restaurant served an already popular noodle-plate for six dollars and has since encased the seating area on protecting glass after restating the scene. Many locals and visitors now refer to the restaurant as Bun Cha Obama to memorialize the meal, the guests, and the popularity of the dish consisting of broth, fatty grilled pork, and noodles. Your evening continues with a private microbrewery tour of Hanoi for a distinctive exploration of the city that will immerse you in the delightfully welcoming culture and surprising flavors of the beers produced in Vietnam’s capital city.

        "description": "The Old Quarter is a common name for the neighborhood of Hanoi once located outside the Thang Long Imperial Citadel. Streets once hosted specializations for residential, commercial, and manufacturing centers but have become a fascinating collection of historical intrigue. Heritage House retains its traditional allure in the sparsely decorated property consisting of two courtyards and fine antique furniture. Bach Ma Temple is the oldest religious center in the city dating back to the 11th century with many additions made over the following millennium. A statue of the legendary white horse is on display inside the temple after passing through the captivating wooden doors. Your guide will lead you to a local café unknown to most visitors that serves authentic “egg coffee.” Hanoi is the undisputed center of Vietnamese coffee culture embodied in the idea of mixing eggs into coffee. The country is the second-largest coffee exporting country in the world resulting in imaginative additions to the celebrated brews produced around Vietnam since the 19th century. Egg coffee consists of a base of bitter brewed coffee spooned delicately into a mixture of egg yolks blended with sweetened condensed milk and sugar. The distinctive and satisfying flavor remains on your palate until you sample the iconic breakfast street food of banh cuon , a steamed rice roll with minced pork, and pho Hanoi , noodle soup in a beef broth served specifically in a style popular in Hanoi. Dine together for a spectacular lunch with a local chef known for creating special chili sauces popular in Northern Vietnamese cuisine. The dipping sauces of the north can consist of fermented shrimp paste, fish sauce, and Nuoc Cham, which can be sweet, tangy, salty, or spicy. Participate in a demonstration to learn more about the particular flavors of Northern Vietnam found in crab noodle soups, steamed rice rolls, and fermented shrimp noodles. The flavorful day continues with an introduction to the renowned civet cat coffee served in a specialty café. A premium cup of weasel coffee (also often known as coffee from civet cats in other parts of Asia) costs between $35 and $100 or up to $600 per pound. This coffee has a different process than the regular coffee. Although the growth and production of the coffee remains the same, before harvesting a weasel eats and digests the cherries but cannot fully digest the beans, so farmers harvest the undigested beans before washing, drying, removing the skin, and roasting them resulting in a smoother flavor absent of bitterness. The café only serves authentic coffee harvested from wild weasels as opposed to farmed animals. For dinner, you can indulge on a stunning menu at an award-winning restaurant known for offering delectable French and Vietnamese fusion."

Before the construction of Trang Tien Bridge, a bamboo structure crossed over the rushing waters replacing the traditional passage with an elegant design of arches to overlook the passing boats and red phoenix flowers. At the citadel, you will soon find the Ngo Mon Gate, and the dramatic structure serves as the royal viewing platform during court ceremonies and acts as two of the five entryways cutting through the thick stone ramparts. The central gateway remains reserved for the emperor’s use, while both of the two flanking gates were used by court officials and mandarins. In the evening, you will arrive at the Ben Xuan Garden House, and the architectural beauty of the home embodies intricate attention to detail crafted over nine years of construction that incorporated recycled materials like ancient brick, discovered doors, and broken porcelain set amongst enticing views to the river.

You will soon set out on a fishing boat with a local to explore the layers of local cuisine caught in the nearby delta. The water rushes into the nearby sea offering access to plenty of prawns and crabs, and you can watch the farmers reel in the crab traps and head to the market to sell their catch, their grains, and their produce.

You are met at the airport and transferred to your hotel. Your excellent accommodation sits along the riverbanks and watches over the cityscape’s expanse, both in the sky and out to the horizon. Whether you prefer the gentle wade of the Chao Phraya River, or the glistening lights of the city at night, you will be able to watch Bangkok’s luster in the spacious and cozy rooms, along the serene patio next to the waterway, or lounging beneath a cabana by the gorgeous pool. After you have settled into your hotel you will venture to the fabulous Jim Thompson House. James Thompson was an American entrepreneur who almost singlehandedly revived the Thai silk trade. The home is made of teak wood and was transferred from Ayutthaya, the old capital of Siam. The dark exterior is glossed, shining beneath the lush green of the surrounding trees. The charming foyer brings Western sensibility to the Eastern home. A Belgian chandelier shimmers beneath the ceiling, while the floor is covered with Italian marble tiles. The 17th century Buddha and hand-carved wooden figurines create a peaceful comingling of diverse styles, all glowing within the elegant architecture."

Follow your guide through the sensational sights of the Grand Palace and Wat Phra Kaew; the Temple of the Emerald Buddha is considered one of the most important temples in Thailand, it was built in the 18th century and, unlike traditional temples, never contained monks’ living quarters. The golden spires coil into the sky, housing the revered Buddha that was carved from a single slab of jade. It is easy to be amazed at the intricacies of the Buddha as it sits in His meditation pose, draped in robes that are changed throughout the seasons by Thailand’s King. The air is filled with the rising scent of incense. Delicate smoke drifts through the room. There is a gentle quiet to the Buddha, the temple, and the grounds that give the opulent complex a peaceful manner."

Float along the sensational waterway where the skyscrapers give way to rich tree lines. Disembark the boat at Wat Arun, Temple of Dawn, where the architecture has made the temple known as one of the most beautiful temples in Thailand. The temple was reconstructed in the 18th century giving it its current splendor, a place where the sun glistens off of the stones at both sunrise and sunset. Somehow the bustle of the city disappears beneath the fabulous architecture, where the gray and white stones climb up in concentric tiers, coming to a steep and inspiring point over 210 feet high. The stairs that reach to the varied terraces are steep but approachable, bringing you to the fabulous view over the water, where you can watch the ancient highway trundle by. In the evening you will dock by Wat Bang Na, a quiet temple located beside the riverbank. The delicate fragrance of basil and mint mix with the freshwater air.

Monks, wearing their vibrant robes, march through the streets collecting alms from the locals, visitors, and anyone willing to give, from rice to coins, even biscuits, while people prostrate themselves asking for blessing. Set out on a private tour of the city, beyond the footsteps of the monks, and into Wat Pananchoeng, a space that houses a Buddha image constructed in the 14th century. The temple complex is modest compared to its gilded counterparts, where Pananchoeng contains tiled roofs, setting itself apart from the opulent structures of Bangkok. Within the main temple the old Buddha sits around 140 feet high, reserving the majesty of a gilded sparkle for itself instead of the temple’s architecture. The fragrance of the room is all encompassing, bringing herbaceousness to Buddha and the surrounding geometric shapes covering the walls. Although the Burmese once overtook the city in the 18th century, the temple has never wanted for followers, as the statue is considered a guardian for sailors."

The Chinese Pagoda stands separately from the palace, overlooking the placid lake. The vibrant yellows, greens, and reds are reflected in the water, making it look as though the colors radiate as the sloping porticos reel back in layers, climbing up into the graceful spire. As the day continues onward you will arrive in Bangkok where you will be transferred to the airport. You will soon arrive in Chiang Mai, the largest city in northern Thailand, and the second-largest city in the country, set within the dense jungle.

Known as Chiang Mai’s most famous landmark, the temple at the summit of the mountain is at the top of 300 steps, flanked by colorful serpent deities that guard the staircase to the temple’s plateau. The steps are a vivacious pink, from the lain brick to the painted idols, all surrounded by the jungle that once protected the monks from outsiders. At the mountain’s summit you will step into the temple complex, where golden spires rise from concentric circles, looking like extra suns as you make your way to the top of the staircase. You can find the image of a decorated white elephant, whose fame comes from having chosen the location for the temple. The mountain air is gracious as the breeze blows through.

For a unique venture around the city you can visit the ancient ruins of Wiang Kum Kam. The old city sits within a mixture of jungle and marsh, where the ancient buildings are as illustrious as the artifacts they housed. From pottery to sculptures, architecture to stone tablets filled with Mon inscriptions, the 13th-century city still persists in its allure. When the Ping River suddenly changed course it swept away the city of Wiang Kum Kam beneath its waters. Today you can see the temple with an angular-based Chedi , a Burmese-style pavilion restored in the early 20th century. The corner of the stupa is guarded by a lion, facing outward and protecting the elegance and purity of the temple. The pyramid-type structure contains large arched windows that give an impressive glow and concentric climb to the temple, making it look much like an adornment in and of itself."

The longhaired, long tailed, aggressive primates are curious about visitors, especially when it comes to food. You can watch Uncle Hog hand each present monkey a piece of food separately, often a piece of banana or peanuts. When grouped together you can hear them screech and fight, but individually they are calm, friendly, and shy. There is affection in the way they connect with Uncle Hog, their delicate reach for the food, the way they stand in line waiting for treats. Descending Monkey Hill brings you to a grand view, better than the summit itself, overcrowded with satellite towers. From the spot within the exercise park you can see the port, a variety of boats anchored, wading in and out to sea, where the color of the water sparkles in the sunshine."

Boats crowd the waterway, filled with vivacious goods, from textiles to more food, handcrafts to toys, filling the morning with an almost overwhelming exuberance and delight. The hundreds of wooden houses that line the river offer insight into the variety of culture within Thailand’s four regions. Back in the city you can explore the stunning architecture of the Sanctuary of Truth. The entire structure was made of wood, including abstaining from the use of metal nails, complete with an otherworldly view of the sea.

The museum feels more like a playful palace for adults, filled with laughter and eccentricities that make you want to jump into the paintings or, as you will soon notice, have the paintings jump out at you. Through clever uses of shading and borders, artists were able to create images that look as though they are smashing through the wall in various ways. Part of the exhibition’s beauty is the encouragement to interact with the art. You can make it look like you’re drifting along the canals in Venice or being regarded by Rodin’s The Thinker .

The palace’s Inner court shows the contrast of styles, constructed and decorated with a European design but topped with a markedly Thai roof. On the palace grounds also sits Wat Phra Kaew, the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, and is considered the most important temple in the country. The iconic green glowing image of Buddha dates back to the 15th century and was carved from a single jade block. The structure itself is filled with an atmosphere of elegance and integrity, with the slight air of incense wafting along the halls. The building is unique in that it doesn’t contain monks’ living quarters and is entirely meant as an elaborate and holy decoration dedicated to Buddha.

        "description": "The wildlife of the jungle offers tremendous insight, not just into the life of the animals but also the culture of the people that have been in touch with their natural surroundings for centuries, if not longer. After breakfast you will venture into the dense jungle, a place where the trees spread over the skyline and cast shades of light beneath them. Along the upper branches you can see the playful and rambunctious acts of gibbons, as they are most active in the cooler hours of the morning. The branches bob and weave as you make your way to Haew Narok Waterfall. The water spills over the highest point of 240 feet spreading over three separate tiers. The powerful falls can be heard from quite a ways away, but when you come to the viewing platform there is little that can prepare you for the exquisite rush no matter the season, pouring down in what looks like a raucous curtain made of beads or an endless blanket of movement pressed against the rocky terraces. In the evening you will watch over the salt licks, where the open plain spreads to the horizon."

        "description": "The wildlife-clad mornings are endless as you journey through the park en route to a cultural market at Pak Chong. The town is filled with local goods and items that showcase the culture and the surrounding region, specifically the fresh food. From local farms and straight from the earth, the vibrant market is filled with the scent of herbaceous spices, remarkable curry, and colorful vegetables. Continue on to the labyrinth made of sandstone decorated by ancient rock art that represents human beings and animals, both domestic and wild, marking the history of a people and how far back the story goes. The reddish hue bursts from the rocky surface with familiar images, as fig trees seem to hang off of the cliffs in impressive displays of persistent nature. After lunch you will return to Bangkok and let the endless energy of the city carry you into the evening."
