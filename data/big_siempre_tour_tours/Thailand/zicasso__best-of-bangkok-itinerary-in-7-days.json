      "title": "Bangkok – A Temple Tour of Bangkok’s Best",
      "description": "There are over 400 temples in Bangkok and far too many to experience in one month, let alone one week. While you may not be able to see every temple, some stand out as the most majestic and famous within Thailand: Wat Phra Kaew, Wat Arun, and Wat Pho. On your first full day in Bangkok, you will visit all three of them as well as the Grand Palace. Today, you will fuel up for the adventure ahead with a complimentary breakfast. Be sure to slip on a comfortable pair of shoes and pack water, sunscreen, and snacks as you will not be returning to your luxury accommodation until later in the evening. Your hotel concierge will take care of everything for you. Once you have had breakfast, you can begin an immersive walking tour of Bangkok’s most attractive temples. The journey will begin with a short walk to Wat Phra Kaew, which is commonly known as the Temple of the Emerald Buddha. It is an easy trip to the temple, with a short stop by the amulet market on your way. Here, you may purchase charms, amulets, totems, and other jewelry. You will then continue on to The Emerald Buddha, which is a temple that is regarded as one of the most sacred in Thailand. It is adjoined with the Grand Palace, and together they are a truly astounding spectacle. Picture-perfect camera shots will be in abundance, so be sure to have your preferred device on hand. ? Thai food market called Tha Tien Market where dried, salted seafood and other goods are sold. Wat Pho is home to the awe-inspiring 46 meters-long, gold-plated, Reclining Buddha. Travelers flock to see the immense monument as its sheer beauty can rarely be rivaled. While you explore all that it offers, you can learn more about King Rama I and the temple’s construction. It was in this temple that the first ever traditional Thai massage was practiced. A temple tour of Bangkok will not be complete without visiting Wat Arun. The 70-meter tall temple towers up from the ground and is surrounded by smaller, but no less significant, temple sites and historical statues. The monument, encompassed in porcelain and glistening colored glass, looks over the Chao Phraya River. After the tour, you will return to your hotel for an hour or two that will be at your leisure. Then, you will make your way to Thip Samai for arguably Bangkok’s best Pad Thai. The local eatery is not to be missed, especially for those who are after a truly authentic meal. Touted as the best Pad Thai in Thailand by Anthony Bourdain, a slightly longer queue than usual will definitely be worth the wait. Once you are finished with supper, you will venture back to your room for a night’s rest."

      "title": "Bangkok – Treat Yourself",
      "description": "Bangkok offers plenty of stunning attractions, but the city also boasts a shopping experience that cannot be found anywhere else in the world. There is an abundance of stalls and malls where travelers can splurge on souvenirs. From high-end, multiple-story shopping complexes to budget-beating markets, the fourth day of your tour will be entirely dedicated to treating yourself. After breakfast, you will transfer from your hotel to Siam Square. Siam Square, better known as the heart of the city, is a mecca for shopaholics and travelers who are searching for keepsakes to take back home. The Siam area boasts some of Bangkok’s biggest shopping malls, and boutique markets can be found within the alleyways that connect the main streets. Your first stop will be Terminal 21, which is located on Sukhumvit Road. The incredibly unique aspect about the airport-inspired mall is that areas on each floor are dedicated to different major cities across the globe. The restaurants and shops are all themed accordingly. For instance, a short trip up the escalators will transport you from Tokyo to London. While it is not an entirely Thai experience, it is one that you cannot miss. This will be a great opportunity to pick up deals on fashionable items and tuck into any of the many, fine global cuisines. After shopping Terminal 21, you will head out of the complex and take a leisurely stroll around Siam Square. This area will be action-packed with endless entertainment to offer.

The exquisite museum tells the story of an American man who fell in love with Southeast Asian art and culture. The American architect is most famous for his role in reviving Thai silk and pioneering the use of it in world-class fashion houses in Europe’s hottest cultural destinations. The meticulous craft and unique blend of Eastern and Western art admirably position the museum as one of the most awe-inspiring attractions in the city. Following the Jim Thompson House, your final destination for the day will be Pantip Plaza. The massive tech-focused mall can provide hours of shopping entertainment. If you wish to bypass shopping, you can transfer back to your hotel for an evening around the pool. For supper, you will have reservations at a local restaurant near your hotel. Your hotel concierge will make these reservations and will direct you to your local, Thai eatery. Finally, you will unwind over supper before returning to your hotel."
