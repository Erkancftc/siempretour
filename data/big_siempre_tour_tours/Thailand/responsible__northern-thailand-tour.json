  "generalInfo": "Our 2-week Hidden Thailand tour takes you by road, rail and river from the vibrant, ever-fascinating capital Bangkok through some of the least-known, yet most spectacular, landscapes of the kingdom.<br/><br/>Along the way we’ll discover the back streets, local markets and street-life of Bangkok, as well as its famous sites and explore the atmospheric ancient temples and lotus ponds of World Heritage Sukhothai. From here we continue north to historic Lampang, the centre for the 19th-century teak trade and home to an impressive stock of period architecture, and picturesque Phayao Town with its lakeside setting and waterfront cafes.<br/><br/>Onwards and upwards we reach the dramatic Phu Chee Fah Range overlooking the Mekong and forests of northwest Laos and head into Chiang Rai Province and the Golden Triangle itself.
