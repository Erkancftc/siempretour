      "description": "TRAINING, TEMPLES AND HILL TRIBE VILLAGES We’ll pick you up at 8:00am from the CHIANG MAI GATE HOTEL in Chiang Mai city and transfer you to our training base in the lovely Mae Wang valley around 1 hour from the city. On arrival at our ‘base camp’ in Mae Wang we’ll introduce you immediately to your Tuk Tuk and crack on with the drive training. This all takes place ‘off road’ and is a thorough session giving all participants the time to get used to these wonderful vehicles and master all the controls. We then head off down winding rural lanes passing through small farming communities (think classic SE Asia photo ops) and up to a remote meditation Temple where we’ll receive a blessing for the adventure ahead. After a simple but hearty local Thai lunch we then we along the back roads up into the mountains towards our overnight destination of a remote Karen Hill Tribe village. We’re camping here tonight in the fields (don’t worry – there are showers and toilets available) to get a real Hill Tribe experience. In the evening we’ll learn how to cook jungle style with an open fire and lessons from our Karen hosts before spending the night under the stars – a real Thai adventure! NOTE - to drive your Tuk Tuk your International Driving Permit MUST HAVE a Category A stamp - please contact us for more information"

      "description": "MOUNTAINS AND MORE HILL TRIBE VILLAGES After breakfast we’ll explore the local area and forest around the village before getting back into the Tuk Tuks and heading further into the foothills of Doi Inthanon, Thailand’s highest mountain. With lots of stops to explore and relax this is a fantastic journey through spectacular mountain scenery and a real insight into this part of the world. We’ll stop for a late lunch at a small roadside restaurant – the real deal in terms of local Thai country fare – and then head on to Ban Mae Khlang Luang, our overnight base. Our overnight accommodation is in another Karen village surrounded by mountains and rice terraces and is the perfect setting for the second night of the adventure. Once we’ve checked in we’ll explore the village and see how the community live – and get to sample some of the best freshest coffee around! In the evening we’ll have a traditional Thai style BBQ in the rice fields, great fun and a real Thailand tradition."

      "description": "HIKING, WATERFALLS AND BACK TO CHIANG MAI CITY We head off this morning to explore the forests around the village in the foothills of Doi Inthanon. The trek is ‘only’ around 5 km but takes us through fantastic forests and eventually to a series of stunning waterfalls. We’ll have lunch at the foot of the largest waterfall and there’s plenty of time to swim in the pool at the foot of the falls. After lunch we trek downhill out of the forest and back to the hill-tribe village. It’s then time to say goodbye to your trusty Tuk Tuk and transfer back to Chiang Mai city by private minivan. We’ll arrive back at Chiang Mai Gate Hotel around 4:30pm"
