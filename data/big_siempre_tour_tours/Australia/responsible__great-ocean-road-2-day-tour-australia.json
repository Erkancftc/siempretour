      "description": "Our journey begins its coastal ties with a short walk along the beautiful waterfront in Geelong. Get a caffeine hit at one of the cafes or just enjoy the transformed promenade and the clean coastal air. Once joining the Great Ocean Road in the surfing haven of Torquay our focus turns to Australian native wildlife as we observe Eastern Grey Kangaroos in the wild. This is one of many opportunities to see and hear about our unique and unusual animals in their native habitat. Our route then starts travelling along the very scenic, cliff-hugging section of the Great Ocean Road. While winding our way along towards Lorne we stop to view sites such as the ‘Memorial Arch’ and tell you of the intriguing story about the construction of this incredible memorial road. After lunch in Lorne, the largest of the seaside villages, we cruise along more of the spectacular road, stopping at many scenic spots including Kennett River where we can see koalas in their natural habitat and many colourful native birds. Our journey then finds us in another popular seaside town, Apollo Bay, where a walk on the beach, the marina, or an exploration of the village helps you enjoy the beauty of the region. Your accommodation tonight is at Chris’s Restaurant and Villas where you can relax in a private self-contained villa set high on a hill overlooking the Southern Ocean (based on availability). This amazing setting is a great place to relax and unwind for a couple of hours before dinner at the highly renowned restaurant. This Greek and French inspired restaurant"

      "description": "After breakfast, our journey starts with us travelling through the Otway ranges and onto the ‘Shipwreck Coast’. Our first stop is at Castle Cove overlooking the Aire river valley. Your guide will introduce you to the strong Aboriginal heritage of the region with many tribes living prosperously around the coastline for thousands of years. In the same area millions of years ago when Australia was part of the great southern land, Gondwana, dinosaurs were roaming the land. A unique find along the coast in 1987 uncovered important clues into the world’s pre-historic past. The 12 Apostles are Icons of Australia’s natural beauty. We arrive as the stacks are lit with the morning sun making them perfect for photos and almost crowd free. This is a bonus for taking a 2 day trip as the stacks are silhouettes in the afternoon and overcrowded. After hearing of the creation of the stacks and holding some of the limestone rock you can explore the boardwalks or brave a helicopter flight along the coastline (own expense). We then visit ‘Loch Ard Gorge’, the site of the most famous 19th century Australian shipwreck. We retell the entire story from the calm voyage, the tragic wreck, the courageous survivors and their ultimate fate. While hearing the tale you will be able to see and hold some original artefacts, photos and documents from the ‘Loch Ard’ contained in our treasure chests. Port Campbell is our lunch stop for today. The small fishing village of just 350 is set in a beautiful natural port and has some wonderful cafes and restaurants for food and views. After lunch we travel to a lesser known but highly impressive area of the Great Ocean Road west of Port Campbell. This section takes in London Bridge, Bay of Islands, Bay of Martyrs, and Boat Bay before our journey turns inland and travels through open farmland towards Melbourne arriving there around 6pm."
