      "description": "Sydney is a pearl of the Pacific Ocean, celebrated for illustrious beach culture and spectacular architecture that celebrates both land and sea. Your flight will land at Sydney Airport where your private transfer will meet you at baggage claim. Your hotel is located near the bustling downtown region that overlooks Darling Harbour, and will offer a perfect blend of city access with the relaxing ambiance of the seaside. You can look out your window to a view of sailboats floating past one another and graceful arch of the Harbour Bridge glinting in drifting sunlight. Your guide will greet you in your hotel lobby, keen on introducing you to the stunning highlights of the city, from the old walkways of the Rocks district, Sydney’s oldest neighborhood, to the marvelous arcades of the Queen Victoria Building. The shopping center was originally erected in the late 19th century beneath a set of 20 cupolas encircling the central dome, and the natural light spills into the main gallery highlighting the historical window frames and mosaic tile floors. Your guide will point to the allegorical marble figures above the entrances of York Street, representing the “Genius of the City,” with the two figures above the entrance of George Street embodying the glory of civilization."

      "description": "In the morning, the cafes of the Glebe neighborhood open to local university students eager to order a rejuvenating cappuccino. A vintage and artisan market open up alongside the streets to showcase homemade honey and preserves set beside the flowing skirts decorated with swirling colors. After breakfast, your guide will meet you at the hotel and lead you on a short walk along the brick esplanade to the exterior of the Sydney Opera House. The structure remains an icon of the city and Greater Australia, known for the way the rooftop imitates the sails of passing ships, eternally cast to catch the gentle sea breeze. The harbor waters lap against the base of the esplanade. The doors to the opera house opened in late 1973 with a seating capacity of nearly 2,700 patrons in the main concert hall. The lavish interior reminds you of a clam, embellished with vaulted ceilings and a textured background behind the main stage. The fabulous acoustics enable a person’s voice to echo against the walls in all direction. Your day will continue outside of the opera house, taking you from the grandeur of concert culture to the relaxed pace of the beachside culture at Bondi, known for pristine sand, gentle waves, and the reality television show of “Bondi Rescue.” The seaside swimming pool of the Icebergs Private Swimming Club overlooks the water splashing against the rocks."

      "title": "Sydney – Relish Sydney’s Splendor and Surroundings at your Leisure",
      "description": "Decorating one of the Sydney estuaries of Homebush Bay is the SS Ayrfield. The neighborhood’s past as a trading port informs its present, accentuated by the rusting walls of the abandoned freighter decorating the waters. The ship was once used to transport coal and war supplies but has since sprouted lush mangrove trees with branches peeking through the hull of the ship first erected in 1911. The remarkable ship resembles a toy boat used as a flowerpot, made more remarkable due to the grand size of the ship, along with its ability to continue floating. Sydney and its surroundings have marvels often overlooked by visitors, so this day will bring you the opportunity to go in search of the city’s hidden wonders and the splendors of the surrounding countryside. For a full day exploration, you will take a private tour of Blue Mountains National Park, an area of New South Wales that fills more than 4,400 square miles. The eucalyptus trees cast an ethereal blue vapor in the early morning light giving credence to the name. You will arrive at the weathered sandstone peaks along the cliffs of Jamison Valley where the Three Sisters stand nearly 3,000 feet above the valley floor. In the foreground, you can see the striking layers of color cast by the sandstone, with a background of the emerald canopy and rocky plateaus."

Godwits call out to one another in the trees as kangaroos bounce in the open plains and monitor lizards search for breakfast amidst the underbrush. After your own breakfast, your private transfer will escort you to the airport for your flight north to Cairns.

Your private transfer will greet you upon your flight’s arrival and lead you north to the seaside town of Port Douglas as cafes and boutique shops line the elegant streets that lead to the marina. Sailboat masts wade in the water and sway from side to side.

White sand stretches along the shore of Four Mile Beach shaded by towering palm trees. You will settle into the comforts of your luxurious hotel set between the lush trees of the rainforest while offering views to the shimmering ocean.

      "description": "At dawn, the sunlight stretches along the eastern horizon layering the sky with dramatic reds, oranges, and pinks. You will rise early in the morning to board the catamaran bound for the Great Barrier Reef. Your boat will weigh anchor, and your excitement will make your heart pound. The Great Barrier Reef is one of the natural wonders of the world, encompassing a collection of coral bodies that span nearly 133,000 square miles. The sea air will brush against your cheeks as the boat brings mist that rises from the ocean surface. You can see the darker segments of water scattered across the ocean where reefs have formed, and you will jump into the water at Opal Reef after donning your snorkel gear. The gentle waves are welcoming, and the warm temperature will immediately relax you. You will look beneath the surface to find the crescent shape of the reef edging the continental shelf as staghorn coral forests, and giant clams glow within the bright light beams that pierce up to 200 feet below the surface. Stingrays swim past effortlessly as their wings flutter like butterflies and can grow to a length of up to 23 feet in length. The spectacular underwater world of the coral reef system is unparalleled to the wonders you have seen across Australia thus far."
