      "description": "Sydney With its glorious harbour, lavish golden beaches and iconic landmarks, Sydney is Australia's showpiece city. Creative and curious, discover the world-class cuisine, indigenous culture, and irresistible beach life that make Sydney one of the world’s most dynamic, exciting destinations. Sydney’s sparkling harbour is the heart of a richly cultural city. Overlooked by the metallic curves of the masterpiece of an Opera House, and that grand arched harbour bridge. Take it all in from the water, and admire the iconic landmarks, which are set before the city’s gleaming skyline backdrop. If you’re feeling adventurous, take the legendary climb up the smooth curve of the bridge – nicknamed the Coathanger - to soak in the shining city’s spread from a unique perspective. Spread out to tan on one of the world’s most famous stretches of sand - Bondi Beach. Restaurants and bars burble away in the background, while the sun beams down, and surfers curl and leap over pure rollers. Swim in spectacular salty ocean pools, or wander the beautiful Bondi to Coogee coastal walk for more of this sun-gorged stretch of prime coastline. Leaving the thrills of Australia’s largest city behind is surprisingly simple – take to the skies to be flown above skyscrapers and rippling ribbons of waves, out to majestic peaks, sheer cliffs and iconic rock formations - like the Three Sisters of the Blue Mountains. Or, drop in on wildlife sanctuaries caring for the country’s animals – from hopping kangaroos to adorably cute, cuddly koalas."

      "description": "Newcastle Once known as the Steel City, today Newcastle is one of Australia’s hippest cities. It’s flanked by the Pacific Ocean and six beaches on its eastern side and a harbor on its west side. Gentrification began when the steel mills closed in 1999. Nowadays the old wharves and warehouses form part of the lively Honeysuckle precinct, which buzzes with hotels, cafés, and restaurants."

      "description": "Brisabne They don’t call it the Sunshine State for nothing, and Brisbane’s modern metropolis fully exploits its sun-blessed location, basking in Queensland’s generous year-round glow. The envied climate makes Brisbane a city of outdoor adventure, activity and relaxation, where days drift by surfing rollers, or relaxing in the shade of swaying palms. While Brisbane may play second fiddle to Sydney and Melbourne at times, it radiates a creative and contemporary energy, offering visitors a refreshing combination of laidback waterfront luxury and urban sophistication. Sandy islands nearby provide scenic diving and oceanside relaxation opportunities, while the city's animal santuaries offer opportunities to meet unbearably cute koalas and kangaroos. Brisbane’s impressive skyline of metallic cylinders rises high above the broad Brisbane River below, which curves lazily through downtown. The rolling waves of the Pacific are close by, but there’s something special about relaxing on soft sand in the very heart of the city, on the beautifully executed South Bank Parklands man-made beach. With golden sand and shallow lagoon waters to cool off in, it’s a dreamy spot to lie back with a book, amid the landscaped gardens. Nestled in a river meander of its own, Brisbane Botanic Park glows with colour, tropical plants and wading ibis birds, and is easily walkable from the Parklands. The South Bank is the cultural hub of city, and houses the celebrated Queensland Gallery of Modern Art - a surreal and vibrant jaunt through contemporary Australian art. The city’s award-winning restaurants also serve up elite food, matched with generous splashes of wine, direct from the nearby Granite Belt’s wine regions."

      "description": "Mooloolaba Once a humble fishing village, tourism has boomed in recent years and transformed Mooloolaba into one of the most coveted of Queensland’s popular holiday resorts. Located 97 km from Brisbane and set right in the heart of the Sunshine Coast, Mooloolaba is much more than an oceanfront playground. Certainly, surfers will find their nirvana here, with ideal spots for both the initiated and the beginner dotted along the coast, along with the famous surfing festival in March. But it’s not all about waxing your board and point breaks – Mooloolaba Beach has featured as one of the world’s top ten beaches for two years running and it looks set to stay that way. An early morning stroll will see you mingling with the locals, and with no beach goers around, be sure to take your cameras for some of the most instagrammable views you’re ever likely to see. Step away from the beach and guests will find some good shopping with everything from antiques and jewellery to beach towels and sarongs for sale. Local artists set up stalls on the pretty esplanade so art lovers will be sure to take home a souvenir that is really special. Epicureans meanwhile will already no doubt looking forward to tasting some of the famous Mooloolaba prawns, caught straight off a trawler. How’s that for freshness! Try the delicious local speciality either in one of the buzzing restaurants in town or straight from the Seafood Precinct and grab a spot in the shade for a picnic! If fun in the sun isn’t your cup of tea, then the Mooloolaba coastline is certainly worth seeing. Hire a motorboat, or relax on a mini-cruise and enjoy the opportunity of searching, and perhaps swimming, with whales, dolphins and turtles. Seaplanes offer another interesting way of seeing the coast with the more adventurous opting for the “doors off” experience."

      "description": "Fraser Island Frazer Island is a World Heritage site listed for the diversity and beauty it holds. Despite being a sand island, Fraser has over 100 lakes and the landscape changes constantly as dunes are moved across the island by wind. With over 350 bird species recorded, Fraser Island is also part of an ‘Important Bird Area’ and on the ‘Australian National Heritage’ list. The island can be explored by 4WD coach and kayak. In addition to the natural history, there is a rich Butchulla Aboriginal culture here. The island's most spectacular lake, Lake McKenzie is well suited for a cooling swim and at the historic central station in the heart of the island, it is possible to walk along the banks of the Wanggoolba Creek and become immersed in the peacefulness of the rainforest."

      "description": "Shute Harbor (Whitsunday Islands) The 74 Whitsunday Islands are something truly special. Natural artistry at its finest, a sprinkle of powdery white sand, a splash of turquoise seas and a whole heap of glorious sunshine combine to create a revered masterpiece of scattered tropical islands. Shute Harbour is the perfect gateway to this alluring natural wonder, a relaxed town with dashing views of the island-pocked azure seas on its doorstep. Buffered from the bustling beach-front fun of Airlie Beach by the luscious greenery of Conway National Park, Shute Harbour is a quieter spot. It offers glorious, elevated views that will whet your appetite for the immersion in pristine island scenery that lies ahead. Venture off into rainforest-clad hills to find beautiful lookout points like Mount Rooper or head for Lion’s Lookout, so you can absorb panoramic views of droplet-like islands rising from blotched turquoise water, and the spread of yachts cruising out to explore. Shute Harbour is the perfect jumping-off point for your own adventure amongst Australia's biggest and most beautiful island group - the Whitsundays. It’s hard to conjure a better vision of tropical paradise, and these stunning, world-renowned islands are just a stone’s throw away from the natural port at Shute Harbour. Kinetic sandscapes, heart-shaped coral reefs bursting with underwater life, and dazzlingly bright white beaches beckon you into a captivating, romantic and blissful pocket of Australian perfection."

      "description": "Townsville Basking in 320 sunny days a year, Townsville is a welcoming, sun-soaked slice of tropical Australia. Venture to this remote city on the cusp of the tropics, to meet adorable animals, explore gorgeous coastal islands and soak up the reliable sun's bronzing glow. Rise to the rosy rock of Castle Hill - the views down over the sparkling coastal setting, and islands waiting beyond form an amazing welcome. Located on Queensland's north-east coast, the city's bay arcs around Magnetic Island - which lies just a scenic 20-minute ferry ride away. An island sanctuary of beautiful dive sites - set amid vibrant reefs and secluded beach coves - it is one of Townsville's most exquisite natural assets. The island's national park is adorned with wildlife, and you can meet more of Australia's famous residents at the family-owned Billabong Sanctuary - which cares for kangaroos, crocodiles, wallabies and more. Townsville's vast aquarium brings the magic of the region's glittering reefs to land, and the largest reef aquarium in the world ensures that even non-divers can enjoy an authentic insight into the colourful life that blossoms offshore. Visit the beaches of lush tropical islands, or wander Townsville's pretty seaside streets and The Strand's waterfront - lined with charming 19th-century architecture and plenty of inviting cafes and alfresco eateries. Learn more of North Queensland's indigenous Bindal and Wulgurukaba communities, as you witness cultural performances, or peruse Townsville's galleries, which showcase extraordinary indigenous arts. Join the locals, to feel the region's sporting passion, as a wall of noise greets the North Queensland Cowboys rugby league team, as they take to the field here in Townsville."

      "description": "Cairns Warmly welcoming you to the natural wonders of the Great Barrier Reef, Cairns is a treasure trove of rich tropical beauty and incredible sea life. Swathes of rainforest spread out to the north, where you can soar over the canopy in a cable car, before looking down over narrow channels of water plummeting down gorges and crocodile-filled waterways. The diverse lands of the Atherton Tableland lie to the west, but it's the crystal-clear waters - and life-filled reefs - of Cairns' remarkable underwater world that draws universal adulation. Priding itself as the Gateway to the Great Barrier Reef, explore Cairns' constellation of colour, as you dive into the world's largest and most spectacular underwater universe. Cairns is huddled in amongst abundant swathes of rainforests, which give way to glorious crescents of golden beach. Kuranda - with its scenic railway and heritage market stalls - waits to be discovered, cloaked within the depths of the rainforest. Learn of the indigenous people of North Queensland during cultural performances, and hear the throaty reverberations of digeridoos, as you hear eternal stories handed down through time, from generation to generation. Back in Cairns, there's always time for a coffee or a beer, or a feast on fresh oysters with glasses of Cairns' white wines – boldly flavoured with mango and banana notes."
