      "title": "Port Douglas – Easing Into Your Surroundings",
      "description": "After landing at Cairns Airport, you will be privately transported to Port Douglas, where your boutique accommodation will be located on the beachfront. Nothing will be planned for these two days, so you can check-in to the Australian atmosphere, indulge in a stroll on the beach, visit the nearby rainforest, and prepare yourself for all the other destinations that are yet to come. It can be difficult to fly halfway around the world and then dive straight into activities and exploration. Port Douglas will offer you a beautiful place to recover from any travel fatigue and jet lag. After these two days are finished, you should be fully settled into your vacation."

      "title": "Port Douglas – Discovering the Great Barrier Reef",
      "description": "Like everywhere on your itinerary, Port Douglas has spectacular surroundings. This morning, you will travel on a speed boat to a pontoon in the Pacific. A long chain of 2,900 individual reefs, the Great Barrier Reef stretches 1,400 miles along the coast of Australia. You will be exploring part of the northern section, which is where there are larger marine species and an opportunity to discover the reefs without getting wet. The boat will dock at a floating pontoon, which will be your base for a few hours of exploring. You can indulge in some guided snorkeling here and can also cruise around the reefs in a semi-submersible vessel. While exotic fish and marine creatures can impress, the highlight will be the reef itself with so many colors and shapes that are clustered in artistic harmony."

      "title": "Melbourne – Exploring Art and Architecture",
      "description": "Today, you will bid farewell to Port Douglas as your local guide transfers you to Cairns for a morning flight to Melbourne. Your boutique hotel will be situated near Flinders Street Station in the heart of old Melbourne. This is an excellent location for senior travelers because it will allow you to easily explore the riverside, the city’s art galleries, and the city’s Victorian charm. From Flinders Street Station, you can also take train service to some of Melbourne’s beachside suburbs. After an airport transfer, you will have some time to rest and freshen up before a private city tour in the afternoon. Your guide will plan a route that is suited to how far you want to walk, using the city’s old-world trams to connect different locations."

      "title": "Melbourne – Encounters with Kangaroos and Koalas",
      "description": "Although you can witness indigenous wildlife in small sanctuaries, it is not the same when the animals are not in their natural habitat. Mobs of kangaroos skip across Australia, especially in the Victoria state, and koalas still survive in the wild. Clinging on with fingers and nails, they live in eucalyptus trees, rarely moving more than 20 meters a day. Usually, you can move close enough to watch koalas open their sleepy eyes, and, almost always, they will go straight back to sleep. With kangaroos, it is difficult to predict how close you will come. Sometimes, a mob is on the move or behaving skittishly, so you may see them hopping around in the distance. You can take a few steps forward before your guide analyzes the marsupials’ reactions."

      "title": "Sydney – History Tour and Sunset Dinner Cruise",
      "description": "After a short flight to Sydney, you will transfer to your luxury accommodation in Circular Quay. A local guide will show you the city center from the cobblestone charm of The Rocks to the glorious Victorian architecture. Sydney’s center is as much about the stories as it is the buildings, and you will continue your evening with a cruise along the Parramatta River. By departing from Circular Quay, you will cruise under Sydney Harbour Bridge to Darling Harbour before gliding under the bridge again and out toward the Pacific. Dinner will be served as you pass the city’s icons from the place where explorers first touched down to neighborhoods of riverside charm. By the main course, you will have heard about the city from both an Aboriginal and explorer perspective, and by dessert, you will be cruising back to Circular Quay with city lights twinkling all around you."

      "title": "Sydney – Performance at the Sydney Opera House",
      "description": "Yesterday will have been a relatively busy day, so today will be left completely free. There is a lot to see and do in Sydney, and you can customize the day to your interests. One option will be to travel to some of the city’s famous beaches like Bondi. If you are feeling active, there is a superb walk from Bondi to Coogee. Another option will be to take the public ferry along the Parramatta River to Manly, which is a beachside suburb on the opposite side of the city. If you want to partake in a day trip, then consider the Blue Mountains, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site of stunning views and a blue-clad forest. This evening, you can walk from the hotel to the Sydney Opera House in less than ten minutes. Most people visit the opera house on a guided tour, and many forget that this is a functioning building."

      "title": "Christchurch – Highlights of a Revitalized City",
      "description": "Today, you will fly between Australia and New Zealand and lose two hours when you jump forward in time zones between Sydney and Christchurch. After a private airport transfer, you can spend the evening exploring Christchurch’s city center, where there is a large pedestrianized area and a number of delicious restaurants. Christchurch will feel more like a charming village than a city. Its history is recent, largely due to an earthquake that severely devastated and scarred the city. These scars are still visible today with piles of rubble and the incomplete frames of buildings that are half-collapsed to the ground. Christchurch may not have fully recovered, but you will find that the recovery process is incredibly exciting and innovative. You will have all of this helpfully narrated by a private guide today."

      "title": "Franz Josef Glacier – New Zealand’s Wild West Coast",
      "description": "Today and tomorrow will be a celebration of your journey, beginning with a beautiful ride on the TranzAlpine railway from Christchurch to Greymouth. You can sit back in first-class comfort and gaze out through the customized windows. A patchwork of pastoral colors will give way to rugged mountains as the train ascends. After a long tunnel, you can see how everything is different. Volcanoes run down the spine of the South Island. The West Coast is known as Te Wahipounamu, and this entire area is regarded as a natural UNESCO World Heritage Site. There are no towns or cities, only mountain passes, secluded beaches, great forests, and icy worlds. After disembarking in Greymouth, you will have lunch before a private transfer carries you to Franz Josef Glacier."

      "title": "Queenstown – Through the Southern Alps",
      "description": "This morning, a helicopter will take you closer before touching down on a glacier. You can get out and walk on the ice, and it can be a little slippery, but your guides will assist you. This is one of the most accessible glaciers in the world. After your heli-hiking tour, you will continue the journey. It will take around five hours of driving to reach Queenstown, but it is a route that is blessed with highlights. Mountain passes can provide you with spectacular moments, and as you descend toward Queenstown, there will be vineyards, where you can indulge in tastings and tours. These two days will involve a ton of travel, but it will mostly be private, so you can stop when you want and take your time. Queenstown will be the perfect place to relax after your journey."

      "title": "Queenstown – New Zealand’s Prettiest Town",
      "description": "Today, you will wake up and gaze out onto Lake Wakatipu. You can step into the street to see more mountains because Queenstown is literally surrounded by rugged summits and slopes. This charming town is famous as a capital for adventure with activities like bungee jumping and jet boat riding. Today can be customized to your interests just like any day on this Australia and New Zealand adventure. You can extend your stay in one destination, miss out on another, and add some in other places. In Queenstown, it is easy to arrange activities locally, so you can see how you feel and what you want to do for the day."

      "title": "Queenstown – The Wonder of Milford Sound",
      "description": "This morning, after a two and a half-hour journey by road, you will cruise through the sound, following dolphins and seals and passing waterfalls. At some points, the walls are vertical and stand more than 3,000 feet above the water. You will travel to the raging waters of the Tasman Sea before looping back to the harbor for your beautiful journey back to your luxurious accommodation by helicopter. Here, you can step out, inhale the tranquil air, and admire the endless natural beauty before continuing to Queenstown for your final night in New Zealand."
