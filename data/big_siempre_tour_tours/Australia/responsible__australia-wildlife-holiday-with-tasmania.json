  "generalInfo": "Australia seamlessly blends rugged wilderness, rich diverse and unique wildlife with top notch accommodation, first class cuisine and fine wines better than any other country. The country is vast and offers a comfortable and safe environment in which to take a holiday of any sort and in terms of safaris offers the chance to see some of the world’s strangest wildlife.<br/><br/>The country is the size of a continent but is also very sparsely populated with people, making this a mecca for wildlife watchers. But the size of the country is also a problem for anyone wishing to see it all in one trip; so we have produced this itinerary which visits several areas over 3 states and a rich diversity of habitats. By visiting Tasmania, Queensland and Victoria we hope to showcase a vast array of wildlife and many of the species which make this island continent unique.<br/><br/>Australia has been isolated from the rest of the world for around 60 million years. In this time the organisms have evolved into a unique flora and fauna and a staggeringly large number of endemic species. Perhaps the strangest are the monotremes, the world’s only egg-laying mammals, such as Platypus and Short-beaked Echidna (of which we have very good chances of seeing) as well as iconic pouched mammals (marsupials) including Koalas, various species of Kangaroos and Wombats.<br/><br/>Birds too are well represented, from the giant Southern Cassowaries to tiny Little Penguins and vibrant Rosellas and Cockatoos; reptiles are also supersized here with large crocodiles, monitors and snakes found in many places in Australia. All of these and much much more all make Australia a true wildlife enthusiasts dream, as well as being a country that can be visited time and again without repeating the same locations.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife tour in Australia. Being a country continent the hardest part is picking what to include and what not to include as it is impossible to see all of this vast and wonderful country in one trip. <br/><br/>This tour focuses on the East of the vast country and in particular three states, the island state of Tasmania, the famous state of Victoria and the wild state of Queensland. These states are home to large tracts of forest and scrubland as well as wild and rugged coastline. It is during our exploration of these states where we aim to showcase wildlife as diverse as the unique and weird platypus and echidna to the seemingly out of place little blue penguin and the colourful crimson rosella. Along with these animals we aim to see the endemic Tasmanian devils and a whole host of wallabies, kanagroos, pademelons, wombats and many more.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including breakfasts throughout. We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers and game drives. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Australia. <br/><br/>Your naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. <br/><br/>We also include all vehicle safaris, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the Australian wilderness, night safaris are available in some locations (subject to the local conditions on that day). You will have to speak to your guide on arrival there and book places on these (this is not included). A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>There is no bad time to visit this part of Australia, however the winter months (August - September) can be cold and even snowy in Tasmania. So we recommend visiting during the build up to summer (October or November); where the average temperature of 10-20 degrees C is very pleasant for wildlife and humans alike.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist guides as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it. We do our best to include as many wildlife activities as possible in all of our itineraries.<br/>• Depending on budget and interest we have a range of different accommodation packages to offer, from luxury top end lodges, national park safari lodges and mobile-camps which often offer unbelievable wildlife watching deep inside national parks as well as camping.<br/>• Spend all the daylight hours searching for wildlife and visiting various natural wonders and stunning landscapes.<br/>• We spend a large amount of time after dark looking for wildlife also. Spotlighting for over 1 hour every night.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our Australian wildlife safaris a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Australia so that we can try and find and observe some of the rarer and more elusive species. We have great itineraries and expertise in all the Australian states and can arrange trips to find some of the rarer species such as yellow-footed rock wallabies, black walleroos, greater bilbies, cassowaries among other species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour visit various locations within South East Australia and the states of Tasmania, Victoria and Queensland. We will start in Hobart and finish in Melbourne.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>There is some hiking here, but never too much and nearly all is over flat terrain, which can be hot (even in winter), so some experience in walking in heat is recommended, but there are no particularly strenuous hikes included in this trip.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 15 Years Old<br/><br/>Photo Credits:<br/><br/>Eric Gropp, CC BY 2.0 <br/>knicolson, CC BY 4.0",

      "description": "Hobart / Bruny Island - Arrival & Travelling This morning you will be collected from the airport (an early arrival is needed) and we will head straight away to catch the morning ferry to Bruny Island. The Bruny Island ferry crosses the D’Entrecasteaux Channel. The island is in fact two islands, North and South Bruny, joined by a narrow isthmus known as The Neck. Both have the highest cliffs in the Southern Hemisphere, all 12 endemic birds and the only wild population of white wallabies in the world which you can easily see at close quarters by taking a walk at dusk to Grass Point. There is much to enjoy here including many beautiful walks through pristine forests and along stunning beaches that look south towards Antarctica. Our accommodation whilst on Bruny Island will be Inala, which has a long and proud history in wildlife rehabilitation, caring for injured and abandoned animals. Together with your guide, you will explore the 1,500 acre property which is home to a variety of threatened species and all the Tasmanian endemic birds and many mammals. After dinner your guide will take you to see the Little Penguin and Short-tailed Shearwater rookery to view these birds returning after dusk. Penguins can be viewed all year round, in varying numbers, but Shearwaters are only present between September and April. You will then head off to see some more of Bruny’s nocturnal and abundant wildlife such as Tasmanian Pademelons and Eastern Quolls which are now only found in Tasmania, as well as Bennett’s Wallabies and Brush-tailed Possums. You will return to the cottage after the tour. (dinner is the only meal included today)."

      "description": "Bruny Island - Wildlife Watching Today your touring will continue around Bruny Island. Your guiding today will also include the three-hour Bruny Island Wilderness Cruise which departs Adventure Bay on South Bruny. You will cruise alongside some of Australia’s highest sea cliffs, beneath towering crags and drift up close to listen to the awesome ‘Breathing Rock’. Enter deep sea caves, pass through the narrow gap between the coast and ‘The Monument’ and feel the power of nature at the point where the Tasman Sea meets the might of the Southern Ocean. You will join in the search for the abundant coastal wildlife such as seals, dolphins, migrating whales and sea birds. After the cruise returns you will continue your touring on Bruny Island before dinner, after which you will enjoy another evening of nocturnal wildlife spotting. (all meals included today)."

      "description": "Bruny Island / Bonorong Sanctuary - Wildlife Watching This morning is your final chance for watching wildlife on Bruny Island, then after an early lunch you will leave Bruny and retrace your drive back towards Hobart and onward to the east coast via a private tour at Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary (~2 hours). Bonorong is a sanctuary, not a zoo, and it is a wonderful place to see all Tasmania’s endemic and native species in a natural environment. It also has one of the most important Tasmanian devil sanctuaries in the state, along with the endangered Tasmania tree frog breeding programme. After our tour here we will continue to our accommodation situated at the mouth of the Prosser River, Orford is a little settlement with great views over Maria Island, where you are touring tomorrow. (all meals included today)."

      "description": "Maria Island - Travelling & Wildlife Watching Today we will catch the ferry to Maria Island and meet our local guide to explore the island. Maria Island is a mountainous island National Park, situated 15km off the East Coast of Tasmania. It is in fact two landmasses joined in the middle by a long sandy isthmus, with stunning beaches on either side. The island is 22km long and 12km wide. The beaches are pure white granite sand. Maria Island is also renowned for its unique geology. You will enjoy viewing volcanic mountains, painted sandstone cliffs, towering limestone cliffs, ancient granite cliffs and beautiful white sandy beaches. Maria Island is a Noah’s Ark for endangered wildlife, including Tasmanian devils, and 11 of the 12 endemic birds. It has no resident human population, just two park rangers. During your day on Maria Island you should be able to spot the many resident Wombats, Forester Kangaroos, Bennett’s Wallabies, Tasmanian Pademelons, Possums and other species if you keep a sharp eye out. Tasmanian devil numbers state-wide have declined dramatically due to the Facial Tumour Disease. Maria Island was chosen as a site for captive breeding and 15 Tasmanian Devils were introduced to the Island in 2012 which have now bred successfully. (Maria Island had previously been devil-free). You will all return on the 5 pm ferry which arrives back at Triabunna at 530 pm. You will drive back to your B&B where dinner is again being provided for you. (all meals included today)."

      "description": "Great Western Tiers - Travelling & Wildlife Watching Today we will make the 229km (~3 hour) drive to Forest Walks Lodge in the Great Western Tiers. Along the way we will stop at the historic township of Swansea which is worth a little wander around. Our destination would be the Freycinet Peninsula today (an additional 45 minutes’ drive). The Freycinet Peninsula is regarded as one of the State’s most iconic coastal areas, although these days it is also one of the most intensely visited with little tourism infrastructure to cope with the numbers who flock here. Most people visit the Freycinet Peninsula to bush walk, with a number of options ranging from the several hour trek into Wineglass Bay and around the Hazards to the much easier Sleepy Bay walk, the Cape Tourville Lookout Walk and the Friendly Beaches Walk. Many species of birds live in or stop over at Freycinet and the surrounding area. Birders are often lucky enough to see a white-bellied sea-eagle gliding overhead or large Australasian gannet diving for food in the ocean. In the bushy and forested areas it is often possible to see or hear small nectar-feeding birds such as eastern spinebill and yellow-throated, crescent or New Holland honeyeaters, and the large yellow-tailed black cockatoos, which often feed and fly in raucous groups. After exploring some of Freycinet Peninsula we will continue onward to Jackeys Marsh which is in the Great Western Tiers, and in particular our accommodation at Forest Walks Lodge. (all meals included today)."

      "description": "Eugenana - Wildlife Watching This morning after breakfast you will enjoy a guided forest walk before leaving Forest Walks Lodge and commencing our drive to another wonderful little eco hideaway, Mountain Valley Retreats in the hidden valley of Loongana, near Leven Canyon (~2 hours). In a wide valley at Eugenana, in the hills in northern Tasmanian near Devonport, the wonderful Tasmanian Arboretum can be found. The lake focuses the landscape and there are a many short and long walks. A popular spot for birding, this provides a habitat for Platypus, which can often be easily spotted by eagle-eyed visitors. When we arrive at our accommodation we will settle in and then in the evening we will have a walk around. Deep in the north west of Tasmania, this is one of the only places you may be lucky enough to see Tasmanian Devils and Quolls in the wild, and you are likely to see platypus in the wild too. (all meals included today)."

      "description": "Mountain Valley - Wildlife Watching Today is a second day at Mountain Valley to further explore Leven Canyon. The walk to the Cruickshank Lookout will take you to an elevated position of 275m above the Leven River. It is only around 45 minutes return with some steep terrain and 697 steps on the Forest Stairs Track. The views are nothing short of breath-taking. There are many other longer walks to enjoy here. Kaydale Gardens, a short drive away, are also worth a visit. The garden imposes itself on the landscape, a stunning garden designed, constructed and maintained by a visionary family. To maximise our chances of seeing wildlife today I recommend spending time on the Fern Walk and the Forest Stairs Walk. (all meals included today)."

      "description": "Cradle Mountain National Park - Wildlife Watching Leave Mountain Valley in the morning and drive to Cradle Mountain (1.5 hours), one of Tasmania’s most iconic landmarks. When entering the park we will head to the accommodation and after checking in we can enjoy one of the many walks around the lodge. Cradle Mountain Wilderness Lodge is nestled in a secluded bush setting in the Cradle Valley on the very edge of the World Heritage listed Cradle Mountain/Lake St Clair National Park. It is on the right hand side as you drive towards the entrance to the National Park, just towards the grid. There is much to see and do to enjoy the majesty of the Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park during your short stay here. Opportunities for bush walks are almost limitless, to suit all ages and abilities. Please take careful note of the weather forecast before setting off on any long walks and ensure you sign in at the walkers’ registration booths as the weather can change very quickly and there is no mobile phone reception. Ensure you are well equipped with suitable clothing and water. New regulations imposed by the Parks & Wildlife Service mean that you can no longer drive your car through the boom gate to the national park during the hours of the shuttle bus operation (8am to 4:30pm). The shuttle buses run a very regular operation and your National Parks Pass gives you free use of the buses. However you are very close to the entrance to the National Park and if you wish you can take your car down the road to Dove Lake after 4:30pm and spot wombats. If we arrive at Cradle Mountain in time, you can enjoy the easy walk around Dove Lake (around 2.5 hours) or to get away from the tourists, opt for the longer and slightly more challenging Crater Lake Walk, which is also the start of the famous Overland Track and begins at Ronny Creek. It is a lovely walk. Weather permitting, you can also continue to Marion’s Lookout for incredible views – the last part does involve a bit of a scramble but it is worth it – or keen walkers can even make it to the summit of Cradle Mountain. We will also visit Ronny Creek to watch wombats shuffling out of the gloaming. This is one of the top (but least known) wombat spotting places in Tassie especially since mange has decimated numbers in Narawntapu, and one of the best kept secrets at Cradle Mountain. Look out for their cube shaped poo. They are completely habituated and a few minutes’ patience will invariably reward you with many sightings. You can often get within touching distance and they will even push past your legs to get to their desired grazing spot. This evening you are booked on the 5:30pm ‘After Dark’ Feeding Tour at Devils@Cradle which is an excellent sanctuary dedicated to Tasmanian devils and their cousin the spotted-tail and eastern quoll although you are likely to see wombats and wallabies too. Quolls are especially elusive even in most sanctuaries, and the here are therefore an easy way to see them in a very natural environment. You will also be given a fascinating insight into both species and the challenges faced by the Tasmanian devil as it fights the devastation of the Facial Tumour Disease which has decimated the species. (all meals included today)."

The diverse forests of East Gippsland are the reason that wildlife is so abundant. Today we will visit both dry and wet mountain forests, visit the famous Snowy River, and walk beside a wilderness creek where the landscape changes dramatically from the sunny, dry slopes to the near-rainforest of the gully. Your local expert guide provides detailed information of the formation of these mighty forests, and helps you search for Lyrebirds, parrots, goannas, wallabies and honeyeaters. Birds and reptiles are abundant, but other human visitors are few. We finish the day with a classic Aussie dinner at the Homestead. (all meals included on these days)."

Then we walk through a heathland and along a forest-lined river to its estuary in Australia’s Coastal Wilderness. We search for Sea Eagles, cockatoos, kingfishers, swans and huge goanna lizards. We visit a quiet beach with a complex dune system and frequently see beach and ocean-going birds. After lunch we take a walk on the nearby rocky headland, peering into rock pools, walking past wind-sculpted coastal shrubs looking at the expanse of the 90 mile beach. We spend a little time on a beautiful beach removing old fishing nets – they wash up from the sea, and sometimes wash back out, where they trap and kill sea creatures. Our dinner tonight is a picnic in the bush overlooking the beach (weather permitting). On our way back to our Homestead we search the plains for wallabies, kangaroos and wombats.

We also search for Grey-headed Flying-foxes in their daytime roosts beside the river at Bairnsdale (a large colony set up there in 2013, and at the time of writing provide great viewing opportunities. They may move on at any time though).
