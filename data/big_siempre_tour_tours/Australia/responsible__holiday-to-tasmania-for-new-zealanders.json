  "generalInfo": "Tasmania - Australia's only island state - is an easy journey from New Zealand.  At 40 degrees South, it lies just an hour or so from Melbourne and Sydney, yet in the relatively short time it takes to get there, you might as well have landed in another world.  <br/><br/>Excitement builds as your plane begins its descent over seemingly endless mountain ranges, stretching as far as the eye can see, all deeply forested and carved up by wild rivers and deep, dark lakes and pockets of rich pastures.  As your plane banks you will see that the island is fringed by startling white sand beaches lapped by brilliant turquoise seas.   <br/><br/>Any sign of civilisation is all but invisible until you land at Hobart Airport. <br/><br/>Even then, you will be immediately struck by island's calm, tranquil lifestyle. Locals consider themselves first and foremost to be Tasmanian, and only then Australian.  They are justly proud of their peaceful existence, as they also are of their rich convict heritage.<br/><br/>What awaits you now is a melting pot of history and culture, an abundance of wildlife that might have hopped or waddled straight from the pages of a fairy tale, and day after day of adventure. <br/><br/>This Land, among the most diverse and fertile in the world, provides a mouth-watering array of produce, wines and whiskies, all of which is clearly evident within minutes of landing.  <br/><br/>Tasmania has everything you could possibly ask for in a dream holiday, all wrapped up in an island the size of Sri Lanka. <br/><br/>This is quite possibly the land that time forgot.  And yet ....<br/><br/>Within this land where Nature is King, you will also find one of the most vibrant, cosmopolitan small cities on the planet.  The harbour city of Hobart, despite its serene location on the River Derwent with Mount Wellington as its backdrop, is a buzzing hotchpotch of history, art, culture, food, wine and people. <br/><br/>On this magical Tasmanian odyssey you will begin your self-drive holiday from Hobart on a day to suit you, and explore for as little or as long as you wish.  <br/><br/>While most visitors are keen to see the classic icons of Tasmania - Wineglass Bay and Cradle Mountain - the real joy of this holiday lies in our local knowledge and ability to take you away from the tourists, to new horizons, down untrodden paths and the road less travelled to hidden gems that not even the best travelled Aussies can tell you about. <br/><br/>Each journey we create is designed to showcase the best of Tassie. ‘Meet the locals’ in charming B&amp;Bs. Dine on delicious home cooking.  Hide away in wilderness cottages. Relax in restored homesteads from a bygone era.  <br/><br/>The style and pace of our holidays are tailored to suit any age and ability, from the young and active to the mature and mellow, even those with limited mobility. We promise you the experience of a lifetime. <br/><br/>We have been making dreams come true in Tassie for over 20 years. Put your dreams in the hands of Tasmanian travel experts. No one knows Tassie like we do. Our passion is to share it with you.",

      "description": "Your journey begins as your plane starts its descent into Hobart. You should catch your first glimpse of endless arcs of the east coast’s white sand beaches washed by an impossibly turquoise Tasman Sea before the plane banks over densely forested mountain ranges stretching as the eye can see, carved up by wild rivers and liberally peppered with inky lakes. Coming into land, you will barely have time to pinch yourself before you arrive at one of the prettiest and most vibrant cities in Australia. This is the maritime state capital, Hobart, perched insouciantly between The Mountain and the Great Southern Ocean. This is also the gateway to arguably the most beautiful and diverse island paradise in the world. And this is where your Tasmanian odyssey begins. Within half an hour you can be standing on the historic sandstone Salamanca Place where you can enjoy the best of all worlds: the pretty village of Battery Point, the year round buzz of Salamanca’s restaurants, bars and galleries, and the arresting beauty of one of the world’s most beautiful harbours with Mt Wellington as its backdrop."

      "description": "If your stay in Hobart falls over a weekend you can enjoy the bustle of Tasmania’s longest running attraction – the Salamanca markets, where locals gather to chat, laugh and entertain each other with an ambience akin to a village fete. Spend the afternoon at MONA – the world famous Museum of Old and New Art, one of the world’s most extraordinary private museums, built within the Triassic sandstone cliffs of the River Derwent. Take the ferry up the river and book seats in the Posh Pit – you won’t be disappointed!"

      "description": "This morning you will leave Hobart and start your westward ascent. Your journey up the scenic and lush Derwent Valley will take you to one of Tasmania’s oldest and best loved national parks, Mt Field, where easy short walks will reveal 80 metre high Russell Falls and the tallest flowering trees in the world – legendary giants of the forest. Stay in a riverside cabin at the very entrance to the National Park, bidding farewell to all but four legged visitors, or a restored homestead surrounded by the rolling hills and lakes of the southern Central Highlands."

This modern-day one-man work of art is a 100 metre wooden sculpture telling the story of the Central Highlands set among the jaw dropping landscapes of the Wild Rivers National Park."

This is the southernmost point of one of Australia's most famous overland treks. You can enjoy a stroll through the landscape spotting platypus and wombats, or take advantage of a guided walk with a local expert."

      "description": "Today you will continue your climb through the dramatic landscapes and across the dramatic ‘moonscape’ of Queenstown. No fewer than ninety bends later, you will reach the tiny town of Strahan. This little outpost sits on the edge of Macquarie Harbour, an astonishing piece of water which is several times larger than Sydney Harbour and has no landmass between it and South America. Soak up the spine-chilling story of this remote outpost that witnessed the torture of men through horrific penal labour, only to see saw men and women stop environmental destruction in its tracks a century later. Take the West Coast Wilderness Railway under steam through virgin rainforest – a living piece of history that will bring the stories of piners and miners alive as your carriage negotiates some of the steepest gradients of any railway in the world under the Swiss designed rack and pinion system."

You will spend the tonight at a wilderness retreat, a former mining village, deep in the heart of one of the last major stretches of temperate rainforest left on the planet."

As you cruise down the majestic waters of this wild river, you will marvel at the shimmering reflections and walk among the most ancient trees in the world with inquisitive endemic wildlife and birds for company."

      "description": "Today you will venture north, continuing on the Road to Nowhere through virgin rainforest and high over the wilderness. This is known as the Edge of the World, and for all the world it feels like it. The Roaring Forties winds sweep in from Patagonia, bring crashing waves to this region which is one of the most accessible wildernesses in the world. Breathe deeply, for you are now on the spot which consistently records the cleanest air in the inhabited world! Stanley, a perfect little gem of a town, sits peacefully at the base of a dramatic ‘Nut’ of volcanic rock at the end of a peninsula in the Bass Strait, bursting with history of early settlers and the contentment of generations of families for whom this remote corner of the world has been home. Nowhere is the warmth and friendliness of islanders, the power of nature, and the cheeky curiosity of the wildlife more evident. Tasmanian Pademelons vie for your attention, wallabies hop down the street at dusk, and comical Little Penguins brazenly strut their stuff right in front of your eyes in all their wild glory as they return from a day’s fishing in the mighty ocean."

      "description": "Today you will leave the Far North West corner - but your adventure is far from over! You will continue your odyssey into yet another world as you venture into ancient devil country. Stay on a private Land for Wildlife retreat in a beautiful lost valley where endangered Tasmanian devils and quolls, found nowhere but on this extraordinary island, roam freely, almost undisturbed by man. During your stay in a simple but spacious log cabin you will take a guided walk at dusk to spot the elusive Duck-billed Platypus before settling down in front of your log fire with a delicious home-cooked dinner, and prepare for Tasmania’s largest carnivorous marsupial to arrive on your porch – the rare and beleaguered Tasmanian devil, more often than not joined by its equally elusive cousin, the Quoll."

      "description": "Today you will be able to explore one of Australia's most breath-taking canyons, arguably the most spectacular bushwalking spot in Tasmania with a fraction of those who flock to Cradle Mountain (which is an easy day trip away for those who wish to see it). Choose from one of the easy walks to two of the most dramatic lookout points in the island on canopies which are cantilevered out high over the crashing river and forests below, or one of the many more challenging walks for those with a thirst for adventure. Visit beautiful private gardens, run by a dedicated family of ladies whose green fingered prowess has attracted film crews from all over the country to this most unlikely of locations."

      "description": "Leaving the enigmatic Central Highlands of Tasmania, you will meander your way to a little known region – the Great Western Tiers. On the way, stop at more magnificent gardens where several platypus can be seen on a daily basis; perhaps enjoy a guided tour at one of Tasmania’s top wildlife sanctuaries or call in at some of the many local makers – cheese, honey, chocolate, salmon and cool climate wines. Spend tonight in a three room eco lodge, where the owners is as famed for his gourmet cooking as for his knowledge of the forests, which he will share on a never to be forgotten guided walk through the forest before he dons his chef’s whites for an equally memorable dinner of local produce. Although just an hour from Launceston and Devonport, you are unlikely to see another soul during your stay here."

      "description": "Head towards Launceston, and stroll around ‘Cataract Gorge’, the ‘Wilderness in the Heart of the City’, taking the world’s longest chairlift across the impressive natural gorge. Culture vultures can visit two of Tasmania’s World Heritage Listed convict sites where the most precious and perfectly preserved convict history in Australia is set among acres of fabulous gardens including the National Rose Garden. You can actually stay in one of the original convict built cottages on the World Heritage Site, or you can head north to the aptly named Beauty Point. Despite its name and location, Beauty Point attracts surprisingly few visitors. You will love its delightful arty, local vibe – added to which you are within a short drive of the Narawntapu National Park and a beautiful swimming beach. Stay in one of the island’s most highly rated B&Bs, a true hidden gem which epitomises Tasmanian hospitality at its best, set in carefully tended cottage gardens which run down to the Tamar River."

Make the easy and peaceful drive through the north east wilderness to the east coast town of St Helens, gateway to the 50 km stretch of beaches known as the Bay of Fires. You can stay in St Helens itself, but those wishing to further connect with nature can enjoy a spot of glamping in the forest, just minutes from the sea although like all things Tasmanian, creature comforts are always to hand with cashmere hot water bottles and gourmet cooking."

      "description": "You are now embarking on Tasmania’s Great Eastern Drive. There are several choices to make, depending on your mobility, interests and most importantly, how many people you wish to see on your travels! Wineglass Bay on the Freycinet Peninsula is one of Tasmania’s most photographed spots and an unmissable highlight for many, but if your idea of heaven is mile upon mile of untrodden wild beaches and walking trails, swimming in secret water holes and an island known as the ‘wombat capital of the world’, our recommendation is to discover the hidden delights north of the iconic Freycinet Peninsula, or equally the historic southern stretch with spellbinding views spanning the Hazards Mountain Range down to the Maria Island National Park."
