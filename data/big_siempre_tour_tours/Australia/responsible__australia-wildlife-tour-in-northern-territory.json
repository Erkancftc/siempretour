  "generalInfo": "The Top End of Australia is home to one of the wettest places on earth as well as some of the driest places in the world. The forests, waterways and desert scrub is home to the largest reptile on the planet, the second largest bird, the largest marsupial as well as the largest monolith in the world. With this abundance of noteworthy natural history the Northern Territory can truly be called a land of extremes. This tour explores the best and wildest parts of this vast region, from Darwin to the myriad of waterways that crisscross Kakadu National Park to the vast deserts of the Red Centre and of course Uluru (Ayres Rock).<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife tour in Australia. Being a country continent the hardest part is picking what to include and what not to include as it is impossible to see all of this vast and wonderful country in one trip. <br/>When driving in the Outback it is easy to think that the desert is devoid of life, but on closer inspection Kangaroos, perenties, snakes and a wide variety of birdlife. This tour explores the centre of Australia and as well as visiting the famous Uluru (Ayres Rock) also goes in search of wildlife in the desert.<br/>But it is not just the desert and scrub lands that are of interest on this trip, we will also be visiting the far north and the wetlands and forests of Kakadu and Litchfield National Parks. This is the realm of the Saltwater crocodile and they live here in huge numbers along side wallabies and a wealth of waterfowl.<br/>There are so many different places to visit in the Northern Territory, this itinerary visits three of the most popular and best for wildlife sightings. Kakadu, Litchfield and Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Parks are all visited here and time spent in each location on safaris.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including breakfasts throughout. We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers and game drives. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Australia. <br/><br/>Your naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. <br/><br/>We also include all vehicle safaris, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the Australian wilderness, night safaris are available in some locations (subject to the local conditions on that day). You will have to speak to your guide on arrival there and book places on these (this is not included). A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>August is the winter in Australia however the Northern Territory never gets truly very cold. With an average temperature of 20-30 degrees C and the lowest annual humidity it is the most pleasant time to visit. It is the dry season so there is often no rain as well. This is when we recommend this tour, however other times of year are also possible.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist guides as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it. We do our best to include as many wildlife activities as possible in all of our itineraries.<br/>• Depending on budget and interest we have a range of different accommodation packages to offer, from luxury top end lodges, national park safari lodges and mobile-camps which often offer unbelievable wildlife watching deep inside national parks as well as camping.<br/>• Spend all the daylight hours searching for wildlife and visiting various natural wonders and stunning landscapes.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our Australian wildlife safaris a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Australia so that we can try and find and observe some of the rarer and more elusive species. We have great itineraries and expertise in all the Australian states and can arrange trips to find some of the rarer species such as yellow-footed rock wallabies, Tasmanian devils, greater bilbies, cassowaries among other species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour visit various locations within Northern Territory, Australia. We will start and end the trip in the territorial capital of Darwin and then move east to Kakadu and Litchfield, before heading south and into the heart of the outback and to Uluru via Alice Springs.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>There is some hiking here, hiking in the desert, which can be hot (even in winter), so some experience in walking in heat is recommended, but there are no particularly strenuous hikes included in this trip.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 15 Years Old",

      "description": "Darwin - Arrival - On your arrival you will be met by your local guide/driver and he will drive you all to our accommodation in Darwin. The rest of the day and evening will be for you to relax and explore Darwin if you wish. We usually take the first day easy as the flight is very long and the heat and humidity in Darwin can take some getting used to. There is an optional excursion to the George Brown Darwin Botanical Gardens if you are interested and not too jetlagged. These gardens are a joy to walk around and if we keep a keen eye looking around we can spot some of the many birds which live around here such as blue-faced honeyeaters, rufous owls, chestnut rails, orange-footed scrub fowl, rose-crowned fruit doves and many other species which are resident here or just visiting the gardens.
