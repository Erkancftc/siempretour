    "generalInfo": "Kangaroo Island is Australia's third largest island, and to the astonishment of most visitors, it is the size of Bali or Long Island in New York.  With over 300 miles of pristine, rugged coastline and 3400 square miles of diverse wildlife-rich landscapes, red dirt roads, sheep farms and bush, this island is best described as hidden Australia in miniature, and the only way to really get under the skin of its wild beauty is with the keen eyes and ears of your own local guide.  <br/><br/>For a three or four day classically Australian wildlife and birding encounter there is nowhere better in which to immerse and indulge your love of nature. The diverse geology, native vegetation and low population make this island Eden a refuge to over 268 species of birds, many species of mammal and over 900 species of plants.  Many of these are subspecies unique to 'KI' - as the locals call their beloved island.  <br/><br/>Within minutes of landing at tiny Kingscote Airport from Adelaide, your eagle-eyed guide from family-run tour company Exceptional Kangaroo Island will have you virtually nose to nose with Kangaroo Island Kangaroos lazing in the bush, and gazing up at picture postcard perfect koalas, dozing a few feet away in the eucalypts.  <br/><br/>After a KI-style picnic lunch on a private reserve, expertly prepared by your guide, a quiet walk through the bush will reveal KI's very own Tammar Wallabies, and a stroll down to the Seal Bay Conservation Park will bring you face to face with countless Australian Sea Lions splashing and diving in the surf, squabbling over territory and basking in the sun.  As you explore the island in an expertly-manoeuvred  4WD, you may see a flock of Glossy-black Cockatoos swooping overhead, while glorious colourful Galahs will call to you from the trees outside your B&amp;B or lodge.<br/><br/>With a Mediterranean climate, KI can be visited at any time of year. While many species of bird and mammal can be seen year-round, each new season brings its own wildlife and birding highlights.  Tell us your wish-list, and we will guide you to the season best suited to your interests.<br/><br/>We can take care of all your travel arrangements from Adelaide Airport, with daily flights on Regional Express.  Your island accommodation will be chosen to suit your very own style; choose from delightful family-run homesteads and cosy Provencal style B&amp;Bs with home-cooked dinners served with local wines (from the island's very own 12 wineries of course); or jolly hotels, intimate boltholes and lodges from rustic to last word in luxury.  <br/><br/>For a completely tailor-made experience, your very own private guide awaits - perfect for a couple or family; if you prefer the company of others, join a small group tour with a handful of like-minded nature-lovers.  No one knows Kangaroo Island better than the locals. Your Exceptional Kangaroo Island Experience awaits.",

        "description": "Today you will take your 30 minute flight from Adelaide Airport to Kingscote on Kangaroo Island - or KI as you will come to call it over the next few days, in true local parlance. You will fly on a 35 seat Saab with Regional Express (REX) which offers a choice of morning or afternoon daily flights. Upon arrival you will be met by your guide who will be your eyes, ears and knowledge for the next couple of days. Depending on your chosen time and accommodation, you will either be transferred to your accommodation or you will be able to explore Kingscote, Kangaroo Island's largest town - population circa 1800! Despite its small population, Kingscote has a thriving arts community and you will be able to browse the local craft ranging from paintings and glassware to woodwork and jewellery. Being South Australia's oldest European settlement, Kingscote also has plenty of historical interest, and an excellent selection of cafés and restaurants for lunch. For accommodation, you may choose a lodge, or your own private retreat. Perhaps a cosy heritage B&B or a Provencal villa where a warm welcome and a delicious smell of home-cooking is likely to greet you - that's your supper, beautifully prepared from local ingredients, served with one of KI's local wines, of course. Relax, perhaps by a log fire if the evening is cool, or in the balmy evening sunshine, enjoying your first experience of the abundant local wildlife and birdsong."

        "description": "Day 2: Dawn breaks and with it the call of the kookaburra and other intriguing bird calls and you can ready yourself for your first day of touring with your local guide. You will be collected from your accommodation after a hearty breakfast and taken by private 4WD (or small bus if you are in a group tour) on an exploration of the island. Your touring is designed around showcasing the best landscapes, wildlife habitat and encounters across the island with the touring style conservational rather than just commentary. Your day will include a drive down a quiet track through tall Eucalypt trees where your guide will point out koalas snoozing overhead, and Kangaroo Island kangaroos (unique to Kangaroo Island as the name suggests) lazing nonchalantly in the bush – both are a wildlife photographer’s dream. Then it's off to the spectacular Flinders Chase National Park in the west of the island. This 200,000 acre wilderness is home to many of the island's bird and wildlife species, many cultural heritage sites and some of the highest cliffs in Australia. Visit a Long-nosed Fur-seal colony at Admirals Arch - these animals were once decimated by hunting but now numbering up to 50,000 across the island; next a visit to the beautifully preserved lighthouse station with three classic Federation style lightkeepers' homes. Next it is on to the astonishing iconic landmark known as Remarkable Rocks, vast granite boulders covered by the red-orange lichen, which have been formed over 500 million years. A quiet walk around this wilderness area will quickly reveal a number of the national park's 126 species of bird including including some of its 17 endemic subspecies, among them scrubwrens, thornbills and honeyeaters. Your guide will keep a sharp eye out for the elusive Short-beaked Echidna, one of the two monotremes or egg-laying mammals (the other being a Duck-billed Platypus) - both found on KI. Break for lunch and while you pore over your mornings’ photos, your guide will expertly prepare a table dressed with linen and glasses for a gourmet picnic with beer and wine. You will feast magnificently in a private secluded spot on a dramatic cliff top or perhaps under the shade of the eucalypts, usually with some unseen but curious wildlife keeping a close eye. The afternoon will be spent exploring the stunning south coast, and one of the major highlights of any visit to KI - Seal Bay Conservation Park. Here you will have a close encounter with a huge colony of rare Australian Sea-lions, whose foraging reefs are now protected within the Southern Kangaroo Island Marine Park. You could spend hours here, watching them lazing and surfing the waves, youngsters playing, females preening, and huge males fiercely defending their territory - and their ladies! End the day with a visit to Murray Lagoon, a wetland habitat for abundant birdlife most especially during migratory season – expect to see stilts, ducks, grebe and ibis, and overhead look for Black-shouldered Kite and Swamp Harriers before you are dropped back at your accommodation with plenty of time to relax with a glass of local wine before dinner."

        "description": "Day 3: Today, after breakfast, you begin your search for two more incredibly rare species; you will be heading to the north coast of KI and a walk the Lathami National Park, where you are likely to once again see the island’s very own subspecies of Kangaroo (the Sooty Kangaroo); however, your search is really on for the namesake of this small park - the Glossy Black Cockatoo, of which only about 250 remain, and are now only found on KI. Thanks to an ongoing initiative to save this stunning bird from extinction numbers are growing and its future is positive. Other regular encounters in this park are with the Tammar Wallaby which has all but disappeared from the mainland. A quiet walk through the bush will bring you within easy photo-distance of this endearing marsupial, as it peers at your through the sun-dappled leaves. Continue on to Stokes Bay and take a beach walk where careful observers are often rewarded with views of the endangered Hooded Plover which nests annually from October through December on Island beaches. Your morning work done, it’s time for lunch. Your guide will once again surprise you with yet another secret location probably accessed via a mob of Sooty Kangaroos, for yet another gourmet feast al fresco – this time it might be a delicious seafood BBQ featuring local fish King George Whiting, expertly whipped up by your multi-talented guide while you sip on more local beverages all the while being entertained by yarns and fables handed down through generations of islanders. Lunch complete, your guide will take you to explore waterbird habitat around the shoreline of Bay of Shoals and Pelican Lagoon before checking the bird haunts around American River, where the Glossy Black Cockatoos can also occasionally be sighted. You might choose to end your Kangaroo Island experience with a final wine-tasting or perhaps a G&T at a boutique distillery before being transferred back to Kingscote Airport to board your REX aircraft for the short flight back to the mainland. Indulge your senses with additional private day tours If you have time to add on one more day, why not enjoy a wild swim with dolphins; or enjoy Exceptional Kangaroo Island’s private ‘Art of Nature’ tour, an intimate and behind the scenes visit to some of Kangaroo Island’s most accomplished artists who have been inspired by the coastal beauty and wilderness landscapes of the island they call home. Alternatively food and wine lovers can spend a day indulging their passion with a private ‘paddock to plate’ safari to meet the artisanal makers of cheese, olive oil, honey, spices, gin, liqueurs and wine – and much more."

The envied climate makes Brisbane a city of outdoor adventure, activity and relaxation, where days drift by surfing rollers, or relaxing in the shade of swaying palms. While Brisbane may play second fiddle to Sydney and Melbourne at times, it radiates a creative and contemporary energy, offering visitors a refreshing combination of laidback waterfront luxury and urban sophistication. Sandy islands nearby provide scenic diving and oceanside relaxation opportunities, while the city's animal santuaries offer opportunities to meet unbearably cute koalas and kangaroos. Brisbane’s impressive skyline of metallic cylinders rises high above the broad Brisbane River below, which curves lazily through downtown. The rolling waves of the Pacific are close by, but there’s something special about relaxing on soft sand in the very heart of the city, on the beautifully executed South Bank Parklands man-made beach. With golden sand and shallow lagoon waters to cool off in, it’s a dreamy spot to lie back with a book, amid the landscaped gardens. Nestled in a river meander of its own, Brisbane Botanic Park glows with colour, tropical plants and wading ibis birds, and is easily walkable from the Parklands. The South Bank is the cultural hub of city, and houses the celebrated Queensland Gallery of Modern Art - a surreal and vibrant jaunt through contemporary Australian art. The city’s award-winning restaurants also serve up elite food, matched with generous splashes of wine, direct from the nearby Granite Belt’s wine regions."

If fun in the sun isn’t your cup of tea, then the Mooloolaba coastline is certainly worth seeing. Hire a motorboat, or relax on a mini-cruise and enjoy the opportunity of searching, and perhaps swimming, with whales, dolphins and turtles. Seaplanes offer another interesting way of seeing the coast with the more adventurous opting for the “doors off” experience."

        "description": "Fraser Island Frazer Island is a World Heritage site listed for the diversity and beauty it holds. Despite being a sand island, Fraser has over 100 lakes and the landscape changes constantly as dunes are moved across the island by wind. With over 350 bird species recorded, Fraser Island is also part of an ‘Important Bird Area’ and on the ‘Australian National Heritage’ list. The island can be explored by 4WD coach and kayak. In addition to the natural history, there is a rich Butchulla Aboriginal culture here. The island's most spectacular lake, Lake McKenzie is well suited for a cooling swim and at the historic central station in the heart of the island, it is possible to walk along the banks of the Wanggoolba Creek and become immersed in the peacefulness of the rainforest."

        "description": "Shute Harbor (Whitsunday Islands) The 74 Whitsunday Islands are something truly special. Natural artistry at its finest, a sprinkle of powdery white sand, a splash of turquoise seas and a whole heap of glorious sunshine combine to create a revered masterpiece of scattered tropical islands. Shute Harbour is the perfect gateway to this alluring natural wonder, a relaxed town with dashing views of the island-pocked azure seas on its doorstep. Buffered from the bustling beach-front fun of Airlie Beach by the luscious greenery of Conway National Park, Shute Harbour is a quieter spot. It offers glorious, elevated views that will whet your appetite for the immersion in pristine island scenery that lies ahead. Venture off into rainforest-clad hills to find beautiful lookout points like Mount Rooper or head for Lion’s Lookout, so you can absorb panoramic views of droplet-like islands rising from blotched turquoise water, and the spread of yachts cruising out to explore. Shute Harbour is the perfect jumping-off point for your own adventure amongst Australia's biggest and most beautiful island group - the Whitsundays. It’s hard to conjure a better vision of tropical paradise, and these stunning, world-renowned islands are just a stone’s throw away from the natural port at Shute Harbour. Kinetic sandscapes, heart-shaped coral reefs bursting with underwater life, and dazzlingly bright white beaches beckon you into a captivating, romantic and blissful pocket of Australian perfection."

        "description": "Townsville Basking in 320 sunny days a year, Townsville is a welcoming, sun-soaked slice of tropical Australia. Venture to this remote city on the cusp of the tropics, to meet adorable animals, explore gorgeous coastal islands and soak up the reliable sun's bronzing glow. Rise to the rosy rock of Castle Hill - the views down over the sparkling coastal setting, and islands waiting beyond form an amazing welcome. Located on Queensland's north-east coast, the city's bay arcs around Magnetic Island - which lies just a scenic 20-minute ferry ride away. An island sanctuary of beautiful dive sites - set amid vibrant reefs and secluded beach coves - it is one of Townsville's most exquisite natural assets. The island's national park is adorned with wildlife, and you can meet more of Australia's famous residents at the family-owned Billabong Sanctuary - which cares for kangaroos, crocodiles, wallabies and more. Townsville's vast aquarium brings the magic of the region's glittering reefs to land, and the largest reef aquarium in the world ensures that even non-divers can enjoy an authentic insight into the colourful life that blossoms offshore. Visit the beaches of lush tropical islands, or wander Townsville's pretty seaside streets and The Strand's waterfront - lined with charming 19th-century architecture and plenty of inviting cafes and alfresco eateries. Learn more of North Queensland's indigenous Bindal and Wulgurukaba communities, as you witness cultural performances, or peruse Townsville's galleries, which showcase extraordinary indigenous arts. Join the locals, to feel the region's sporting passion, as a wall of noise greets the North Queensland Cowboys rugby league team, as they take to the field here in Townsville."

        "description": "Cairns Warmly welcoming you to the natural wonders of the Great Barrier Reef, Cairns is a treasure trove of rich tropical beauty and incredible sea life. Swathes of rainforest spread out to the north, where you can soar over the canopy in a cable car, before looking down over narrow channels of water plummeting down gorges and crocodile-filled waterways. The diverse lands of the Atherton Tableland lie to the west, but it's the crystal-clear waters - and life-filled reefs - of Cairns' remarkable underwater world that draws universal adulation. Priding itself as the Gateway to the Great Barrier Reef, explore Cairns' constellation of colour, as you dive into the world's largest and most spectacular underwater universe. Cairns is huddled in amongst abundant swathes of rainforests, which give way to glorious crescents of golden beach. Kuranda - with its scenic railway and heritage market stalls - waits to be discovered, cloaked within the depths of the rainforest. Learn of the indigenous people of North Queensland during cultural performances, and hear the throaty reverberations of digeridoos, as you hear eternal stories handed down through time, from generation to generation. Back in Cairns, there's always time for a coffee or a beer, or a feast on fresh oysters with glasses of Cairns' white wines – boldly flavoured with mango and banana notes."

    "generalInfo": "This tailor made trip to Australia beings in Adelaide, South Australia’s coastal capital, known for its delicious food, stunning beaches and close proximity to the country’s most famous wine regions. It is a wonderfully walk-able city with something for everyone, from the beautiful botanic gardens to the bustling central market. You’ll enjoy a cycling tour to the Fleurieu Peninsula to explore the wine regions and of course, sample some of the world-famous produce of the area. The highlight of the tour is cycling from one winery to another by e-bike, minimizing the impact on the environment and maximizing your time within the stunning setting. <br/><br/>After a few days to adjust in Adelaide, you’ll make your way north, into the outback. Your destination is the wonderfully undiscovered Flinders Ranges. During your stay you will be immersed within the vast expanse of the ranges, which boast spectacular scenery and a rich Aboriginal history for you to uncover. There are plenty of walking trails often occupied by the native wildlife, and local guides available to teach you about the culture of the region. <br/><br/>From the Flinders Ranges you will travel overland to Sydney on the Indian Pacific. The train is by far the best way to see inland Australia, with a significantly lower carbon footprint than a domestic flight. You’ll explore Sydney by bike travelling along the harbor, through the parks and past the Sydney Opera House. After your stay in the city, you’ll drive west to the Blue Mountains National Park. You will spend the day immersed in the rainforest with a local guide, listening to stories of the region’s rich history and learning about the flora and fauna that surrounds you. <br/><br/>Continuing on your journey along the coast you’ll reach Byron Bay, a typically Australian, laid-back beach town. Byron offers fantastic beach, stunning walking trails and plenty of marine life. Departing from the beach in a kayak, you’ll have the opportunity to see local dolphins up close in their natural habitat. From Byron, you will make your way to Lamington National Park for a stay in the rainforest. You’ll have the chance to explore the extensive rainforest walks and meet the on-site wildlife. <br/><br/>From the coast, you will then travel to Pumpkin Island, a quiet and undiscovered island in the Great Barrier Reef. Here you will spend your days relaxing on the beach, snorkeling in the reef and swimming with the marine life. It is a perfect opportunity to relax and unwind after a busy trip, in the serenity of the reef. As the trip draws to a close, your final stop is Brisbane, a busy city with plenty to ignite the senses. The best way to explore is by bike, along the dedicated cycle paths with a local guide to show you the hidden secrets of the city. After a final night in Brisbane, you will depart back home with memories to last a lifetime.",

    "generalInfo": "Australia seamlessly blends rugged wilderness, rich diverse and unique wildlife with top notch accommodation, first class cuisine and fine wines better than any other country. The country is vast and offers a comfortable and safe environment in which to take a holiday of any sort and in terms of safaris offers the chance to see some of the world’s strangest wildlife.<br/><br/>The country is the size of a continent but is also very sparsely populated with people, making this a mecca for wildlife watchers. But the size of the country is also a problem for anyone wishing to see it all in one trip; so we have produced this itinerary which visits several areas over 3 states and a rich diversity of habitats. By visiting Tasmania, Queensland and Victoria we hope to showcase a vast array of wildlife and many of the species which make this island continent unique.<br/><br/>Australia has been isolated from the rest of the world for around 60 million years. In this time the organisms have evolved into a unique flora and fauna and a staggeringly large number of endemic species. Perhaps the strangest are the monotremes, the world’s only egg-laying mammals, such as Platypus and Short-beaked Echidna (of which we have very good chances of seeing) as well as iconic pouched mammals (marsupials) including Koalas, various species of Kangaroos and Wombats.<br/><br/>Birds too are well represented, from the giant Southern Cassowaries to tiny Little Penguins and vibrant Rosellas and Cockatoos; reptiles are also supersized here with large crocodiles, monitors and snakes found in many places in Australia. All of these and much much more all make Australia a true wildlife enthusiasts dream, as well as being a country that can be visited time and again without repeating the same locations.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife tour in Australia. Being a country continent the hardest part is picking what to include and what not to include as it is impossible to see all of this vast and wonderful country in one trip. <br/><br/>This tour focuses on the East of the vast country and in particular three states, the island state of Tasmania, the famous state of Victoria and the wild state of Queensland. These states are home to large tracts of forest and scrubland as well as wild and rugged coastline. It is during our exploration of these states where we aim to showcase wildlife as diverse as the unique and weird platypus and echidna to the seemingly out of place little blue penguin and the colourful crimson rosella. Along with these animals we aim to see the endemic Tasmanian devils and a whole host of wallabies, kanagroos, pademelons, wombats and many more.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including breakfasts throughout. We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers and game drives. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Australia. <br/><br/>Your naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. <br/><br/>We also include all vehicle safaris, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the Australian wilderness, night safaris are available in some locations (subject to the local conditions on that day). You will have to speak to your guide on arrival there and book places on these (this is not included). A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>There is no bad time to visit this part of Australia, however the winter months (August - September) can be cold and even snowy in Tasmania. So we recommend visiting during the build up to summer (October or November); where the average temperature of 10-20 degrees C is very pleasant for wildlife and humans alike.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist guides as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it. We do our best to include as many wildlife activities as possible in all of our itineraries.<br/>• Depending on budget and interest we have a range of different accommodation packages to offer, from luxury top end lodges, national park safari lodges and mobile-camps which often offer unbelievable wildlife watching deep inside national parks as well as camping.<br/>• Spend all the daylight hours searching for wildlife and visiting various natural wonders and stunning landscapes.<br/>• We spend a large amount of time after dark looking for wildlife also. Spotlighting for over 1 hour every night.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our Australian wildlife safaris a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Australia so that we can try and find and observe some of the rarer and more elusive species. We have great itineraries and expertise in all the Australian states and can arrange trips to find some of the rarer species such as yellow-footed rock wallabies, black walleroos, greater bilbies, cassowaries among other species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour visit various locations within South East Australia and the states of Tasmania, Victoria and Queensland. We will start in Hobart and finish in Melbourne.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>There is some hiking here, but never too much and nearly all is over flat terrain, which can be hot (even in winter), so some experience in walking in heat is recommended, but there are no particularly strenuous hikes included in this trip.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 15 Years Old<br/><br/>Photo Credits:<br/><br/>Eric Gropp, CC BY 2.0 <br/>knicolson, CC BY 4.0",

        "description": "Hobart / Bruny Island - Arrival & Travelling This morning you will be collected from the airport (an early arrival is needed) and we will head straight away to catch the morning ferry to Bruny Island. The Bruny Island ferry crosses the D’Entrecasteaux Channel. The island is in fact two islands, North and South Bruny, joined by a narrow isthmus known as The Neck. Both have the highest cliffs in the Southern Hemisphere, all 12 endemic birds and the only wild population of white wallabies in the world which you can easily see at close quarters by taking a walk at dusk to Grass Point. There is much to enjoy here including many beautiful walks through pristine forests and along stunning beaches that look south towards Antarctica. Our accommodation whilst on Bruny Island will be Inala, which has a long and proud history in wildlife rehabilitation, caring for injured and abandoned animals. Together with your guide, you will explore the 1,500 acre property which is home to a variety of threatened species and all the Tasmanian endemic birds and many mammals. After dinner your guide will take you to see the Little Penguin and Short-tailed Shearwater rookery to view these birds returning after dusk. Penguins can be viewed all year round, in varying numbers, but Shearwaters are only present between September and April. You will then head off to see some more of Bruny’s nocturnal and abundant wildlife such as Tasmanian Pademelons and Eastern Quolls which are now only found in Tasmania, as well as Bennett’s Wallabies and Brush-tailed Possums. You will return to the cottage after the tour. (dinner is the only meal included today)."

You will cruise alongside some of Australia’s highest sea cliffs, beneath towering crags and drift up close to listen to the awesome ‘Breathing Rock’. Enter deep sea caves, pass through the narrow gap between the coast and ‘The Monument’ and feel the power of nature at the point where the Tasman Sea meets the might of the Southern Ocean. You will join in the search for the abundant coastal wildlife such as seals, dolphins, migrating whales and sea birds. After the cruise returns you will continue your touring on Bruny Island before dinner, after which you will enjoy another evening of nocturnal wildlife spotting. (all meals included today)."

Bonorong is a sanctuary, not a zoo, and it is a wonderful place to see all Tasmania’s endemic and native species in a natural environment. It also has one of the most important Tasmanian devil sanctuaries in the state, along with the endangered Tasmania tree frog breeding programme.

        "description": "Maria Island - Travelling & Wildlife Watching Today we will catch the ferry to Maria Island and meet our local guide to explore the island. Maria Island is a mountainous island National Park, situated 15km off the East Coast of Tasmania. It is in fact two landmasses joined in the middle by a long sandy isthmus, with stunning beaches on either side. The island is 22km long and 12km wide. The beaches are pure white granite sand. Maria Island is also renowned for its unique geology. You will enjoy viewing volcanic mountains, painted sandstone cliffs, towering limestone cliffs, ancient granite cliffs and beautiful white sandy beaches. Maria Island is a Noah’s Ark for endangered wildlife, including Tasmanian devils, and 11 of the 12 endemic birds. It has no resident human population, just two park rangers. During your day on Maria Island you should be able to spot the many resident Wombats, Forester Kangaroos, Bennett’s Wallabies, Tasmanian Pademelons, Possums and other species if you keep a sharp eye out. Tasmanian devil numbers state-wide have declined dramatically due to the Facial Tumour Disease. Maria Island was chosen as a site for captive breeding and 15 Tasmanian Devils were introduced to the Island in 2012 which have now bred successfully. (Maria Island had previously been devil-free). You will all return on the 5 pm ferry which arrives back at Triabunna at 530 pm. You will drive back to your B&B where dinner is again being provided for you. (all meals included today)."

        "description": "Great Western Tiers - Travelling & Wildlife Watching Today we will make the 229km (~3 hour) drive to Forest Walks Lodge in the Great Western Tiers. Along the way we will stop at the historic township of Swansea which is worth a little wander around. Our destination would be the Freycinet Peninsula today (an additional 45 minutes’ drive). The Freycinet Peninsula is regarded as one of the State’s most iconic coastal areas, although these days it is also one of the most intensely visited with little tourism infrastructure to cope with the numbers who flock here. Most people visit the Freycinet Peninsula to bush walk, with a number of options ranging from the several hour trek into Wineglass Bay and around the Hazards to the much easier Sleepy Bay walk, the Cape Tourville Lookout Walk and the Friendly Beaches Walk. Many species of birds live in or stop over at Freycinet and the surrounding area. Birders are often lucky enough to see a white-bellied sea-eagle gliding overhead or large Australasian gannet diving for food in the ocean. In the bushy and forested areas it is often possible to see or hear small nectar-feeding birds such as eastern spinebill and yellow-throated, crescent or New Holland honeyeaters, and the large yellow-tailed black cockatoos, which often feed and fly in raucous groups. After exploring some of Freycinet Peninsula we will continue onward to Jackeys Marsh which is in the Great Western Tiers, and in particular our accommodation at Forest Walks Lodge.

In a wide valley at Eugenana, in the hills in northern Tasmanian near Devonport, the wonderful Tasmanian Arboretum can be found. The lake focuses the landscape and there are a many short and long walks. A popular spot for birding, this provides a habitat for Platypus, which can often be easily spotted by eagle-eyed visitors. When we arrive at our accommodation we will settle in and then in the evening we will have a walk around. Deep in the north west of Tasmania, this is one of the only places you may be lucky enough to see Tasmanian Devils and Quolls in the wild, and you are likely to see platypus in the wild too.

It is only around 45 minutes return with some steep terrain and 697 steps on the Forest Stairs Track. The views are nothing short of breath-taking. There are many other longer walks to enjoy here. Kaydale Gardens, a short drive away, are also worth a visit. The garden imposes itself on the landscape, a stunning garden designed, constructed and maintained by a visionary family. To maximise our chances of seeing wildlife today I recommend spending time on the Fern Walk and the Forest Stairs Walk. (all meals included today)."

        "description": "Cradle Mountain National Park - Wildlife Watching Leave Mountain Valley in the morning and drive to Cradle Mountain (1.5 hours), one of Tasmania’s most iconic landmarks. When entering the park we will head to the accommodation and after checking in we can enjoy one of the many walks around the lodge. Cradle Mountain Wilderness Lodge is nestled in a secluded bush setting in the Cradle Valley on the very edge of the World Heritage listed Cradle Mountain/Lake St Clair National Park. It is on the right hand side as you drive towards the entrance to the National Park, just towards the grid. There is much to see and do to enjoy the majesty of the Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park during your short stay here. Opportunities for bush walks are almost limitless, to suit all ages and abilities. Please take careful note of the weather forecast before setting off on any long walks and ensure you sign in at the walkers’ registration booths as the weather can change very quickly and there is no mobile phone reception. Ensure you are well equipped with suitable clothing and water. New regulations imposed by the Parks & Wildlife Service mean that you can no longer drive your car through the boom gate to the national park during the hours of the shuttle bus operation (8am to 4:30pm). The shuttle buses run a very regular operation and your National Parks Pass gives you free use of the buses. However you are very close to the entrance to the National Park and if you wish you can take your car down the road to Dove Lake after 4:30pm and spot wombats. If we arrive at Cradle Mountain in time, you can enjoy the easy walk around Dove Lake (around 2.5 hours) or to get away from the tourists, opt for the longer and slightly more challenging Crater Lake Walk, which is also the start of the famous Overland Track and begins at Ronny Creek. It is a lovely walk. Weather permitting, you can also continue to Marion’s Lookout for incredible views – the last part does involve a bit of a scramble but it is worth it – or keen walkers can even make it to the summit of Cradle Mountain. We will also visit Ronny Creek to watch wombats shuffling out of the gloaming. This is one of the top (but least known) wombat spotting places in Tassie especially since mange has decimated numbers in Narawntapu, and one of the best kept secrets at Cradle Mountain. Look out for their cube shaped poo. They are completely habituated and a few minutes’ patience will invariably reward you with many sightings. You can often get within touching distance and they will even push past your legs to get to their desired grazing spot. This evening you are booked on the 5:30pm ‘After Dark’ Feeding Tour at Devils@Cradle which is an excellent sanctuary dedicated to Tasmanian devils and their cousin the spotted-tail and eastern quoll although you are likely to see wombats and wallabies too. Quolls are especially elusive even in most sanctuaries, and the here are therefore an easy way to see them in a very natural environment. You will also be given a fascinating insight into both species and the challenges faced by the Tasmanian devil as it fights the devastation of the Facial Tumour Disease which has decimated the species.

    "generalInfo": "The Top End of Australia is home to one of the wettest places on earth as well as some of the driest places in the world. The forests, waterways and desert scrub is home to the largest reptile on the planet, the second largest bird, the largest marsupial as well as the largest monolith in the world. With this abundance of noteworthy natural history the Northern Territory can truly be called a land of extremes. This tour explores the best and wildest parts of this vast region, from Darwin to the myriad of waterways that crisscross Kakadu National Park to the vast deserts of the Red Centre and of course Uluru (Ayres Rock).<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife tour in Australia. Being a country continent the hardest part is picking what to include and what not to include as it is impossible to see all of this vast and wonderful country in one trip. <br/>When driving in the Outback it is easy to think that the desert is devoid of life, but on closer inspection Kangaroos, perenties, snakes and a wide variety of birdlife. This tour explores the centre of Australia and as well as visiting the famous Uluru (Ayres Rock) also goes in search of wildlife in the desert.<br/>But it is not just the desert and scrub lands that are of interest on this trip, we will also be visiting the far north and the wetlands and forests of Kakadu and Litchfield National Parks. This is the realm of the Saltwater crocodile and they live here in huge numbers along side wallabies and a wealth of waterfowl.<br/>There are so many different places to visit in the Northern Territory, this itinerary visits three of the most popular and best for wildlife sightings. Kakadu, Litchfield and Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Parks are all visited here and time spent in each location on safaris.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including breakfasts throughout. We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers and game drives. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Australia. <br/><br/>Your naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. <br/><br/>We also include all vehicle safaris, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the Australian wilderness, night safaris are available in some locations (subject to the local conditions on that day). You will have to speak to your guide on arrival there and book places on these (this is not included). A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>August is the winter in Australia however the Northern Territory never gets truly very cold. With an average temperature of 20-30 degrees C and the lowest annual humidity it is the most pleasant time to visit. It is the dry season so there is often no rain as well. This is when we recommend this tour, however other times of year are also possible.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist guides as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.<br/>• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it. We do our best to include as many wildlife activities as possible in all of our itineraries.<br/>• Depending on budget and interest we have a range of different accommodation packages to offer, from luxury top end lodges, national park safari lodges and mobile-camps which often offer unbelievable wildlife watching deep inside national parks as well as camping.<br/>• Spend all the daylight hours searching for wildlife and visiting various natural wonders and stunning landscapes.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our Australian wildlife safaris a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Australia so that we can try and find and observe some of the rarer and more elusive species. We have great itineraries and expertise in all the Australian states and can arrange trips to find some of the rarer species such as yellow-footed rock wallabies, Tasmanian devils, greater bilbies, cassowaries among other species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour visit various locations within Northern Territory, Australia. We will start and end the trip in the territorial capital of Darwin and then move east to Kakadu and Litchfield, before heading south and into the heart of the outback and to Uluru via Alice Springs.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>There is some hiking here, hiking in the desert, which can be hot (even in winter), so some experience in walking in heat is recommended, but there are no particularly strenuous hikes included in this trip.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 15 Years Old",

The valley retains the landscape values of 19th Century rural Australia. Winding roads are overhung with trees, meandering creeks support native wildlife and there are no power-lines or intensive agriculture to spoil the soft lines of the valley edge. All householders living within the valley use alternative power for their domestic needs. From the southern end of the valley you can access the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area. From Adam's Peak at the top of the track on a clear day you can see far across the Central Plateau Conservation Area. The slopes of the valley are heavily forested while the valley floor has been used sporadically for farming for the last century. The old growth forests of the valley are very diverse because they contain elements of most of Tasmania's forest communities, from dry eucalypts and myrtle dominated rainforest to alpine and sub-alpine species.

Our first stop is at Castle Cove overlooking the Aire river valley. Your guide will introduce you to the strong Aboriginal heritage of the region with many tribes living prosperously around the coastline for thousands of years. In the same area millions of years ago when Australia was part of the great southern land, Gondwana, dinosaurs were roaming the land. A unique find along the coast in 1987 uncovered important clues into the world’s pre-historic past. The 12 Apostles are Icons of Australia’s natural beauty. We arrive as the stacks are lit with the morning sun making them perfect for photos and almost crowd free. This is a bonus for taking a 2 day trip as the stacks are silhouettes in the afternoon and overcrowded. After hearing of the creation of the stacks and holding some of the limestone rock you can explore the boardwalks or brave a helicopter flight along the coastline (own expense). We then visit ‘Loch Ard Gorge’, the site of the most famous 19th century Australian shipwreck. We retell the entire story from the calm voyage, the tragic wreck, the courageous survivors and their ultimate fate. While hearing the tale you will be able to see and hold some original artefacts, photos and documents from the ‘Loch Ard’ contained in our treasure chests. Port Campbell is our lunch stop for today. The small fishing village of just 350 is set in a beautiful natural port and has some wonderful cafes and restaurants for food and views. After lunch we travel to a lesser known but highly impressive area of the Great Ocean Road west of Port Campbell. This section takes in London Bridge, Bay of Islands, Bay of Martyrs, and Boat Bay before our journey turns inland and travels through open farmland towards Melbourne arriving there around 6pm."

The creation of these ranges dates back around 420 million years ago and has at one stage had the Southern Ocean lapping up against it. These sandstone mountain ranges are sedimentary deposits that have since faulted and lifted. This upheaval now allows us to discover an incredibly rare and stunning landscape. An hour into our journey we arrive in Halls Gap in the heart of the Grampians NP. This township’s Parks Victoria information centre and ‘Brambuk’ Aboriginal cultural centre help us learn about the region, including a couple of short videos in the dreaming theatre that reveals both the the natural history and the Aboriginal creation story. Our day includes a few short walks at Baroka Lookout, Reid’s Lookout and McKenzie Falls as well as the rock art site ‘Bunjil’s Shelter’. Our journey back to Melbourne takes us by the gold mining township of Ballarat, once one of the richest towns in the world and the reason for Melbourne’s early prosperity.

At 40 degrees South, it lies just an hour or so from Melbourne and Sydney, yet in the relatively short time it takes to get there, you might as well have landed in another world.  <br/><br/>Excitement builds as your plane begins its descent over seemingly endless mountain ranges, stretching as far as the eye can see, all deeply forested and carved up by wild rivers and deep, dark lakes and pockets of rich pastures.  As your plane banks you will see that the island is fringed by startling white sand beaches lapped by brilliant turquoise seas.   <br/><br/>Any sign of civilisation is all but invisible until you land at Hobart Airport. <br/><br/>Even then, you will be immediately struck by island's calm, tranquil lifestyle. Locals consider themselves first and foremost to be Tasmanian, and only then Australian.  They are justly proud of their peaceful existence, as they also are of their rich convict heritage.<br/><br/>What awaits you now is a melting pot of history and culture, an abundance of wildlife that might have hopped or waddled straight from the pages of a fairy tale, and day after day of adventure. <br/><br/>This Land, among the most diverse and fertile in the world, provides a mouth-watering array of produce, wines and whiskies, all of which is clearly evident within minutes of landing.  <br/><br/>Tasmania has everything you could possibly ask for in a dream holiday, all wrapped up in an island the size of Sri Lanka. <br/><br/>This is quite possibly the land that time forgot.  And yet ....<br/><br/>Within this land where Nature is King, you will also find one of the most vibrant, cosmopolitan small cities on the planet.  The harbour city of Hobart, despite its serene location on the River Derwent with Mount Wellington as its backdrop, is a buzzing hotchpotch of history, art, culture, food, wine and people. <br/><br/>On this magical Tasmanian odyssey you will begin your self-drive holiday from Hobart on a day to suit you, and explore for as little or as long as you wish.  <br/><br/>While most visitors are keen to see the classic icons of Tasmania - Wineglass Bay and Cradle Mountain - the real joy of this holiday lies in our local knowledge and ability to take you away from the tourists, to new horizons, down untrodden paths and the road less travelled to hidden gems that not even the best travelled Aussies can tell you about. <br/><br/>Each journey we create is designed to showcase the best of Tassie. ‘Meet the locals’ in charming B&amp;Bs. Dine on delicious home cooking.  Hide away in wilderness cottages. Relax in restored homesteads from a bygone era.  <br/><br/>The style and pace of our holidays are tailored to suit any age and ability, from the young and active to the mature and mellow, even those with limited mobility. We promise you the experience of a lifetime. <br/><br/>We have been making dreams come true in Tassie for over 20 years. Put your dreams in the hands of Tasmanian travel experts.

Breathe deeply, for you are now on the spot which consistently records the cleanest air in the inhabited world! Stanley, a perfect little gem of a town, sits peacefully at the base of a dramatic ‘Nut’ of volcanic rock at the end of a peninsula in the Bass Strait, bursting with history of early settlers and the contentment of generations of families for whom this remote corner of the world has been home. Nowhere is the warmth and friendliness of islanders, the power of nature, and the cheeky curiosity of the wildlife more evident. Tasmanian Pademelons vie for your attention, wallabies hop down the street at dusk, and comical Little Penguins brazenly strut their stuff right in front of your eyes in all their wild glory as they return from a day’s fishing in the mighty ocean."

You will continue your odyssey into yet another world as you venture into ancient devil country. Stay on a private Land for Wildlife retreat in a beautiful lost valley where endangered Tasmanian devils and quolls, found nowhere but on this extraordinary island, roam freely, almost undisturbed by man. During your stay in a simple but spacious log cabin you will take a guided walk at dusk to spot the elusive Duck-billed Platypus before settling down in front of your log fire with a delicious home-cooked dinner, and prepare for Tasmania’s largest carnivorous marsupial to arrive on your porch – the rare and beleaguered Tasmanian devil, more often than not joined by its equally elusive cousin, the Quoll."

Visit beautiful private gardens, run by a dedicated family of ladies whose green fingered prowess has attracted film crews from all over the country to this most unlikely of locations."

Although just an hour from Launceston and Devonport, you are unlikely to see another soul during your stay here."

Your guide will introduce you to the strong Aboriginal heritage of the region with many tribes living prosperously around the coastline for thousands of years. In the same area millions of years ago when Australia was part of the great southern land, Gondwana, dinosaurs were roaming the land.

        "description": "Our guests on this micro group tour of just 8 people are collected from their Melbourne hotels and introduced to the wonderful journey ahead. We travel through the vast volcanic plains on route to Geelong where you have time to stroll along the beautifully transformed waterfront. We start our journey along the Great Ocean Road at Torquay, stopping at various places along the coast including Bells Beach and our scenic morning tea location. A visit to a brilliant new chocolate factory is a great place to grab a coffee or engage your inner chocoholic. Our focus then turns to Australian native wildlife as we observe Eastern Grey Kangaroos in the wild. This is one of many opportunities to see and hear about our unique and unusual animals in their native habitat. Our journey then begins travelling the very scenic, cliff-hugging section of the Great Ocean Road. While winding our way along we stop to view sites such as the ‘Memorial Arch’ and tell you of the intriguing story of this incredible road. Lorne is the largest of the seaside resorts, with its abundance of cafes and restaurants it is a perfect place for a lunch break. You may even find time to have a swim or do some shopping. After lunch we cruise along the spectacular road, stopping at many scenic spots including Kennett River where we can see koalas and many colourful native birds in the wild. Travelling through Apollo Bay we take time to explore the harbour, beach and township. We then check into your private, self-contained accommodation at Chris’s Restaurant and Villas. This is an amazing location to unwind an enjoy some time looking out to sea. We have dinner tonight at the award-winning restaurant with breathtaking views of the ocean and enjoy a modern Greek Australian menu that utilises great local produce."

        "description": "Our second day starts with great coffee, tea and vast breakfast menu make this a perfect way to start another full day. Our journey then ventures into the Great Otway National Park where we take you on a guided walk through a cool temperate rainforest gully to see the world’s tallest flowering plants and prehistoric trees. Our first stop on the shipwreck coast is at Castle Cove overlooking the Aire river valley. Your guide will introduce you to the strong Aboriginal heritage of the region and the important fossil discoveries of dinosaurs dating back to the cretaceous period. The 12 Apostles are Icons of Australia’s natural beauty. We arrive as the stacks are lit with the morning sun making them perfect for photos and crowd free. This is a bonus for taking a 2-day trip as the stacks are silhouettes in the afternoon and overcrowded. After hearing of the creation of the stacks and holding some of the limestone rock you can explore the boardwalks or brave a helicopter flight along the coastline (own expense). We then visit ‘Loch Ard Gorge’, the site of the most famous 19th century Australian shipwreck. We retell the entire story from the calm voyage, the tragic wreck, the courageous survivors and their fate. While hearing the tale you will be able to see and hold some original artifacts, photos and documents from the ‘Loch Ard’ contained in our treasure chests. Port Campbell is our lunch stop for today. The small fishing village of just 350 is set in a beautiful natural port and has some wonderful cafes and restaurants for food and views. After lunch we travel to a lesser known but highly impressive area of the Coastline west of Port Campbell. This section includes the limestone formations of London Bridge, Bay of Islands, Bay of Martyrs and Boat Bay and is seen only be a small percentage of the people travelling the Great Ocean Road. Our journey then continues through to Warrnambool and Port Fairy with a visit to Tower Hill Game Reserve for the chance to see Koalas, Kangaroos and Emus living wild within this extinct volcanic crater. We then leave the coast and drive north to your accommodation in Dunkeld at the southern end of the Grampians National Park. The Royal Mail hotel is a renowned hotel for both its setting, looking out at the mountains, but also its culinary excellence, having been awarded many mighty accolades over the times. Your experience here includes the five-course degustation menu in ‘Wickens’. This dining experience is something that has people from all over Australia travelling for."

        "description": "Our third day starts at the Southern end of Gariwerd, the Aboriginal name for the Grampians. After enjoying breakfast at the hotel we start an incredibly scenic drive North between the Serra and Mt William Ranges towards Hall’s Gap while the sun is streaming in from the east lighting up the rocky cliff faces of the ranges. The creation of these ranges dates back around 420 million years ago and has at one stage had the Southern Ocean lapping up against it. These sandstone mountain ranges are sedimentary deposits that have since faulted and lifted. This upheaval now allows us to discover an incredibly rare and stunning landscape. An hour into our journey we arrive in Halls Gap in the heart of the Grampians NP. This township’s Parks Victoria information centre and ‘Brambuk’ Aboriginal cultural centre help us learn about the region, including a couple of short videos in the dreaming theatre that reveals both the the natural history and the Aboriginal creation story. Our day includes a few short walks at Baroka Lookout, Reid’s Lookout and McKenzie Falls as well as the rock art site ‘Bunjil’s Shelter’. Our journey back to Melbourne takes us by the gold mining township of Ballarat, once one of the richest towns in the world and the reason for Melbourne’s early prosperity. The end of our 3-day tour concludes back in Melbourne around 6pm."

Our journey starts with us travelling through the Otway ranges and onto the ‘Shipwreck Coast’. Our first stop is at Castle Cove overlooking the Aire river valley. Your guide will introduce you to the strong Aboriginal heritage of the region with many tribes living prosperously around the coastline for thousands of years. In the same area millions of years ago when Australia was part of the great southern land, Gondwana, dinosaurs were roaming the land.

    "generalInfo": "Mix scuba diving and snorkelling with rainforests and rivers as you head to Queensland on a tailor made two week tour that's all about experiencing an array of animal encounters alongside Australia's iconic and lesser-known marine and landscapes.<br/><br/>This is your chance to search the Great Barrier Reef for turtles, sharks and a plethora of marine life, prior to exploring Daintree rainforest and the highland forests of Atherton Tablelands on the trail of crocodiles, cassowaries and tree kangaroos.  <br/><br/>In order to develop our unrivalled range of combined wildlife watching holidays, our guides have spent years searching for Australia's best wildlife watching locations and seldom visited areas. This dedication has led us to create this wonderful tour that starts and ends in the city of Cairns. In between you'll be taken to the pristine rainforests of the north and the wonderful highlands of the Tablelands as well as experiencing some of the best marine wildlife from Hervey Bay to the Great Barrier Reef. <br/><br/>Anyone interested in the marine world will no doubt know that there are very few better destinations than the Great Barrier Reef. But we will also explore some of the best kept wildlife secrets in Australia by travelling inland in search of Lumholtz tree kangaroos, musky rat-kangaroos, southern cassowaries and platypus. There are few other places in the world that boast the range of marine life of Queensland and when you couple that with such a biodiverse range of habitats this holiday is a wildlife watcher's dream. All of our tours are guided by our own professional local guide so you can be sure you're in the best hands possible for the best sightings. <br/><br/>We also have a great network of local guides in Australia who have developed a great range of wildlife watching locations where the rarest species are commonly seen. We will spend as much time after dark in certain locations as you wish and with the help of a high powered spotlight we will search for nocturnal species. One of the reasons why our wildlife watching holidays are unique is that our background (as a company) is from a scientific and zoological standpoint. We have a great network of colleagues and contacts all over the world who are the people on the front line searching for the best new locations for wildlife watching. <br/><br/>Where possible we use brilliant guides who will escort you on all your excursions and will act as your driver throughout, and also very knowledgeable local guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Queensland. <br/><br/>We have included wildlife watching in the wonderful Atherton Tablelands where some of the rarest marsupials in the world can be found including the Lumholtz tree kangaroo and several possum species. We also include all vehicle safaris, guided walks, spotlighting drives, scuba diving &amp; snorkelling in the Great Barrier Reef, whale watching excursions, river cruises, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We also look to hire scientists and researchers where possible to help find some of the rarer and more elusive species. <br/><br/>We include more time in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator. Only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the Australian bush or trip out to sea in Hervey Bay or the Great Barrier Reef. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour.<br/><br/>Best time to watch wildlife in Queensland:<br/><br/>For this tour we have decided that the Southern Hemisphere Autumn and Winter is a good time of year to visit Queensland. The waters of the Great Barrier Reef are warm all year around and during May they are around 25-27C. Through June – August the temperatures drop slightly to a pleasant 22-24C and during all of this period the visibility is good. Also during June to August there are minke whales on the outer reefs and humpback whales migrating through. The terrestrial wildlife is also easier to see during this time of year as it is also the low rainfall season. <br/><br/>Recommended fitness levels:<br/><br/>There are a few physical activities on this tour. Firstly, the ability to swim and snorkel is essential (if you can scuba dive, dive trips can be arranged – certified dive log book and certificate required), and the ability to swim in open water for over 1 hour is also needed. There is also lots of walking involved and the temperature and humidity in Queensland can be hot and humid, even during the winter, so we require people to be used to walking in the heat.<br/><br/>Minimum age: 18 years",

        "description": "Hervey Bay ¬– Travelling & Whale Watching – After breakfast we will once again have a long journey along the coast south. This journey will take you into the heart of the sugar cane region of Queensland. Huge amounts of this crop are grown around here and as a result of the tasty plant the insect and bird life is prolific. We should see many species of flycatcher and raptors in the skies all around us like, black kites, black-shouldered kites, wedge-tailed eagles, nankeen kestrels and many other falcons on the drive to Hervey Bay. Once again we will stop along the way regularly to break the long drive up. Once we arrive at Hervey Bay you will check in and prepare for some whale watching tomorrow. Hervey Bay is a beautiful enclosed bay on the north-west side of Fraser Island, this small protected bay makes an ideal stopping point for the migrating humpback whales as they travel up and down the Australian east coast and it is the humpback whales that we will target during this whale watching trip. We will have around 8 hours on the water and with any luck get extremely close to the whales. The water is so clear and pure here that the visibility is exceptional and you can see all the behaviours of the whales underwater. Even though the boat cannot approach the whales as we have to abide by international law the whales are so curious and used to boats that they come right up to us often come within touching distance. It is hard to tell who is watching who as they seem really interested in what is going on on-board the boat. They also like a play and regularly treat us to spectacular displays of acrobatics as they breach through the placid waters. We will eat some lunch on board and on return have the rest of the day to yourself with our evening meal at the accommodation or a nearby restaurant. (Breakfast, Lunch & Dinner included)."

Fraser Island is otherwise known as Great Sandy National Park and is dominated by long beaches, pristine forests and brilliant lakes. Once on the island we will drive to our accommodation and check in. After checking in and having some lunch we will begin to explore the island. On one of the days here we will visit Indian Head to try and see tiger sharks in the shallows, their dark bodies forming sinister shapes in the surf. The rest of our time here will be spent visiting some of the beautiful freshwater lakes here. Fraser Island is second only to Tasmania by having a high concentration of freshwater lakes in Australia we will also visit some of them including Lake McKenzie, Lake Wabby and Basin Lake. Wildlife which is commonly seen during our visit to Fraser Island are the resident dingos, which are very common and not in the least bit shy, but it is important to remember that they are wild and not pets. There are not many other mammal species here but we maybe lucky to see swamp wallabies and short-beaked echidnas, however it is reptiles that really dominate the fauna here with endemic skinks and turtles like Fraser Island short-necked turtle regularly seen along with carpet pythons, lace goannas and eastern water dragons. There are also 6 species of marine turtle recorded from the waters around the island. We usually see ospreys dive bombing for fish around the island as well as well other raptors that soar the skies around the island. Of course visiting the pristine lakes here would not be complete without taking a dip in the water and so there will be plenty of time to snorkel with the turtles of Lake Wabby and just relax in the azure waters of Lake MacKenzie.

There is some good bird watching in the parks of the city as well as looking for koalas, swamp, red-necked and whiptail wallabies around the parks. But a real treat is the evening exodus of flying foxes from their roosts to their feeding trees once a night. With black, grey-headed and little-red flying foxes all flying around the sky is pretty spectacular during the evenings. Then on day 15 you will be taken down to the harbour for our final trip out on a boat in Queensland. We are once again on the look out for cetaceans and Moreton Bay has its fair share of whales and dolphins. We will be catching up with the humpback whales again and usually get brilliant views of the whales as they approach the boat to have a nosy at us. Our lunch will be served on board and as we sit down to eat we will be surrounded by the whales hopefully with some young whales as well. We also have a good chance of seeing common bottle-nose dolphins as they race along bow-riding with the boat. Then in the afternoon and evening you will have the rest of the evening free for souvenir shopping and catching up with everything we have seen in our two weeks exploring Australias reefs and rainforests.

Set out on foot to explore some of the 140 kilometres (87 miles) of walking tracks, admire the native bushland, marvel at the impressive rock formations, explore underground caves and more. Before heading into Katoomba you might want to stop and take the easy 1.8-kilometre (1.1-mile) Princes Rock Walk to a lookout over Wentworth Falls, Kings Tableland and Mount Solitary. Then continue to Katoomba, a town in the Blue Mountains known for its gorgeous Art Deco architecture and offbeat shopping. It sits on the edge of a cliff, offering breathtaking views of the craggy Three Sisters rock formation. Drive (or walk) from Katoomba town centre to the Echo Point lookout to see the Three Sisters and beyond. The views of World Heritage-listed rainforest and dramatic escarpments stretch over the horizon. (Insider tip: come back after dark to see the Three Sisters floodlit until 11 pm.) Spend the afternoon exploring the area at your leisure. For dinner with a view, head to Jamison Views Restaurant in Katoomba, if you're after a casual atmosphere (and amazing cocktails) check out \"Polar Bear Of Leura\". Overnight: Blue Mountains"

Hit the road north towards the aptly named Sunshine Coast. You might want to poke around Noosa, a chic resort town flanked by subtropical rainforests and brilliant blue waters. Depending on how you go timewise, enjoy a meal by the beach at Bistro C or check out Betty's Burgers for a more casual atmosphere. From Noosa, it's about a two-hour drive to Hervey Bay. Take a trip out to Fraser Island for a full day of adventure and exploring all of the iconic K'Gari (Fraser Island) sights, you’ll meet like-minded travellers, visit the top natural attractions and cool off in watering holes. All from the air-conditioned comfort of custom-designed, four-wheel-drive coaches. Swim in the crystal-clear waters of Lake McKenzie, wander through ancient subtropical rainforests, marvel at the rustic ruins of the Maheno Shipwreck, and cruise along the 75-Mile Beach highway, as you explore the world’s largest sand island. Join an expert guide as they navigate the sand tracks and share the history of this World Heritage-listed paradise with you. Discover the pristine native environment, and catch a glimpse of the unique wildlife and protected species that inhabit the island. From here leave the Fraser Coast behind and get ready for a day on the road, heading North. There are a few stops of interest on the way to stretch your legs. Depending on your timing, you might want to go the direct way via the highway and stop only at Childers, Gin Gin or Miriam Vale for a coffee. If you leave early and make a whole day out of it, you can take a detour via Bundaberg, Australia’s favourite rum-producing town. You can take a tour around the Bundaberg Rum Distillery or simply buy a nice local souvenir to enjoy later. After heading north of Bundaberg, drive east to Seventeen Seventy, a small coastal town near Agnes Waters. It’s the most northern surf beach along Australia’s coast, people call it one of Australia’s best-kept secrets. Further north you will arrive in Rockhampton (‘Rocky’ to its mates), where the hats, boots and utes are big, and the bulls are even bigger. With over 2.5 million cattle within a 250km radius, this riverside city, founded in 1858 on land owned by the Darumbal people, calls itself Australia’s Beef Capital with some justification. For dinner head to the mighty Fitzroy River where premium dining can be found along the heritage-listed streets, with some of the best steak houses, restaurants, pubs and cocktail bars found anywhere in regional Queensland. Hit the road and make your way towards Airlie Beach. You will spend most of today driving, so we recommend downloading a great playlist and/or podcasts to entertain you during today's road trip. Stop for ice cream and a coffee at Flaggy Rock, then head further north until you reach Mackay. Have a look around the laid-back town and check out Cape Hillsborough National Park, where wild wallabies and kangaroos are at home. You might be lucky and spot them during the day. In the afternoon, you will arrive at Airlie Beach, a relaxed resort town on Queensland's Whitsunday Coast. It's a gateway to the Whitsunday Islands and the Great Barrier Reef. For dinner, head to the Airlie Beach Hotel or Fish D’vine and relax in the tropical atmosphere. Driving duration: 6 hours (without stops) Driving distance: 525km / 320miles Queensland is Australia's second-largest state, distances are far which means today's drive will take up most of your day. But fear not, there are a few nice stops along the way if you want to take your time. Leave Airlie Beach in the morning and head north, after an hours drive you will get to Bowen. Home to the Big Mango as well as secret beaches like Horseshoe Bay. Then continue along the coast to reach Townsville, another of Queensland's eye-catching coastal cities. The town has both a fascinating military history and significant Aboriginal heritage. For an early lunch visit The Beet Bar which offers healthy eats and lots of treats. Pass through Ingham, often referred to as \"Little Italy\" which isn't surprising given more than half of Ingham's population being of Italian descent. Just a short drive southwest of Ingham provides an opportunity to discover the awe-inspiring Wallaman Falls, Australia's highest permanent single drop waterfall. Continue your drive and stop in Cardwell to see the famous Cardwell Spa Pools, a natural swimming hole located just out of the main town area that blew up in 2016 when the location was revealed on Instagram. Since then it has become a must-do on the east coast of Australia. In the afternoon you will reach Mission Beach, a quiet stretch of the Tropical North Queensland coast which is also the closest point to the Great Barrier Reef on the mainland. Enjoy the absence of traffic lights, chain stores, and crowds. For dinner check out the delights of BUKO restaurant at Castaways. Driving duration: 6 hours (without stops) Driving distance: 525km / 320miles On your final day head to Cairns to return the camper and overnight stay."

When you're ready, drive via Atherton to Mareeba, going through the crafty towns of Tolga and Kairi. Mareeba is the centre of the Australian Coffee industry – visit Australia’s oldest coffee plantation at Skybury, and enjoy a cup of their trademark coffee while taking in the unforgettable view from their café – Skybury Farmgate. From Mareeba continue to Mossman Gorge which is rich in Indigenous culture and breathtaking beauty. The journey continues along vast sugar cane fields before turning right at the Daintree Gateway towards the Daintree Rainforest. Take the cable ferry (payable locally) across the Daintree River and enter the world’s oldest living rainforest. Stop at the Walu Wugirriga Lookout (Alexandra Range Lookout), pausing to admire sweeping views of the mouth of the Daintree River and islands beyond as the Aboriginal name of this place, ‘look about’, suggests. Wind your way through the ancient surroundings of the Daintree Rainforest, refresh in a crystal-clear swimming hole or recharge with a stroll along a beautiful rainforest boardwalk. The Great Barrier Reef Drive culminates at Cape Tribulation, as you take a short boardwalk from the carpark through the rainforest and emerge onto the beach. Here you have arrived at your final destination, standing between the dual World Heritage areas of the Great Barrier Reef and the Daintree Rainforest. Then retreat to your accommodation and fall asleep to the sounds of the rainforest. Driving duration: 3.5 hours (without stops) Driving distance: 200km / 130miles Overnight: Daintree Rainforest"

Explore the rainforest at your leisure: Trek through the jungle and discover plants and animals found nowhere else on the planet. Start your Daintree experience at the Daintree Discovery Centre. Here you can learn all about the origins of the ancient rainforest before heading out onto the series of aerial walkways and viewing platforms connected to the centre. This allows you to easily explore all levels of the rainforest up close, from the forest floor to the uppermost reaches of the canopy. Then head to the village of Cape Tribulation, the meeting place of two World Heritage sites (the Daintree Rainforest and the Great Barrier Reef), and explore gorgeous scenery, beautiful beaches and rainforest walks. If you're lucky you might spot an endangered cassowary during your visit. These elusive flightless birds can stand up to two metres (6.5 feet) tall and are arguably Australia's most spectacular feathered species."

This tour explores both the island of Tasmania and the mainland coast of Victoria as we go in search of wildlife from Tasmanian devils and humpback whales to platypuses and gang-gang cockatoos. <br/>This tour is a wildlife adventure to some of Australia's most beautiful habitats and with so many iconic and bizarre creatures this trip is sure to be enjoyed.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife tour in Australia. Being a country continent the hardest part is picking what to include and what not to include as it is impossible to see all of this vast and wonderful country in one trip. <br/>This tour focuses on the South-East part of the vast country and in particular two states, the island state of Tasmania and the famous state of Victoria. These states are home to large tracts of forest and scrubland as well as wild and rugged coastline. It is during our exploration of these states where we aim to showcase wildlife as diverse as the unique and weird platypus and echidna to the seemingly out of place little blue penguin and the colourful crimson rosella. Along with these animals we aim to see the endemic Tasmanian devils and a whole host of wallabies, kanagroos, pademelons, wombats and many more.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including breakfasts throughout. We have our own private air conditioned 4x4 vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers and game drives. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional zoologist (when available - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us) who will escort you on all your excursions and we also have very knowledgeable English speaking local naturalist guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Australia. <br/><br/>Your naturalist escort is an expert in wildlife biology and behaviour and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge where we are going to visit. Where needed we further employ local guides at specific locations where their intimate knowledge of individual reserves and parks is invaluable in finding our targeted species. <br/><br/>We also include all vehicle safaris, guided walks, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the Australian wilderness, night safaris are available in some locations (subject to the local conditions on that day). You will have to speak to your guide on arrival there and book places on these (this is not included). A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour (subject to availability of a zoologist guide - zoologists are not always available, if you wish to have a zoologist escort your trip, please inquire with us).<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>There is no bad time to visit this part of Australia, however the winter months (August - September) can be cold and even snowy in Tasmania. So we recommend visiting during the build up to summer (November); where the average temperature of 10-20 degrees C is very pleasant for wildlife and humans alike.<br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>• All of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by an experienced naturalist guides as well as local drivers and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife you’re watching.<br/>•\tOur zoologist (where available - if you wish to have a zoologist please contact us and we can check availability - not all tours include a zoologist) that escorts tours (where available) has a great wealth of knowledge.• We can also offer further wildlife watching activities if they present themselves whilst on the trip. For example our local guides keep their ears to the ground and have many contacts and if and when a new location of animal is known and reliably seen we can head there to experience it. We do our best to include as many wildlife activities as possible in all of our itineraries.<br/>• Depending on budget and interest we have a range of different accommodation packages to offer, from luxury top end lodges, national park safari lodges and mobile-camps which often offer unbelievable wildlife watching deep inside national parks as well as camping.<br/>• Spend all the daylight hours searching for wildlife and visiting various natural wonders and stunning landscapes.<br/>• We spend a large amount of time after dark looking for wildlife also. Spotlighting for over 1 hour every night.<br/>• All the above reasons give this, our Australian wildlife safaris a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Australia so that we can try and find and observe some of the rarer and more elusive species. We have great itineraries and expertise in all the Australian states and can arrange trips to find some of the rarer species such as yellow-footed rock wallabies, black walleroos, greater bilbies, cassowaries among other species. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>• Unlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour visit various locations within South East Australia and the states of Tasmania and Victoria. We will start and end the trip in Victoria's state capital, Melbourne and then move south and over the Tasman Straits to Tasmania.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>There is some hiking here, hiking in the desert, which can be hot (even in winter), so some experience in walking in heat is recommended, but there are no particularly strenuous hikes included in this trip.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 15 Years Old",

A marine reserve and part of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area, we spend two whole days (weather permitting) enjoying this rare opportunity to hike, kayak and take in this pristine natural environment. We explore by Xplorer tender vessels and learn about intrepid European explorers and Indigenous Australians, who once walked this land and keep a lookout for the rare and endangered Orange Bellied Parrot amongst other wildlife. *Access to Port Davey and Bathurst Harbour is subject to annual permits being granted by Tasmania Parks and Wildlife."

    "generalInfo": "This Tasmania fishing holiday takes you to the island that was the birthplace of trout fishing in the Southern Hemisphere.  One hundred and fifty years ago brown trout ova were packed in moss and ice and transported successfully, on the third attempt, from the UK to Hobart, from where they were taken by horseback all over Tasmania, Australia, onwards to New Zealand and further field. In the year that celebrates this remarkable anniversary, one of the Tasmania's most breath-taking World Heritage wilderness lodges is also due to open, Pumphouse Point, located 250 metres from the shore of  Lake St Clair, Australia's deepest lake, and one of the finest fly fishing spots in the world. Tasmania is known as The Land of 3000 Lakes with the deepest in Australia, packed full of wild trout, and as many crystal clear rivers and streams providing extraordinary fly fishing and lure fishing for anyone of all ages. <br/><br/>Nowhere else in the world offers such a huge range of diversity of fishing from remote wilderness camps on the edge of the World Heritage Wilderness, to convict built estates in heritage village that happens to have one of the world's best trout fishing rivers running through it to sustainable fishing eco lodges such as Currawong Lakes in the north east wilderness.  While you are unlikely to see another human other than your guide for many of the days you are in Tasmania, you are never alone.  Wedge-tailed eagles soar overhead, platypus duck and dive in the waters around you, and wombats, wallabies and Tasmanian devils rustle in the bush nearby, or stand on the shore watching you in nonchalant bemusement. Among the top fly fishing guides in Australia including the current Commonwealth Champion, Tasmania also has Australia's only professional fisherwoman, who takes pride in encouraging ladies and children to try their hands at fly fishing making it a holiday for couples and families too. <br/><br/>Whether you want to take one day out of you holiday to try your hand at fishing or two full weeks casting your fly in the very best of Tasmania's lakes and rivers from the north east to the Central Highlands you can be sure of stunning landscapes, weird and wonderful wildlife, superb food and drink and a comfortable bed on which to lay your head under a star filled inky black sky.  Tasmania's trout fishing season runs from September to March.",

When the land bridge flooded that separated Tasmania from the mainland, it became a life raft for species that would be wiped out by the arrival of the early settlers on mainland Australia. <br/><br/>Prolific, unafraid, at once beautiful, comical, weird and wonderful, Tasmania's wildlife will leave you captivated.  With careful planning and local inside knowledge, the species of marsupial and monotreme that you can see in the wild include Tasmanian devils, Quolls, Wombats, Possums, Kangaroos, Wallabies, Pademelons, Bettongs, Poteroos, the Duck-billed Platypus and Echidna.  Even the more common Australian species are highly unusual in their own way - such as the wild White Wallabies found only on Bruny Island. Even for non-birders, birds hold an irresistible appeal - such as the Cape Barren Goose, the Orange-bellied Parrot - the rarest bird in the world that breeds only in Tasmania, and the Native Hen.<br/><br/>This Tasmanian Wildlife Tour will take you to far flung corners of this extraordinarily diverse island, a landmass the size of Ireland, Switzerland or Sri Lanka. You will stay at little known properties on land that has been protected by its owners, guardians of nature and accidental eco-warriors, for decades.  The accommodation may be rustic and simple in the more remote places but no less charming, and its true beauty is that the wildlife is free to roam and live without fear, meaning you are the privileged visitor who shares its habitat and learns from those who have spent much of their lives striving to protect it. <br/><br/>You will, with luck, witness the remarkable experience of Tasmanian devils, the largest remaining carnivorous marsupial with a jaw strength second to none, feeding in the wild. You will watch the world's plumpest Platypus swimming gracefully in rivers and lakes. You will quite possibly walk through a mob of Forester Kangaroos and wild white Wallabies and count dozens of Wombats grazing yards away from you without a care in the world.  You will watch Little Penguins coming back from a day's fishing in the Bass Strait to their burrows and watch White-bellied Sea Eagles swoop to take fish thrown from your boat. You will take to the seas along the highest cliffs in the Southern Hemisphere to gasp in wonder at Albatross, Sea Eagles, pods of Dolphin and, in certain months, Southern Right, Humpback and Killer Whales on their migration north.  You may not see a Tasmanian Tiger but you will certainly believe it exists. <br/><br/>While the tour is largely based on a self-drive, those who wish to leave their keys behind for a couple of days and put themselves in the hands of experts will benefit from superb private guiding by one of Australia's top bush trackers, and one of the country's most highly respected conservationists and birding experts.  Those who love walking can spend four days glamping on Tasmania's very own Noah's Ark, an island off an island, where, like much of Tasmania, wildlife has been left to roam and breed freely and uninterrupted by man.",

    "generalInfo": "Join an expert local guide in Western Australia and explore both the land and sea here in search of Tiger Sharks, Whale Sharks, Greater Bilbies, Numbats as well as experiencing the wonderful deserts, forests and coral reefs along the Western Coast.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/><br/>We are specialists in tailoring wildlife watching all over the world and we have a great range of wildlife tours in Australia which combine various different wildlife events and in this case along the glorious coast of Western Australia. In order to develop our unrivalled range of combined wildlife watching holidays, our guides and colleagues around the world have spent years searching out the world’s best wildlife watching locations as well as visiting some seldom visited areas. This dedication has led us to create this wonderful tour that starts in the capital of Western Australia and the fantastic city of Perth, before heading the short distance across the sea to Rottnest Island and then back on the mainland down south to the unique forests of Dryandra before travelling back north and all the way to Exmouth, via Jurien Bay, Nambung &amp; Kalbarri National Parks and the oceanic hotspots of Shark Bay and Ningaloo Reef (before flying back to Perth). <br/><br/>This tour stops off at some of the best wildlife watching locations along this wonderful coastline. Anyone interested in the marine world will no doubt know that there are very few better destinations that Western Australia. But we will also explore some of the best kept wildlife secrets in Australia by travelling inland in search of some wonderfully named animals such as numbats, woylies, bettongs, boodies and bilbies. But of course it is the sea that dominates life in Australia and we will aim to experience some of the worlds most spectacular oceanic species; from the worlds largest fish to some of the worlds most pristine coral reefs and endangered species like dugongs, manta rays and top predators like tiger sharks. The marine life is so prolific here that many of the species can be seen from the boat and we do not bait or chum for any of the sharks and still usually see over 5 different species. All of our tours are guided by our own professional local guide so you are sure to be in the best hands possible for the best sightings. Our escort for this tour has experience working on with sharks in South Africa and in Australia as well as working with whales and dolphins in the UK. If possible we will try and arrange a trip out with the Shark Bay Ecosystem Research Project (SBERP) whilst in Shark Bay; this is a project that our director worked on and will try and take you out with them to see how they conduct their research on the sharks, turtles and stingrays in the bay (subject to availability). <br/><br/>We also have a great network of local guides in Australia who have developed a great range of wildlife watching locations where the rarest species are commonly seen. We will spend as much time after dark in certain locations as you wish and with the help a of high powered spotlight we will search for nocturnal species. One of the reasons why our wildlife watching holidays are unique is that our background (as a company) is from a scientific and zoological standpoint and so have a great network of colleagues and contacts all over the world who are the people on the front line in search of the best new locations for wildlife watching. All of these reasons and many more make us experts in arranging safaris and are able to tailor a safari to any location to try to find your targeted species. All you have to do is to get in touch with your budget and your group size and where you would like to go to try and find rare and elusive species.<br/><br/>Price Includes:<br/><br/>Everything mentioned in the itinerary is included. Including three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner). There will be bottled water (approx 1ltr) available for each guest each day. We have our own private air conditioned vehicles with an excellent driver for all transfers. Where possible we use two brilliant guides; first a professional guide will escort you on all your excursions and will act as your driver throughout and also very knowledgeable English speaking local guides who have decades of experience working and guiding through Western Australia. Your guide is an expert in animal behaviour as well as marine biology and will be able to help you identify the different species as well as interpret you what behaviours you are seeing. The local guides have spent years searching out the best wildlife watching locations and have an unrivalled knowledge of where some of the most elusive Australian animals are. As well as having years of experience in bringing people out to see sharks, whales, sea lions and endemic Australian marsupials and other wildlife safely. We have included trips to Dryandra Woodland Sanctuary where some of the rarest species in the world are being bred back from the brink of extinction. We also include all vehicle safaris, guided walks, spotlighting drives, whale shark snorkelling, swimming with sea lions, whale watching excursions, park entrance fees and sightseeing entrance fees. Also any trips out with researchers and scientists to see the wildlife (including tiger sharks) of Shark Bay will also be included (subject to availability). We include more time spent in the field searching for wildlife per day than any other tour operator around; only if you request to have a rest day will we not arrange a safari into the Australian bush or trip out to sea for whales or sharks. A comprehensive species list (which states the relative chances of seeing animals based on past tours) is included in the pre-departure pack. There is also a reference book library available for your use throughout the trip as well as some documentaries on the wildlife that you are likely to see which are available to watch throughout the tour.<br/><br/>Seasons:<br/><br/>Season; Early May to mid August. There are two main focuses of this trip, firstly the rare and endemic marsupials of Australia as well as the myriad of marine life from Perth north to Ningaloo and Exmouth. The marsupials do not have a specific season and can be seen all year around so we are dependent on the marine life and along the west coast of Australia everything is dependant on the plankton bloom of Ningaloo Reef. This occurs during the southern Hemisphere winter and from May to mid August there are many plankton feeding whale sharks and manta rays taking advantage of the plankton, these species are added to the resident Australian sea lions, bottlenose dolphins, humpback dolphins, marine turtles, reef sharks and dugongs. However we can further refine this period to incorporate the beginning of the humpback whale and tiger shark migrations from north to south by participating in this tour in from mid June to mid August. <br/><br/>Why Choose this Tour:<br/><br/>•\tAll of our wildlife watching holidays are guided by a local naturalist guides and also scientists or researchers where possible, this not only gives you numerous sets of trained eyes to find the animals but also gives you the chance to understand the behaviours and habits of the wildlife your watching.<br/>•\tWe will endeavour to organise a trip out with the Shark Bay Ecosystem Research Project (SBERP) as they conduct surveys of Shark Bay as they study the tiger sharks, many stingray species and two species of marine turtle. This is the best way to see free-swimming tiger sharks without the use of bait or chum as well as seeing some of the many species that inhabit the bay.<br/>•\tWe can offer you spotlighting trips of the Dryandra Woodland Reserve and Kalbarri National Park so that you can search for the rarer species and other nocturnal wildlife when they are more active.<br/>•\tWe will also visit the Dryandra Woodland Sanctuary were a number of species are being bred for future reintroduction; the animals here (greater bilbies, boodies, numbats, woylies and bettongs) are living in a semi-wild habitat and you will be able to get up close and personal with some of the rarest species of mammal in the entire world.<br/>•\tWe can also bring thermal imaging and night vision equipment as well as hydrophones (on request) to also aid in finding the nocturnal mammals after dark and listen in on the underwater conversations of whales and dolphins.<br/>•\tWe use camera traps (where available) which will increase the chances of getting close up pictures and movies of rare animals and other rare nocturnal wildlife.<br/>•\tTake the ferry from Perth over to Rottnest Island for a couple of days and see the idyllic Australian dream in full.<br/>•\tSwim alongside the world’s largest species of fish, the whale shark off the wonderful Ningaloo Reef. This is all but a guaranteed experience during this time of the year and you will probably have the chance of swimming with a few of these magnificent sharks throughout the day.<br/>•\tExplore the Pinnacles of Nambung National Park, this natural rock formation is stunning with over 150,000 (some up to 5m tall) stone pillars dotting the landscape.<br/>•\tSnorkel with a colony of very inquisitive Australian sea lions at the stunning Jurien Bay Marine Park.<br/>•\tHave a sunset catamaran cruise around beautiful Shark Bay, where the sky and sea melt into a pastel shaded horizon and dolphins, dugongs and turtles can be seen hundreds of meters away on the mirror like surface.<br/>•\tHopefully we will see one of the most unusual behaviours in the world and watch bottlenose dolphins beach themselves in pursuit of fish in François Peron National Park (as seen on the BBC’s Planet Earth Series).<br/>•\tSnorkel the impressive Ningaloo Reef which is the world’s largest fringing reef, this means you can walk to the reef from the beach and enjoy most of the same species that the Great Barrier Reef has to offer from within 50m of the beach.<br/>•\tAll the above reasons give our Western Australian wildlife tour a great success rate of seeing the best wildlife around here. We have an unrivalled network of experts and guides throughout Australia so that we can try and find and observe animals such as the greater bilbies, boodies, numbats, whale sharks, tiger sharks, humpback whales, dolphins, Australian sea lions and hundreds of other species throughout Western Australia. Whether it is the Queensland, Northern Territory, Tasmania, South Australia, Great Barrier Reef, New South Wales and Victoria or any of the other many wildlife watching locations you want to visit we can arrange it. Please inform us if you wish to receive more information about any of these locations and booking a safari.<br/>•\tUnlike many tour operators we are willing to run this tour for a single person (on request).<br/><br/>Locations:<br/><br/>This tour travels from Perth to Rottnest Island, Dryandra Woodland Reserve, the national parks of Nambung and Kalbarri as well as visiting the marine wildlife hotspots of Jurien Bay, Shark Bay and Ningaloo Reef.<br/><br/>Fitness Level:<br/><br/>There are a few physical activities on this tour, firstly the ability to swim and snorkel in essential (no scuba-diving experience is needed) and the ability to swim in open water for over 1 hour is needed. There is also walking and cycling involved and the temperatures in Western Australia can be hot, even during their winter. So we require people to be used to walking in the heat.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/><br/>When you book onto the tour we will send you a comprehensive pre-departure pack which will include a full packing list of recommended equipment; the equipment list will vary from tour to tour and from location to location so it is best to contact us or wait until you receive the pre-departure pack after booking.<br/><br/>Minimum Age: 18 Years Old.",

        "description": "Shark Bay ¬– Travelling & Wildlife Watching – On the morning of day 11 you will leave Kablarri national Park after breakfat and travel further north and into the World Heritage area of Shark Bay. This will be your home for the next 4 nights, we will explore various aspects of this incredible and huge bay. Shark Bay is famous for its huge (largest in the world) pristine sea grass ecosystem which holds such a huge amount of life you will almost not believe your eyes and one of the most incredible spectacles will be seen on day 11. Just as we enter the peninsula we will stop at Hamelin Pool Marine Nature Reserve. This small bay is home to true living fossils. The bizarre looking statues which dot the waters edge are in fact living organisms called stromatolites; they are cyanobacteria and they form the structures by trapping microscopic calcium particles from sea shells and sand, they are the most simple form of life which use photosynthesis in order to produce food and the hyper-saline water of Hamelin Pool is perfect for them. They are living fossils because their closest relatives are fossil stromatolites over 3,500 million years old! The water is quite chilly but you are free to have a dip and get some underwater shots of the stromatolites. As well as these there are other animals in the pool including large thorntail stingrays which can grow to over 2m across their disc. They are very curious and often come right up to the waters edge. Once we leave Hamelin Pool we will continue on to Denham and our hotel for the next 4 nights. The next morning you will rise early and after breakfast drive down the road to the other settlement in Shark Bay; Monkey Mia. It is here that you can meet the stars of the bay as every morning a group of Indo-Pacific bottle-nose dolphins come very close to the beach and are fed by the locals. This is very controversial and we do not condone the feeding of the dolphins as it is proven to alter their behaviour, however it does allow you to get closer to wild dolphins than is usually possible. The rest of the day will be spent in the resort and we can go for walks along the beach and see what we can find which often includes, western shovelnose rays, coach-tail whiprays, reticulated whiprays, spotted eagle rays, cow-tailed stingrays, nervous sharks, Australian pelicans, pied cormorants and of course the dolphins. We can also hire sea kayaks and head out onto the water at a very leisurely pace to see if we can get close to dugongs, dolphins, green and loggerhead turtles and maybe even find the king og the bay, one of the large tiger sharks. There is very little to be worried about in the bay (considering there are over 10,000 tiger sharks and other species present in the bay there has only ever been one recorded shark attack and he was a spear fisherman. Our director has spent many hours on the water here including doing diving and snorkelling as part of a the Shark Bay Ecosystem Research Project and can vouch for the safety of the water (as long as your sensible). We will eat lunch here at Monkey Mia and when we have finished exploring the coastline we will leave for Denham and have our evening meal here. After breakfast on day 13 you will be taken to explore the interior of the peninsula inside Francois Peron National Park. Most of the roads are suitable for 2 wheel drive vehicles but if the conditions are not right we may be limited in where we can visit. However usually we can get to Skipjack Point, Cape Peron, Bottle Bay and the Gregories. Skipjack Point and Cape Peron are the best places to spot large sharks (tigers, bull, sandbar, lemon, nervous, scalloped hammerheads and others), stingrays (spotted eagle rays, coachtail whiprays, reticulated whiprays, cow-tailed), shovelnose rays (great and western), dugongs as well as green and loggerhead turtles. If we are lucky it is from here that a group of Indo-Pacific bottle-nose dolphins have learnt to herd fish into the shallows and beach themselves to snap them up. This was famously filmed for Planet Earth and we may be treated to a live viewing. As we are driving around the peninsula we past many birridas (salt-pans) and here many migratory birds aggregate. Peron is one of the best places to see thorny devils, bobtail skinks, breaded dragons, woma pythons and common walleroos. We will have a picnic lunch and as the sun begins to set we will head back to Denham for our evening meal. For your last full day in Shark Bay you will once again spend the day at Monkey Mia again so after breakfast we will drive there and today we will be having a cruise around the bay one of the catamarans which conducts wildlife tours of the bay. We will have an afternoon tour which specialises in finding dugongs. We will either stay on the boat for sunset and a relaxing cruise as the sunsets against the still waters creating a surreal pinkish grow which is reflected everywhere or we can join a cultural tour with an indigenous member of the Shark Bay population; he will take us into Dream Time and show us how the desert provides his people with food, water, shelter and everything they could need. Our evening meal will be in Denham and afterwards we can go back out into the desert and try to spotlight some of the rare mammals like Shark Bay mice, bilbies, boodies and short-beaked echidnas.

        "description": "Exmouth & Ningaloo Reef – Travelling, Snorkelling & Wildlife Watching – After an early breakfast in Denham we will leave Shark Bay and head north to our next destination and last stop on the northerly journey. Today is a long day of driving and so we will split the day with a morning drive to Carnarvon (4.5 hours) where we will have lunch and a break before we continue north to Exmouth (4.5-5 hours). As the drive will take the majority of the day the rest of the evening is free for you to rest and relax either in your hotel. The next day we will spend the day with the largest fish in the world. By travelling out to the edges of Ningaloo Reef, you will be in one of the best whale shark watching places in the world. From May to August they aggregate here to take advantage of the plankton blooms of the reef. We will have an opportunity to snorkel above the outer reef wall until the spotter plane fins a whale shark. The snorkelling may prove very rewarding as it is not unusual to see grey-reef sharks, white-tipped reef sharks, bat fish, large schools of sea bream and other fish. But the real fun begins as soon as we receive news of a sighting. The pilot of the plane will radio in the sighting and circle the shark until we arrive. Once we arrive you will be briefed on the strict rules of swimming with the animals which is as much for the safety of you as for the shark. Swimming with these gentle giants is amazing and you get a genuine sense of awe as they dwarf you and power forward with the smallest flicks of their tail and you struggle to keep up as you swim as fast as you can! We will recoup some energy with lunch on the boat and continue to snorkel with the huge sharks and sometimes we will end the day with more snorkelling around the reef itself, where huge stingrays and many reef fish are plentiful. As well as the highlight of whale sharks there are very good chances we can see and maybe swim with manta rays and even humpback whales at this time of the year; and then on retuning to the hotel you will you’re your well deserved evening meal. During day 17 you will be driven around the peninsula and taken to Cape Range National Park. Cape Range is a beautiful part of the world, partly because of all of the wonderful wildlife found around here such as black-footed rock wallabies, western grey kangaroos, Australian bustards, emus, galahs, perenties and red kangaroos and partly because of the close proximity of Ningaloo Reef. The reef here extends right up to the coastline and this makes snorkelling here amazing. In between all the green turtles, black-tipped reef sharks, blue-green parrotfish, Clarke’s anemone fish and many more species you will not know where to look. We will travel to a nearby café for lunch and in the afternoon continue exploring the park either by snorkelling or walking. Then on your last full day around here you have the choice of either going back to Cape Range National Park and enjoy more snorkelling, birding and walking in the scrub or stay in Exmouth and enjoy our last day relaxing in the quaint town before we travel back to Perth. We will eat our lunch in a café depending on where we are and our evening meal will be back at the hotel. (Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner)"

        "description": "Viti Levu acts as the international gateway to Fiji. As your flight descends into Nadi International Airport, you can look out the window to see the jade hues of the rainforest canopy carpeting the landscape. The sapphire waters lap at the gold-sand shores, and the peak of Mount Victoria reaches out of the northern highlands to a height of nearly 4,345 feet. In the distant waters, you can see the outline of pockets of coral reefs deepening shades of blue within the crystal clear ocean. You and your partner land at the airport and board a brief domestic flight to reach Suva, the capital of Viti Levu and the second largest city on the island. The culture emanates youthfulness around the streets of the city, which highlights a lush, hilly peninsula. The diverse architecture of downtown creates a puzzle of colonial buildings, contemporary shopping plazas, and an esplanade overlooking the indigo waters. You have a private transfer from Suva Airport to the dock, where you board a speedboat bound for your secluded resort. Students walk along the esplanade beside businessmen wearing traditional sarongs. Sari shops stand beside curry houses emanating vibrant spices blending with the seaside aroma. The boat casts off with you and your partner embracing the refreshing tropical breeze embellished with sporadic mist. Upon arrival at the resort’s private jetty, you check into the hotel inside the open-air lobby and marvel at the romantic ambiance of your private suite. The balcony overlooks the plunge pool and offers a spectacular view of the layering blues of the Pacific Ocean. The tropical trees, from ferns to palms, frame the beach. In the afternoon, you and your partner can sip drinks on the veranda listening to the water lap at the white sand beach, accented by the distant sounds of a live acoustic band playing near the dining room."

The delightful aroma of coconut blends with the swirling scent of the sea. After the meal, you and your partner have the day to enjoy the splendors of island living at your leisure, from digging your toes into the warm sand to lingering beneath the seductive tropical sun. You and your partner step out into the waters with a guide to view the kaleidoscope colors of the coral reef encircling the island. The resort provides snorkel gear. Your guide leads you to a hidden area of the reef providing stunning views and insight into the underwater world. The water is cool on your skin beneath the embracing sun. The light can pierce the surface water upwards of 200 feet deep. The coral rises from the seafloor to create hills and valleys steeped in rainbow hues. Regal angelfish glow with white, yellow, and blue stripes. The iridescent scales contrast the rocks and dark coral. Clownfish rub against the bristle of anemones waving in the current.

You travel into the remote highlands of Viti Levu to meet your guide along the banks of the Wainikoroiluva River. You and your partner board the raft and ride the gentle current between the rising boulders. The rainforest contains a herbaceous aroma emanating from the trees. The current leads you downstream as the banks turn to smooth cliffs at Upper Navua Gorge. Water spills over the cliffs, creating a beaded cascade spilling into the river. Black volcanic rock shapes curves along the river-edge, narrowing to a width of 16 feet apart. The surrounding canopy shimmers with jade leaves as parrots and fruit bats perch on the branches. Your guide tells you and your partner to paddle. The sound of rushing water echoes against the canyon walls. The river washes over rocks, splashing against the rapid decline to create whitewater. You paddle with the current. Your guide steers the raft. The rapids clear and the river returns to tranquility. You and your partner glance at one another, beaming with the thought of sharing another adventure."

Your private speedboat meets you at the jetty after your meal and escorts you to the shores of Suva.

You and your partner make your way to the marina and step aboard a luxurious catamaran bound for the outer rim of the Great Barrier Reef. Inside the catamaran, the aroma of coffee and tea fill the air. On the outer decks, the scent of the ocean sweeps across the bow. The shoreline disappears from view and silhouettes of smaller coral bodies intersperse the open ocean. The Great Barrier Reef encompasses more than 1,400 miles with ribbons of soft and hard coral, sea grass, and sea fans reaching a depth of more than 1,600 feet deep. The catamaran weighs anchor at your first stop. You don your snorkel and fins before submerging into the water at Agincourt Reef. Myriads of fish glisten in the beams of light piercing the water’s surface. Clownfish snuggle into sea anemones and schools of damselfish cause the water to glow in clouds of neon. You immediately notice the diversity in the fish and how the enormous ecosystem differs from the reefs you explored while in Fiji. The fragile beauty of the reef easily enchants you and your partner, even before a sea turtle gently glides past."

Begin to savor your time in Tasmania with a visit to the Jansz Vineyard where sparkling wines reign supreme. Sip the Premium Cuvée and the air is perfumed with honeysuckle and citrus, mixing with a subtle scent of strawberry. Gentle fruits wash over your tongue letting the citrus notes linger a while. Continue on to the world famous Pipers Brook Estates where the complex perfume of the 2013 Pinot Gris fills the glass with a depth of aroma, from fragrant pear to dried goji berries, finishing with a subtle blend of cinnamon spice. The full body of the wine is filled with apple strudel combined with a sweet ginger spice that gives a delightful richness to the dry wine. Continue your journey through Northern Tasmania with a stroll through the Myrtle Rainforest. The trees tower into the air surrounding you with the pleasant scent of fresh rain and lush flora. The forest is vivacious, with trees almost as wide as they are tall, roots sprouting from beneath the forest floor like something out of a fairytale, the moss almost neon green. Travel across the canopy on a hanging bridge for a view of the forest from on high before making your way to the luxuries of the Tidal Waters Resort, located along the sensationally blue waters of local bay, surrounded by numerous lagoons and lakes. The trees nestle the resort allowing for seclusion and privacy amongst its many luxuries, including the delightful view of the stunning scenery from most any room. The romance and flavors have only begun with your first taste of Tasmania."

One of the many colonial towns on the island, Ross is secluded and has therefore maintained its stunning beauty throughout the centuries. With the typical sensation of the British countryside you’ll feel as though you’ve been transported. Ross was an important stopover between Launceston and Hobart during the 19th century, needed as a horse coach changing point and a local garrison.

The ruin stands tall along the calm waters of the sea where the Watchmen’s Quarters are still visible from a distance. The scent of wet rubble and the surrounding forestry surround the compound. Wander through the Museum Houses where a number of the homes have been restored with furniture, dishes, and insight into the daily life of the settlement, from colorful china to bronzed kitchen appliances. Continue your day with a selection of delicious options for you to explore, from Oyster shucking to fruit farming, depending on your preference of flavors. Barilla Bay is known as much for its pristine waters, unspoiled environment, and easy climate as it is for its premium oysters. Venture out onto the soft lull of the waves and help bring in a batch of oysters where you can feel the strength of the shell between your fingers, learning how to shuck an oyster like a natural. If the juicy sweetness of fruit is your preference you can meander through the berry and cherry orchards, tasting the sweet fruit juice and feeling the ripe bunches between your fingers.

A trained guide will hold a sugar glider, a marsupial known for its love of fruit and flower nectar that can glide nearly 300 feet between trees, extending a wing-like flap to help carry them through the air. Another guide will hold a koala as it nibbles on a thread of leaves. As you complete your time in Cairns, one last look at the wildlife is the perfect end to your journey. When you are ready, your private transfer will meet you in your hotel lobby to escort you to Cairns Airport. You will have discovered the splendors around Cairns, but you could extend your vacation to immerse yourself in the urban grandeur of Sydney or Melbourne before returning home."

Palm trees line the street and sailboats wade in the marina with their masts swaying against the skyline. Cafes overlook the popular seaside esplanade. The scents of rich coffee and brick-oven pizza blend into the whirl of semi-sweet ocean air. Families dip their toes into the refreshing waters of the swimming lagoon overlooking the shoreline and flying foxes rest in the trees before venturing out in search of fresh mango. Your flight lands at Cairns Airport, where your private transfer meets you upon arrival. You easily settle into the comforts of your luxurious hotel offering views of the quiet lull of water against the shore. Tropical gardens bloom with lush orchids and vibrant jasmine. The Botanic Gardens embodies the splendor of the exotic landscape by representing the diversity of flora over more than 90 acres. The grounds were laid in the late 19th century and also showcase more than 4,000 different species of plants from around the globe. Bamboo grows alongside the footpaths and mature palms rustle in the passing breeze."

Sailboats set out to the edges of the Great Barrier Reef and locals return to the esplanade for a scenic stroll. The sunlight spreads ample colors across the eastern horizon. After breakfast, your guide meets you at the hotel and escorts to the train station where you board a scenic ride into the jungle en route to Kuranda. The railway takes you back in time with comfortable first-class seating and open windows to view the lush wet tropics of the region. It is your first expedition into the oldest known rainforest on Earth. The scent of the herbaceous canopy fills the train car and blends with the rich aroma of fresh coffee. The vines of strangler figs wrap around tree trunks. Exotic palm trees soar above the forest floor. Orchids shimmer with elegance against the jade hues of the leaves. The train takes you over the deep ravines and passes gorgeous waterfalls framed by the mountains ridges. You reach the town of Kuranda by traveling from sea level to an altitude of nearly 1,100 feet. The jungle town brims with local life and historical culture. The art market fills with hand-carved wood sculptures and Ulysses butterflies flutter with reflective blue wings against the backdrop of the trees. You continue to Mareeba, leaving the herbaceous aromas of the jungle for the rock walls of Granite Gorge. Deep pools form inside the rock formations where rock wallabies graze on the pockets of foliage."

The protected area overtakes nearly 300 acres. The morning air is refreshing and cool on your skin. You step into the gondola of a newly inflated hot air balloon and ascend into the sky. The sun peeks above the eastern horizon and spreads layers of pink, sage, and crimson through the air. The breathtaking view encompasses the rainforest canopy, meandering river, coastal plains, and the Coral Sea. Your guide greets you upon landing and leads you to a local coffee plantation to continue your energetic exploration of Mareeba. The plantation has been producing Australian Arabica coffee for nearly 30 years. You traverse the edges of the bushels that thrive in the tropical climate. The plantation spreads across 375 acres, accented by the red glow of the berries in which you find the coffee beans. Your guide leads you through the process of cultivation, including how the grain is dried and roasted, presenting a coffee bean you are used to seeing. The roasting helps accentuate the natural oils, releasing the flavors that coffee drinkers enjoy. When sampling the locally produced coffee, you find hints of chocolate and caramel linger on your palate. Continue to the entrance of Undara Volcanic National Park to view the world’s longest and largest lava tube system, reaching a length of nearly 4,270 feet."

After the meal, you venture east to the shores of Port Douglas. Soaring coconut palm trees line the white sand beaches. The water of the Coral Sea shimmers with sapphire hues. The streets of Port Douglas create an inclusive ambiance with locals offering welcoming smiles and friendly waves. The day on the coast is yours to enjoy, whether you prefer taking to the renovated golf course or basking on the powdery white shores of Four Mile Beach. You can begin your exploration of the day at Mossman Gorge, located north of town. Crystal clear waterfalls tumble over granite boulders splashing into swimming holes. The rainforest canopy overtakes riverbanks. Sugarcane fields grow along the tropical edges of the gorge before giving way to manicured trails and dense forest. A shuttle takes you to the heart of the gorge, where you can hear the water of the Mossman River flowing along the smooth granite rocks. A walking circuit traverses the forest floor, encompassing nearly two miles. You can dip into the cold water of a swimming hole and relax beneath the rustling fronds. Dusky honeyeaters flutter overhead as you search for signs of the elusive cassowary in the bush. The bird can stand more than six feet tall with an elegant neck shining with electric blue plumage."

After breakfast, you leave the shores of Port Douglas behind as you make your way to Cape Tribulation, where the roots of the tropical rainforest touch the lapping waters of the coiling edges of the Great Barrier Reef. Before reaching the cape, you pass through Daintree to search for the endemic saltwater crocodiles. The Daintree Rainforest spreads across nearly 465 square miles and dates back more than 135 million years. Butterflies flutter above the underbrush brushed with dew. You board a shallow river cruiser to take you along the Daintree River. Your guide provides colorful commentary to your water safari, with stories of crocodiles and tree kangaroos, the latter of which are found only in Daintree. You find the vibrant yellow breast of a buff-breasted kingfisher, which migrates between the tropics of New Guinea and Australia. You spot a large saltwater crocodile basking in the sunlight on a small promontory. The scales glisten in the sunlight. The crocodile can average 17 feet in length and weigh 1,000 pounds. You continue north to Cape Tribulation and relax on the secluded sands of Coconut Beach, located just over a mile from Cape Tribulation. A reef fringes the coastline before a steep drop off. The mouth of Myall Creek feeds into the sea where crocodiles linger at the edges. The pristine sand shimmers beneath the passing sunlight against the crystal clear waters."

After breakfast, you return to the paths traversing Cape Tribulation and make your way along towards Cooktown by first stopping along the trail leading to Bloomfield Falls, a sacred cascade of the Wujal Wujal people. The water trundles 130 feet into the wading pool. The whitewater roars beneath the forest canopy. The nearby falls add a refreshing symphony of nature. However, the remaining cascades at Wujal Wujal are sacred to the community and are off limits to the general public. A cool mist rises up from the splashing pool. Ripples course through the water until calming to a reflective surface. After visiting the falls, you meet with a local Kuku Yalanji guide for an in-depth tour of the ancestral lands and ancient culture. Your guide takes you through the bush to discover significant plants used for medicines and art, creating ochre hues out of muddled leaves and soil. You listen to the captivating stories of Dreamtime, when the Rainbow Serpent created the earth, along with the importance of oratory in the culture. The landscape takes on a new importance after your guided tour, offering you a glimpse into ancient tribal secrets."

Cooktown sits at the edge of Cape York Peninsula and was the first location on the continent Captain Cook landed in the 1770s. The ship struck a reef off Cape Tribulation and spent nearly 50 days repairing the damage. The secluded streets preserve the history of the region and maintain a stance as the first European “settlement” in Australia. The surrounding landscape brims with lush forest bordering the pristine tropical beaches interspersed with lagoons and waterfalls. Gardens hide beneath the canopy and the mountains provide unparalleled views to the eastern horizon. For an encompassing view of European history in Australia, you make your way to the James Cook Museum, situated at the corner of Helen and Furneaux. The edifice was erected as a convent in the late 19th century and presents relics from Cook’s time in the region. Journal entries and the anchor of the Endeavour add texture to the exhibits. The latter was recovered from the seafloor in the 1970s, offering a piece of the nation’s European cultural history to the captivating landscape."

At breakfast, the aromas of sugarcane and coconut accompany the breeze. You make your way along the coast and enjoy the views of rolling emerald canopy and gentle indigo waters brushing white-sand beaches. You venture inland, between the dense trees and tropical brush, to enter Quinkan County, an internationally significant collection of Aboriginal rock art characterized by mythological beings. The sandstone escarpments near the small town of Laura contain the largest bodies of prehistoric works, including engravings and stenciling. The Ang-Gnarra Aborigines crafted the artwork more than 35,000 years ago. The art depicts tracks of the mythical Quinkan creature in red ochre with white and black embellishments. A mystical ambiance emanates from the preserved art adorning the rock face. You continue south until the trees once again open to an ocean view.

You wake early to step aboard a luxury catamaran bound for the edges of the Great Barrier Reef’s Outer Reef. The marine park stretches for 1,400 miles from Australia’s east coast. The wind glides over the catamaran. Pockets of reef bodies cast dark shadows beneath the crystal clear surface. The calm waters provide pristine visibility reaching to nearly 60 feet in all directions. You leap into the water at Agincourt Reef and immediately notice the warm temperature wrapping around you. The transparent hue offers opulent rainbow colored coral to glow over billowing sea grass. The ridges of brain coral twist over the unique looking mound. Sea anemones flutter in the gentle current. Blue tang fish, best known for their representation as Dory in Finding Dory , rub against the soft anemone tendrils. You dip beneath the surface for a closer look at the way the anemone resembles grass rustling in the wind. The yellow tendrils fade to fuchsia tips. A large Maori wrasse swims past. They can grow to more than six feet long and weigh up to 365 pounds. Their scales shimmer with pastel hues against the backdrop of coral rising out of the seafloor like a hill."

As the forest opens out, find the kangaroos in large mobs clustered on green fields. Males stand and fight, comically trading punches and vicious kicks. Females stand and watch before they hop along to get a closer look. Move slowly, stay silent, and it's remarkable how close you can get. Approach with a few steps, stop, check that the kangaroos seem uninterested, then get closer still. You will see a lot more of these marsupials, so it's a good time to practice the routine.

A place of migration, it’s a serene place to stop as five other whale species move through the oceans. Humpback whales crash their frames onto the water, while southern whales continue to breach close to the coast. Pilot whales are also common, often spotted near to Hector's dolphins, two playful species that add further enchantment to your adventure. With two days of boat cruising, enjoy extended opportunity to get close to all of these species, along with the enhanced possibility of spotting two of Kaikoura's (and the world's) elusive sights. Orcas and blue whales feed in these waters, and a sight of them is the wildlife highlight of a lifetime, not just of a vacation! Guided boat tours are often followed by pods of dusky dolphins, and it's hard to travel too far without an encounter with New Zealand fur seals. As the currents collide, the waters of Kaikoura provide a very special sanctuary for the marine giants of our world. Most tours last five to six hours with departure times dependent on tides and conditions. With its oceanfront location, and a backdrop of regularly snow-capped mountains, the town always imbues quintessentially New Zealand tranquility.

The township is charming, filled with Edwardian beauty and pillared structures that adorn the main street. The church has a towering brick spire that stretches tall into the open sky. While you are inland you will explore the serene landscape around Hyden where you will climb onto the oldest plateau on earth, Greenmount Hill in the Darling Range. The gigantic granite piece sits in the sun and is open to rushing wind and falling rain, which has shaped the rock over millions of years. The rock rises and curls like a tremendous wave that sparkles in the sunlight. Once you have “ridden” the Wave Rock, and explored its spectacular structure you will make your way to Fitzgerald River National Park where inspiring trails curve along the shore. The water shines an opulent blue, waves lap at the rocky coast, and the sky is open as far as the eye can see. Whether standing on the hilltops and feeling the misty breeze through your hair, or walking along the hot sand, there is always open space to explore and enjoy."

Begin your exploration with a visit to the Telegraph Station. The skeleton of the structure stands along the sand, half buried by beach. Through wind, rain, and time the old telegraph station still shines in the sun but beneath the growing sand dunes that roll across the beach. Climb across the roofless bricks, circle around the stones and see how much of the old building remains versus how much of the stone now lies sunken beneath the swirling sand. Continue your journey across the vast expanse of Australia with a visit to Head of the Bight known for stunning views and unparalleled landscape. The flatland of the Bight stretches out to the sea before dropping steeply along a colorful cliff into the water. The ocean glows vibrant blue. The crash of the water on the cliff rises into the air. From various lookout points along the water you can see southern right whales drifting beside the coastline, the large puffs of air sprouting mist into the sky before you continue your journey inland to Nullarbor Plain and witness the famous camel-wombat-kangaroo sign. Nullarbor Plain is a large stretch of flat, arid landscape in Western Australia with practically no trees, and the famous sign there warns travelers to watch for camels, wombats, and kangaroos during their journey along the road. You can also witness the land-whale at the shell station, where in the arid landscape of Nullarbor the last thing you’d except to see would be a humpback; however, sitting in front of the petrol station lies exactly that, waiting to greet you on your journey."

A narrow cobblestone lane winds between sandstone warehouses leading to the oldest surviving house in the Sydney. Cadman’s Cottage was originally built in 1816 in the traditional Georgian style of the time. Your guide explains that during high tide the water would reach within 8 feet of the structure but has since moved over 300 feet away after the construction of Circular Quay.

Founded over 200 years ago around the torrent of freshwater that tumbled through Cataract Gorge, Launceston is a lovely pocket-sized city featuring heritage architecture and a food scene renowned for its focus on fresh local produce."

        "description": "After breakfast, you will take one last look at Cradle Mountain before climbing into your car and beginning the journey back to Launceston. Here you will board your flight to Sydney on the east coast of the Australian mainland, where you will be met by your driver and privately transferred to your hotel, the distinctive flatiron building that sits in the center of Sydney’s Central Business and Shopping District and only two blocks back from Sydney Harbour. As one of the most beautiful cities in the world, deciding how to spend your final afternoon in Australia is not an easy one. Sydney is famous for its beaches, its vibrant art scene and café culture, and the iconic Sydney Harbour Bridge and Opera House. But the true show stopper in Sydney is really its magnificent harbor, which was first discovered by Captain James Cook in 1788 when he was searching for a location for a new penal colony. If you really want to understand the essence of Sydney, you need to experience the harbor. From your hotel, it is a five-minute walk down to Circular Quay. From there, you can take a public ferry or water taxi to anywhere in Sydney Harbour. For those short of time, we suggest a quick ferry trip to Cremorne Point, a spectacular vantage point located opposite the city. Take a picnic and some wine and sit on the grassy slopes as you admire the view. Any ferry departing from Circular Quay will afford you with five-star views of both the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Sydney Opera House, so a ferry ride really is the best way to see these landmarks. For those with more time, a relaxed ferry trip to Watson’s Bay is a highlight of any visit to Sydney. Eat at the famous Doyles On The Beach, have a dip at the stunning ‘Camp Cove’ beach, walk along the cliff top to ‘The Gap’ and peer down at the waves crashing far beneath you, or take a short bushwalk around to South Head, which marks the Southerly head of the harbor. Alternatively, a ferry ride to Manly is always popular. Pack your ‘swimmers’, enjoy fish and chips on the beach, or do some snorkeling at Shelley Beach. Sydney also has a very hip scene, which is located around Oxford Street in Sydney, as well as the artsy Balmain in Sydney’s Inner West. Both are a short taxi/ferry ride from the city, and there you will find eclectic shops and one-of-a-kind markets each Saturday. For your final night in Sydney, finish with a splash at one of the many harborside restaurants that Sydney has to offer."

The blend of the colorful skirts accentuates the scenery amidst the sounds of the lapping waves. After breakfast, you make your way to River Heads to board a sailboat leaving for Fraser Island. The Aboriginal called the island K’Gari , which means paradise, due to the breathtaking blend of landscape and ocean scenery encompassing nearly 75 miles. Fraser Island is the world’s largest sand island, crafted over time by wind and ocean drifts settling off eastern Australia’s mainland. The island interior contains crystal clear freshwater lakes with rugged outcroppings framing the shoreline. Your sailboat catches the breeze and glides over the sapphire waters separating the island from the east coast. Sporadic sea spray splashes against your cheeks and the refreshing breeze brushes over the hull of the boat. Upon reaching the island, you visit Maheno Shipwreck, which washed ashore during a cyclone in the 1930s. The skeleton of the ship edges a sandbar with gentle waves brushing against the shoreline and rusted exterior. Seeing the frame of the ship in person transports you into an adventure tale, wondering if buried treasure also hides somewhere on the island. The ship reaches a length of 120 feet from bow to stern, adding a touch of artistry to the unique beauty of the island’s natural landscape."

See how they act in their natural environment: eating, sleeping, and snugging branches. Take part in a cultural show to learn about the local community's ancestral ties and cultural connection the Queensland’s rainforest. The bang of drums pulses through the air as dancers pound their feet to the floor and spring into traditional dance. Watch the performers demonstrate how to hunt with a spear and how to properly throw a boomerang. Their faces are streaked in white paint and the hum of the didgeridoo vibrates through the circle. Take the chance to learn how to play the didgeridoo; you never know when it will come in handy. By the end of the performance you will understand the Tjapukai’s connection to the area; you will even get a glimpse at the myth of the creation story that made Australia and its unique environment. As the day winds down and the smell of bark is exchanged for the smell of the sea, the myth of Dreamtime is never far away."

The clear water allows you to see the life below the waterline and invites you in. Take the opportunity to get up close to the coral with the free SCUBA dive included in the tour. The coral shines brightly with a pink and purple sheen. A delicious lunch will be served on board, full of fresh seafood and juicy exotic fruits, enough food to fill you with the needed energy to “just keep swimming .” The shimmering blue and yellow of the Blue Tang fish jump in and out of the coral. Stingrays fly across the ocean floor. Eels slither through the warm water. The lanky arms of starfish cling to the sides of collected coral.

The waves crash on the shore, but the quiet sound of drifting is all you can hear. The rest of the day could be spent relaxing by the pristine shores of Port Douglas. Dip your toes into the warm sea.

Kata Tjuta is an important cultural site to Aboriginals in the area, its name translating to “Many Heads.” The domes of the Kata Tjuta are connected through crevices, caves, and gullies. The rocks look as though they are covered in rust ready to be blown away with the breeze, surrounded by desert brush and sand. Traverse the craggy earth that fills the gaps between the Olgas, still damp in shady areas from the last rainfall. The guides will teach you about the cultural connection to the area, along with the legend of the Rainbow Serpent. In the evening you will enjoy the incredible Sound of Silence Dinner.

However, the reefs have suffered from extensive bleaching and show signs of weariness from over-tourism. The outer reefs are in better shapes, but those that are accessible on half day trips can prove to be a disappointment.

After flying into Exmouth, you will be transferred to Ningaloo. You should note that there are no international flights to Exmouth, so you will need to make a domestic transfer, which typically occurs in Perth. Your lodge is located on a quiet sandy beach with excellent snorkeling and diving that is available directly from the sand. After your arrival, there will be some time to rest and relax before a nighttime marine adventure. This can be a guided snorkeling trip with flashlights, and you are usually floating on a drift above a reef wall.

There are loggerhead, green, and hawksbill turtles here, each with their own nesting sights along a mostly deserted coastline. With two to three days in the water, there will be an excellent opportunity to see all three of these species just about any month of the year. The largest fish of them makes Ningaloo its home from March to August. Whale sharks are attracted by the plankton-rich waters of winter, and swimming with them is almost guaranteed every day from March to August. You will jump into the water with the whale sharks this morning and cruise above their enormous frame. Such proximity to these giants is always a humbling experience, and if not, it may be a little frightening at first. The whale shark season overlaps with migratory humpback whales. The whales begin to arrive in July and stay until the end of October. There can be up to 30,000 calving and resting whales who are basking in the sheltered warmth of these remote West Coast waters. Today’s exact itinerary will be dictated by the month that you are traveling. If it is in season, then your morning with whale sharks will be complemented by a sunset boat tour with the humpbacks. If you travel to this destination outside of this season, then there will be many different reefs and marine sites to explore."

In the Flinders Range, you will have a four-wheel drive vehicle and local guide with options to travel in many different directions. You will follow the dried-up creek beds to find marsupials that are sheltered beneath the red gums. You can tour billabongs and can encounter ebullient animals that are feasting on water, including dingoes. In some areas, the arid red gives way to lush tones, and the blurring of these habitats will be a highlight of your outdoor adventure."

        "description": "The scenic flight from Flinders Ranges to Kangaroo Island will bring the most remarkable juxtaposition of landscapes. One habitat is open, arid, and expansive. Australia’s third-largest island is fertile with tightly-packed forests that stretch into green valleys and quiet beaches. There is more wildlife here, and it is more densely packed although you will not see the giants, like red kangaroos, that are able to survive in harsher Flinders Ranges habitat. You will fly directly into the wilderness and then set off on a wildlife safari, which is a four-wheel drive expedition that is likely to encounter many of the country’s most iconic species. Kangaroos are abundant as you might expect from the island’s name. Large males may square up before starting a boxing duel, and females may happily lead suitors around the plains. They will hop away, wait to be followed, and then hop some more. The island is also the last genuine refuge for koalas. You can see them hugging eucalyptus branches as they are usually fast asleep. Sometimes they will wake, and there can be a beautiful moment as you return the gaze of the soporific marsupial. Today’s wildlife safari will take you through the national park to a beachside lodge within the conservation area. During the evening, you can choose for a local wildlife walk or just stay warm around the fire."

Its isolation has meant the evolution of distinct subspecies, such as Tammar wallabies, various possums, southern brown bandicoots, and the delightful short-beaked echidnas. These can be exclusive wildlife highlights today along with blue-tongued skinks and platypus. You can choose to stay dry and spend your entire day in popular island spots, including beaches where sea lions bathe. It will also be possible to go snorkeling or diving should you wish."

First, you will tour around the base of the world’s largest monolith, inspecting Aboriginal rock paintings and coming to appreciate the astonishing size of this structure. After this heart touching experience, you can take a step back, sip on some sparkling wine, and watch how the rock journeys through a spectacular change in color. As with the Flinders Ranges, you will see that there is no fixed definition for the color red here. Each piece of the landscape has its own tone, and every moment, this can change with the sun. Then, once the day is done, you can gaze up at the dazzling, Southern sky. You will stay at an enchanting desert camp away from the main Uluru tourist hub. An astronomer can teach you about the night sky from constellations to the small secrets that appear each evening."

These animals are cantankerous and highly endangered. After dark will come new life such as owls, nightjars, tawny frogmouths, and perhaps a troupe of wallabies.

You may be lucky enough to spot a mob of kangaroos or wallabies. Birdlife is very impressive, and the experience can be operatic. Sometimes flocks will cover the sky, and you will be treated to a flurry of activity and harmonious chirps. At other times, you will have to wait patiently, following audio clues to a pair of blue wings. This is wild bushland, and it is ripe for exploration. You cannot see Kakadu in a day as it takes about half of a day just to reach the real wilderness. Three days will allow a loop around the park’s most iconic features. Daytimes here will be all about adventure. You can eat breakfast at dawn by the remains of last night’s fire or hike and drive on rarely covered paths. You will be staying in wilderness cabins where the skies are magnificent, especially when you are sitting around the fire and appreciating a world away from Wi-Fi and modern life.

The kids smile with anticipation as you move closer to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, which remains the largest coral reef network in the world, encompassing 132,974 square miles. An onboard marine biologist tells you and the kids about the types of fish you can see, including numerous clown fish, which the kids know from the film Finding Nemo . When you reach the first sight, the kids put on their snorkel gear and jump fearlessly into the water. When you submerge into the water, you find the temperature warm and the view inviting. Pink and orange calcite wind upwards from the seafloor, resembling vivacious mountains. Soft coral delicately waves in the gentle current, surrounded by schools of fish swirling closer to the various forms and shapes in front of you. Your kids find a clown fish first, peaking through an anemone, its orange and white stripes standing out against the creamy tentacles of the anemone."

Throughout the day, the guides bring visitors up close to some of the furriest and friendliest animals in the sanctuary, from sugar gliders to wombats. Beyond the charm of the cute creatures is the allure of the endangered species that call the island home. The sanctuary houses a number of Tasmanian devils. The elusive animals look a bit like miniature bears with long tails, and average more than 25 inches in length, not including its tail. During the day, they hide from the heat in dense bushes or burrowed into a hole. At night, they prowl through the bush in search of food. Seeing one is unique and unforgettable."

The museum was erected in the 1820s and maintains a range of architectural styles due to a series of renovations over the years, including Greek revival and neoclassical elements. You stroll through the galleries intent on finding the exhibit displaying Eric the Pliosaur, whose bones were discovered in a mining town in the 1980s. The marine tetrapod lived during the late Triassic period. While submerged in the earth, the bones opalized, causing a stunning sheen to the surface. As you view the bones, you can see the gem-like qualities spreading across the more than eight-foot long frame accentuated by the museum’s soft light. In the afternoon, you make your way to the Tobruk Sheep Farm for a private tour of the grounds, including a demonstration of sheep herding and shearing. The sheep graze on the verdant grass. The scent of wool and rich soil emanate from the grounds. The sheep have fluffy and bushy coats in both black and white colors. As the dogs start to herd the sheep, the family watches from behind the fence, noticing how the sheep flock together before walking to the corral."

The dromedary, the single-humped camel, can grow to more than six feet tall and was brought to Australia to help with trade across the Red Desert in the 1820s. You mount your camel and instantly understand the euphemism “Ship of the Desert,” as the camel sways from side to side. The sun begins to rise above the eastern horizon. The light layers the distance with color, slowly creeping over the desert sand to return the darkness back to the familiar deep red. You tell the kids to look towards Uluru, as the marvelous monolith changes colors at sunrise, from an unmistakable silhouette to an iridescent orange. After breakfast, your guide leads you to the stunning natural domes of Kata Tjuta, also referred to as “The Olgas.” The 36 orange and white sandstone monoliths have a smooth and grainy texture.

The boat cuts through the ocean breeze and splashes up the waters along the side of the boat. Sporadic reef bodies turn the water a darker shade of blue. The azure and indigo hues of the Coral Sea fade to cobalt. You reach the Agincourt Reef, a collection of ribbon-like coral and jewel-like colors connected to the nearly 133,000 square miles of the Great Barrier Reef. The sunlight can pierce through the clear water of the sea’s surface up to 200 feet deep, encouraging rich growth and the marvelous marine life you soon experience.

Your transfer will escort you to the center, where you will encounter dedicated scientists and marine biologists who study these gorgeous animals and help prepare them for life in the wild after they have been maimed or struck with a catastrophic illness known as “floater’s syndrome.” The results of this remarkable center are spectacular because the rehabilitation rate for the turtles they care for has climbed to nearly 85%. Your guide will introduce you to the different species of turtles by offering stories of each turtle they help, including their species like the flatback turtle that can grow three feet in length and weigh up to 200 pounds. Not only will you have the rare opportunity to get close to these delicate and sensitive animals, but you will also feel the singular warmth of helping them return to their natural homes."

        "description": "Land in Auckland ready to explore and enjoy New Zealand’s most populated city. Sky Tower, the tallest freestanding structure in the Southern Hemisphere, tops the city skyline, the spiraled point sticking into the clear sky. Wander through lively Queens Street on your way to the harbors where the heart of the city can be seen pulsing. The salty smell of the ocean comes on the back of the breeze that blows through the streets. The sails from boats lining the harbor jut into the air giving the city its nickname, “City of Sails.” Visit the Auckland museum located in one of New Zealand's most historical buildings situated in a central city pleasure garden. The scent of roses lingers beneath your nose from spring to autumn and the crisp cool breeze blows in the winter. The exhibitions are exciting, full of artistic integrity and Pacific culture. Monumental carvings decorate certain exhibits, shaved from local trees, polished and shiny in their frozen faced adaptation of traditional spirits. Canoes and replicated communal buildings remain unobstructed and unimpeded for everyone to understand the cultures that have made up the current face of New Zealand. The Auckland War Memorial Museum is another of the museum’s efforts to commemorate the country’s past. An empty tomb on a pedestal stands without decoration or religious symbols to help honor those that fought for the Common Wealth during World War I. The contrast of commemorating the native soldiers lost in battle with commemorating the native culture is among the important understandings of a country coming to terms with its past and is part of the beauty that New Zealand offers as a reward to those willing to find it."

The island is chockfull of beaches, vineyards, olive groves, and lovely villages. Venture from Auckland harbor and take the ferry to Waiheke. The water is an opal blue. The boats in the harbor rock back and forth as the sails sway in the wake before shrinking in the distance. Reaching the island brings the stunning faded sand and pearl blue water of the beach. The lush hills roll into the distance. For lunch you will taste the delicacy of Stoneyridge winery. The hills are almost indistinguishable from the vines as they wrap around and over the horizon. The salty sea air is still drifting from the water and mixes with the fresh soil of the vineyard. Mentioned in the February 2003 issue of UK Wine Magazine under “Cult Wines of the World,” Stoneyridge wines have a rich and varied flavor due to the miscellaneous terrain. Larose wine is a mixture of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec, and Petit Verdot. A Bordeaux-style red wine with dark, wild berry fruits and freshly ground cinnamon on the nose and a firm, medium finish underlying a palate of sweet fruit. Enjoy a tasting of the wine or a full glass as you dine on the rich and citrusy flatbread pizza. The menu boasts fresh, local ingredients that highlight every flavor. The sweet citrus of tomato and the delicate richness of an aioli topped on a crispy pesto flatbread will make the day melt away. Wander through the incredible sculptors showcased at Connells Bay where art & nature are united to create space dedicated to specific sculptures. Sit along the fresh grass, the green hills rolling behind you while the seaside is framed in the large-scale wired vase. This is a perfect place for you to watch the sun set on the horizon; the warm colors stretch in the sky, and the sun fits perfectly in the frame as if it were painted there. Before the sky darkens completely the ferry will take you back to Auckland where another adventure soon awaits."

A city surrounded by the cultural history of the Maori, the beautiful geysers and hot springs of the volcanic region, and the history of the 19th century resort town, Rotorua offers a sense of beauty in its present and its past. Hot pools feed into the lake making steam drift from the water’s surface and the sound of geysers thunder in the distance. Visit the buried town of Te Wairoa hidden but not forgotten in the volcanic eruption of 1886. Ash covered many buildings and other features of the village that have preserved 19th century life making the site a Kiwi Pompeii. The village is surrounded by lush, dense jungle. Village huts and remnants of civilization speckle the area. A hiking route can take you to the stunning panorama of Wairere Falls. The water careens down the rocky path carving through the trees. Mist rises from the sunken pool and drifts into the air, the spray carried on the back of the breeze. At night you will watch the cultural history of the Maori unfold before you. Warriors in traditional grass woven skirts paddle an ancient warrior canoe through the stream. The clear water is full of trout and it flows directly from the sacred spring. The warriors’ faces are decorated with Tā moko , different from a tattoo due to its application; the Tā moko connotes a social status and creates eccentric patterns that encompass the face. Watch your traditional hangi , a type of buried Maori BBQ, lift from the ground, the smell of succulent meat and decadent vegetables roasting in the air."

A guided tour of the city brings with it the elegant flare that is unique to Napier’s streets alone. The architecture symbolizes optimism in the wake of disaster. The buildings and streets are decorated with bright colors; the semi Victorian homes open themselves to the streets with warm blues and greens reflecting the oceans beauty in the houses’ colorful frames. Weekend Summer Festivals celebrate the reconstruction of the city and continue to give Napier an elegant and graceful atmosphere where the Art Deco buildings are more than just a history to be remembered but are a present to be celebrated. Music echoes through the streets. Performers dancing and sing along the sidewalks. The grass sways in the breeze. Waves crash along the shore. People make lovely picnics and vintage style frivolity keeps a fun filled past alive. Surrounded by the luscious tastes of Hawkes Bay vineyards, venture beyond the colorful streets of the city and enhance the ambiance with a taste of Trinity Hill’s Chardonnay. With citrus, white flowers, and stone fruit on the nose, the lovely aromas are complemented by a creamy rich texture and is an incredible way to bid farewell to the day."

The city sprawls out from under any view and offers great sightseeing within its confines as well. For a fabulous panorama of the city and the waterway that curbs its edges, enjoy a ride on the cable car up to the Kelburn Gardens. The cable car travels through some of the tallest buildings in Wellington before making the steep climb to Kelburn, one of the area’s suburbs. The city glows in the reflection of the sun off of the bay. Once in the gardens the smell of tulips fills the air. The bright red, purple, and orange flowers patch the entrance. Lily pads float along the pond’s surface, the white petals open and glistening on the water. Branches hang over the walkways and offer shade in the warm sunlight. Manicured shrubberies climb walls making designs. Visit the gazebo at the edge of the pond. The water is still in the afternoon light. Ducks quack on the shore ready to swim among the lily pads. Eventually you will make your way back to the city center, down the cable car, and away from the gardens."

You will touch down at one of the Hunter Valley’s most opulent wineries, where the tasting room and restaurant give off an air of old-world France. Lunch will be an extravagant affair: four courses that are paired with wine and a sublime view across this striking region. After obligatory coffee and chocolate, you can return to the wine. Your accommodation will be located on a vineyard, and the winemaker will lead you through the farm’s production. If you particularly enjoy a wine, he will probably ask for an older vintage to be uncorked, so you can get a vertical tasting that covers nearly 20 years. It will be the insight and conversation that really makes this experience, and you will learn about traditional European styles that have made the Hunter Valley Australia’s most famed wine region. In particular, the discussion about Syrah versus Shiraz is a very interesting one, and you will come to understand and taste the contrasts."

He will offer excellent advice on the current wines that you can put away for at least a decade. Food and wine pairings will make for a degustation style experience at another farm, improving your knowledge of local cheese in the process. This will lead nicely into a light lunch with a wine tasting at the next farm. Then, for the remainder of the afternoon, you can relax at a winery that is usually closed to the public. The winemaker or cellar master will be your guide here, and it will not be just about the wines that you can drink or the knowledge that you can gain, but about enjoying a laid-back and informal afternoon with one of the figures that helped shape Hunter Valley wine.

Melbourne is Australia’s big foodie city, and it reflects an enormous variation in style. In a city with so many outstanding restaurants, it can be agonizing to only dine at a few. The degustation walk connects the city’s gastronomic diversity, and you will get to sample the creations of nine different chefs. It is also a journey through two charming little neighborhoods, and the actual walking will help preserve your appetite because there is a lot of food to eat. At each restaurant, you will have a flight of wine and a small dish with the journey taking you from appetizers to seafood and from game meats to desserts. At some venues, you can dine standing up at the bar, and at others, you will be on the terrace. However, with some, the chef will come out to explain the food."

This is the most picturesque of the wine regions, and here, wine tasting is always done with a view. You have to start with bubbles because this is the country’s premier producer of sparkling wine. It is not Champagne as it is not from Champagne, France, but you may be astonished at how they produce a similarly rich, nutty taste. The day will be long and indulgent as you visit four separate wineries, two of which are typically closed to the public. Lunch will be another old-world affair, but this time with less game meat than in the Hunter Valley. Throughout the day, you can taste how terroir dictates so much here, especially by comparing farms on either end of the valley. Again, there will be a focus on having local experts to lead your tasting. So, rather than just sampling a few wines, you can learn the story behind how each one has been cultivated."

You will sip on sparkling wine with your toes dipped into the ocean, pick mussels straight from a trawler, taste directly from the barrel, and have a picnic amid the vines.

One cooler will be stuffed with local wine and beers, and another ice box will begin to fill with fresh seafood. While the shellfish is predictable, any larger fish will be a bonus. You will disembark at a small cove, where an impromptu kitchen will be set up on the sand. Your chef will provide a cooking demonstration, and it will be fun to get involved, especially in the preparation of sashimi and dressings. You will then dine in the deserted surroundings, which is a seafood experience that can trump anything that is possible in a city restaurant. It is not just about the freshness, but about the memorable variety. It is also great to watch the chef at work, admiring the creativity that they put into all of their dishes based on what has been caught.

A mystical ambiance drifts out of the cave mouth lingering above the azure pool of water reflecting the Grand Arch. You make your way into the first grotto. The cool temperature surrounds you and keeps the limestone walls cold even in the summer heat. You rub your fingers along the smooth edges of the cave beneath the dipping stalactites. Stalagmites rise out of the ground like columns. The perfect acoustics make each footstep echo across the gallery.

Serene koalas offer the ultimate photo opportunity, the cute fluffy animals playful with lucid eyes and mischievous smiles. Stand next to one, wait for their head to turn, and capture the moment. Rather than return to the city center by road, board a local boat and cruise back on the unruffled river water."

Thousands of individual reefs burst with color, their vibrant facades home to an ethereal assortment of tropical delights. You don’t visit the Great Barrier Reef merely hoping to glimpse marine life; one look under the water and you’re surrounded by the planet’s greatest natural aquarium. Today’s excursion is perfect for families. Cruise out to an outer lying reef, where a floating pontoon is your base for the next four hours. Underwater viewing windows give a glimpse at the marine delights and a submersible craft tours different parts of the reef. Trained lifeguards watch over a designated snorkeling area and are always on hand to assist. Buoyancy equipment is also available. This means that the children can snorkel and explore the untamed marine world, yet still be within five to ten meters of the pontoon. Turtles languidly swim past, bewildering colored fish swarm in shoals, and huge groupers are unperturbed by snorkels. Back on the pontoon, a delectable buffet lunch awaits. Trained marine biologists are also available to answer any questions you might have regarding the stunning marine life. It’s a 90-minute cruise back to the mainland, and the children almost certainly sleeping on the ride back as they slumber from happy exhaustion."

Marked nature trails head deep into this mystical realm, bird song always accompanying the journey through a myriad of green colors. It’s around 90 minutes actual driving time to reach Daintree, although the journey is certain to last longer with all the sublime places to stop en route."

Wander through the rainforest with an Aboriginal guide, the unique uses of each plant revealed. Pay attention, because you’ll be retelling the story later. So which green bug do you eat to cure a cold? And what was the significance of dancing around the fire three times? After a locally caught lunch, visit a deaf Aboriginal artist. He’ll explain the historical meanings behind the traditional artwork, and then it’s up to you to paint a story using the three distinct paints and bamboo stick paintbrush. Both guides are exceptional with children and really evoke the ancient lifestyles, enabling the whole family to garner a new perspective on an evocative culture."

Pick up the rental vehicle keys and meander into a landscape of rolling green hills, curiously shaped mounds, charming cottages, and cozy cafes. Rotorua is the heartbeat of Maori culture and what better way to be welcomed than a traditional greeting from a local tribe? Trumpets call out, Maori warriors perform the Haka, ancient stories are retold through song and dance, and this cultural evening is a great way to immerse the children in a very distinctive culture. Rotorua isn’t just about Maoris. Hissing beneath the surface is volcanic activity, the earth’s crust being pierced by incredible geysers. Gaze across the red-tinged rock, and all looks normal. Then bang! The geyser explodes and water spirals 40 feet into the air. Mud pools and floating mist continue the unique look at New Zealand’s geology. Your afternoon and evening visit to Tu Puia combines a memorable cultural experience with an almost baffling dose of natural wonder."

After the direct flight to Uluru, spend the afternoon along the base of the world's biggest monolith to admire the Aboriginal rock art and narratives that are etched into the walls. As the sun fades, the view is incredible as you stand beneath a small cluster of scorched trees to face the great wall of Uluru (Ayer's Rock). As the sun dips it paints the rock, transforming it from rusty red to glowing crimson, then through a kaleidoscope of oranges before nighttime arrives. Almost immediately, the stars appear.

You make your way to the first vineyard opened on the island, which was established in the 1970s to pioneer the island vintners. The vineyard encompasses 30 acres spread across native brush and decorated with rolling vines in view of the waters at Putiki Bay. You can hear the gentle waves lapping against the rocks below. After touring the winery to see the sustainable operations, you sit at an outdoor table with a selection of the wines grown on the estate, eager to taste how the mixture of inland soil and sea breeze affect the grapes. The Chardonnay carries hints of tropical fruit rounded out with buttery oak."

A memorial dedicated to the Maori people overlooks the city. Your private transfer meets you at the hotel after breakfast and escorts you to Auckland Airport for your brief flight to Rotorua, the cultural capital of New Zealand, filled with steaming geysers and Maori tradition. A layer of mist drifts across the lake due to the volcanic activity heating the waters, from hot springs to mud pools. Your private transfer leads you to your luxurious hotel at the heart of town before escorting you to the gates of Te Puia, the thermal reserve south of the city. The 500 springs bubble with heated water and steam out of the landscape. The most notable geyser is Pohutu, which erupts up to 20 times daily. The water bursts out of the conical peak up to nearly 100 feet in the air. The nearby Prince of Wales’s Feathers geyser bubbles and gurgles before every Pohutu eruption, almost like an opening act to the major show. The heated mud pools were once used for cooking, with Maori women wrapping fish or vegetables in flax before dipping the ingredients into the water to boil. You can’t help but be fascinated with the purapura whetu , which means “stardust.” The clusters of mud pools swirl like an impressionist painting of the night sky, creating a virtual milky way in the black sulfurous texture of the soil. In the evening, you enjoy a cultural performance to view the evolution of Maori culture since before European arrival to contemporary times, listening to the thrilling calls of the Haka , the war dance for which the Maori are famous."

You don flippers and a snorkel before jumping into the deep water of the reef. The warm temperature is inviting. You float with the gentle current. Beneath the ocean surface moves a fragile ecosystem glowing with rainbow hues and exuberant life. Sea anemones shine yellow and purple against the sapphire water.

Deep ravines encompass 87 miles of hiking trails, countless waterfalls, and fascinating wildlife including koalas, kangaroos, and yellow-bellied gliders. You will arrive at the Three Sisters, one of the most famous features of the national park. The three sandstone pillars were carved out of the cliffs by wind, rivers, and rain at more than 2,952 feet above the Jamison Valley floor. In the morning the majestic mist spreads across the trees in the valley for an eloquently beautiful image. A trail of more than 800 steps leads in the basin to create the Giant Stairway. Upon reaching Govetts Leap Lookout, you will see the dramatic steepness of the sandstone cliffs as the wisps of Bridal Veil Falls trundle over the 590-foot ledge."

        "description": "Coffee lovers will relish the morning air in Sydney as they find a revelation in the boutique coffee houses that serve unforgettable flat whites. The typical Australian drink consists of coffee made with espresso and hot, steamed, non-frothed milk to give it a different flavor and texture than a cappuccino. After breakfast, your private transfer will escort you to Sydney Airport for your flight to the Red Center at Uluru, also known as Ayers Rock. The hot, desert climate consists mainly of dry orange and red hues beneath a bright blue sky. Enjoy the casual comforts of your luxury accommodations in the heart of the Red Center within Australia’s Northern Territory. The hotel has a mixture of urban and Aboriginal themes with a view to the remarkable monolith of Uluru that rises over the flat horizon like a crown. From the distance, the giant rock has an impressive allure, which only grows as you travel closer for an afternoon tour. Uluru is over two miles long and nearly 1,142 feet tall. It strikes an impressive and dramatic posture amid the absence of shape on the surrounding landscape. The monolith retains significant meaning to the Anangu Nation, who continues to use certain areas for ceremonies as they take their title as the traditional custodians of the land seriously. The ochre color in the afternoon turns a dark shadow before the sun begins setting. The shifting light turns to a burnt orange then deep reds before an eventual charcoal color. Acclaimed artist Bruce Munro has erected an inspiring installation known as the “Field of Light.” The artwork glows to life under the night sky as it interacts with the unadulterated starlight above. The installation turns the desert scenery into a field that glows with 50,000 spindles as their stems sway in the cool night air to cast deep violet, blue, and white waves of light."

You watch as the process from the night before repeats itself in reverse order with charcoal shadows turning to red and then orange textured walls. The scent of a full Australian breakfast of bacon, egg rolls, tea, and homemade golden syrup, made from refining sugar cane, fills the air. Your guide points to the newly visible animal tracks made by dingoes, marsupial moles, and rufous hare-wallabies. In the gentle morning light, Uluru resembles a cathedral more than a monolith, which signifies its importance once more to the Anangu people. The afternoon will be at your leisure to relax at the hotel or consider taking a camel ride into the desert for a different view of the expansive landscape. In the evening you will attend the Sounds of Silence Dinner. Beneath the storied desert sky, the air fills with the aromas of roast pumpkin, lemon myrtle, and wild lime. Tables are set up in the open to offer views of Uluru at one angle and the rounded domes of Kata Tjuta to another angle. You delight in the abundant flavors of Australian delicacies, such as barramundi and emu, as the sun sets over the remarkable landscape once again to reveal the colors of the Red Center and the fantastic starlight. A resident astronomer advises you on the visible constellations, including the Southern Cross, while the sounds of the didgeridoo carry across the desert."

The walls of the canyon reach 328 feet above the crevices lined with palm trees. You reach the top of the walls for an exceptional view of the greater Watarrka National Park along the canyon’s rim. Your guide will lead you around the pathway that circles the canyon in a nearly four-mile circuit. Dingoes, red kangaroos, and feral camels populate the landscape, as well as wild horses known as brumbies. The ancient rocky scenery hides the natural oasis known as the Garden of Eden, which grows on the promontory of Kings Canyon. The waterhole attracts abundant life in the form of verdant plants contrasting the rugged orange rocks. Locals and visitors do not swim in the watering hole, which is considered sacred due to the hundreds of species who rely on the water source for satiation."

You arrive at your spacious, luxury hotel in the charming town of Port Douglas located approximately an hour north of Cairns. The remainder of the day will be at your leisure to indulge in the beauty of Port Douglas and the surrounding serene ambiance. The former fishing village has grown into an elegant upmarket town that contrasts the hectic crowds of Cairns, while still offering easy access to the Great Barrier Reef and the famous Daintree Rainforest.

Leap into the water with your snorkel equipment and notice the warm temperature and saline quality that makes you feel extra buoyant. The reef glows with vibrant colors, which emanate from the coral and the schools of fish. You can’t help but notice the butterflyfish and the white, black, yellow, silver, and orange colors streaking its scales.

Daily activities help you learn about life out here, from foraging for food to throwing boomerangs, plus making paint and painting from the dusty, ochre ground.

Hundreds of small fish species swim past your mask while a small ray or reef shark might glide past. After a 90-minute boat journey, you will be at Hardy Reef to spend four hours at a pontoon above the coral. The pontoon is a dry space to drink and dine in between different underwater activities. Snorkeling is superb, both guided and unguided, with lifeguards watching over the snorkeling area. A semi-submersible showcases the marine world without you needing to get wet. The pontoon’s underwater chambers feel like being in an aquarium, except all this is wild, not captive. And after all the adventure the kids should be fast asleep as you cruise back to Hamilton Island and your final night in Australia."

Wander along the mosaic tiles and beneath the shimmering sunlight cast through domes of the Queen Victoria Building before reaching Bondi Beach. The golden sand is warm beneath your toes. Cliffs frame the edges of the shallow bay. An elevated pool connected to the Icebergs Swimming Club stands along the rocky edges, above the splashing waves. The briny aroma of the sea air blends with the enticing scent of fresh fish and chips emanating from the seaside cafes. You meet your private instructor on the hot sand, keen on beginning your private family surf lesson. Your instructor has each member of the family lay on individual foam longboards. You practice popping up from a laying position, trying to perfect landing on your feet at the same time. The kids seem to master the motion easily. You venture out into the water with your instructor leading the kids first over the soft waves. The larger waves break near the mouth of the bay. You stay in the gentler waters and practice catching the wake. The water is cool and refreshing beneath the hot sun. Looking back at the shoreline, you can see the sunbathers basking across the golden sand. The kids pop-up onto their board as the small wave breaks behind them, propelling them closer to the shore as they ride their first swell."

After breakfast, the family ventures into the Blue Mountains National Park, which encompasses nearly 90 miles of walking trails and heritage tracks spread through sandstone plateaus, waterfalls, ravines, and lush eucalyptus forests. In the passing light, the natural oils of the eucalyptus trees cast a blue hue above the canopy, accounting for the unique name of the national park. The stunning scenery incorporates small towns amidst the breathtaking sandstone pillars known as the Three Sisters. The formations rise more than 2,950 feet above the Jamison Valley below. The kids listen to the bewitching legend of the peaks, once attributed to the local Aboriginal community, stating that a tribal elder turned the sisters into stone for their own protection. The Giant Stairway connects the undulating peaks to the forest floor over the course of 800 steps. You continue to Featherdale Wildlife Park for an immersive interactive experience with the animals for which Australia is known. The park sits on seven acres of natural bush and boasts the world’s largest collection of wildlife native to Australia. Crocodiles lounge in the cool waters and ghost bats hide in the darkness of the tree canopy. Sheep graze in the farmyard nursery and Tasmanian devils sleep amongst the rocks. The kids are excited to meet with the koalas, watching the marsupials laze in the trees and occasionally snack on eucalyptus. They sleep for up to 20 hours a day and have five digits on their hands."

Upon your arrival at the airstrip, your private transfer escorts you to a remarkable hotel in view of the famous desert monolith, Uluru. Shady tarps decorate the hotel walkways and poolside, resembling the very sails you left behind in Sydney. The scent of baked clay emanates from the hot soil beneath the desert sand. Take the time to visit the Wintjiri Arts and Museum to view the fabulous display celebrating the spiritual heart of the country. A majestic ambiance emanates from the mystical borders of the rock face. The museum displays works of local artists exhibited in the language of Anangu, the Aboriginal community of the region, allowing visitors deeper insight into the connection of the land and ritual associated with Uluru.

Your guide points to the Southern Cross, a consolation visible only in the southern hemisphere. The family mounts a selection of camels connected to a camel train passing by Uluru. Merchants brought camels to the Red Centre in the 19th century to help traverse the desert sands. The region now has a large population of wild camels traveling in packs and grazing on the shrubbery. The kids cheer at the movement of the camel, swaying back and forth before becoming familiar with the unique motion. The sun begins to rise over the eastern horizon, spreading across the landscape and shifting the silhouette of Uluru into an iridescent orange. The monolith reaches a height of more than 2,800 feet above sea level, rising nearly 1,150 feet above the desert floor. The family listens with intent to the stories of Dreamtime as you watch the colors transform from dark shadows to lively reds and oranges. Later in the day, you return to the edges of Uluru for a walking tour around its base. Caves and plateaus are off limits to visitors, withholding secrets of rituals and ceremonies practiced by the Anangu. Your guide points to a painting hidden by an overhanging ridge, inscribed with symbols similar to those you saw in the works hanging in the Wintjiri Arts and Museum; only the rock art is centuries older."

After the meal, the family has a private transfer to the airstrip for your flight east to Cairns. The red glint and orange sandstone of the vast desert fade and the verdant trees of the Daintree Rainforest spread across the undulating summits of the Great Dividing Range. The mountains separate the Australian Outback from the white-sand shores of the eastern seaboard. As the plane descends into Cairns Airport, you point out the layers of blue glistening on the ocean, watching the indigo near the beach shift to sapphire and cobalt nearer to the horizon.

You board a riverboat and take to the water. A gentle breeze rustles the bordering leaves. The sunlight pierces the treetops in distinctive beams. Your guide points to a low-lying tree to which a tree-kangaroo clings. The marsupial has adapted to the forest grounds with broader hind feet and longer curved nails to help climb bark. The kids look beyond the boat with keen interest and a dash of fear, scouring the water and shallow shoreline for hiding crocodiles. Your guide points to what you thought was a log floating in the water. The crocodile’s eyes become visible, with hints of yellow peeking above the surface of the lagoon. Crocodiles in the region grow to more than 16 feet and build nests amidst the trees. The crocodile lunges away from the boat, sinking back into the water with a quick swish of its powerful tail."

The biodiversity shines with rainbow colors beneath crystal clear turquoise and sapphire waters. The sunlight pierces the surface of the Coral Sea to a depth of 200 feet, allowing for clear vision and a bright expanse. The seaside aroma grows softer out at sea. The glint of white sand fades behind the western horizon. An onboard marine biologist helps explains to the family the extraordinary characteristics of the reef, including its ancient age of approximately 20 million years old. The boat stops at the edge of a large reef body. The hard coral twists upwards from the seafloor, draped in neon orange and yellow beside flat coral resembling lark mollusks. A bed of sea grass grows from the sandy bed. Once in the water, the family snorkels above the coral, finding the light spreading across remote niches from which moray eels peek out with their heads. You point the kids to the sea grass where a loggerhead turtle nibbles on the foliage. The grass tickles at the turtle’s underbelly.

The roses of the Royal Botanic Garden add layers of rouge to the green leaves, and you will notice that the briny aroma of the sea is stronger here as you rise upwards from Sydney’s waters than it was in the shallow Pacific of northern Queensland. The distinctive turret of Sydney Tower stands more than 1,000 feet above the streets with a golden spire. Bold visitors walk along the outer rim to view the glass floor, offering a sightline of the city streets, the surrounding suburbs, and the glistening harbor. After returning to the shore, you can share in a thrilling adventure with a Bridge Climb. Locals lovingly refer to the structure as “The Coathanger” as the ironwork arches over the water to connect to the central business neighborhood of the northern shores. Your guide will fit you both for protective coats and then will strap you to a protective rail that spans the aerial walkway. The sea breeze will blow through your hair as you follow your guide along the platform. The steel is cold and grainy as you pass your fingers over the structure as you walk past. Your breathtaking view is unique at nearly 440 feet above the sea, where you can watch the ripples in the water, the sails of the opera house, and the skyline of downtown."

Locals linger to sip espresso and savor in the fresh flavors of the poached salmon served over toast with crème fraiche. After breakfast, your guide will lead you outside of the city and into the hills of the Blue Mountains, a national park that highlights chiseled sandstone, sunken valleys, and captivating waterfalls in the blue haze that emanates from the eucalyptus trees. The foothills begin 40 miles outside of Sydney, which quickly rises to sandstone plateaus at more than 3,600 feet above sea level. Panoramic views open up to the lush trees that carpet the valleys of eroded sandstone, most notably at Echo Point. The trees open to a view of the collective karsts of Three Sisters. You will continue to Wentworth Falls for a romantic view of the dramatic cascade that plunges nearly 1,000 feet into the Valley of the Waters. The aroma of eucalyptus fills the air as a veil of emerald spreads through the canopy above the guided walkway. The pair of you can wander along the forested path and enjoy the company you crave during an unforgettable excursion that you will always share."

Tropical waters stretch out from the golden beach, a thick and beautiful rainforest backdrops the town, and palms sway gently, reflecting the laid-back pace of life here. Today, you will land in Cairns, which is the gateway to Queensland and Australia’s tropical Northeastern coast. Cairns itself has become a little rowdy, plus there is not actually a beach in the town. You will take a one-hour transfer up the coast to Port Douglas, which is a more favorable destination for seniors and a lovely place to ease into an Australian vacation. The afternoon will be at your leisure, and there are some excellent cafes and terraces along the beach for you to try.

Across this giant island, there were once over 500 tribes, each with their own land and specialism. They all lived off of the land and traded with their neighbors. This morning, you will explore the Daintree Rainforest, which is home to the ancient Kuku Yalanji people. With an Aboriginal guide, you will travel on a short walk through the forest to learn about the use of all the different plants. You can rub together certain leaves and make soap. There are plants for making rope, shelter, and medicine. There are also plants that you can eat although you will probably choose against snacking on the live bugs. As part of this short walk, you will stop to ask safe passage from the rainforest spirits and later thank them for the journey. After lunch, you will then meet with Aboriginals from two other tribes. One will be from the neighboring coastal tribe and will explain how they harvest the ocean and then trade rock crab and shells with flora and fauna from the interior. The other will be from the opposite side of Australia and will be your guide to Aboriginal art. Instead of words, these indigenous people have traditionally recorded history through paintings. Only three colors are used to produce complex canvases of dots and lines. With a bamboo paintbrush, you can have a go while discussing history and change with the artist."

Hundreds of different fish species swarm around the reefs, and by staying, you can listen to the guide and find out what these species are.

        "description": "If you are an early riser, then Port Douglas is a wonderful place to be. Aromas blend together on the coastal promenade such as coffee from the many beachside cafes and the Pacific’s soft, salty breeze. Early morning is an excellent time to stroll as you can watch the sun make its slow and vibrant rise out of the ocean. If you do not rise early, then do not worry because the town will have already worked its charms for the last three days. Later this morning, you will travel to Cairns by private transfer for a flight to Alice Springs where you will down, and everything will be different. The tropical colors will be gone and replaced by the evocative red tones of outback Australia. Alice Springs is an iconic outpost and a frontier town that is literally in the middle of nowhere. It is arid and dusty with somewhat of a Wild West feel about it. You can sense the history, especially down the main street of local pubs and establishments. This is not the nicest place to linger, so after a short tour of the town, you will head to a small desert lodge outside of Alice Springs. You will check-in to into the lodge and spend this evening around a campfire and beneath the stars. Dinner will be a lavish barbecue, which is an opportunity for you to try various, local game meats such as kangaroo. After dinner, you will be guided around the night sky by an astronomer. The first part of this experience will be to understand and recognize some of the constellations. Then, you can move into the rare and wonderful sights that only grace the sky for a brief time each year or even only every few years. Alice Springs is thousands of miles from any other city, and the light pollution here is virtually non-existent. So, the Southern sky shines, and you do not need perfect eyesight to take it all in."

It really requires a few days to start understanding how this desert holds secrets. Today, you will travel south from Alice Springs towards Kings Canyon. It will be a sublime journey through iconic Australian desert that will usually feature the odd mob of red kangaroos. You can stop en route to see the 12 craters that were created by a meteor some 4,700 years ago. Then, you will have lunch with a view of this strange spectacle. When arriving at Kings Canyon, you can take a short walk along the creek bed to see and understand how this place is so unique. Here, there are giant, red gum trees that sprout from beside a dried-up riverbed. A murky billabong provides life for hundreds of birds, and dazzling rock formations change color with the moving sun, going from ochre to blood red to shadow. Tonight’s desert lodge is even more remote, and the stars even more resplendent. Once again, you can be comfortable and even have the same amount of luxury as what you could have in a modern city, except the setting is entirely different. With these three desert days, you will have modern comfort in a sublime wilderness setting with the impressions of silence and solitude being likely to make sure that you feel humbled by Mother Nature."

The entire walk is almost four miles around, but it will be impressive just to cover a few hundred meters. Traveling onwards to Uluru, you will make a stop at a family-owned farm for a barbecue lunch to learn about life as a resident in this wilderness. After lunch, Uluru will be your compass point, which is the world’s largest monolith, guiding you onwards through the red, dusty desert. This is the land of the Anangu people. A short walk along some of Uluru’s base will help you understand this Aboriginal tribe and the messages that they have painted onto the famous rock. Again, you do not need to walk very far to experience the magic of the surroundings. For sunset, you will drive back a little to a hidden spot that faces Uluru. The famous sunset will be accompanied by sparkling wine and nibbles, which will prove a perfect way to end your third day in the outback."

Later this morning, you will fly to Sydney. Add the flight to the time zone change, and it will be late afternoon by the time you arrive. After your airport transfer, you will have a little time to refresh at your luxurious accommodation before enjoying the best way to discover Sydney. So much of this city lines the Parramatta River, including most of the famous sights and structures. You will set off from Darling Harbour and cruise beneath Sydney Harbour Bridge, which is an iconic steel arch that connects two sides of the city. The Sydney Opera House reflects the time of day because the fading sun bounces off its white sails. By cruising east, you can watch the sunset as it reclines over the city before your dinner is served upon the deck. Live music will be played, and you will travel slowly back into the city, seeing the same riverside sights.

The sand glows a vibrant red from oxidization that stretches across the depths of the valley. Experience the majesty of the Mutitjulu Waterhole where the orange sandstone surrounds the water and glistens like pastels in the sunlight. The scent of fresh water and barren earth fills the air. The water gently trickles from the earth offering life to the arid region. When the rains come the water careens down the smooth sandy stones and drips into the waterhole, making the rounded rocks look as if they are melting into the earth. Your day continues with a visit the Uluru-Kata Tjuta Cultural Center where the legends of the region and the famous monolith are kept. The thatched roofed buildings sit beneath the hot sun surrounded by the red sand and desert brush. Uluru stands tall in the distance, the largest monolith in the Southern Hemisphere, glowing in the daylight. Enter the center and feel the deep hum of the didgeridoo echo around the room. The bright colors of the Rainbow Serpent slither around the room offering the creation myth of the serpent and the legend of Dream Time. The Cultural Center is operated by the local Aboriginal tribe in conjunction with the Australian Government to help ensure the lasting legacy of the people, the place, and its majesty. The sunset over Uluru brings with it a delicious glass of wine that will offer a taste of the colors of the setting sun wrapped up in the rich purple of the glass.

Follow your guide along the trails that will take you within, over, and through the giant desert boulders. Wander deep into caves where water trickles and remains from past rains, the scent of damp limestone filling the cavern. From atop Kata Tjuta you can watch the dry green stretch over the red sands along the Valley of the Winds. Sit beneath the shade and listen to the legends of the valley and the boulders, hearing the timber in your guide’s voice as they explain the origins of the Red Centre the way it has been shared for millennia, through the oratory of passing stories.

The waters linger in the wet season and offer vibrant life to the indigenous people and the animals that have called the continent home for millions of years. Follow your guide around the waterways, through the billowing grass, and to Nourlangie Rock where Aboriginal rock art almost jumps from the limestone out into the world. The rock is an outlying formation on the banks of a billabong. The art exemplifies the people, culture, and animals of the region through time and, at times, looking like geometric configurations created by modern artists. The air is perfumed with the mint of eucalyptus and dried brush. The mountains glow in the pink sky. Your day continues with a cruise through the Yellow Water Billabong to witness the dangerous beauty of the saltwater crocodiles and the expansive majesty of the bird life in the area. Lily pads spread across the water. The warm water of the billabong purely reflects the riverbanks as you drift through. Pelicans stand on tree roots, spreading their wings to dry in the afternoon sun. Egrets dip their heads beneath the water and dig for tiny fish or bugs. Crocodiles sit along the shore and warm themselves in the sun. The closer you come the wider their mouths open to signify their territorial nature, ready to defend their area if need be.

After a 90-minute flight, you will touch down to bubbles with a bottle of sparkling wine to accompany your brunch. For the rest of today, you will go behind the scenes of the Hunter Valley wineries, enjoying experiences that are only afforded to very few visitors. You can sample wines directly from the barrel, taste past vintages with a winemaker or cellar master, and enjoy a private tour of a vineyard. This will be an indulgent day, so it is good to have a place of privacy this evening."

        "description": "Sydney is a splendid city and will provide a change of pace today. It is good to start in the Hunter Valley as this quieter destination helps you settle into the Australian rhythm and atmosphere. It should slow you down a little and help you unwind rather than traveling straight from the chaos that is home to Australia’s liveliest city: Sydney. After a private transfer back to Sydney, your local guide will tailor a tour to your interests today. This can include famous sights such as the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Sydney Opera House, Darling Harbour, and Bondi Beach. It could take you off the beaten track in local neighborhoods or focus on the city’s historical precincts. There will be plenty of time to discuss the options on the drive to Sydney, and today day will allow you to explore the Sydney of your own imagination."

These iconic animals can provide an extra little treat as you set off on today’s tour of the Yarra Valley. Your guide will know of a couple of places where the marsupials are regularly spotted, including a grassland where a large kangaroo mob grazes most mornings. These will be very wild and unpredictable sightings, and they can be complemented by a visit to Healesville Wildlife Sanctuary, which is where other animals such as wallabies enhance the wildlife experience. The Yarra Valley is a cool-climate wine region, and it produces superb Chardonnay and Pinot noir as well as wines that are produced in the Champagne style.

The remaining stone walls rise out of the tall tufts of grass in view of the sapphire water and textured mountain ridges. After breakfast, you will board a luxury catamaran and make your way off the island for a day spent along the Outer Reef, a stunning portion of the Great Barrier Reef that edges the open Pacific Ocean. The shallow waters are graced with pockets of coral silhouettes that fade to deeper, cobalt waters. You will have learned at the research center that the Great Barrier Reef encompasses nearly 133,000 square miles and stretches from Cape York Peninsula in Australia’s north to Bundaberg in the south, and seeing it with your own eyes will be extraordinary. Once in the water, the familiar warmth will embrace you with tiny salt crystals clinging to your shoulders. The coral shines brighter and grows larger without the confines of fringing islands or shallow waters. Elkhorn coral spreads upwards from the seafloor like an acacia tree, reaching a diameter of 12 feet. Blue coral catches the sunlight and glint against the pebbled and sandy floor. Soft carnation coral shimmers with colors and ruffles similar to its namesake flower as parrotfish shine with pastel hues causing the marvelous rainbow colors of the coral to muddle. The parrotfish can grow longer than four feet and have a parrot-like beak used for grasping at algae."

It is an easy city to gain your bearings, and you can walk around as a family, even when a little jet-lagged.

Continue to The Rocks, where brownstone buildings paint a story on Sydney’s earliest history. Then end at Darling Harbour, an expression of modern Sydney. Here you will find a spacious park and dozens of family-friendly restaurants, along with the colorful sculptures of a changing outdoor art gallery. Your privately-guided cycling tour is suitable for all ages and avoids major roads, sticking to protected cycle routes and vehicle-free areas around the promenade. Travel east this afternoon, heading out to Sydney’s famous surf beach. Bondi is backdropped by cafe-clad hills, a broad cove of golden sand lapped by continual barrel waves. It is one of the most famous places in Australia to surf, certainly as a beginner. While locals ride the breaking green waves, beginners can learn in the frothy surf closer to the sand. Lessons are lighthearted and use large foam boards, so almost everyone achieves the experience of standing and riding a wave. After a two-hour surf lesson for the kids, and perhaps the adults, settle in at a cafe and watch the waves, the ocean’s salt still gathered around your faces."

        "description": "An hour outside Sydney and you will be in the bush. Ragged mountain peaks climb above a eucalyptus-clad valley. Gaze across the scene, and a peculiar blue haze fills the air, subtle and surreal as it attaches itself to the mountains. These are the UNESCO World Heritage Blue Mountains, a strange landscape that provides easy family adventures in the Australian bush. The world’s steepest railway takes you down to the valley floor, where wooden boardwalks provide access to the forest, and these are great if you have a child in a stroller. Wandering around, you can encounter inspiringly tall trees and raucous birds. There are many trails, and you can choose one or more based on your energy levels. On this private Blue Mountains trip, you will first hit the forest. Explore by road during the afternoon, visiting Katoomba, Wentworth Falls, and the King’s Tableland. Make a stop at Featherdale Wildlife Park on the way back to Sydney, giving the children some very personal encounters with Australia’s wildlife. The park is home to rescued animals, including kangaroos, wallabies, and tiny koalas, a note to the kids, they are not bears! In New South Wales, you are permitted to hand-feed and touch some of these animals, so Featherdale is a good place for family wildlife photos before more wilder experiences on Kangaroo Island. You will return to Sydney by ferry, such a leisurely journey, and far more enjoyable than the road."

        "description": "Two domestic flights bring you to Kangaroo Island, where wildlife writes the script for the next two days. While indigenous wildlife is becoming increasingly scarce on the mainland, this island in South Australia provides a mostly untouched refuge. Alien species were not introduced en masse, and most of the island is gazetted as either national park or conservation area. After landing on the island, you will check into your hotel along the coast in an area loved by wallabies and koalas. You will see the marsupials hopping around the property, sometimes entire wallaby mobs roaming just ten meters from your suite. There will not be too much time for a wildlife safari this afternoon, so searching for koalas is a great option. It will be like a treasure hunt, scanning the eucalyptus forests for signs of life. Clinging to their branches with sleepy eyes, the koalas barely move more than a few trees each day. They are somniferous creatures, sometimes spotted high in a tree, other times barely two meters from the ground. Watch how their eyes open slowly, soporifically, before their claws grab on and they drift asleep once more. Okay, they are not the most exciting creatures once you actually find them, but the koala treasure hunt is safe and fun for every age."

Great mobs cover grass plains, hopping, and boxing the morning away. Out in Seal Bay Conservation Park, you will be guided by smells, a pungent aroma provided by a vast colony of seals. They bask in the sun as you wander the beach, amazed by how few other people are around. Deep on the island interior, you might see platypus as well, with wallabies providing the beachside enchantment when you return to your hotel."

Spending tonight in Adelaide is essential due to the flight schedule. It is an extremely relaxed city along the coast, famous for its beaches and laid-back atmosphere. Your hotel is on the beach, and you can spend the rest of the day on the sand, dipping your toes in cool ocean waters, perhaps throwing a rugby ball in the shallows. Adelaide feels more like a village than a city, and you can take a comfortable family stroll in the center, admiring the late 19th-century architecture that has survived."

Great broad-leaved trees create shade on the beach as the waves lap gently and the warm waters are usually safe for children to swim in. Port Douglas is quieter and more family orientated compared to Cairns, a larger town that is firmly fixed on the backpacker trail. Plus, it has nicer restaurants and a much better beach. After a private airport transfer, you will check into your waterfront apartment that is within a rainforest nature reserve. There will be a large elevated terrace overlooking the ocean, and lots of space for the kids to run around."

        "description": "In a four-wheel-drive vehicle you will bump up the coastline, crossing epic tree roots and dusty trails. Saltwater crocodiles sunbathe along the Daintree River on the route, peering at you from a statuesque form. Pacific waves crash onto mangroves while ancient trees mark the sand on seemingly endless beaches. Continue the adventure and ascend to the Cape Tribulation lookout. From here, you can witness the rainforest meeting the Great Barrier Reef, a stirring sight to impress the power of nature. This is a day of raw adventure, and one that reminisces of Crocodile Dundee or any fictional traveler your kids may follow. But while nature writes the script, there is a wonderful cultural lesson to learn as well. Your guide is an Aboriginal, and his tribe call Daintree home. He will show you how to ask the rainforest for safe passage, with a harmonic voice that calls to the trees. Then he shows you around to explore how one plant is for making rope, another for curing fever, others for buildings, medicine, eating, washing. Rub certain leaves with water, and you can make soap. Rub others together, and you have toothpaste. And if any of you are feeling brave, it is possible to harvest a few bugs for a cold lunch, with a proper lunch included later on. It will be a privilege to explore with the rainforest’s gatekeeper, and the full-day tour should create a new appreciation for nature."

        "description": "A grouper swims past, with rainbow colors across its skin, and two reef sharks swim off, darting with impressive precision. A myriad of fish swarm around coral sponges and some have flamboyant stripes as one inflates its yellow body. A school of ribbonfish cruise past as an eel pokes its head from beneath a rock. This is the Great Barrier Reef, a kaleidoscope of marine life and bright colors, a structure so immense it can be seen from space. It is a barrier, a collection of individual reefs that form a chain along Australia’s northeastern coast. Each of these reefs is a little different, and some are in better condition than others. It is well worth the additional travel time required to visit the Outer Barrier Reef, where the reefs are better protected against storms and human impact. Having fewer visitors and boats also adds to the authenticity of the experience. After a 90-minute boat ride, you can spend most of the day around a pontoon above a reef. This provides dry land and food in between your activities. The snorkeling is superb, and there are special zones for less confident or able swimmers. Scuba diving is a possibility, even if you have never done it before, and a semisubmersible craft roams above the reefs as well, so you can enjoy the reefs without getting wet."

You will undoubtedly be jet-lagged from the journey, but there will be a full day to rest and re-energize before the adventure really starts tomorrow. When stretching your legs in Sydney, Circular Quays is always a good destination as Victorian buildings meet modern skyscrapers and the famous bridge. You could easily make a short trip to Bondi for some time on the beach or to enjoy the coastal walk to Coogee.

They narrate a raucous 18th-century city of brownstone buildings that have survived to this day. After The Rocks, today’s walking tour moves forward chronologically, connecting streets of grand Victorian architecture and early 20th-century glamour. Looping back towards the coast you will end at Sydney Opera House, an icon Australia with as much controversy as beauty. Its surrounding area is very lively, and there are many cafes for reenergizing before this afternoon’s bridge climb. Clambering slowly up the steps you can climb the exposed steel arch of Sydney Harbour Bridge. You will be strapped in, but your adrenalin will certainly surge through your veins, especially when you reach the bridge’s zenith. Beneath you lies the Parramatta, blue and peaceful. To the west, you can see open green pastures and the mountains you will visit tomorrow. Look eastwards, and it will be all about the Pacific with a wildness to the open landscape. Readjust your vision and keep climbing, looking across at the skyscrapers now standing high above Circular Quay. The whole bridge climb experience takes three hours and your evening in the city is left free."

Soaring towards the horizon this haze wraps itself onto mountain pinnacles, notably the wind-carved frames of The Three Sisters. Listen to how these mountains received their name before wandering the forest below, feeling the strange atmosphere of this natural UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Blue Mountains is Australian bushland and offers a very easy adventure with short hikes to different viewpoints and many an impressive cliff to photograph. After half a day here, you will return to Sydney via Featherdale Wildlife Park and kangaroos and wallabies will hop past your camera. Koalas occupy the short trees, and this is one of the few places where you can really pose with them. Sydney is a city on the water, and you can only truly appreciate this with a journey along the river. Ride a ferry all the way back into the center, emerging from a narrow channel to meet the main river, and then cruising beneath the bridge you climbed yesterday."

A long promenade takes you past locals, grilling meat on public barbecues, backpackers splashing around swimming pools, and quiet parks for wiling the afternoon away. After two busy days, Cairns impresses the laid-back atmosphere of Queensland and the coast. Your hotel will overlook the ocean, and there are many restaurants within walking distance. When walking to them, you will hear up to a dozen street musicians, from Aboriginals blowing soulful horns to acoustic guitarists from around the world."

        "title": "Cairns – Discovering Aboriginal Heritage on the Coast and in the Forest",
        "description": "In an artist’s gallery, you can sit down and paint. The artist is deaf and communicates through hand signals, impressing the style and meaning behind Aboriginal art. Only three colors are used, and all of these come from the earth. Dots and lines, a precursor to Pollock in one way, make up each painting, suggestive of a story that has been passed down through the generations. While your own painting may not amount to much, it will be an eye-opening experience to learn about the use of art to preserve oral history. Next, head out onto the beach with a member of the local tribe, using spears to hunt for rock crab and other marine creatures. Rather than one Aboriginal culture, Australia is covered by over 250 Aboriginal tribes, each with its own language. Every tribe is a specialist on their land, so those from the coast are very different from those living in the rainforest or interior. Throughout history these tribes traded, sharing resources without ever introducing monetary units. Over a lunch of freshly caught catch and local bushtucker, you can discuss this history in more depth, as well as the challenges facing Aboriginal people today. A final local experience comes in Daintree Rainforest and Mossman Gorge, where the Aboriginal tribe has successfully reclaimed land that was taken by colonialists. An Aboriginal guide will be your gatekeeper, and he will ask the forest for safe passage before showing you what each plant can be used for. There is soap, toothpaste, rope, food, and construction materials when you know where to look. This full-day tour returns to Cairns late in the afternoon and offers a genuine insight into the local culture, away from the typical stereotypes that are often so pervasive."

Looking out, you will soon realize that the reef does not really end, as it is instead a long barrier of individual pieces that blur and morph into each other. This is the Great Barrier Reef, and you will have traveled to an outer reef where the marine splendor is more untouched than those closer to the shore. It will be a 90-minute journey by boat, and you can spend the day on a pontoon for a dry space where you can eat, drink, stay dry, and gaze across the Pacific. Once at the pontoon you can choose activities to suit your interests. Snorkel along the reef, marveling at how the colors unfold, or you can take a helicopter flight above it all, admiring how the barrier stretches on and on. Ride a semisubmersible for personal marine encounters, without you needing to get wet. Or consider scuba diving, with the lack of swell and current making this a good place to do a beginner dive. Visiting the outer reef is a long day tour, but it will be worth spending more time versus visiting reefs closer to Cairns, where human and natural impact has resulted in marine bleaching."

They have never been places where people have lived. Your guides are not Aboriginals, but they will impress the importance of respecting local culture and returning Uluru to its original landowners. One sign at Uluru is particularly poignant: “Is this a place to conquer or a place to connect with?” You will have an awe-inspiring feeling as you wander around the base of Uluru, tracking Aboriginal art and admiring how the monolith rolls on and on and on. Find a quiet little place for sunset with sparkling wine being served as the rock goes through its daily color change. After deepest red and flaming orange, it quickly turns to shadow, the desert turning deathly black all around, and now a new show begins. An astronomer will be your guide, and there is no night sky like this one as you are over a thousand miles from any city. Gaze up at planets, learn the constellations, lose track of the shooting stars, and watch the Milky Way consume the sky. Silence accompanies the stars, and after the tour, there is a wonderful solitude to being so deep in the desert."

Over two dozen domes also dot the desert, the red pinnacles of Kata Tjuta your destination this morning. Watch them emerge from the shadows as you feel the stillness of the desert at dawn, and then wander through the landscape, past a bubbling waterfall as red rocks tower 200 meters above you. Most of Kata Tjuta is off bounds as it is a ceremonial site for the local Aboriginal people, so it is a privilege to be given access to a three-mile canyon that runs through its heart. After an early lunch back at the hotel, you will fly eastward. With the time difference and airport transfer, it will be late afternoon by the time you are settled in Melbourne. Make up your own city impressions on a self-guided stroll through the city as street musicians provide the soundtrack and you will come across dozens of galleries and boutiques, along with artistic little restaurants and narrow houses preserved since Victorian times. While Sydney is the fun-loving city, Melbourne is Australia’s cultural heart, and you will immediately distinguish its difference from where you were a week ago."

        "description": "Kangaroo mobs roam the plains just an hour out of Melbourne. These are wild animals, often two dozen of them hopping around in front of you. They are naturally skittish, so you must approach slowly, creeping forward a few steps then stopping to see if the mob is troubled by your presence. Sometimes they box, a fiery blur of punches before a victor emerges. You may spot a female leaving her scent, tantalizing males who battle to follow her. Interaction is the highlight as this will not be an experience with one animal, but an insight into how a mob lives in the wild. Koalas are cuter, although far less active, clinging to tree branches with sleepy eyes and indecipherable smiles. A tracker will go ahead of you and leave ribbons on the trees, so you can easily find where the koala are located. This half-day wildlife experience is followed by a guided city walking tour, taking in the key Melbourne sights and listening to the city’s history.

Kangaroo Island is wilder than Tasmania, and once more, seafood initially dominates.

Native spices are cultivated with care, along with spices brought from all over the Pacific. Wild olive oil is harvested from gnarled trees, a peppery flavor to its bite. Free-range honey is produced by nomadic beekeepers, who move hives dependent on nectar flow and flowering patterns. The wine is yet to reach its potential, but early signs are good, with the cool climate and slow ripening ideal for certain cultivars.

New hotels will rise above the Parramatta, and restaurant terraces will stretch along the water, indulgent as they beckon you forward with promises of surf n’ turf. There will be energy here, and there are enough people for a couple to easily get lost in the crowds. It is also peaceful, especially when your hotel suite is ten floors above the river and commands glorious views across the city. Today, you will be greeted at the airport and check into a five-star hotel that is symbolic of all of modern Sydney. The rest of the day will be at your leisure."

This was Australia’s most popular and famous luxury car back in the 1960s. Only a handful are kept in pristine condition by enthusiasts, and it is the type of classic car that will make an entire street stop and stare. You will cruise off into The Rocks, where you will bump along the cobbles of the city’s first neighborhood. You will travel out of the city, cruising to Bondi Beach in the restored Holden, which is located next to Bronte and Tamarama. With the smell of fresh eucalyptus in the air, you will return to central Sydney, following the harbor drive where you will find a remote beach with superb panoramic views. Here you will pop the cork, watch the sun go down, and feast in the privacy of hidden Sydney."

Everyone sees this opera house on a tour, but tickets for performances are extremely hard to find.

You will fly 2 ½ hours to an isolated paradise, where you can dance beneath the Milky Way and luxuriate in all the space. You will check into the road less traveled, staying at an exclusive wilderness camp in the middle of nowhere. Here, there is so much space and privacy that it will seem unbelievable after coming from the city. As the day’s heat begins to fade you will visit the big rock, wandering around its base to find Aboriginal paintings and scorched inscriptions. Beneath the shade of gum trees, you will watch Uluru change hue, as sunset brings a spectacular rainbow of red across its face. Back at camp, you will have an uninterrupted view, and your decadent room will be hidden away from all others. The sky will be clear nearly every night, and once you are thousands of miles from the nearest city you can expect a nighttime show like no other. Some people are fortunate enough to see a shooting star a few times in their lifetimes, but out in Australia’s desert, they are spotted every few minutes."

It will be an eerie, silent place that will also be as surreal as it is sublime. You can take a walk into this special Aboriginal place, through Walpa Gorge and towards the sound of trickling water. By 10 am it will be getting hot, and you will be back at the camp, relaxing by the pool and doing whatever you please. There will be some short walks that you can take this afternoon, or you may choose one of the optional activities such as a camel ride, motorcycle trip to Uluru, or perhaps even a helicopter ride above the red desert. Then nighttime comes, and it will feel so special to be beneath the stars, basking in the silence and privacy."

Weaving and winding, you will go past roots used for rope, and leaves that can be turned into toothpaste and soap. Soon, the sound of waves will take over, and you will be at a beach that is only accessible by foot. You can take a hand in hand stroll across the sand before continuing further into the bush. Today’s walking tracks will be private, so the atmosphere will not be interrupted by bus loads of tourists coming to photograph a koala or crocodile. A private bush camp will be set up on a small creek, and the guide will start the barbecue, roasting up a feast as you take a dip in a nearby swimming hole. It will be late-afternoon before you are back at the treehouse and you will have a good understanding of the natural world that goes unseen by most. Many visitors end up taking in the red center and the Great Barrier Reef, while few explore the less famous strips of bush such as Mossman Gorge and Cape Tribulation National Park."

Golden sand will be populated by locals and visitors alike, but while this is not a private beach break, it is easy to be energized by the local atmosphere.

If you can find one, then look up, for these ribbons mark the location of koalas. With sleepy eyes and adorable claws, the marsupials will cling to their eucalyptus, occasionally crawling up or looking out, but usually will just be fixed to their tree. Increasingly endangered, these animals will not be easily spotted in the wild, which is why you will probably need a tour and a tracker. You may spot between two to ten different koalas, some high in the trees and others barely six feet off the ground. As the trees rescind, they meet open plains populated by kangaroo mobs. These marsupials will sit and stare, inspecting you and your partner. Some will hop around you. If they do not hop away, then you can creep closer again until you are magically close to these unique animals. Boxing matches will play out, as kangaroos often partake in fights with one another. These will be wild kangaroos, and just like the koalas, there will be no touching, just a raw connection with Australia’s endemic wildlife. This tour will take around six hours, leaving you back in Melbourne for time on the beach or in the city."

Verdant hills rise out of the waters to shape the suburbs outside of the Central Business District. Your guide leads you to the Sydney Botanic Gardens, which encompass nearly 75 acres. The grounds were established in the early 19th century and decorated with plants collected from overseas and across the continent. Bright white and red roses blossom in the rose garden.

The arcade complex was erected in the late 19th century and retains many of its original adornments, including the mosaic floors and window frames accentuating the mixture of historical styles, such as gothic and Romanesque embellishments. Marble figures stand above the entrances at York and George Street, each representing allegorical figures connected to the city and civilization. After breakfast, your private transfer greets you at the hotel and escorts you to Sydney Airport for your flight north to Cairns. The landscape quickly changes between the states of New South Wales and Queensland. The water shifts from turquoise to indigo. The sands glow white instead of gold. The eucalyptus trees turn to emerald rainforest carpeting the Great Dividing Range, the mountains separating the desert Outback from the tropical shoreline. You land at Cairns Airport, where you continue on a brief scenic flight to your resort island, located nearly 60 miles off the northeast coast. The luxuries of the resort are accentuated by the splendors of tropical paradise spread across 24 beaches with powdery white sand and a national park encompassing more than 2,500 acres. Your private suite overlooks the calm waters of the Coral Sea. You can settle into the remainder of the day in comfort and bask in the luscious aroma of coconut and pineapple emanating from the trees."

Their long tails nearly dip into the water warm water below. At breakfast, you find tropical fruits you have never seen before shining exotic colors against the backdrop of the indigo sea. Rambutan has a rich red outer layer and star fruit resemble stars in both shape and vibrant yellow hues. After the meal, you step aboard the island yacht bound for the outer reaches of Ribbon Reef for a full day snorkeling experience along the Great Barrier Reef. Your guide accompanies you while offering commentary on the aquatic life spreading across nearly 133,000 square miles. In the afternoon, you reach Cod Hole, a site known for the potato cod that roam the reaches of the coral with mighty girth, growing to a length of more than eight feet and weighing upwards of 240 pounds. You don your snorkel and fins before entering the sea. The water is warm and inviting. The salt helps you float easily along the surface as you dip your head below to view the bustling subaquatic life shifting between 16 and 70 feet below the surface. Sea fans wave elegantly with the current, resembling the decoration of a cabaret. Soft coral overtakes the sea floor resembling wavy grass and bush stalks. The hard coral rises above the sandy seafloor like rugged hills gleaming with rainbow colors, from dark purples to bright oranges. A mixture of hard and soft coral resembles a staggering tree beneath which two large Maori wrasse nudge one another. Their pastel blue and green scales stand out amidst the clear water."

Pheasant coucals linger in the underbrush and black flying foxes snack on fresh mango. The day is yours to enjoy the splendors of island living at your preferred pace. Linger on the beach beneath the shade of the soaring coconut palms or return to the water to snorkel around the reef fringing the island’s shore. Trails around the island lead to secluded beaches and a lookout atop a nearly 1,180-foot forested ridge offering views to the entire island. The summit is named for Captain James Cook who first stepped foot on the island in 1770, climbing to the peak to chart a course out to sea. The tropical sunlight pierces the forest canopy. You amble around rocks and roots, listening to sea-eagles call out to one another. Monitor lizards scurry beneath the brush before you reach the peak and bask in the panorama of verdant trees, white sand shoreline, and the indigo sea fading to cobalt blue in the distance."

Visitors and locals rent sandboards to glide down the ridges, with the tallest peak reaching nearly 230 feet above sea level. You arrive at the Remarkable Rocks to continue a day filled with extraordinary natural scenery. The wind and sea have coursed through the cluster of granite boulders to shape the rocky dome arching nearly 250 feet down to the sea.

        "description": "The day is yours to leisurely enjoy the city of Sydney, whether its strolling through the botanical gardens to see Mrs. Macquarie’s Chair, the spot where the governor’s wife would sit to watch the ships roll in from England, or wandering through the Rocks, where people, shops, and history come together. The air is perfumed with fresh fudge and salty pretzels. The sound of laughter and ocean mist mixes together. Shops showcase beachwear, while the antique factory façade blends into the under workings of the Harbour Bridge. What was once a historical spot for the Aborigines in the area became the sight that European settlers first stepped ashore, and the wonders of the area continue to shine today."

        "description": "Today you will make your way to the Sydney Airport and depart for home. You have ventured through the depths of Australia, from the beach to the Red Center, from the south to the north, winding your way into the outback. The Sydney Opera House sparkled. The Great Barrier Reef brimmed with life. Uluru glowed in the sunset. Your journey within the big cities and around the outskirts of the untouched wonders of the country has taken you into the unique highlights of Australia, where nature’s pure beauty leads into human nature’s ingenuity."
