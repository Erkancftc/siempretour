      "title": "Auckland - Decidedly Different",
      "description": "Meet your guide and depart from the beautiful city of Auckland. Begin your adventure through the islands of New Zealand by first making your way through the incredibly lush dairy farmland of the Waikato region. The hills roll in the greenery that seems never ending. Stop at one of the many farms in the area for a fresh cup of coffee and a taste of the local flavor, from New Zealand’s famed hospitality to a delicious, rich cup of coffee topped off with a splash of the local milk. The fresh grass is sweet in the air as you make your way to the Waitomo Caves. Your voice echoes in the emptiness of the damp cavern. The sound of rushing water swirls around you. Float deeper into the darkness where bits of light scatter and hang like glowing icicles from the cave’s ceiling, until the cave’s glow fades, the water pushes you to the nearest opening and you exit the cavern with a taste of wonder and a small hint of the beauty of the North Island. Settle into the “Cultural Capital,” of New Zealand: Rotorua. Once known for being a luxurious resort town, the city still bustles with spas and hot springs but has also grown to encompass a large connection to its Maori roots. Experience the Maori culture first hand. The warriors stand tall and proud in grass skirts, their eyes and tongues bulging out of their heads. Their arms flex as they jump and shout into the air. Once the tribe has calmed down, no longer sensing you as a threat, they greet you with a warm welcome and the promise of a hangi , a traditional Maori style BBQ, with succulent meats and hardy vegetables slow roasted in a deep hole dug for the occasion. The sounds of guitars and chants, rhythmically structured and continuous, move around the air mixing with the luscious smell of roasting food. As the sounds and flavors of the night fade into the ether it will always be a reminder of how unique the North Island is."

      "title": "Rotorua - The Diversity of Wonder",
      "description": "With the day in Rotorua there is an expanse of worlds to see. Visit some of the area’s natural wonders. The incredible Pohutu Geyser is the largest geyser in New Zealand and erupts up to 15 times a day shooting hot water almost 100 feet into the air, giving it its name, \"Big Splash.” The intensity of “Hell's Gate” is apparent in its name. Known for being Rotorua's fiercest geothermal area. The whirlpools boil and the largest hot waterfall in the Southern Hemisphere careens and splashes down. The heat is intense and can be felt from yards away but the steaming water as it hits the air and falls into the pool below is stunning in its disparity, how something so dangerous could be so beautiful. Wandering around Rotorua and its surroundings will bring you to the village of Whakarewarewa, a place known to be a Living Thermal Village. Maori have lived in the area for 700 years. The communal hut is made of wood and stretches long to accommodate many visitors, similar to the long Native American structures of the North Western United States. The entryway is adorned with carved masks of spirits to protect and defend the structure while at the same time blessing those inside. The smell of active hot springs lingers in the warm mist. Whakarewarewa is now filled with Maori Art that is made from the Crafts Institute, an inspiring assurance of Maori art, craft, and culture. The carvings of masks tend to have the same swirls and lines as the Maori themselves, meant to signify pride and affiliation. The eyes bulge, the tongue points, and the smooth swirls that mark the carved faces are a reminder of a cultural history that continues to grow strong."

      "title": "Napier - Decidedly Natural (or Naturally Manmade)",
      "description": "Depart the beautiful cultural and natural wonders of Rotorua and make your way toward Napier, the Art Deco capital of the world. Along the way you will stop at the incredible marvel of Huka Falls. Watch as the opulent blue of the Waikato River rumbles through the narrow chasm causing a thunderous rush at the bottom of the powerful falls. Traveling around the serene and reflective beauty of Lake Taupo you will find your way into the decadently colored seaside village of Napier. Rebuilt in the 1930’s during the height of a depressed global economy, the buildings in central Napier scream with vibrant life, creating a smile on the colorful Victorian homes that are as much decoration as they are comfort. Explore the city and find remnants of a beautiful architectural past that continues strong in the preset, from the friendly county fairs to the classic cars that parade through the city’s streets. The cool sea breeze blows through the town and gives a salty sweetness to the pastel colors that shine."

      "title": "Martinborough - More Than Just A People",
      "description": "The beautiful city of Napier fades from the horizon as you travel through the beautiful vineyards, orchards, and gardens of Hawkes Bay. The lush green of the vineyards stretches along the foothills. The light red of apples speckle the canopy as the orchards extend high and long. The landscape is manicured and expansive as you arrive at the Pukaha Mount Bruce National Wildlife Centre where kiwis are no longer meant as just another name for the locals. Open your eyes to the magnificent display of endangered birds that the center not only house but also attempts to conserve and preserve for future generations, including Manukura, the world’s only white kiwi in captivity. Visit the nocturnal house where Turua , another North Island Brown Kiwi, is on display. The aviaries are inhabited by endangered New Zealand birds being bred to help increase populations by releasing them into the wild. From native island parrots to blue ducks, the majesty of wildlife, especially when endangered, is hard to experience; however, the center will show you some of the natural wonders of New Zealand that often hide from visitors but will be open and active to you."

      "title": "Wellington - The Eclectic Beauty of Living",
      "description": "Make your way from Martinborough to the luxuries and urban culture of Wellington. The bay breeze mixes with the scent of fresh brewed coffee drifting through the streets. The City of Wellington is New Zealand’s capital city and offers the great depths of culture and beauty that all of New Zealand boasts. Cafes line the streets, tables decorate the sidewalk, and steam rises from numerous cups sitting on the street-side tables. The city opens itself up to visitors and locals alike with welcoming food, delicious drinks, and fantastic activities. Visit Te Papa, the National Museum of New Zealand where the history of the nation comes alive, from its connected cultural roots to Polynesia to its settlements by Europeans. Te Papa even explores the successes and setbacks of the local tribe that spanned the Wellington region and the northern tip of the South Island. The soft sounds of tribal chants resound in the lobby. Footsteps echo on the polished floor. Te papa, which stands for “our place,” is able to educate visitors and locals through its connection with the country’s history, whether the proud resurgence of its indigenous people or the not so proud history of displacement. As the sun sets over the bay the museum remains a bright light in the future of New Zealand because of its ability to instruct and progress."

      "title": "Blenheim - A Different Day",
      "description": "Wave goodbye to Wellington and the entirety of the North Island and make your way across Cook Strait by ferry. The stunning ferry ride is considered to be one of the most beautiful in the world. The cool breeze is full of salty mist. The soft sound of lapping water lifts from the strait. Lush hills roll and line the beginning of the journey as you make your way into the open ocean eventually docking and stepping onto the South Island. Be carried away to the beautiful town of Blenheim where you will stop at the Cloudy Bay vineyard to experience their variety of decadent flavors. The Sauvignon Blanc is considered to be the quintessential wine of the Marlborough region, mostly because of Cloudy Bay’s doing. The vineyard looks more like a miniature forest with the silhouettes of mountains lingering along the winery’s edge. Indulge a little and smell the wine’s vibrant aromatics. Taste its layers of pure fruit flavor and delicate structure. Continue your journey to the stunning Hotel d’Urville, recently listed in the New York Times bestseller 1,000 Placed To See Before You Die . The façade resembles a state capital shining and opulent white with pillars adorning its entrance. The lobby smells of rich mahogany and garlic as the aromas from the kitchen glide into the lobby and fill the open space."

      "title": "Kaikoura - A Time For Gold and A Time For Green",
      "description": "Leave behind the golden hills of the Marlborough region for the beautiful scenery of Kaikoura and its stunning coast. The gentle sound of lapping water emanates from the bay. The water is bright blue. The half-moon bay arches toward the colorful foothills of the surrounding mountains. Seals can be heard barking from the rocks, bathing in the warm sun. They snuggle in a large colony and dive into the water for a refreshing dip. When in-season you can take a tour of the bay and watch the seals and the rocks fade into the distance as you make your way from shore to watch the whales migrate. The deep water shines a dark blue in the sunlight. Whale tails lift from the water and smash down. The large mass of a whale suddenly breaches the water, it’s body excitedly large and flying through the air, eventually splashing down and returning to its maritime home, the sea once again returning to its calm sway. Enjoy the seaside luxury of the White Morph hotel where you can enjoy succulent crayfish as the sunset melts behind the horizon."

      "title": "Canterbury - Decidedly Southward Bound",
      "description": "Leaving Kaikoura will take you through the rolling plains of Canterbury. The green prairies of the area stretch along the roadway and to the foothills of the mountains that seem to be ever-present until you eventually reach the foothills of the Southern Alps and the small village of Mt Somers. The mountain peaks peer out from behind one another. Often topped with snow, they shine bright in the light blue sky. The green fields beneath stretch to the opposite horizon. Tonight you can relax and indulge in Stronechrubie's incredible restaurant. The hotel resembles a series of villas set on the vast prairie and surrounded by the mountains. The New Zealand lamb melts in your mouth while the garlic mash is packed with flavor. The desserts change regularly to ensure a one of a kind experience no matter how many times you visit and revisit Stronechrubie."

      "title": "Queenstown - Farther South Further Transformations",
      "description": "The landscape changes considerably after Burkes Pass from cold hills strewn in every direction to the opulent beauty of turquoise lakes and the sweeping vistas of mountain peaks and brilliant brush. Watch the largest peak in New Zealand extend into the sky, known to the Maori as Aoraki (the cloud piercer). The often-snowy peak looks similar to a cloud positioned still and high in the air. Easy hikes can take you partly up the mountainside to visit with the fresh lakes that dot the area; the smell of cool melted snow is refreshing and delicious. The varied undulations of the South Island continue as you traverse the Kawarau Gorge. The river is a pearl green as it rushes through a narrow pass carving deeper into the mountains every year. Follow the rush of the river eventually reaching the gorgeous city of Queenstown situated lovingly between Bob’s Peak and Lake Wakatipu. Known as the “Adventure Capital” of New Zealand, it is far more than just adventure sports that keeps the city buzzing; the local rich flavor of oysters, complete with a zest of citrus, helps bring the day to a delicious and delectable end."

      "title": "Queenstown - The Different Sounds of Milford Sound",
      "description": "Depart from the beauty of a Queenstown morning, the sun glistens off the lake’s calm ripples as you make your way to Milford Sound. Located in Fiordland National Park, Milford Sound is an exceptional site to explore and experience. Winner of the 2008 Travelers’ Choice Destination Awards by TripAdvisor, Milford Sound is quiet and still, surrounded by steep cliffs and dense rainforest. At the pinnacle of Milford Sound is the fascinating Mitre Peak, standing tall behind the surrounding mountains, its sharp peak almost pokes a hole in the surrounding range. The sharp call of White herons can be heard as they glide along the water’s edge. Dolphins swim in the boat’s wake, jumping and playing as you travel the sound. The water is a reflective calm that never seems to be disrupted. The cool air flows and surrounds you. The sweet breeze sweeps across the water. The light splash of dolphins and the rushing crash of waterfalls fill the quiet and you understand the unparalleled beauty of the South Island."

      "title": "Wanaka - Emerald and Gold",
      "description": "Outside of Queenstown, on your way to the stunning town of Wanaka, visit the spectacular Dart River. The water is emerald and crisp. The speedboat tour will take you close to the snow-covered mountains that line the shore of the river and partially feed the water’s incredible color. The trees grow tall and thin like a forest in a fairytale; the grass is a fresh vibrant green. The area was used as he scenery for Middle Earth in the Lord of the Rings movies. A visit to Arrowtown brings the educational adventure of the region’s gold mining history. Arrowtown is a delightful village cushioned beneath the beautiful mountains that surround the Arrow River. Walk along Buckingham Street, a parade of heritage buildings that extends into a tree-lined avenue of cottages once used by the miners. Consistent with the images of an Old Western town set in the mountains, in the autumn the golden leaves paint the village colorful. Learn about the gold dusted history that marks the town and the current proceedings of the village before heading to Wanaka, another city surrounded by the never-ending beauty of mountain peaks that decorate the sky and the city’s panorama."

      "title": "Franz Josef Glacier - The Difference in Glaciers",
      "description": "Travel beside the incredible waters of Lake Hawea and Lake Wanaka. Created by massive glaciers more than ten-millennia ago, Lakes Wanaka and Hawea lie side by side separated by a slice of land around 3,000 feet wide. The waters almost mirror one another in their opal coloring, their pristine reflections of the surrounding mountains and covering sky. To look at it is to wonder how these two glaciers were once joined. The scenery of Te Wahipounamu was shaped by the rocky coasts, incredible fjords, soaring cliffs, and careening waterfalls. When looking down upon the still, emerald lakes it is almost hard to know which is the sky and the mountains, and which is the reflection of the collection. The air is always cool and fresh. A gentle breeze brushes the smell of snow in front of you, incredibly different from the swampland rainforest that lines the coast. Reach Franz Josef and notice how the quaint quality of the town is enriched by the surrounding mountains and the nearby glacier."

      "title": "Punakaiki - The Beauty of Land and People",
      "description": "In the early morning you can fly over the glacier and see how the frozen river sits between the mountains and looks ready to slide through the cracks and continue its descent to the ocean. Land on the glacier and hike along the icy crevice. The sound of crunching ice resonates from beneath your feet. Remnants land on your lips. Duck into ice tunnels, the craggy service of the glacier stunningly still beneath you. When the icy tour ends you will make your way from Franz Josef and on to the coastal town of Punakaiki. The Pancake Rocks are famous limestone formations which started forming million of years ago from fragments of marine creatures, soft mud, and clay. Waves crash into the caverns beneath the rocks creating huge waterspouts that explode skywards through the blowholes that line the area. Fur seals line the beaches of the rugged coastline. Their barks mix with the thunderous sound of the crashing water. The seals have small ears and their backs are covered in dark gray-brown fur. As the mist explodes into the air, the seals bark along the wet rocks, the sun begins to set over the waterspouts and sinks behind the horizon."

      "title": "Punakaiki - The Decidedly Different Railway",
      "description": "Journey to Greymouth to catch the luxurious railway north to Christchurch on the TranzAlpine Railway. The sweet smell of rich coffee warms the train cabin. The beautiful rugged scenery of Otira Gorge stretches out the window. Carve your way through the gorge, past Arthur’s Pass National Park and eventually crossing the Canterbury Plains where the lush green fields of the farmland are separated in manicured pieces. Once in Christchurch you will immediately understand why it is known as the “Garden City.” The subtle rush of the Avon River winds through the gardens and the city’s center. The colorful buildings glow in the sunlight as the sound of tram bells ring among the trees. The city center is comfortable as seagulls and ducks linger alongside the Avon, its banks decorated with weeping willows and aspens, office workers and visitors all enjoying the sun.
