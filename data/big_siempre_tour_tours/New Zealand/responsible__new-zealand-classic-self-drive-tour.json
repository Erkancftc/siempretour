  "generalInfo": "North Island or South Island? You can explore both on this 21-day New Zealand fly drive tour which gets you to all the biggest sights, from Tongariro National Park in North Island to South Island’s glaciers. <br/><br/>Driving is the simplest way to reach the most scenic New Zealand locations and gives you the freedom to stop at lesser visited sights in between: that quirky roadside café, or that layby with the beautiful sea view. Twenty nights gives you an unhurried and immersive New Zealand experience. <br/><br/>This trip starts with North Island. You’ll pick up your car in Auckland before heading south via ‘Hobbiton’ – the film set from Lord of the Rings – in Waikato to Rotorua, and then on to Wellington. You’ll cross to South Island on the Cook Strait to Picton and then drive towards Christchurch, Queenstown and ‘glacier country’. <br/><br/>Exploring Maori culture is a must whilst you’re here, and there are plenty of ways to do so, whether you visit the cultural centre at Rotorua or enjoy a hangi feast, which includes dishes prepared in an earth oven – a slow cooking process that makes hearty meals out of ingredients like lamb, beef, sweet potatoes (kumara) and vegetables. <br/><br/>Wildlife is a massive highlight – in more ways than one. You can go whale watching at Kaikoura and watch these giants made weightless by the waves. A nighttime wildlife sanctuary tour will show you New Zealand’s more diminutive treasures, like a little spotted kiwi or hundreds of glow worms.  <br/><br/>With all its wonderful wildlife, New Zealand is an ecologically minded country, making a responsible holiday here a natural fit. This New Zealand fly drive holiday makes use of the country’s extensive network of family-run bed and breakfasts to give you an authentic experience. These local businesses are doing their own bit to help with biodiversity on the islands, whether that’s by replanting native trees or creating wilderness areas on their properties; by staying with these inspiring hosts you can help support these endeavours. <br/>",
