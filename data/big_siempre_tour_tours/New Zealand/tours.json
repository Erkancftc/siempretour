        "description": "Queen Charlotte Sound First sighted in 1642 by Abel Janszoon Tasman while seeking shelter for his ships Heemskerck and Zeehaen from a storm near d’Urville Island, it was Captain James Cook who would first set foot here aboard the Endeavour during his five visits to Ship Cove, his New Zealand base between 1770 and 1777, in what he would call Queen Charlotte Sound. We spend two full days exploring the waterways and islands of scenic Queen Charlotte Sound with opportunities to head ashore and walk a section of the Queen Charlotte Walkway as well as search for birdlife on the predator-free islands. A visit to Tory Channel brings the whaling history of the Perano Whalers to life. We also plan to visit Ship Cove and learn of its history, exploring the region and visiting Captain Cook’s memorial inaugurated in 1913. Another conservation success story, Blumine Island has seen the translocation of several rare bird species including the once widespread Orange-fronted Parakeet, now New Zealand’s rarest parakeet, which were translocated to the island between 2011 and 2012. Also thriving on the island are South Island Saddleback, brought back from the brink of extinction last century from just 36 birds rescued in 1964, descendants of these birds were translocated to Blumine Island in 2009."

The outermost island in the Marlborough Sounds, d’Urville Island features imposing sea cliffs along its west coast, a high mountainous backbone and the fastest moving tidal flows in New Zealand between the French Pass tempered by some of the country’s finest peninsula scenery. Dolphins and New Zealand Fur Seals are frequently seen in the waters surrounding the island and it was here that Pelorus Jack, the endearing Risso’s Dolphin who famously stole the nation’s heart, guided ships across the dangerous waters of Cook Strait between 1888 and 1912."

Venturing into Pelorus Sound we head to Ngawhakawhiti Bay where nature surrounds us and it’s possible to get a glimpse of what the sounds would have been like before the native forest was cleared.

Cruising around Milford Sound searching for dolphins and seals and jetboating through Mount Aspiring National Park are two standout activities. During your time here, you’ll also come to understand New Zealand’s unique heritage, meeting Maoris in Rotorua and visiting the New Zealand National Museum in Wellington.

    "generalInfo": "North Island or South Island? You can explore both on this 21-day New Zealand fly drive tour which gets you to all the biggest sights, from Tongariro National Park in North Island to South Island’s glaciers. <br/><br/>Driving is the simplest way to reach the most scenic New Zealand locations and gives you the freedom to stop at lesser visited sights in between: that quirky roadside café, or that layby with the beautiful sea view. Twenty nights gives you an unhurried and immersive New Zealand experience. <br/><br/>This trip starts with North Island. You’ll pick up your car in Auckland before heading south via ‘Hobbiton’ – the film set from Lord of the Rings – in Waikato to Rotorua, and then on to Wellington. You’ll cross to South Island on the Cook Strait to Picton and then drive towards Christchurch, Queenstown and ‘glacier country’. <br/><br/>Exploring Maori culture is a must whilst you’re here, and there are plenty of ways to do so, whether you visit the cultural centre at Rotorua or enjoy a hangi feast, which includes dishes prepared in an earth oven – a slow cooking process that makes hearty meals out of ingredients like lamb, beef, sweet potatoes (kumara) and vegetables. <br/><br/>Wildlife is a massive highlight – in more ways than one. You can go whale watching at Kaikoura and watch these giants made weightless by the waves. A nighttime wildlife sanctuary tour will show you New Zealand’s more diminutive treasures, like a little spotted kiwi or hundreds of glow worms.  <br/><br/>With all its wonderful wildlife, New Zealand is an ecologically minded country, making a responsible holiday here a natural fit. This New Zealand fly drive holiday makes use of the country’s extensive network of family-run bed and breakfasts to give you an authentic experience. These local businesses are doing their own bit to help with biodiversity on the islands, whether that’s by replanting native trees or creating wilderness areas on their properties; by staying with these inspiring hosts you can help support these endeavours. <br/>",

New Zealand has an incredible amount of variety - dramatic scenery, plentiful wildlife and a rich history and culture. This itinerary will give you a real feel for both the landscape and its people.<br/><br/>You’ll be presented with incredible beauty throughout your trip, from deserted sandy beaches, to wild mountain ranges, to untrammelled native forest, to spectacular geothermal activity. For wildlife enthusiasts, highlights of the trip will include watching the sperm whales and dolphins in Kaikoura, spotting kiwis on Stewart Island, taking a nature cruise along Milford Sound and visiting protected colonies of royal albatross, sea lions, fur seals and penguins on the Otago Peninsula. <br/><br/>You’ll also get the chance to learn more about the indigenous Maori people, whose culture influences all aspects of New Zealand life. You'll visit Rotorua, which is steeped in Maori culture and history, as well as the renowned Waitangi Treaty Grounds in the Northland and the fascinating Te Papa museum in Wellington. Added on to the end of your New Zealand sojourn, a four night trip to Fiji will take you to the rugged beauty of Viti Levu’s interior, where you’ll join a traditional kava ceremony in a Fijian village as well as explore waterfalls, rainforest and mountains, not just in a vehicle, but also on foot and by kayak. Next, you’ll head to the pristine beaches and clear waters of the Mamanuca Islands where, as well as relaxing on the beach you can explore the incredible world underneath the water, either snorkelling or diving. You can also learn more about Fijian culture from the staff at your resort. <br/><br/>To make the best of the above itinerary you should avoid the winter months of June, July and August. The ideal time to visit New Zealand is from November until the end of March. The best time to visit Fiji is the dry season of May to October, but the mild climate means that it’s a year-round destination. Bear in mind, however, that cyclones are more common between November and April. <br/><br/><br/><br/>",

This treasured natural wonderland, its wildlife, conservation and history inspired our dream for responsible travel.<br/><br/>Established in 1952, Fiordland National Park is now over 1.2 million hectares in size and rightly famous for its epic, grand scale scenery, untamed wilderness and unique wildlife including Bottlenose Dolphins, Fiordland Crested Penguins and New Zealand Fur Seals. However, Fiordland is also rich in natural history, geology and the location of some historical firsts and important restoration and conservation projects.<br/><br/>Maori legend describes how demi-god Tu-te-raki-whanoa carved out the region’s fiords with his adze, Te Hamo, from rock walls to create the fiords we know today. Captain Cook and his crew were the first Europeans to visit, landing here aboard HMS Resolution in 1773 and subsequently spending five weeks in Dusky Sound. Cook’s records and maps would attract sealers and whalers not long after, who would go on to form the first European settlements here, historically this region is very important and shaped the future of the country.<br/><br/>The majority of Fiordland’s sounds are only accessible by sea, making them among the most remote areas of New Zealand’s mainland ensuring their epic beauty remains unspoiled and historic sites undisturbed. Waterfalls, streams, rivers and fiords are enveloped with misty veils that come and go, revealing steep gradients of mountain peaks and sheltered valleys. Join us as we sail the calm waters of Fiordland in solitude exploring some of the most unique and wild parts of Fiordland on this unforgettable adventure.<br/><br/>NB shorter versions of this cruise also available, please enquire",

The area’s natural bounty saw more than 2,500 gold miners and saw millers flock to the region in the late 1890s, this early settler history at mining towns Cromarty and Te Oneroa, now reclaimed by nature, can still be observed, none more spectacularly than at the failed Tarawera Mine and Smelter, where the ruins of the smelter’s three-storey chimney were restored in 2015. Among the activity Preservation Inlet can also lay claim to having New Zealand’s first whaling station at Cuttle Cove and the location of one of the country’s most remote lighthouses at Puysegur Point, which began operation in 1879 perched some 40-feet above the South Island’s most south-western point. Here a great coastal walk, formerly a telegraph track built to connect the lighthouse, leads to the old landing shed at Otago Retreat."

One of several important predator-free islands in the inlet including Great Island and Passage Islands, Chalky Island is home to some of New Zealand’s most critically endangered bird species including the Little Spotted Kiwi and Kakapo, and endemic Te Kakahu Skink, discovered in 2002. The protected harbours at North and South Port offer much to explore as the centres of human history in the inlet with North Port the final resting place of the rusting hulk of purposely grounded GSS Stella while South Port reveals an industrial past with the remnants of once prolific sawmilling activity. Sailing to the head of the fiord the surrounding mountains envelope us with their majesty."

On nearby Pigeon Island learn the history of Richard Henry and his pioneering live transfer of birds to island refuges – an international first in wildlife conservation. While his attempts were unsuccessful due to stoats swimming over to the island, it is heartening to learn the island is now pest-free and a sanctuary for native birdlife, with Henry’s vision fulfilled."

The extensive sheltered waters of scenic Breaksea Sound, initially scouted for sheep farming suitability by early setters in the 1850s, is also the location of Breaksea Island, an iconic site in New Zealand conservation history as one of the first large islands declared rat-free in 1988."

Your captain and expedition Leader will find a suitably sheltered anchorage for our ship where activities could include kayaking or joining your expedition guides in a coastal exploration by Zodiac. Another rarely explored fiord, Caswell Sound is home to the last physical remains of the 1949 New Zealand–American Fiordland scientific expedition, a primitive hut standing on the banks of the Stillwater River used while studying the Wapiti/elk herd introduced earlier in the century.

In 1931, Napier was destroyed by a massive earthquake that registered 7.9 on the Richter Scale. Following the destruction of the city, its centre was rebuilt in the Art Deco style of the period - we'll explore a little of this heritage during an expert-led walking tour with Napier's Art Deco Trust."

The wild and rugged beauty of the West Coast surrounds us on our journey before we finally arrive into the old gold mining town later this afternoon. Founded in 1864, Hokitika was once a thriving community of over 30,000 until the end of the gold seams saw its population drift away. Today it's home to around 4,000 people and, as well as gold still being found here, it's also home to New Zealand greenstone (similar to jade), with a prolific number of craft galleries and open studios. It still retains something of its frontier spirit though and a stroll through its historic heart makes for an interesting diversion. The town was put back on the map in 2013 after it was used as the gold-rush era setting of Eleanor Catton's The Luminaries (the winner of the Man Booker Prize 2013). If the weather is clear, the sunsets from Hokitika are amazing, and there is a handily named Sunset Point that looks over the beach - the perfect spot to enjoy a cold beer or fish and chips as you watch the sun go down.

The first European to discover the west coast was Abel Tasman in December 1642. Long and thin and enclosed by the Tasman Sea to the east and the Southern Alps to the west, it's a land of glacial deposits and alluvium that flows from the rivers and glaciers of the Alps. There are some 60 glaciers in the park, but Franz Josef and Fox are the most famous. Up to ten years ago, the Franz Josef Glacier was one of the few glaciers in the world that crept down below the vegetation line. Today however this glacier has receded so much that you can only see the terminal face at a distance. The whole landscape of this glacial region is quite fascinating and there are several optional excursions available today, including glacier valley walks (short walks within the old valley of the glacier), heli-hikes that take you up onto the glacier itself, and scenic helicopter flights over both Franz Josef and Fox Glaciers. We'll spend tonight in Fox Glacier town."

En route, we'll stop at the pretty gold-mining town of Arrowtown with its clapperboard buildings and historic Chinese settlement to learn about New Zealand's gold rush history. From here, we'll continue to the adventure capital of New Zealand, Queenstown, where we'll soak up the town's resort-like vibe with a short walk around the foreshore and town. After a short time in Queenstown, we'll continue to the small town of Te Anau, the gateway to New Zealand's Fjordland National Park. The town is stunning, situated on the banks of Lake Te Anau (from which the town takes its name). According to Maori legend, there was a cave on the shore of the lake that was filled with iridescent light. Centuries later, in 1948 the entrance to a series of limestone caves was discovered to be home to hundreds of glowworms - perhaps explaining the ancient legend. This afternoon, we'll visit the glowworms ourselves, travelling across Lake Te Anau by boat to reach them. At 12,000 years old, the caves are still relatively young and continue to be carved out by the torrent of water that flows through them. This has created a twisting network of passages hiding whirlpools, sculpted rock features and an underground waterfall. Exploring the caves on a small boat, we'll finally visit the small glowworm grotto. In the darkness, the glittering light is quite mesmerising. Our driving time today will be around four hours."

Dunedin was settled by Scottish settlers in the middle years of the 19th century and today is a picturesque setting of towers and spires that still retains something of its Gaelic heritage. After lunch, we'll travel to the Otago Peninsula, where we board a boat for our wildlife cruise around Weller's Rock and Tairua Head. We'll see uninterrupted views of the world's only mainland nesting place of albatross, and we may be lucky enough to see them soaring and banking, with their three-metre wingspan unfurling overhead.

    "generalInfo": "This stunning three-week tailor-made adventure takes in New Zealand’s South Island, which is well known for its beautiful scenery, adventurous activities and native wildlife. Begin in the Abel Tasman National Park; well-known for being the sunniest place in the country and the perfect opportunity to start you trip by exploring hidden sandy beaches and secret coves by kayak, using human power rather than engines to reduce your impact on the environment. There are numerous hiking trails throughout the park and the famed multi-day Abel Tasman track heads right through the dense undergrowth while awarding you with glimpses of the turquoise waters. <br/><br/>Heading south through the flat vineyards of Blenheim you will continue to Kaikoura, famed for its abundance of marine mammals and birds. In Maori, the town’s name translates as ‘to eat crayfish,’ which are a huge resource in the nutrient rich waters. Here in Kaikoura, you’ll have the chance to swim with dusky dolphins, be awe-inspired by breaching sperm whales and spot graceful Albatross gliding overhead.  Continuing the ocean theme, bi-pass the hustle and bustle of Christchurch and spend a little time in the quaint little French village of Akaroa, nestled in the centre of a volcanic crater. There are some lovely hidden spots for hikes and picnics like Le Bons Bay and Pigeon Bay. The real highlight here is to spot the world’s smallest species of dolphin, the Hector’s dolphin. These animals are so intelligent and love swimming circles around the boat. <br/><br/>Your journey continues into the heart of the Southern Alps to the rich glacial lakes of Tekapo and Pukaki, where Aoraki (Mount Cook) dominates the landscape. This area is all about immersing yourself in the wilderness and the natural beauty. There are some stunning hikes such as the hike to Mount John in Tekapo along with the Hooker Valley track at Mount Cook itself. This area, the Mackenzie Basin, is a registered as a Dark Sky Reserve meaning you could see the dazzling Milky Way, Southern Cross and many other constellations on a clear night. <br/><br/>Continuing through the Alps, Lake Wanaka is situated on the edge of the Mount Aspiring National Park and therefore an excellent destination for natural beauty and some fantastic hikes. Some of our favourites are Roy’s Peak, Iron Hill and the Diamond Lake track. In this sleepy alpine town, you can take a leisurely cycle ride along the banks of the Clutha River on a state-of-the-art e-bike or visit a predator free island in the middle of the lake to learn more about re-introducing native bird species. Being on foot or cycling around the area can really help reduce your carbon footprint. <br/><br/>From Lake Wanaka, you’ll meander through the winelands of Central Otago and the Gibbston Valley before reaching Queenstown and the mighty Lake Wakatipu. The scenery really doesn’t disappoint with views over the Crown Ranges and onwards to Glenorchy. Here you can explore the native beech forests during a guided hike on the Routeburn track or visit some of the filming locations for the Lord of the Rings. From Queenstown, you can access the mighty Fiordland National Park and spend the night sailing on Doubtful Sound, on the Fiordland Navigator. This magical experience will afford you the chance to spot transient Humpback whales, dolphins, New Zealand fur seals and even the elusive Fiordland Crested Penguins. Waking up in the peace and serenity of the Sound is a once in a lifetime experience. From Queenstown, you’ll depart home and look back at an incredible trip with fond memories.",

        "description": "Today you will depart from Auckland and watch the skyline fade into the horizon as you make your way to the famous Waitomo Caves . Follow your guide through the limestone maze. The air is cool around you. Touch the cave walls and feel the smooth, slick surface. You can hear the sound of trickling water before you are guided onto a small boat. Drift through the cave’s waterway, the ceiling undulating and at times seemingly dripping the limestone down to touch the water. The black darkness gives way to speckles of shimmering blue that cling to the walls, ceiling, and stalactites. As you get closer the blue becomes brighter, strewn through the cave like fairy lights. You have arrived at the famous Glowworm Grotto where the luminescence of the glowworms lights the cave in iridescent blue. As you continue to drift through the cave the light from the glowworms fade, the cave entrance opens, and you continue your journey to Rotorua. Arrive in Rotorua, known to be the Cultural Capital of New Zealand. The diverse mixture of traditional Maori culture convenes together with the influences of European culture and history. The city was built upon the geothermal wonders of the province, giving the architecture a quaint Victorian charm with the luxuries of resort decadence. In the evening you will experience the cultural vivacity of the Maori with a visit to a Hangi , a traditional feast, complete with concert. Upon arrival be ready to enter the meetinghouse with a friendly greeting with the chief. He presses his nose to yours to show that you are welcomed as more than a guest, but as a new family member, into the tribe’s home. The carvings on the façade of the meetinghouse resemble spirits; smooth wood is chiseled into detailed faces with tongues sticking out, eyes bulging out, and geometric tattoos standing out. The scent of polished wood gives way to the slow roasting of lamb and pheasant. You can almost hear the sizzle of the potatoes as they cook in the traditional manner, dug into the earth in a large hole stuffed with hot coals. The concert begins with tribal chants similar to those that stem from its Polynesian roots; however, the melodic sounds soon end. The Maori warriors enter with frayed grass skirts, ta moko, traditional body art, decorating their shoulders and faces. The drums pulse through your bones. The warriors slap their chests and scream into the night. They bulge their eyes and stick out their tongues like the craved sprits on meetinghouse’s façade. Their war cry beats thick in the air and you have witnessed the sensational haka . After the concert’s end you will return to your hotel; whether you prefer rural charm, urban opulence, or luxurious seclusion, there is no shortage of accommodation to fit your tastes."

Being your day with a unique and thrilling scenic helicopter flight to Mokoia, an active volcanic crater. The island is home to a plethora of endangered birds, including the coarse-haired kiwi for which New Zealand is known. Mokoia is filled with Maori traditions and myths. The lush green of the island is brought about by the volcanic soil which is rich in nutrients. The surrounding water is almost indescribably blue and serene. Hover around the rugged terrain of White Island where the main crater is situated. At various times of the day you can see puffs of steam rising from the crater. Wind around the steaming cliffs of the thermal valley where you can also see the iridescent glow of the colored pools of the thermal reserve before setting back down to earth. Your best of adventures continue on a 4X4 journey through the dense and stunning landscapes that surround Rotorua. The roar of the vehicle hums beneath you as the dense forest begins to open up. Branches brush against the jeep. Water splashes around you. You can hear the thundering waterfalls in the distance as you rumble along the unpaved path to see the outskirts of the city, beyond the Cultural Capital and into the heart of nature. The landscape rolls and the trees are full, until the world opens up into a quiet plane where you can see the mountains far in the distance."

For a fabulous rush and fantastic scenery, take a jet-boat ride along the thundering river, where the cool wind rushes through your hair and the crisp mist of the water splashes your face. You can also take an easy hike to the falls; you can stand on the bridge and watch the colorful water thunder over the rocks as you watch the jet-boat speed through the river in the distance.

From the city streets to the outlying vineyards, there is plenty to see, plenty to taste, and plenty to do. Stroll along the streets of the city and see the expanse of Art Deco architecture that decorates the city in a virtual palette of colors. The bricklayer streets sparkle in the sunlight. The energy of the city is as vivacious as the colors, caught in the roaring vibrancy of the Art Deco movement that is less than a tradition and more of a way of life. Leave the colors of the city behind for a moment to experience the luxurious flavors of the region. A visit to the Craggy Range Vineyard gives you first-hand experience of the diverse landscapes of New Zealand and how those landscapes drastically change the flavors of vines and food, whether through tiny variations in temperature or by soil type. Sit along the edge of the vineyard where you can hear the crash of the ocean along the rocky shores. The scent of fresh grass and growing vines fills the air. Swirl the Shiraz around your glass and see the deep and dark purple hue, the sweet aromas of blackberries combine with hints of cocoa and freshly cracked black pepper. The refreshing acidity of the wine brings you back to the expansive Art Deco streets of Napier where you don’t have to ask for the best to know that you are getting the best."

Along the way you will pass through the charming and beautiful town of Martinborough. The town contains a picturesque village square immersed in heritage buildings. The Victorian architecture lines the streets with encompassing balconies offering a view that wraps around the street corners. The Martinborough countryside is draped with vineyards that stretch along the valley and into the foothills, giving the region a diverse range of wine varietals and flavors. For a unique taste of the Martinborough pay a visit to Molive Gold, where their distinctive production of late harvested extra virgin olive oil results in a mellow and smooth taste. Continue on to Wellington where the sun glistens along the bay and invites you in. The city sits between the foothills of Mount Victoria and the cool waters of the Cook Straight. The red trolley rolls through the city, up the lush mountainside, and into the suburban gardens. For a decadent treat of New Zealand flavors visit Boulcott Street Bistro. The scent of smoky braised lamb drifts from the kitchen. The gentle spice of the crushed minted peas awakens your taste buds, and the slight crunch of the herb polenta gives you that satisfying texture assuring you it is the best lamb you’ve ever had."

The buildings sparkle in the morning sun, the grass of Mount Victoria glistens, and the water laps calmly at the city’s shores. It is the perfect time to visit Te Papa, the National Museum of New Zealand. The quiet solitude of the museum brings with it the collective weight of the country’s various cultures, from the indigenous Maori to the European settlers, and the largest population of Polynesians outside of the Pacific Islands themselves. The balance of Te Papa lies in its ability to inform visitors about the diverse history of the North and South Island’s people, from the land’s origins to the country’s origins, sometimes proud and other times questionable, but always unbiased and informative. Board the Cook Straight Ferry and cruise along one of the most beautiful ferry rides in the world. The mountains of the surrounding bay recede into the distance. The open water is filled with sunlight and a cool breeze. The lush scenery of the South Island comes closer until you dock in the tiny town of Picton and make your way to Blenheim, the sunniest town in New Zealand. The city sits besides rolling hills and vast vineyards in the stunning Marlborough Region. Filled with large fountains stretching through the opulent parks, Blenheim feels more like a town in the countryside than a bustling city. Orchards are brimming with ripe apples and vineyards are chockfull of grapes ready for harvest. The scent of fresh citrus fills the city streets and invites you in."

Marlborough is considered New Zealand’s most famous wine region and Brancott Estate is at the heart of Marlborough’s best. The ranch style building sits between the vineyards as they expand across the hills giving an orange and green tinge to the day. The cool, sunny climate and young soil help create some of the most distinctive Sauvignon Blanc. The wine has the delicate sweetness of ripe fruit and citrus giving it a crisp freshness. Stay and taste the luxurious pairing of the Sauvignon Blanc with the barbecued prawns. The simple citrus zest of the prawns makes the fruity bite of the wine pop. Continue on to Christchurch, filled with cobblestone-paved streets at its center, and the sound of the Avon River meandering around the parks and streets. Known as the Garden City, you will easily see the pristine parks decorating the city and bursting with the vibrant colors of blossomed lupines, daisies, roses, and trees. Punters glide down the river in romantic embraces and with blissful smiles as the river opens the expanse of the city to the aquatic explorers. The hum of the trolley car fills the city center. The stone facades of the Victorian past remain in the spired cathedral and the vast façade of the college. Whether strolling through the gardens or the streets of Christchurch, the best of the city is offered to you in plain view."

Once in Aoraki you will enjoy an exceptional dinner at the award-winning Panorama Restaurant located in the Hermitage Hotel.

Board the inflatable raft with your knowledgeable guide and drift along the serene lake that is fed by opulent glacial waters. The snow is an untouched white along the shores until you reach the base of the Tasman Glacier. The bluish-white covers the textured surface and stretches between mountains as Mount Cook, the tallest mountain in the Southern Hemisphere, lingers over the range. Continue on your way to Queenstown with a stop along the fabulous Lindis Pass, where the colors change with the seasons. The Southern Alps fill the horizon as the orange plains shine in the autumn, the gold shimmering in the spring. Enjoy a stop at Mrs. Jones’ Fruit Orchard and sample the luscious fresh fruits. The kiwis are a vibrant green with a juicy citrus and the cherries offer a fragrant and satisfying scent. The almonds and nut varieties are worth the stop alone. Once in Queenstown you can relax in the comfort of the alpine city’s treats. The mix of village charm and city luxury is inherent in the city’s beauty, nuzzled between the foothills of Bob’s Peak and the shores of Lake Wakatipu.

Waterfalls tumble down the mountainsides and crash into the sound, the cool mist rising into the sky. The scent of pure nature fills the fiord. You can hear the squawk of penguins in the distance and see them waddling along the boulder-filled shores.

After a flight from Sydney to Uluru, you will be transferred to an intimate desert camp that is well away from the main Uluru crowds. You can stop, breathe, and inhale the silence. This is the wilderness, and there will be nothing here but the two of you. The camp provides luxury in the wilderness, and the premium is on space. After you spend an afternoon at the fabulous domes of Kata Tjuta, admiring how the desert’s color is always ephemeral, you will have a night of pure seclusion beneath the stars. Dinner will be served to your suite as the southern sky unfolds."

On any given day, you can look out on the water and see boats casting their sails and catching the breeze. They glide across the sea like passing clouds. The city boasts the largest Polynesian population outside of the islands and emanates a friendly, eclectic atmosphere. The Sky Tower stands 1,076 feet tall and with a 360-degree view of the city. Make your way to the interactive aquarium at Kelly Tarlton’s for a view of subaquatic and arctic life. The habitat was opened in 1985 and continues to provide over 360 feet of tunnels to view passing fish and sharks. Stroll alongside the arctic encounter to view penguins up close in a simulated glacial environment. Stand at the edge of a 92,000-gallon tank and see stingray gliding through the water. You can watch staff enter the tank and feed the large and unique looking animal, pointing out the eyes atop their body and their mouths underneath. Even in the cities the natural splendor of New Zealand is present and prevalent."

        "description": "Meet your guide and depart from the beautiful city of Auckland. Begin your adventure through the islands of New Zealand by first making your way through the incredibly lush dairy farmland of the Waikato region. The hills roll in the greenery that seems never ending. Stop at one of the many farms in the area for a fresh cup of coffee and a taste of the local flavor, from New Zealand’s famed hospitality to a delicious, rich cup of coffee topped off with a splash of the local milk. The fresh grass is sweet in the air as you make your way to the Waitomo Caves. Your voice echoes in the emptiness of the damp cavern. The sound of rushing water swirls around you. Float deeper into the darkness where bits of light scatter and hang like glowing icicles from the cave’s ceiling, until the cave’s glow fades, the water pushes you to the nearest opening and you exit the cavern with a taste of wonder and a small hint of the beauty of the North Island. Settle into the “Cultural Capital,” of New Zealand: Rotorua. Once known for being a luxurious resort town, the city still bustles with spas and hot springs but has also grown to encompass a large connection to its Maori roots. Experience the Maori culture first hand. The warriors stand tall and proud in grass skirts, their eyes and tongues bulging out of their heads. Their arms flex as they jump and shout into the air. Once the tribe has calmed down, no longer sensing you as a threat, they greet you with a warm welcome and the promise of a hangi , a traditional Maori style BBQ, with succulent meats and hardy vegetables slow roasted in a deep hole dug for the occasion. The sounds of guitars and chants, rhythmically structured and continuous, move around the air mixing with the luscious smell of roasting food. As the sounds and flavors of the night fade into the ether it will always be a reminder of how unique the North Island is."

        "description": "With the day in Rotorua there is an expanse of worlds to see. Visit some of the area’s natural wonders. The incredible Pohutu Geyser is the largest geyser in New Zealand and erupts up to 15 times a day shooting hot water almost 100 feet into the air, giving it its name, \"Big Splash.” The intensity of “Hell's Gate” is apparent in its name. Known for being Rotorua's fiercest geothermal area. The whirlpools boil and the largest hot waterfall in the Southern Hemisphere careens and splashes down. The heat is intense and can be felt from yards away but the steaming water as it hits the air and falls into the pool below is stunning in its disparity, how something so dangerous could be so beautiful. Wandering around Rotorua and its surroundings will bring you to the village of Whakarewarewa, a place known to be a Living Thermal Village. Maori have lived in the area for 700 years. The communal hut is made of wood and stretches long to accommodate many visitors, similar to the long Native American structures of the North Western United States. The entryway is adorned with carved masks of spirits to protect and defend the structure while at the same time blessing those inside. The smell of active hot springs lingers in the warm mist. Whakarewarewa is now filled with Maori Art that is made from the Crafts Institute, an inspiring assurance of Maori art, craft, and culture. The carvings of masks tend to have the same swirls and lines as the Maori themselves, meant to signify pride and affiliation. The eyes bulge, the tongue points, and the smooth swirls that mark the carved faces are a reminder of a cultural history that continues to grow strong."

Watch as the opulent blue of the Waikato River rumbles through the narrow chasm causing a thunderous rush at the bottom of the powerful falls. Traveling around the serene and reflective beauty of Lake Taupo you will find your way into the decadently colored seaside village of Napier. Rebuilt in the 1930’s during the height of a depressed global economy, the buildings in central Napier scream with vibrant life, creating a smile on the colorful Victorian homes that are as much decoration as they are comfort. Explore the city and find remnants of a beautiful architectural past that continues strong in the preset, from the friendly county fairs to the classic cars that parade through the city’s streets. The cool sea breeze blows through the town and gives a salty sweetness to the pastel colors that shine."

The lush green of the vineyards stretches along the foothills. The light red of apples speckle the canopy as the orchards extend high and long. The landscape is manicured and expansive as you arrive at the Pukaha Mount Bruce National Wildlife Centre where kiwis are no longer meant as just another name for the locals. Open your eyes to the magnificent display of endangered birds that the center not only house but also attempts to conserve and preserve for future generations, including Manukura, the world’s only white kiwi in captivity. Visit the nocturnal house where Turua , another North Island Brown Kiwi, is on display. The aviaries are inhabited by endangered New Zealand birds being bred to help increase populations by releasing them into the wild. From native island parrots to blue ducks, the majesty of wildlife, especially when endangered, is hard to experience; however, the center will show you some of the natural wonders of New Zealand that often hide from visitors but will be open and active to you."

The City of Wellington is New Zealand’s capital city and offers the great depths of culture and beauty that all of New Zealand boasts. Cafes line the streets, tables decorate the sidewalk, and steam rises from numerous cups sitting on the street-side tables. The city opens itself up to visitors and locals alike with welcoming food, delicious drinks, and fantastic activities. Visit Te Papa, the National Museum of New Zealand where the history of the nation comes alive, from its connected cultural roots to Polynesia to its settlements by Europeans. Te Papa even explores the successes and setbacks of the local tribe that spanned the Wellington region and the northern tip of the South Island. The soft sounds of tribal chants resound in the lobby. Footsteps echo on the polished floor. Te papa, which stands for “our place,” is able to educate visitors and locals through its connection with the country’s history, whether the proud resurgence of its indigenous people or the not so proud history of displacement. As the sun sets over the bay the museum remains a bright light in the future of New Zealand because of its ability to instruct and progress."

Lush hills roll and line the beginning of the journey as you make your way into the open ocean eventually docking and stepping onto the South Island. Be carried away to the beautiful town of Blenheim where you will stop at the Cloudy Bay vineyard to experience their variety of decadent flavors. The Sauvignon Blanc is considered to be the quintessential wine of the Marlborough region, mostly because of Cloudy Bay’s doing. The vineyard looks more like a miniature forest with the silhouettes of mountains lingering along the winery’s edge. Indulge a little and smell the wine’s vibrant aromatics. Taste its layers of pure fruit flavor and delicate structure. Continue your journey to the stunning Hotel d’Urville, recently listed in the New York Times bestseller 1,000 Placed To See Before You Die . The façade resembles a state capital shining and opulent white with pillars adorning its entrance. The lobby smells of rich mahogany and garlic as the aromas from the kitchen glide into the lobby and fill the open space."

The water is bright blue. The half-moon bay arches toward the colorful foothills of the surrounding mountains. Seals can be heard barking from the rocks, bathing in the warm sun. They snuggle in a large colony and dive into the water for a refreshing dip. When in-season you can take a tour of the bay and watch the seals and the rocks fade into the distance as you make your way from shore to watch the whales migrate. The deep water shines a dark blue in the sunlight. Whale tails lift from the water and smash down. The large mass of a whale suddenly breaches the water, it’s body excitedly large and flying through the air, eventually splashing down and returning to its maritime home, the sea once again returning to its calm sway. Enjoy the seaside luxury of the White Morph hotel where you can enjoy succulent crayfish as the sunset melts behind the horizon."

The mountain peaks peer out from behind one another. Often topped with snow, they shine bright in the light blue sky. The green fields beneath stretch to the opposite horizon. Tonight you can relax and indulge in Stronechrubie's incredible restaurant. The hotel resembles a series of villas set on the vast prairie and surrounded by the mountains. The New Zealand lamb melts in your mouth while the garlic mash is packed with flavor.

Watch the largest peak in New Zealand extend into the sky, known to the Maori as Aoraki (the cloud piercer). The often-snowy peak looks similar to a cloud positioned still and high in the air. Easy hikes can take you partly up the mountainside to visit with the fresh lakes that dot the area; the smell of cool melted snow is refreshing and delicious. The varied undulations of the South Island continue as you traverse the Kawarau Gorge. The river is a pearl green as it rushes through a narrow pass carving deeper into the mountains every year. Follow the rush of the river eventually reaching the gorgeous city of Queenstown situated lovingly between Bob’s Peak and Lake Wakatipu. Known as the “Adventure Capital” of New Zealand, it is far more than just adventure sports that keeps the city buzzing; the local rich flavor of oysters, complete with a zest of citrus, helps bring the day to a delicious and delectable end."

At the pinnacle of Milford Sound is the fascinating Mitre Peak, standing tall behind the surrounding mountains, its sharp peak almost pokes a hole in the surrounding range. The sharp call of White herons can be heard as they glide along the water’s edge. Dolphins swim in the boat’s wake, jumping and playing as you travel the sound. The water is a reflective calm that never seems to be disrupted. The cool air flows and surrounds you. The sweet breeze sweeps across the water.

A visit to Arrowtown brings the educational adventure of the region’s gold mining history. Arrowtown is a delightful village cushioned beneath the beautiful mountains that surround the Arrow River. Walk along Buckingham Street, a parade of heritage buildings that extends into a tree-lined avenue of cottages once used by the miners.

Created by massive glaciers more than ten-millennia ago, Lakes Wanaka and Hawea lie side by side separated by a slice of land around 3,000 feet wide. The waters almost mirror one another in their opal coloring, their pristine reflections of the surrounding mountains and covering sky. To look at it is to wonder how these two glaciers were once joined. The scenery of Te Wahipounamu was shaped by the rocky coasts, incredible fjords, soaring cliffs, and careening waterfalls. When looking down upon the still, emerald lakes it is almost hard to know which is the sky and the mountains, and which is the reflection of the collection. The air is always cool and fresh. A gentle breeze brushes the smell of snow in front of you, incredibly different from the swampland rainforest that lines the coast. Reach Franz Josef and notice how the quaint quality of the town is enriched by the surrounding mountains and the nearby glacier."

Land on the glacier and hike along the icy crevice. The sound of crunching ice resonates from beneath your feet. Remnants land on your lips. Duck into ice tunnels, the craggy service of the glacier stunningly still beneath you. When the icy tour ends you will make your way from Franz Josef and on to the coastal town of Punakaiki. The Pancake Rocks are famous limestone formations which started forming million of years ago from fragments of marine creatures, soft mud, and clay. Waves crash into the caverns beneath the rocks creating huge waterspouts that explode skywards through the blowholes that line the area. Fur seals line the beaches of the rugged coastline. Their barks mix with the thunderous sound of the crashing water. The seals have small ears and their backs are covered in dark gray-brown fur. As the mist explodes into the air, the seals bark along the wet rocks, the sun begins to set over the waterspouts and sinks behind the horizon."

Lunch is served as green suburbs line the riverside before you loop back into the heart of the city to dock beside the glimmering sails of the Opera House. Head inside on a tour to discover that there is much more to this world-famous venue than its ingenious design. Wander through the theaters, admire the sets and props and enjoy the controversial story of its creation. Sydney is a relatively compact city, and your hotel is just two metro stops away from the Opera House."

Formalities over, you will be privileged to enter a Maori meeting place for an evening of food, song, and dance."

        "description": "Mud pools bubble and silica terraces glisten in the morning sun, and a geyser may burst skyward, the water surging above you many meters. Some areas of the geothermal reserve are a shock of surreal colors while others are marked by strange textures and explosive action. The highlight is how there is so much different geothermal activity in such a small space. You will only need to walk for a few minutes to catch everything from geysers to gassy vibrancy. After this stop at Wai-O-Tapu, you will make a stop at Huka Falls where the waters are blissfully turquoise as they surge into a narrow chasm. Tongariro is an active volcano and will provide the compass point this afternoon. Ngauruhoe and Ruapehu are also part of the trilogy of cones here. Their individual features will be clearly visible as you enter a national park for a night beneath the volcanoes. One of New Zealand’s highlights will be that you do not need to be incredibly fit or have much time in order to get very close to nature. This afternoon, you will explore a spectacular landscape of volcanoes and mountains without needing to wear walking boots."

While it would be a little shorter to fly, this privately chauffeured journey will be worth it, particularly to view how the landscape transforms from volcano to rainforest to pastures. The world’s southernmost capital is a charming little place and can feel more like a village than a city. This afternoon will be left free, and your guide can provide some ideas on places to go and things to for you see. Local cafe culture is usually very appealing to senior visitors, and there are some lovely little boutiques here as well."

Historical artifacts are complemented by a stunning art collection as the museum is essentially the country’s national art gallery as well. This is New Zealand’s best museum and will be the main focus of today. Your local guide will help to provide more context to some of the exhibits. Then, this afternoon, you can discuss all things Maori at one of the city’s neighborhood cafes."

Approaching Picton, these islets soar higher, and mountain spines become thickly-clad in the indigenous forest. While Milford Sound is the most dramatic of New Zealand’s coastal landscapes, today you will see why Queen Charlotte Sound is the prettiest. The best part will be that cruising through the Sound is part of the journey that you must undertake to reach the South Island. In New Zealand, the journey is always experiential. To be sat on the deck and cruising through the sand will be such a relaxed way to spend a morning. The ferry will dock in Picton, where you will be met by a new guide and transferred to wine country. Vineyards carpet a broad valley, and rows and rows of vines stretch between the mountains. Regardless of whether you like wine or not, this will be a serene place to spend two nights. Your lodge will be located on a wine farm, providing a sense of peace and tranquility along with all the excellent wines and food. Marlborough is well regarded as the producer of the world’s finest Sauvignon blanc. Fresh and summery, this white wine tastes much like how the region feels."

You can also visit the charming town of Blenheim, where whitewashed townhouses and gardens line the streets, but in a destination as tranquil as this, you do not need a clearly prescribed itinerary.

The planet’s largest toothed predator breaches and dives through the bay. You may enjoy intimate, close-up encounters with these giants on an afternoon whale watching cruise, although it cannot be absolutely guaranteed that you will witness these elusive creatures. Dusky dolphins and fur seals will also be highlights, but these will be dwarfed by your first sightings of a sperm whale. Such massive creatures can be quick to make you feel humbled by nature."

An earthquake flattened this city less than a decade ago, and you can see continued evidence of the destruction. However, you will mostly discover a city that is rebuilding through ingenuity and innovation. Gigantic graffiti murals have been used to cover up ruins, turning the city into a living art gallery, and pop-up shops and cafes fill the void left by destroyed malls. There is a lively and friendly energy on the streets, but there is not much traffic, especially in the compact city center. Christchurch is suitable for senior travelers because you can see and understand a lot without having to walk very far. Everything is close together, and you will have a full afternoon to explore.

        "description": "Land in Auckland and you may find it hard to believe that this is New Zealand’s biggest city. Yachts lull in the harbor as hills poke up to dominate the cityscape. The waters are blue and inviting, and though a third of the country lives here the urban landscape is dwarfed by nature. This is just the beginning of the New Zealand experience as you have landed in a country where nature writes the script. Today it will be a coastline narrative as you check into your waterfront hotel and explore the promenade as popup cafes juxtapose with sailing yachts. Islands jut out along the horizon, and you will find the laid-back culture of a land cast adrift in the South Pacific."

        "description": "Giant ferns and lush forests greet you on Waiheke Island with the colors a rainbow of interior green tumbling towards coastal turquoise. It might not seem how you expected New Zealand to be as Waiheke is more of what you would expect elsewhere in the Pacific, perhaps on Fiji or even Hawaii. The island is just 45 minutes from Auckland and makes for a relaxed day trip, especially if you are battling a little with jet lag. Take the ferry, and then use the tourist bus to get around, hopping out at vineyards, beaches, and tiny towns. Many of the stops are connected by short, signposted trails, so you can walk through tropical nature and feel the silence of New Zealand."

        "description": "After two days exploring on your own, it will be time for your guide to take over. Driving south, you will cross strange volcanic hills as the cityscape soon gives way to a sheep-speckled vista. Hobbiton is hidden here, positioned so that nothing modern can be seen in any direction. Wander through the movie set, past the manicured hobbit gardens and circular doors, across a fictional town to the fictional Green Dragon Inn, where they serve very real Middle Earth beer. Hobbiton is a convenient stop on the journey to Rotorua, New Zealand’s most volcanically active town and the heartbeat of Maori culture. At Te Hana Te Ao Marama Maori Cultural Centre the locals will come to greet you. Stamping their feet and exhaling loudly they will meet you in the traditional manner. Laying down a single feather, they make a show of peace. By picking up the feather, you accept their invitation. This is one of the only places in the country where you are allowed to enter a Maori meeting place, and once inside, you can join the Maori in song and dance before dining on a hangi meal. There is a reason that the Maori traditionally thrived here, and that is the volcanic thermals. Your dinner has been roasting naturally underground, while the geysers and mud pools are part of the people’s natural well being."

Walking trails ascend past geysers as raging rivers cut through ferns, leading to a stunning grade IV rapid you can raft down. In bubbling mud pools you bathe a morning away while on another trail you witness flumes of water rising 20 meters into the air. Rotorua symbolizes the North Island’s volcanic and natural history and is a destination where the adventure can be adapted to your interests and energy levels. Your guide will meet you in the morning and plan a day based on your preferences with options to include cycling, walking, rafting, kayaking, and all of the therapeutic outdoor thermals."

Gasp at a geyser, and then continue across the hills to Lake Taupo where the Huka Falls provide a surging, soul-stirring sight. A half-day guided transfer will leave you with a free afternoon to spend around the lake. You could take a boat cruise or go kayaking, or simply wander along the lakeshore and feast on the views. Backdropped by mountains and rolling to a laid-back rhythm, Lake Taupo is very much how you may have pictured a vacation in New Zealand."

Here you can wander through neighborhoods of small art galleries and quirky cafes, stopping to enjoy the flat white coffee that originated here, and then travel along the harbor towards the summit of Mount Victoria. The Museum of New Zealand is the best museum in the country and an essential afternoon excursion for a chance to follow the storyline through Maori and European settlers. Wellington has a superb dining scene, and your guide can make reservations at one of the city’s standout restaurants."

Take today as an example as you will cruise through Marlborough Sounds with a scenic ferry trip past dolphins and seals and majestic cliffs. Wind rushes past your ears, and there will be silence, plus that inspiring sense of adventure. Arrive in Picton, and then continue by road to Blenheim. As you travel, nature’s raw splendor will be replaced by vineyards, colorful streets, as you arrive to your farmhouse-style suite amid the grapes. Soon you will have forgotten the journey as you are sitting on a terrace to sample different wines, including the world-famous Sauvignon Blanc. Relaxing into the experience, you will find Blenheim to be a destination from a dream."

Part of the journey will be by road, with the second half on the water as a private speedboat takes you beneath the cliffs and the overhanging forest. Tiny gaps appear between the cliffs, and you will dive inside, cruising into tidal bays and coves. Here the turquoise waters reveal rays and reef sharks, while further along the coast you can find beaches completely cut off from the road as golden sands are shaded by 300-year-old trees. It will be out here that your hotel is located, and it is one of the very few hotels in the national park."

        "description": "New Zealand is one of the best countries in the world for a road trip. Self drive vacations are extremely popular and there is no debating why. On such vast natural landscapes there is so much to experience along the way. The roads are never boring, and they make wilderness very accessible. One of the country’s great highlights is watching how the nature changes, while another is the sense of freedom and solitude. On a two-week vacation it is usually too much to drive the entire time, but doing it for four days provides a unique New Zealand travel experience. The most spectacular road is along the South Island’s West Coast, from Nelson down to Queenstown. Almost the entire route is through national parks, and you will traverse four of them with Paparoa, Westland, Mount Coo and Mount Aspiring, as well as much of Te Wahipounamu UNESCO World Heritage Site. Today it will be a leisurely four-hour drive to Greymouth, passing through Buller Gorge with stops at the blowholes and pancake rocks of Punakaiki, the highlights of the mysterious Paparoa National Park. Take your time over the journey, arriving in a small coastal town that always provides a warm welcome to visitors."

Break the journey in Hokitika and walk in the treetops before hugging the coastline to Franz Josef. In total, it will be 2 ½ hours by road, and you can comfortably arrive by lunchtime. This afternoon you will soar, taking a helicopter to the icy realm of Franz Josef Glacier. Strange ice sculptures will appear as ice tunnels glisten blue. Strapping on crampons, you will go for a hike, admiring how the glacier flows down into a forest. New Zealand really makes adventure accessible, and the heli-hike is a perfect example of this. Not only is a glacier in a rainforest, but you can feel your feet on the ice."

The road leaves the coast, snaking across Mount Cook and Mount Aspiring national parks. Snowy summits reflect in numerous lakes as you traverse both mountain passes and rainforests. Waterfalls dot the scene, and the wilderness appears unending. On such an open road you could stop at thousands of places along the way with the final one hour into Wanaka particularly memorable. In total, it will be a four-hour drive to Wanaka, although it is best to take your time and make this a full-day trip."

Queenstown is draped along this lake, a quaint town backdropped by incredible mountains. Check into your waterside hotel and spend your afternoon in Queenstown itself. There will be adventure in the form of famous bungee jumps and jet boat rides, plus mountain bikes and hiking trails for all levels.

First travel three hours by road, passing icy escarpments on a remote road through Fjordland National Park. Board a boat in the early afternoon and then cruise alongside the increasingly vertiginous cliffs. Hundred-meter waterfalls gush from these cliffs and soon the landscape towers a kilometer above you. Milford is the narrowest and most dramatic of the New Zealand fjords, and you must spend the night to appreciate its true splendor."

Last night you were docked deep in the sound, surrounded by silence and the workings of nature. At night, you will not see much, although the solitude is superb. The great highlight of spending a night is waking up in the fjord as mist flutters through, and the cliffs emerge slowly, unfolding before your eyes. There are very few other boats, and you will sense a wilderness that has never been tamed. After a morning spent exploring more of Milford Sound, you will be transferred back to Queenstown for your outbound flight. Such a remote experience in nature should leave you in a very relaxed frame of mind for the journey back home."

You can sense the city bustle is somewhere close, but by the harbor, it is always incredibly tranquil and relaxed. After landing in Auckland, you will be transferred to a hotel that overlooks the water and harbor. With such a long journey and the time difference, it is hard to predict how you will feel upon your arrival.

Vineyards create a carpet of green colors on the island’s interior, and you may initially think that Waiheke is more like Pacific destinations further north such as Hawaii or even the Californian coast. However, on a private day’s tour, you will realize that Waiheke is distinctly New Zealand. From the colorful, local cafes and boutiques to the Maori canoes upon the water, this is New Zealand’s own tropical island and a place where you can indulge and luxuriate in blissful surroundings. You explore at a relaxed pace, taste at three different vineyards, discover a sculpture park, and have an afternoon to unwind on the beach."

When approaching Waitomo, these give way to indigenous forest although rugged mountain pastures remain dotted with sheep. With half a day here, you can tailor an adventure with your guide. Short hikes will lead you to waterfalls that hide in the forest along with strange, rocky cliffs and trees that could come from Middle Earth. The Waitomo glowworm caves are the unmissable highlight today, and you will cruise into a mystical world where the worms flash poetic, green patterns in the darkness. By the middle of the afternoon, you will back on the road, twisting through glorious farmland on route to Rotorua, which is the home of the Maori. With precise, choreographed movements, a Maori family will come out to greet you in the same way the Maori have welcomed visitors since Abel Tasman’s first landing. It may seem to incite war, but by placing down a single feather, this is a greeting of peace. By picking up the feather, you will show respect and be welcomed into their meeting place where song and dance will fill the evening.

You should sit on the right because when you come into view of the land, there will be superb views over the fjords even though these are only a glimpse of what you will see tomorrow. Mountains rise on all sides of Queenstown, and the Remarkables glimmer white and reflect in the serene waters of Lake Wakatipu, forming a barrier to the West Coast and New Zealand’s fjords. To the opposite side, the peaks grow ragged as they twist into Central Otago and a different kind of wilderness. Above you will stand a less domineering mountain that is known as Bob’s Peak. You will take a cable car up here for New Zealand’s most famous sunset. Before this, you will have a choice of afternoon tours in the area. Bungee jumping was invented here, and there are three potential jumps that you can try. Commercial jetboating also started here, and you can whizz down the Shotover River, turning 360 degrees on an exhilarating ride through nature. A Lord of the Rings movie location tour is the most tranquil option. Traveling through wild New Zealand in a four-wheel drive, you can reenact scenes from the trilogy in addition to hearing stories about half of Queenstown’s residents being enlisted as extras for the movie’s battle scenes. All three of these options will fill your afternoon and still provide time for sunset views over the lake."

While this is not an excellent location for photos, it only adds to the charm when you cruise through New Zealand’s narrowest and tallest fjord. Before the Sound, you will need to travel by road, which is a spectacular journey across icy mountains and remote passes with stark rocks that tower high above the vehicle. This is a remote world that has remained mostly untouched by civilization. It is a string of fjords that stretches for hundreds of miles around the island’s coast. You will set off on the cruise, and you can immediately feel the mystique. When the clouds are low, it can really seem as if you are journeying into the unknown. Waterfalls roar and gush down the vertiginous fjord walls. They can seem small, but they are hundreds of meters tall. It is just that the fjord itself is over a kilometer in height. The scale of this landscape is first to impress, but as the boat gets close to the walls, you can pick out individual details like seals as they bask on a rock, slithering waterfalls that start 800 meters high, and perhaps dolphins that play in the boat’s surf. After a three-hour cruise of Milford Sound, you will return to Queenstown by helicopter, which will be a dazzling journey across Fjordland.

Your guide brings you to the edge of the subterranean river where you climb aboard a small boat and drift along in the darkness. In the distance you can see a subtle glow spread throughout an open cavern. You have reached the famous Glowworm Grotto, known for being home to the exceptional light and stunning existence of the glowworm. As they light your way in the darkness with radiant purple and blue color, you will exit the boat, leave the cave, and continue on your way to Rotorua. In Rotorua the streets are filled with the remnants of the city’s 19th and 20th century British Resort history. Victorian architecture is mixed with balcony-lined streets and colorful facades. Steam rises from Lake Rotorua on the edge of the city. Tonight you will experience the cultural majesty that is a Maori hangi , a traditional Maori feast. Be welcomed into the feast with a hongi , the welcome greeting of pushing your nose to the chief or welcome party’s nose, and immediately the songs begin. Warriors chant as they push down the river in their canoes. The beat of drums and strum of guitars fill the meetinghouse. The decadent aroma of succulent meats and earthy vegetables lingers in the air. As the fire burns bright you have been invited and welcomed into a new world, a world filled with rich history, tenacity, and as much inherent beauty as the landscape within New Zealand."

        "description": "Today you will depart from Rotorua and continue your journey southbound arriving at the shores of Lake Taupo, New Zealand’s largest lake. The water reflects the snowcapped mountains on the horizon. The crisp breeze blows in off of the lake and rushes through your hair. No visit to Taupo would be complete without a visit to the sensational Crater of the Moon. The cratered valley hisses and clouds with steam. Walk along the track and feel the heat emanate from the earth where pools of mud boil. The water pressure from the nearby geothermal power station has superheated the water, making it rise to the surface and escape through any and every possible vent. Puffs of slightly sulfurous steam swirl into the air as the active world beneath the earth becomes noticeable and unforgettable. Arrive in Napier, considered the Art Deco Capital of the world. The city center shines with a pastel color palette that makes the city feel like a constant celebratory parade. The spherical buildings twirl into the air, and the sloped roofs are as colorful as the sea. The city mixes classic Hollywood imagery with the exotic sentiments of Africa and South America rolling into the industrial inspiration of railways, steamships, and cars. The city sits along the shore as the soft breeze of the sea rolls through the streets. Enjoy a night tour of the city where the apparent charm of Napier will blend with the city’s history and culture buried deep within its roots. From the colorful buildings to the colorful people, Napier is filled with charm and a quirkiness that will immediately welcome and settle you."

The deep perfume of rich earth rises from beneath the vines. For a sensational taste of Hawkes Bay, venture to Trinity Hill and taste the exceptional 2012 Trinity. Perfumed with leather and plum, the wine combines the spice of Merlot, the rich currant of Cabernet Franc, and the structure of Cabernet Sauvignon. The outcome is rich and soft, serious yet delightful. After your bounty of the beautiful New Zealand earth you will continue to Wellington, New Zealand’s capital city set between the foothills of Mount Victoria and the sapphire waters of Cook Straight."

The semi-bohemian culture of the city blends effortlessly with the plethora of cultures, from Maori to Polynesian, film communities to tech, all revolving around the cafés and coffee shops that keep the pulse of Wellington on its toes. It is a perfect day to visit Te Paupa, New Zealand’s National Museum and free of charge. Te Paupa helps showcase New Zealand’s identity, from Maori roots to European settlers, from the geological past to a cohabitating present. The rooms are scented with soft cedar and filled with the quiet of a library, often with revolving exhibits that help express the nations identity, whether through New Zealand’s connections and strengths or struggles with its own identity. No matter what exhibits rotate through Te Paupa, you know they will always be super fun and incredibly informative, whether exploring cultural history or the evolving landscapes."

The ocean is vibrant with life as seals bark along the rocky shore; dolphins dive in the boat’s wake and play in the waves. In the distance you can see the large spritz of a whale’s breath. The boat wades in the water. The whales linger along the surface of the sea before breaking the calm water, breaching into the air and crashing down again. The sound thunders into the sky, the crash is somehow both elegant and chaotic, and the most beautiful thing you have ever seen."

The grass glows against the sprouting fountain and blue pond while you enter onto the grounds. The interior sparkles with opulent, preserved history, from the beds to the dinning hall. The gardens bloom colorfully and expansively in the spring and summer, where the newly blossomed purple lupines and red tulips contrast against the antiquated façade of the castle. In the afternoon you will be guided through the beauty of the Otago Peninsula. The ocean quietly laps at the shores. The green hills roll along the peninsula’s interior. A cool mist rises from the ocean while the sweet scent of the sea sits on the breeze. You can see the rare yellow-eyed penguins waddle along the sandy shores of the peninsula, nesting in the warm coastline, and taking turns diving out to sea to cool down, fish, and frolic. The yellow stripe that circles around the crown of their head and decorates their eyes glows against their black fur. The golden grass sways in the breeze while the squawk of the penguins rises into the air.

Then, you will meet with local artists and see how it is crafted into a protective or ceremonial piece that is usually hung around the neck. Each style of greenstone design has its own meaning and purpose, which is something you will come to learn from the artists. Some symbols are buried and then dug up to increase fertility. There are also more simple pieces that indicate friendship or protection for sea journeys. Every carving will become an expression of the Maori land and culture. There is a chance to get involved in making your own piece, although most of the exacting chips and carves must be done by a professional. This is also a fun and informal way to explore more of the local culture away from the more famous Maori welcomings and dances."

Connect in Auckland to a domestic flight and touch down at Kerikeri Airport, the northern most reaches of the country offering an unforgettably serene welcome. You’re probably tired after the flight, so soak up the tranquil sight of lush islands in the marine blue. Relax. Take your time. This is New Zealand, and almost immediately you settle into a gentle rhythm, nothing rushed or stressful, yet everything running on your time."

Cruise inland and it's green that dominates the vista, a thousand shades merging before your eyes. Touch down on a tiny isolated runway beside Cape Reinga Lighthouse, and then transfer to a coach that takes you across Tapotupotu Bay. Have a quick swim in the deserted waters and continue to giant sand dunes. It’s tempting to stand back and simply photograph their majesty, but the adventurous will want to grab a sled and surf down these remarkable natural features.

It’s just a couple of hours by air, with luxury chauffeured transfers and astonishing views from the window coming as standard. This North Island was formed by volcanoes, and rumbling beneath the Rotorua surface are inspiring reminders of this geological foundation. Geysers suddenly explode, huge flumes of boiling water spiraling some 50 feet into the air. Pools of mud slurp and bubble, while thermal baths cascade across the hilly landscape. Explore the remarkable beauty of this geothermal town at Te Puia, the geysers gushing just meters away. They don’t just look pretty. The natural heat has been essential to the Maori lifestyle for many millennia. Your dinner has been roasting underground; huge joints of meat slowly cook on the scorching rock. But before dinner, you must be officially welcomed. The Maori chief comes out in a fanfare of trumpets and singing, putting down a single leaf as a sign of peace. Pick up the leaf and accept the traditional welcome, then enter their wooden home for an evening of entertainment. Watch and learn the haka war dance, admire narratives told through dance, and enjoy this very rare opportunity to connect with Maori culture. Then it’s time to feast on the thick cuts of lamb and beef, the slow-roasted vegetables, and a couple of modern delicacies for dessert. With a steaming mug of hot chocolate in hand, you return to the geyser just in time for its evening explosion."

This morning you cruise over to White Island, the rims of craters gazing on from the distance and the delights of whales often breaching beside the boat. Following the calm comes the thrill of a live volcano, one that hisses and bubbles below the earth’s crust. It was only a decade or so since the last eruption, so hard hats and gas masks are a necessity, and careful monitoring of the underground rumbles means the trip can be canceled if there is imminent danger. Trek along the scorched rim, stepping over rocks created from lava and ash. A layer of steam floats in the distance, the volcano exhaling small reminders of its power. Ascend to the edge and then look into the abyss, hissing and bubbling sounds accompanying the inherent thrill. Yes, this is real; you’re standing on the edge of one of New Zealand’s active volcanoes. From here you follow the fault line, walking across the scars left by past eruptions and marveling at the iconic dome of Mount Tarawera. With all the excitement it’s left to the dolphins and whales to bring you back down to earth, friendly marine delights accompanying the cruise back to the mainland."

Today’s experience offers three unique highlights, each providing a different vantage point for admiring the splendor. Head out in a glass-ceilinged bus stopping beside calming lakes along the way, and then meander across a dazzling mountain pass. You’re always gazing up, rocking your head skyward and trying to comprehend the enormity. This impression continues when you reach Milford Sound, the world-famous natural wonder featuring vertical mountain walls that rise over 4000 feet from the narrow sapphire water. Switch to a boat, cruising past delightful waterfalls and into the magical mist that always hangs on the horizon. The boat provides the close-ups, revealing the intricate details of this abundant landscape. Later in the afternoon you get to see scale, a helicopter soaring above the Fjordlands and serving up one of the planet’s most sublime panoramas. Fjords and white peaks extend in every direction, and now the pilot swoops low and reveals natural ice sculptures lost amongst the rock. Touch down on a glacier, no evidence of human existence anywhere to be found. Take a few steps and photograph the white mirage. Admire your complete immersion in the wilderness.

Glowworms will illuminate magnificent limestone formations, and there will be a real sense of the surreal as you drift through the caves in a boat. The afternoon will be at your leisure in Rotorua before an evening tour of a geothermal park. Here, there are geysers, mud pools, and the highlight of being welcomed by a Maori community. This will be a dramatic and somewhat frightening experience because you will witness warriors in full costume. From there, it will be all smiles with an evening of dance, song, sharing stories, and learning the Maori ways."

The Nazgul follow Arwen into the river and you can see her summons bring the rush of the pristine water through the mountains and wash away the pursuing vagrants of Nazgul. Fly along the white blanket of Mt. Earnslaw. The exceptional glacier sits along the range. The mountain pass is plush green and dotted with tiny waterfalls that stem from the glacial water that adorns the mountaintop. The glacier emits a pure aroma of water and crunches beneath your feet. The ice is cold against your fingertips. The rock below the glacier is gray until it gives way to the lush grass that sprouts from the consistent water. Look over Mt. Earnslaw, the bright white snow giving way to the a series of people wading through the treacherous path of the Redhorn Pass that lies beneath the slopes of Caradhras and was predominantly used by traveling elves. Like the traveling elves and the nine members of the Fellowship you will make it through Redhorn Pass and many more treacherously beautiful sites of Middle Earth that blanket the South Island."

The shore of Lake Wakatipu laps beneath the boardwalk. The Remarkables roll into the distance, and the city sits quiet beneath you. The air is crisp and the smell of pine needles fills the brush. Your professional guide will strap you into the protective gear, ensure your safety, and you will glide across the panorama of Queenstown, between the abundant trees atop Bob’s Peak and watch the opal blue lake sparkle in the sun. Whether silently drifting through the sky or zipping down the line, the colors of Queenstown become more vibrant and the mountain range that sits beyond the lake seems to shrink, as if you can see every rock, blade of grass, and snowflake that decorates the distance."

The lake is opal in the mid-morning sky. The water reflects the mountains and the trees. The trees and grass sway in the breeze. The city of Queenstown fades into the distance as you make your way to Glenorchy. Once in Glenorchy you will climb aboard for an incredible jet boat tour of the Dart River. The water is emerald green and surrounded by pristine banks crowded with blooming gorse. The banks fluctuate between verdant forests and grass, to pebbled beaches and boulders. The mountains fade from white tips to deep gray foothills. The cool, fresh water mists your face. The wind wisps through your clothing. The woodlands shape and form next to the river, the thin tall trees that made Lothlorien and sit beneath the lower Misty Mountains."

The waterway opens up before you. The sails catch the breeze and push the boat forward. The vessel feels dwarfed between the goliath mountains that encircle the sound. The air is cool and quiet. The mountains are vibrant and green in the brilliant sky. Bottlenose dolphins often swim around the sound, their silver bodies shimmering beneath the clear water. They love to jump and dive next to the boat, showing off for the people aboard as you make your way around the stunning glaciers that drip water down the mountainsides. The sound of crashing water echoes in the silence. The valley was carved by glacial activity which still remains. Penguins are also occasionally seen flying through the water and drying their feathers along the rocky shores. Whether dolphins, penguins, glaciers, or pristine water, Doubtful Sound has you enter the world of Tolkien and Jackson once again, whether used in the films or not, to experience its surreal and breathtaking beauty."

Inspiring ice formations extend across the landscape, crevasses offer views into the abyss, and lakes stand silent in the crisp morning air. Some of this can be glimpsed from a road or walking track. But almost all of Fjordland has never been tamed. To really see this natural wonder you need an aircraft, something with the ability to fly low between the mountains and land on isolated glaciers. The Milford Ultimate Heli-Scenic Flight is an incredible way to round out this once-in-a-lifetime vacation, the family transported to places that rarely see human eyes. Explore the heart of this epic expanse, the 2500 foot Sutherland Falls thundering away from close quarters and the helicopter touching down on a huge glacier in the midst of the wilderness. It’s hard to know which way to look; the astounding lake down below, perhaps the artistically framed ice formations, maybe the complete panorama of peaks, or the white mirage that fills the window. Stop for lunch at a remote Musterer’s Cabin then return to the air, children’s eyes filled with amazement as the natural scenes keep coming. Now comes a famous landing at the Moonlight and Shotover Canyons, and the last three and a half hours have flown by.

Glaciers surge down from the mountains and into the rainforest, then onwards to the ocean. There are many different glaciers here, and two are accessible on helicopter hikes or Heli Hikes. Franz Josef is the more popular glacier, but Fox Glacier has a more varied landscape, which you will discover this afternoon. Just to reach the glacier is an adventure. You will be strapped into a helicopter and soar into a wonderland that can initially look like Narnia. Crampons and snowsuits are essential, which further adds to the fun. The ice beneath your feet will crunch as you trek to ice-sculpted archways, artistic natural pinnacles, soft, blue melt pools, and ice caves. You can walk through tunnels where the ice has a gorgeous blue tinge before gazing out onto the humbling magnitude of Fox Glacier.

The great part about this hike is that the helicopter makes it accessible. This three-hour section could be the ultimate highlight of a week-long trekking expedition, but you will fly straight to the most spectacular part of the trail.

A two-hour guided tour takes a winding path through the village, past the hobbit holes, and into the world from the big screen. Close by is another iconic filming location, the Mangaotaki Rocks. The troll and campfire scenes from An Unexpected Journey were filmed here, on towering limestone cliffs that overlook the primeval forest. Lunch is included as you journey south through these mystical landscapes before you arrive in Rotorua in the late afternoon. Geysers can be spotted from the hotel, exploding in the distance and indicating what you'll all see tomorrow."

        "description": "Mud pools boil, and geysers explode all across Rotorua, the area's bubbling volcanic currents continually shaping the landscape. The gushing water arrives at clockwork intervals, erupting 20 times a day and sending flumes 100 feet into the air. You spend the morning exploring the thermal wonderland, watching steaming fumaroles and taking a dip in naturally heated pools. Strange colors are carved across the landscape, the world's crust uplifted to the surface. Yet you're not just here to admire unique geology. A Maori chief emerges to greet your family, laying down a feather as a sign of peace. Te Puia is the country's premier Maori cultural center, and you're invited into the meeting house, where the haka (war dance) is performed and then taught. Stories are narrated through song and dance, and your children are shown the basics of traditional Maori tales. Completing the evening's Maori heritage is a hangi meal, a feast of meats that have been steaming underground. Today's activities take place in Rotorua, and there's free time during the day to explore the town, or cycle along the lakeshore."

Mountains rise evocatively, the resplendent peaks jutting above lakes and tempestuous gorges. Driving through Arthur's Pass to the West Coast is one of the country's great journeys, and there are countless places to stop. Sweep away from the green Canterbury Plains, winding west into the valleys of the Waimakariri River, each growing narrower and steeper as you enter the national parks of the West Coast. Stop at the Nile River Caves, an ancient world of stalactites that rove above galaxies of glowworms. As javelins of light shoot into Metro Cave, the focus switches from sculpted formations to the luminescence of nature. After going underground, you continue the drive to Punakaiki, a landscape of blowholes and dense rainforest. This is the longest day of driving on the itinerary, but you'll only spend a total of four hours in the car, punctuated by all the different stops. Overnight along the coast at a lodge near Punakaiki."

A 450-meter long walkway leads you between the ancient rimu and kamahi trees, revealing a dense undergrowth of ferns and palms that are always alive with birdsong. From here it's a three-hour drive south, winding beneath snow-capped mountains to the village of Franz Josef Glacier. You must travel by helicopter to continue; your family swept above the vertical glacier wall to land on the snow. Gaze out and the glacier seems to stretch all the way to the ocean. But you walk away from the coast, ice ax in hand, to gargantuan ice tunnels that can gobble an entire family. Strange sculptures cling to the glacier's sides, ice creations that dance with originality. You'll have two hours on the glacier, surrounded by an untouched white wonderland. Specialist warm clothing is provided."

Silver beech forest takes you to a swing bridge over the Makarora River, where trout swim in the azure and everyone feels as if they're a thousand miles from anywhere. Part of New Zealand's appeal is the seamless journey from asphalt road to wilderness, something that often takes just a few footsteps. This is a land that makes adventure safe and easy, allowing families to explore within their own comfort zone. Later in the day you drive between Lake Hawea and Lake Wanaka, both the azure waters set against the alpine brilliance of Mount Aspiring National Park's peaks. Spend the next two nights along the shores of Lake Wanaka, a very tranquil counterpoint to the day's adventure."

Sutherland Falls tumbles out of the cliffs, the world's fifth highest waterfall yet it's almost lost in the enormity of the fjord's walls. Returning to Wanaka is also an aerial ride, a scenic journey that portrays the scale of New Zealand's South Island.

Today is deliberately left free, and your family may wish to follow the relaxed atmosphere along the lake shore. But if you're still searching for New Zealand adventure, there jet boating, bungee swings, and paragliding off the mountain above Queenstown. While they all have exemplary safety records, these are not the typical activities that parents want to watch children doing. So take your pick or lounge along the lake."

Then the skyscrapers of the harbor, an imposing sweep of glass that you seem to be ascending above. Reaching the pinnacle of the bridge, you gaze out along the Parramatta to the mountains and green forests that line the edge of the city. There's a thrill to the climb, yet the experience has a calming charm.

Teenagers might prefer the explanation with a little more myth, something that's provided by the Aboriginal tale of the Three Sisters, crumbling sandstone pinnacles that stand above the forest. Your family's day in the Blue Mountains can take various directions. Hiking trails descend into the eucalyptus where the world's steepest train journey brings you back above the valley. Mountain bike trails are available for all levels, but it's also possible to tour the lookout points by road and savor the panoramas of this majestic national park. Return to Sydney at your leisure."

The forests of Victoria provide one of the easiest places to see large numbers of marsupials so close to the city. First, the koalas are found clinging to eucalyptus branches with an indelible look of adoration. Eyes briefly open and the koala changes its pose before sleep overcomes and they sit in perfect repose. Kangaroos are far more active, continually hopping around as they fill the green plains between trees. You can get close if you step quietly, the males boxing and the females bounding in small mobs. In a wildlife sanctuary, you can see these animals. But in the wild, you can witness how they interact in their own realm."

Gentle waves allow you to surf along in the kayak, feeling the rush of the water take you towards the shore. Then it's onwards, with dolphins often swimming nearby and the city skyscrapers rising above the distant horizon.

Opal lakes reflect Mt Cook’s peak. Lupines glow in the sunlight, pink, purple, and gold. The scent of lupines is sweet along the fresh grass. The snow across the open mountain range makes the range blend in with the clouds. Continue your journey to Dunedin, a lovely beachside city located on the east coast. Once you arrive in Dunedin, Larnach Castle is a lovely site to visit. The castle has served many purposes since it was built in 1871, such as its use as a lunatic asylum, a hospital for shell-shocked soldiers, and even partly as a sheep holding pen. The castle resembles those of the English countryside. The stone façade is adorned with large windows looking over the field. The light trickle of the fountain fills the air. Swans swim around the fountain’s pool. The castle gardens are colorful and lively in the spring and summer full of blooming flowers and fresh grass.

The volcanic landscape is littered with peculiar green hills, mythical seeming riverine forests, and rural roads that wind into a lost world. Weave through exceptional panoramas to Hobbiton, the renowned movie set untouched from the time when Peter Jackson's epic was filmed. Forty-four Hobbit Holes can be explored, each fastidiously complete with intricate details. Even the fences have been carefully painted with 500 year old mould. It's a whole village of wonder, complete with smoke emitting cottages and the chance to drink a glass of Hobbit Stout in the Green Dragon Tavern. After the enchantment of Hobbiton you continue the journey south, the Hobbits replaced by traditional warriors as you arrive in the heart of Maori culture – Rotorua."

        "description": "It's impossible to shake the feeling of mystique here. Everything looks recognizable yet foreign. Hundreds of movies and commercials are filmed in New Zealand and, from up close, the landscapes blend the sublime with the surreal. Over the next two days this astonishing nature is yours to explore, a backdrop of Maori culture coating the adventure in intimacy. The itinerary is dictated by you. There's mountain biking through untamed forest, with easy beginner trails through thick pines to international standard competition tracks that head deep into the wilderness. An eclectic myriad of hiking routes explore the rolling natural surroundings. You can easily meander off to hidden waterfalls and natural wonders miles from any road. Your guide explains the options and then allows you to craft the perfect adventure, everything suited to your own tastes and fitness level. You can opt to take a rafting trip through the forest, a small inflatable craft paddling through gushing white water and thrilling rapids. If you're brave enough there's even the world's highest commercially raftable waterfall, a narrow 20 foot drop plunging you out of the forest and into a wide calming pool. Perhaps you would like something more serene. Try kayaking across a placid lake to an uninhabited island of natural hot springs. Lie back in the thermal baths and savor the view, green mountain scenery encircling this tiny piece of paradise. Throughout it all, your guide knows where and when to stop for the regions’ best coffee and organic lunch. Bubbling beneath Rotorua is irrefutable volcanic activity, the heat from the earth's core occasionally spurting through the earth's crust. The town is covered in exploding geysers and fizzing mud baths, champagne pools and remarkable prehistoric rock. Spend the evening of day four at Tu Puia, marveling at this natural spectacle of volcanic brilliance. These thermals are essential to Maori culture. Your evening dinner has been cooking underground, a feast of lamb, beef, and vegetables, being naturally roasted on the hot stone. Rotorua is the heart of traditional Maori culture and ancient practices are enthusiastically passed through the generations. The Maori chief comes out to meet you, drums and dancing accompanying his offering of peace. Accept the welcome and you're invited into a traditional Maori meeting place, Tu Puia, one of the only places in the country where this is possible. Sounds of the haka war dance reverberate through the wooden home before the tone is relaxed and you're treated to Maori storytelling through song and dance. This may be a fun evening for visitors, but it's an essential part of preserving local culture. By having this regular opportunity to continue old practices, Maori ways are not diluted generation to generation. And while this evening has a Maori focus, all your time in Rotorua is imbued by the charm of indigenous culture."

        "description": "White Island last erupted in 2001 and there continues to be background rumblings and activity. Travel out to Whakatane Wharf and board a boat to this active volcanic island, a gentle journey bringing you slowly closer to the iconic dome. Start trekking across rugged boulders, ascending to a unique vantage point, the very edge of the crater rim. Gaze down and shake your head at the view. Bright yellow sulphur crystals, the hissing and roaring crater lake, steam and ash floating away in the distance, the volcano's mesmeric beauty is revealed at stunningly close quarters. It's an unquestionable display of nature's power, energy, and beauty defined in a single vista. After you've returned the hard hat it's a soothing journey back to the mainland, whales and dolphins regularly visit these shores. Note that volcanic activity is constantly monitored and if there is risk of danger then trips do not take place."

Christchurch was decimated recently, half the city crumbling into dust. Yet it's not a depressing destination. Cheerful locals don't linger on the past, they look forward, finding ingenious ways to rebuild and redefine the city. After a morning flight from Rotorua and a luxuriant private transfer, you have a day to explore Christchurch's enthusiasm and unforgettable atmosphere. It's hard to find more welcoming and optimistic residents anywhere else on the planet. Traveling solo can sometimes be daunting but Christchurch epitomizes why New Zealand is such a great choice for single travelers.

Be driven out to the harbor and board a wildlife cruise, the waters dancing with the antics of dolphins and, occasionally, whales. These are Hector's dolphins, endemic to New Zealand and the smallest of all the dolphin species. They're also probably the cutest, ever exuberant and mischievous in the water. But you're not just admiring them from the boat. Jump into the water and swim with these happy creatures, an inspiring natural experience that immerses you with their antics. You can also choose to sea kayak alongside them for another incredible angle.

Take the cable car to the mountaintop for new panoramas, the mountains reaching far beyond the horizon and delighting the camera. Such pristine beauty emanates absolute tranquility and Queenstown provides an idyllic final stop to your unique New Zealand vacation.

        "description": "Serenity is just one side to Queenstown. This southern town is proud of its reputation, always finding ways to elevate its status as the adventure capital. The plethora of adrenalin-fueled activities is just another reason why Queenstown always features high on lists of the planet's best destinations for solo travelers. Today's heart racing action starts on Shotover River, the sapphire glacial melt drifts between stark mountain rock and into a narrow canyon. Hold onto the handlebars as the pilot plunges forward, putting the jet boat into a 360º spin and then hurtling into the canyon. It's gripping and frightening, the skilled pilot skirting past rocks and skipping across the water. If ever an activity brings a group of strangers together it's this one, all the passengers staggering off in communal wonder. Queenstown's status as adrenalin hub was heavily influenced by A.J Hackett, the man who installed the world's first ever commercial jump in a nearby canyon. This afternoon you have a choice of bungee jumps, each at different notches on the fear factor scale. For an historical slant you can take the famous first ever bungee. For insane views then throw yourself off a platform that's perched above Queenstown. Or for crazy height, head into a canyon and propel yourself from a cable car. If this sounds a little too hectic, then swap the bungee jump for parasailing above Queenstown. The great thing about traveling solo is that there's no need to negotiate what to do with a travel partner, so this itinerary can be customized to your exacting preferences."

        "description": "After nine days of exploring New Zealand, the penultimate day bursts with intimate wonder. Something extra special has been saved for today, a helicopter ride into Fjordland National Park. But be patient, because before the delights from the air you get to savor it all from the ground, a winding road heading along mountain passes and past jaw dropping lakes in the wilderness. Keep taking photos as you head deep into the Fjords, transferring to an elegant boat that saunters onto the water of Milford Sound. Rock your head back and look up; those mountain peaks are 4000 feet above the water, sheer vertical walls that coat Milford Sound in mystery and grace. Dolphins and seals play along the rocks, and as the nature cruise continues you coast beside 1,000 foot waterfalls that appear from hidden streams. This journey into Milford Sound could be the unforgettable highlight of any vacation. But now you're getting a new vantage point, the helicopter taking off and soaring between the rugged mountain ridges. Individual fjords roll into the distance and the shimmering whiteness of glaciers juxtapose with hypnotic mountain summits. From up here the views are staggering, a full 360º of absolute splendor. The pilot descends, intimate details of ice sculptures getting closer until you touch down on a hidden glacier. Few people ever see this place, never mind set foot on it. Lose yourself in the beauty and look around at the domineering mountains, soaking up the dazzling inimitability. You're only halfway back to Queenstown, so the propellers start to turn again and you're treated to another journey of stupendous panoramas before a spectacular landing beside the lake."

The green canopy of the trees blend with the passing hills; however, the fuzzy rind of the kiwi stands out, dangling from the treetops. Take the time to explore Katikati, known to the locals as Mural Town. In 1990 the town was facing an economic downturn. In order to lift the town’s spirits and attract visitors, a group of volunteers took it upon themselves to paint the town’s history along its walls. Some of the murals are more avant-garde, the colors embodying the emotion, while other murals are a clear representation of the town’s cultural past, a realistic portrayal of cattle plowing the field with the New Zealand forest neighboring the farms’ edges. Take yourself away from the engrossing murals of Katikati, traveling through Tauranga on your way to your destination. Should you choose to take one final excursion along the way, it is just a short jaunt from Tauranga to the Okere Falls. The spectacular falls are just a short walk and worth a stop.

Lake Wakatipu outlines the city with the Remarkables Mountain Range towering behind it. Bob’s Peak stands above Queenstown and pushes the city closer to the lake’s edge. The breeze blows the scent of evergreens through the quaint, alpine streets. A visit to the Artbay Gallery is warm and inviting. The space showcases the diversity of New Zealand’s artists, from naturalist painters to industrial sculptors. The ongoing arts program includes regular exhibitions, artists in residence, art classes, art talks, and interactive displays that change as often as every two weeks. Walk through the open, industrial styled gallery and experience the magic beyond New Zealand’s landscapes by seeing its current culture in motion, from expressing a connection to tribal roots, to a hopeful decadent future for the nation as a whole; the art is as diverse as New Zealand itself."

        "description": "Arrive in Auckland with the city inviting and the excitement buzzing in your ears. After settling into your accommodation, enjoy the sites of Auckland and its surroundings on an Auckland Harbour Coffee Cruise. Hop aboard a local Kiwi’s yacht, the sail raised into the air to catch the breeze, the splash of the sea on your lips, the pleasant commentary of Auckland and New Zealand’s history coming from the captain. Sip on your coffee, the heat warming you from the inside out as you make your way through the clear blue water of the Waiheke Island-Half Moon Bay. The farther you drift from the shore, the more impressive the skyline. The Sky Tower, the Southern Hemisphere’s largest free-standing structure, stands tall among its surroundings, the sky needled pointing high into the distant sky. The sails of Auckland Harbour wave in the breeze like a collection of sheets trying to blanket the ocean. It is no wonder the Auckland is called the “City of Sails.” After you dock and exit the cruise wander along the urban life of Auckland’s harbors. With the people of New Zealand being just as much of a reason to visit as the country’s landscapes and activities, spend part of the day in Viaduct Harbour. Filled with a fabulous maritime museum that highlights New Zealand’s long history of its nautical connections, the harbor is also a great place to relax, enjoy a drink, and watch the city pass by. Colorful artist types, kooky hipster types, yachtsmen, and everyone in between, pass along the harbor’s walkways, the sea gently rocking the boats. The smell of fresh coffee drifts past you from the Sierra Coffee shop mixing with the salt of the sea. The sun sets beyond the harbor and makes the once blue ocean dance in a fire light."

        "description": "Travel down to Rotorua and experience all you can of the city with the Rotorua Diamond Pass. Known as New Zealand’s “Cultural Capital,” the city offers more than just hot springs and thermal baths. It contains the heart of the indigenous people; it holds the culture of the farmers and ranchers of an entire country, and, of course, it is also a wonderful place to experience hot springs and thermal baths. Whether you want to experience the culture of the local people or indulge in the relaxation of this antique town, having been a spa resort since the late 19th century, there is plenty of time and plenty to enjoy during your stay in Rotorua. Visit the Maori experience of Te Puia where the culture and history come alive. Maori guides tell stories that have been handed down orally from generation to generation. The men dress in woven grass skirts, their faces decorated with T ā moko , which differs from a tattoo due to its application. The green lines swirl around their chins and cheeks in a delicate and graceful swirl. The National Carving and Weaving Schools teaches and displays traditional craftsmen & women at work. The wood is local and smells of fern. The masks are often decorated with the same T ā moko that decorate the men and women carving the work, sometimes including the bulging eyes of a warrior during the haka , traditional war dance, when the drums and voices build to a crescendo, pulsing and echoing through the sky."

        "description": "The new day in Rotorua brings new experiences to enjoy. The breeze brings in the fresh smell of dew off the morning grass. The sun rises slowly in the distance. Fresh pastries and sweet fruit grace the breakfast table. Much of the land of New Zealand is used for pastoral farming with none of its farming being subsidized by the government. The farming community ensured its survival through its own efforts of humane, pasture-based farming techniques. With such a deep, historical connection to farming and to the animals that provide many people a living, a visit to the Agrodome is a must. The famous show is an hour of farm-based action-packed entertainment. The soft smell of sheep lingers in the stadium. The audience is boisterous and the arena full. The experienced farmers jump onto the stage, rock stars in their discipline and speed. The sheep’s wool flies off in a shearing demonstration, the buzzing sound of clippers drowned out by the cheers of the audience. Participate in feeding the lambs, their wool soft beneath your fingers. You can even milk a cow, learning the proper technique, the necessary force and grace that is required to extract the milk. The differences between the Agrodome and Te Puia are apparent but both are equally important to New Zealand and its people for understanding its past, its present, and its future."

As you wave goodbye to the fun and relaxing experiences of Rotarua to make your way to the country’s capital of Wellington, you will pass through Tongariro National Park. Don’t hesitate to stop and explore the Tongariro, New Zealand’s first national park and the world’s fourth. Tongariro is a vast land of juxtaposition. There are fields of snow in the water, unobstructed lava flows chaotically, and the craters that lie among the mountain range are active. You can hike along the volcanoes’ foothills or up to some of the opulent hot springs that speckle the range. Waterfalls trickle and spill down craggy areas. Smoke sometimes rises from the crater. The air is clean and crisp. The sky feels within reach. Take a deep breath and watch the range fade from view as you venture to Wellington arriving later in the day to the welcoming city nestled between the harbor and the hills."

There is never a lack of exciting and lovely things to do including visiting Te Papa, the National Museum of New Zealand, full of the country’s history, from before its European settlers through the evolution of the country that has led to its present. An understanding of its people is easily obtained with a visit to Te Papa, but if you are looking to find the unique flavors of the country, then partake in a decadent luxury of a gourmet food and wine tour. On a tour or traveled independently, you can wander through New Zealand’s Classic Wine Trail to taste the wine, food, and sociability of the region. The Murdoch James Estate is a fine example of the luscious wines and decadent food that flows through the country. The soil is lime based in the Blue Rock Vineyard that gives the white wine a combination of vibrant fruit and a long, lingering mineral sensation. In summer you can relax on the deck and in winter you can snuggle up by the fire. The pan-roasted fish is flaky and tender while the haricot and pancetta broth has a decadent flavor packed with umami. The restaurant will even do a wine and meal pairing to ensure a perfect, unforgettable visit."

The journey takes around three hours and takes you from Wellington to Picton. It has been described as \"one of the most beautiful ferry rides in the world.\" The water reflects the green hills and trees that hover along the shore. Stand along the outer deck and watch the mountain range in the distance drift by, the snow topped peaks standing high and bright in the distance. Oftentimes dolphins swim and laugh in the ferry’s wake, jumping out of the water and diving back into the clear sea. Once you reach the South Island you will make your way down to Christchurch through the opulent seaside town of Kaikoura. Stop along the shoreline and watch the sea lions basking in the sun, drying their fur along the warm rocks. Their gruff barks rise above the sound of crashing waves. They dive back into the water and jump onto crowded rocks cuddling with one another. As the sun moves along the sky, continue your drive down to Christchurch absorbing the beauty of the sea on one side and the mountain ranges on the other."

The lively arts community fits snuggly inside the historic buildings dating back to the late 19th century with the earliest European settlers. The smell of roses fills the streets meandering from the vibrant gardens in the summer. In the winter the fresh snow gives a rosy color to the locals’ cheeks. For an experience and view within the city, hop along one of the restored trams that circle the city proper. Add a bit of ease and local flair, where the locals hop on and off on their way to work, school, the local shop, or to the city center. The hum of the track vibrates the tram. The tram bell rings at intersections giving notice of its presence to those in the area. Christchurch doesn’t just boast its beauty in its architecture and gardens, but contains many museums and activity centers that keep locals and visitors enthralled. Visit the International Antarctic Centre and experience the interactive fun of Antarctica in the relative safety of the educational center. As the third closest country to Antarctica, after Chile and Argentina, you will experience the unforgiving snow, ice, and arctic storms of the world’s last continent, while also learning about the day-to-day life in modern Antarctica from information collected and given from Scott Base. The center is in the heart of a working Antarctic campus where many missions are organized. The blue penguins chirp and waddle their way along the frozen tundra exhibit created just for them. Watch how they fly through the frigid water, chase and catch fish, and groom themselves along the snowy shoreline. The Antarctica Centre is a fun and pleasant time especially knowing that you can leave the perils of the unforgiving continent behind, exit the center and return to the serenity of the “Garden City.”"

Nuzzled in the heart of an ancient volcano, Akaroa is a historic French and British settlement full of colonial architecture and surrounded by pearl blue bays and lush rolling hills. The people are incredibly welcoming and helpful. The streets are lined with pristine white homes, and the roofs are angled and colorful shining against the white of the building’s base and the green of the hills. The people of Akaroa aren’t the only friendly citizens of the area; get up close to New Zealand’s playful Hector's dolphins in Akaroa Harbour. Known as the smallest dolphin they have a rounded dorsal fin with pale gray skin from a distance. However once you float along the water’s surface the dolphins swim ever closer, you will notice the variety of colors that decorate the dolphins; their dorsal fins and flippers are black, their eyes are surrounded by a black mask, and a subtle black shaded band crosses their head behind the blowhole, while their underbellies are buttery white. The water is cool on your skin, the salt coating your goggles. The dolphins bob their heads, circle around you, and laugh at the water’s surface. Their joviality is contagious making everyone in the area smile, laugh, and feel warm."

The green is set in patches and stretches to the base of the Southern Alps looking more like a painting on a movie set than real life. Continue past the evolving landscape of the foothills of the Southern Alps, the South Island being known to have some of the best alpine landscapes in the world, until you arrive at Mt. Cook. Mt. Cook is the highest mountain in New Zealand reaching 12,218 feet. Local legend claims that Mt. Cook was originally a boy frozen by the south wind, and is considered the most sacred ancestor from which the southern tribe has descended. In the warmer months lupines blossom violet and red, their stunning colorful stems rising from the green field. Mt. Cook’s peak continuously rises while surrounded by the sparkling white of the Tasman and Murchison Glaciers to the east, and the Hooker and Mueller Glaciers to the south. Take the journey up Mt. Cook whether on foot or on horseback and pay a close, personal visit to some of the oldest inhabitants of the South Island, the Southern Alps. You could even spend the night beneath the stars. The Milky Way swirls around the night sky, the stars sparkle like diamonds, and you are on the top of the mountain so close to the stars you could practically touch them."

Stop along the suspension bridge and hear the rush of the water pour through the gorge. The cool mist rises from the river below. The rich green along the gorge’s rim clashes with the mineral gray of the rocks that stretch to the gorge’s base beneath the river. Birds linger along the bridge’s railing and sing in the cool mist. Arrive in Queenstown, the adventure capital of New Zealand with plenty of activities to enjoy, whether for the adventurous visitors or those wanting a more relaxed visit. Lake Wakatipu sits along the city’s edge. The breeze blows bringing in refreshingly cool vapor from the lake. The city sits between the lake and Bob’s Peak, the mountain that stands tall above the city opposite the lake. Climb aboard the steepest gondola in the Southern Hemisphere which will carry you to the top of the peak. The entirety of Queenstown unfolds before you as the gondola climbs up the cables. The city looks more like a town in its quaint and small layout; Lake Wakatipu rolls out to the shore of the foothills beyond. The air is crisp at the top of Bob’s Peak, the sound of giggled cries surround you. Feel the wind in your hair and the rush of sweet adrenaline as you make your way on the alpine luge, whether on the speedy, adventurous track or the tranquil, scenic route where the trees hang over the track’s edge giving the scent of pine in the wind as the panoramic view of Queenstown fades to the base of Bob’s Peak and the quaint streets of the city before you."

A short journey outside of Queenstown will take you to the stunning experience of Milford Sound. Nestled in the beauty of the Southern Island’s western shore, the waterway is located inside New Zealand’s Fiordland National Park. The area is of such extreme beauty that Rudyard Kipling once called it, “The eighth wonder of the world.” In the light of the summer morning sun, the haze lifts from the water, the mountains peeking through mist until it burns away to display Milford Sound in all its glory. Surrounded by pristine mountains, lush rainforest clings to the looming cliffs. The sound of rushing water fills the silent air from the waterfalls careening off of the cliff tops. Dolphins swim around through the cold water and play in the boat’s wake. In the proper months whales can be seen breaching the water’s surface, their large bodies jumping into the air and crashing down, their large girth somehow graceful in its fall. Penguins waddle along the shoreline and dive into the water grabbing fish and avoiding whales. The Sound is a place of serene beauty, natural wildlife, and a gem for the locals, human and animal alike."

Enjoy the walk in Queenstown’s safest and most well marked trail as it takes you past the opulent Lake Wakatipu, over to the reflective beauty of Lake Hayes. The trail would even take you through the vistas of Gibbston Valley Winery. Stroll along the vineyard floor for a taste of the region’s luscious wine and decadent food. The smell of oak barrels and earthy vines emanate from the valley floor. Stroll into the Gibbston Valley Winery and try the 2009 Pinot Noir. Its fragrant nose of blueberry and clove makes your mouth water. The palate is full of flowing fruit that complements the dense, soft tannins. Enjoy a snack of savory salami and rich creamy cheese before making your way back to Queenstown. As the sun sets over Lake Wakatipu the water reflects the sunlight to the point where it is hard to know if the sun is rising from the lake’s surface or setting behind the horizon."

Kauri’s forests and rugged cliffs can also be featured on today’s 4WD safari, but the exact plan is up to you. You will need a 4WD vehicle because some of today’s destinations are inaccessible without one."

Every Maori has one or more hand-sculpted pieces, and each style and shape symbolizes something different. For example, the fish hook ( hei matau ) provides protection on the water while the twist ( pikorua) symbolizes a bond between two people and is given as a gift. In a workshop, you will witness the exacting process for creating sacred greenstone pendants, discussing the meanings of various designs of highly symbolic pieces that are used in Maori weddings or as fertility charms. It will be a very exciting morning in Hokitika, which is the place where the majority of the island’s greenstone is harvested. After lunch you will continue along the coast. Your eco resort will be on a golden beach, and it will only be a short walk to the Pancake Rocks and the Blowhole, which are strange pieces of nature that are best enjoyed when you have time to watch them for hours.

Getting to experience how the fjord changes throughout the day is the beauty of an overnight cruise. Just to reach any of the fjords will be at least a three-hour journey from Queenstown. They are located in remote and isolated places but are worth the journey. Milford Sound is the most famous and popular. Reaching Doubtful Sound will take longer, but will create a more private fjord experience. After following the shores of Lake Wakatipu by road, you must then cross Lake Manapouri by boat before traversing the Wilmot Pass in a jeep. You will set sail on a luxury vessel where bottlenose dolphins will become your neighbors. Their fins will join with penguins and seals as you travel deeper into the wilderness. On day nine, there will be an opportunity to kayak along the shoreline or to explore in a tender boat with a naturalist guide. Hearing the eerie nighttime silence will connect you to the fjord, and as you sleep the mist will roll in. After waking up in this strange place, you will have another half-day of cruising, and when the landscape is this unique, it is almost essential to have a second day on the water.

        "description": "Today, you will have a full-day hike to the Pinnacle Rock Formations. By traversing along the Webb Creek Trail, you will cross a series of narrow suspension bridges and find small waterfalls that are located deep within the forest. Most of the trail is shaded, but it is exposed to the sun after Pinnacles Hut, which will be the final 45 minutes of your journey. This section offers spectacular views of the surrounding valleys, and these will only get better when you reach the summit and admire the 360-degree panorama. Although this hike can be divided into two days with a night in a mountain hut, by doing it in one day, you should have the summit mostly to yourself."

The North Island beaches are famously clean and never busy, especially those in lesser-known areas like Coromandel. Trails wind through the trees and connect to different beaches, usually via a stunning, coastal viewpoint. Your guide will outline your options for the day, and you can also spend it lazing around your waterside hotel."

Your time of departure will depend on the tide because there is only a four-hour window to fully enjoy Hot Water Beach. Getting to this long beach first involves a 30-minute walk through the forest and along a stretch of coastal rocks. It is nice to enjoy the serenity here because Hot Water Beach is popular, and you will not have it all to yourself. A volcanic hot spring runs beneath the sand, and your guide will give you a shovel, so you can dig your own natural jacuzzi on the beach within a few meters of the rolling surf."

The hike to Cathedral Cove is easy, and after walking through a cave, you will exit to a hidden beach and cove, where the vistas are a surreal assortment of rocky mountains that look as if they have been cast adrift by the ocean. This Cathedral Cove experience is best early in the morning, and an early start also means that you can fully enjoy your afternoon at Whangamata. From this small town, you will kayak to Whenuakura and follow an estuary into the heart of the island. The tide will push you inland to a lagoon of phantasmagorical color, and after this afternoon island experience, your evening will be relaxing and comfortable along the coast at another of New Zealand’s boutique hotels."

It can seem strange to pass through this part of New Zealand and not partake in the Hobbiton tour, but if you do not have any interest in Lord of the Rings, your guide can lead you along the coast to Mount Maunganui instead. A one-hour up and down hike will provide you with spectacular Pacific views from the summit, and the nearby town has some charming cafes that you can try for lunch.

Single-track mountain bike trails can lead you through the indigenous rainforest just like they can near Rotorua, and you can also go sailing on the lake.

Here, there are icebergs that float in turquoise-hued waters, and you can cruise alongside them, admiring how every iceberg is an entirely different shape. Returning by helicopter will provide you with more stunning views, including one of the rugged coastline."

It is just as tasty and is more fitting given the environment. The rest of your day will be left free, and you can choose to do Akaroa’s most popular activity, which is swimming with Hector’s dolphins. These wild, ocean creatures dance and pirouette through the water, sometimes jumping many meters above the water’s surface. These animals are incredibly playful and enchanting. Seals are another highlight of these waters, and you can often spot whales as well, especially during the winter months. However, it is not an absolute guarantee that you will see the elusive whales.

After flying across a lake, you will land at Doubtful Sound, where a boat tour will provide a stunning impression of a New Zealand fjord. Milford Sound is more famous, but the lack of other boats and visitors makes Doubtful Sound a nicer experience for couples.

They do not add anything to the water here, so it will be pure alpine melt that will be heated to body temperature. Even when it is snowing, you can stay warm here, looking down to admire the river and the mountains."

        "description": "Your tour of Milford Sound will not be private but will be as close to private as you can get. After a sublime road journey across the mountains, you will set off through the famous fjord, watching the scenery through the panoramic suite windows. On the Upper Deck, you might spot dolphins playing in the wake, and down at the front, you can be splashed by waterfalls that tumble hundreds of meters from the cliffs. The boat will anchor, and you can explore on the water, either in a double kayak or on a small boat. Both of these experiences will help you appreciate the true size of the fjord. Milford Sound was even one of the finalists for the new seven wonders of the world. It will be peaceful after dark, and you can relax on your deck or retire to your room that will be deep within the atmosphere of nature."

It is all part of the Milford Sound mystique. Sometimes you can only see ten meters from the boat. If this is to happen, then that means you are extremely lucky, because watching Milford Sound emerge from its gray cover is the most iconic experience to be had in New Zealand, and it can only be possible if you have spent the night on the fjord. By mid-morning, you can grasp how enormous the fjord is, and your boat will still be the only one out on the water. There will be time for another kayak should you wish before returning to the harbor and then Queenstown, where you will take a late-afternoon flight to Christchurch."

These are not captive or trained dolphins. They are wild oceanic creatures who love to play. They are very friendly, so you can jump into the water and swim in their vicinity. Squeaks and tweets can be heard in the water as if the dolphins are narrating their next dance move. After lunch back in the harbor, you will have another chance to swim with playful ocean creatures. This time, it will be seals, and they love to emulate swimmers. The seals may come close, corkscrewing around like a child looking for a friend to play with. They will cajole and charm you, but if you do not swim with the seals, then they will usually head off looking for somebody else. Although encounters with wild animals can never be 100% guaranteed, Kaikoura is a wonderful base to experience how these creatures really live as they swim free in the Pacific."

Indigenous forests will cascade towards rich, blue waters, and small tracks will lead through the trees. If you follow these tracks, you will find near-deserted coves and beaches for you to spend a private moment. It will be easy to go a whole day without seeing or hearing anything other than the birds and lodge staff, so settle into the privacy and call for breakfast whenever you are ready. There are plenty of adventures in nature that can be had here. Coastal tracks will take you across narrow suspension bridges and then up through forests to yet more beaches and coves. In a double person kayak, you can paddle beneath sculptured granite cliffs, perhaps spotting manta rays on the sandy ocean bottom. A small boat tour will take you to tropical tidal coves where the cliffs are exposed, and nature takes on a stunning silence. For these two days, you can relax at the lodge, create your own adventure, dance beneath the southern sky, and bring your romantic two weeks in New Zealand to a close."

The sweet scent of blossomed tulips adds a welcoming fragrance to the streets as Victorian architecture decorates the city. The hum of trolley cars rings through the city center and a gentle trickle emanates from the current of the Avon River as it meanders through the lush parks and around the bustling cobblestone streets. Whether it’s venturing through the various gardens on foot or drifting along the Avon River with the soft scent of spring hovering in the air, Christchurch is the perfect city to welcome you to New Zealand and the splendors of the South Island. For the best introduction to Christchurch, you can take a gondola to the top of Mount Cavendish at more than 1,600 feet above sea level. The cable car will provide you with a fabulous 360-degree view of the city, the cobalt waters lapping against Banks Peninsula, and the sprawling greenery of the Canterbury Plains."

The cobblestone streets of the city center host exceptional wonders, partially rebuilding from the crippling earthquakes in 2010 and 2011. The vibrant life of the city continues to spring from the whirr of the trolley cars and the perseverance of the locals. The flowers blossom along the edges of the river within the nearly 75 acres of public parks. Fantastic art galleries that embody the beauty of the European-style city are packed with bright and bold representations of local and international exhibitions. Collections range from traditional to contemporary works including artists working in light or interactive sculptures. The Art Centre first opened in the 1870s inside a building known for its Gothic Revival architectural design, which was first associated with Canterbury College. After extensive restoration, the buildings have slowly reopened with a collection of boutique shops, charming cafes, and fascinating museums. Popular local artist Min Kim has opened a fine new gallery in the Boys’ High structure showcasing emerging artists from across New Zealand, as well as her own works within different mediums including sculpture, paintings, and handmade glass."

After a delightful breakfast, you will leave the quiet charms of the Garden City behind ready to explore the captivating diversity of the South Island’s famous landscape. En route to Mount Cook Village, you will pass the shores of Lake Tekapo. The peak of Mount Cook, the tallest mountain in the Southern Hemisphere, hovers over the plateau to the west reaching over 12,200 feet above sea level. The lake has a crystal-clear blue sheen that reflects Mount Cook and the surrounding ranges across its surface. After a scenic drive, you reach the helicopter pad near the base of the mountain. The propellers whirr to life and you take off into the air with an exhilarating view of the Aoraki Mount Cook National Park. In summer the alpine plains grow jade grass beneath the glistening glacial surface that wraps around the undulating peaks of Mount Cook, which encompasses 40 percent of the entire protected area. The helicopter lands on a safe plateau, which showcases the remarkable stretch of the Tasman Glacier’s 16-mile expanse. The ice reaches nearly 2,000 feet deep at its deepest point. The upper area on which the helicopter landed hosts pristine, powdery snow and the light glints against the pure ice below. Your crampons grip the ice and help you walk along the shifting but stable terrain. Ice-falls roll down the slopes of the dramatic mountain peaks surrounding the glacier. You touch your fingers to the glacial surface noticing the slick texture against your fingers. Before you return to the helipad, you pass the Hochstetter Icefall, where the chaotic crevassed surface resembles a rushing river frozen in midstream."

The city is best known for its adventurous activities but it has much more to offer. Fabulous luxuries, natural beauty, and an incredible focus on relaxation add to the splendor of the surroundings. You travel through the diverse landscape of Otago to reach the banks of the Dart River, whose water travels nearly 40 miles from the Dart Glacier to Lake Wakatipu. Your jetboat departs from Glenorchy, where the history of gold prospectors and explorers still decorate the surrounding hills and riverbanks. As the boat begins to speed through the river, you can feel it dance effortlessly on the ripples of the crystal-clear water below. Snowcapped mountains stretch alongside the river, giving way to cascading waterfalls that drench the lush banks of the Dart River Valley. The breeze carries the spiced aroma of pine from the forest and the crisp mist splashes against your cheeks. The stunning landscape stretches and winds around you, which highlights the unquestionable majesty of New Zealand. When the boat slows, your guide explains how the melting glaciers of the last ice age shaped the gorges and braided together the rivers on which you travel. You stop on the pebbled shore and stroll on the small trail leading into the dense forest of beech trees, whose quiet ambiance stirs memories of the landscape from the Lord of the Rings film trilogy. After your thrilling boat ride, you will return to Queenstown and ride the Skyline Gondola up the steepest rail in the Sothern Hemisphere reaching nearly 1,500 feet above sea level. Queenstown drops away as the forests that decorate the slopes of Bob’s Peak reach closer. Lake Wakatipu glistens in the sunset as you relax with the breathtaking 220-degree view extending from Coronet Pea to the Remarkables Mountain Range."

You board the boat and begin your journey through the landscape where the silent beauty of the sound gives way to the thunderous crash of cascading waterfalls. The boat floats past lush forest that spreads along the upper edges of the surrounding the foothills. Sporadic trees emerge from the rugged shoreline and along the cliffs before the karsts plunge beneath the water’s surface. The iconic image of Mitre Peak rises over a full mile into the sky, dwarfing the boat and the surrounding mountain summits. Your captain tells you to keep watch along the boat’s edges, as bottlenose dolphins are known to play in the wake of the boat, speeding along with the ship and jumping into the air to show off for passengers. Mist drifts upwards from the crashing waters of Stirling Falls, which reaches nearly 500 feet in height. The cascade, named for Captain Frederick Stirling, captures your attention like a jewel amidst the fascinating scenery."

Whether you explore the hiking paths around Bob’s Peak or relax in comfortably heated pools beneath the stars, Queenstown is filled with stunning luxuries and sensational activities. For a delicious taste of New Zealand, you can wander outside of Queenstown and along the Otago wine trail. The lush green of the vines wraps around bark like bushels and stretch over the foothills giving the wines and vineyards diverse flavors. The rolling hills spread into the surrounding mountains. You can sit on the veranda and feel the gentle valley breeze rush over the vines as the scent of rich earth and ripening grapes rises from the grass. You sip the luscious Amisfield Pinot Noir 2011 and smell the aromas of baking spices and fine oak rise from the glass. The silky zest coats your palate and the sun glistens on the vineyard’s lingering dew for another sweet moment to cherish."

The city is considered New Zealand’s cultural capital as it showcases the fascinating disparity of European resort history and Maori cultural history. Antique structures line the streets at the heart of town with balconies adorning the preserved Victorian architecture, which boasts geometric railings that stretch the lengths of the terraces. The city is rich with conserved Maori and European cultural significance while geysers and mud pools gurgle in the distance. The cool breeze drifts through the streets as steam rises from the geothermal lakes. In the evening, you attend a traditional hangi, a banquet where the food is cooked in an underground oven. Flax leaves typically cover the different ingredients, from root vegetables like sweet potatoes to chicken or fish, pumpkin or lamb. The long and slow cooking process infuses a smoky flavor and earthy fragrance into the food and instills a tender texture. The hangi accompanies a performance by members of a Maori tribe that perform cultural dances, including the haka."

Roses and tulips blossom in the sunlight while native trees shade you from the warm day as they dangle their branches and spread their leaves along the tranquil pathways. You can almost hear the geothermal fields that surround the gardens, sizzling, bubbling, and sprouting water. Your exploration of the city leads you to the Whakarewarewa Thermal Reserve. A knowledgeable Maori guide leads you through the mud pools that bubble from the subterranean heat and mineral springs that shine a translucent blue against limestone rocks. Geysers like Pohutu erupt into the sky, spreading mist into the air like clouds before crashing down onto the weatherworn terrain. Pohutu erupts with enough force to send the water 100 feet into the air upwards of 20 times a day. The adjacent geyser known as the Prince of Wales’ Feathers begins to gurgle shortly before Pohutu explodes, giving visitors in the area advance notice of the spectacle to come. Afterward, you visit the Kiwi House where the nocturnal kiwi, New Zealand's renowned national bird, stretches its long legs and elongated beak."

You stop at the Waitomo Caves and follow your guide through the mouth of the cavern and into the swarming darkness. The limestone is cool and glossy against your fingers. The sound of trickling water echoes against the smooth walls. Climb aboard a boat and travel deeper into the heart of the cave as the water pulses around you. The region’s geological activity has shaped approximately 300 limestone caves over 30 million years with walls reaching upwards of 650 feet thick. The depths of the cavern give way to a bright glow.

This premier destination highlights the natural splendors of New Zealand and the charms of a mythological village of Middle Earth as it boasts the mystical hobbit holes. The vibrant village encompasses 44 hobbit homes with gardens, hedges, and a mill. The arch bridge crosses the babbling river and the thatch roof on the pub captures the ambiance of a historic hamlet spanning 14 acres. The Green Dragon pub welcomes visitors inside with the promise of delicious beer, savory dishes, and the aroma of oak emanating from the wood features. You wander inside of Bilbo Baggins’s famous home by stepping through the circular green door at Bag End. The unfinished walls and empty rooms reflect the magic of movies, as the interior scenes were filmed in a studio in Wellington. As you arrive in Auckland, the harbors fill with boats returning from the calm sea, giving Auckland the title “City of Sails.” The city opens itself to you as the largest and most diverse city in the country.

Glowworms adorn the cave walls and fill the dark cavern with their twinkling presence.

        "description": "Begin your day with a venture to New Zealand’s largest bubbling mud pool at Wai-O-Tapu. The hot springs sizzle and steam beneath the elevated walkways. Lady Knox geyser erupts high into the sky; mist pressured into the air crashes down back to earth. From a distance the geyser looks like little more than a termite mound; however, when the eruption begins and the water sprays forth, the force from which the mist is ejected from the earth is another example of earth’s awesome power. Continue your exploration of the landscape that has shaped New Zealand’s past and present with a visit to Waimangu Volcanic Valley. The eruption of Mt Tarawera spread open the spectacular world of the bush covered, geothermal expanse. The water sparkles an opulent blue as the earth mists and steams around the water. Rock formations bleed and blend colors, looking more like a melted painting by Salvador Dalí than earth. From the sizzling earth and thundering rivers, to the chants of the Maori tribes that have called the region home for millennia, you will see and hear the inextricable link of thermal activity and the cultural evolution that has left the landscape and the Maori entwined. Follow your guide through the traditional village located within the volcanic valley, where you can experience a live weaving display within the art and craft gallery. The carvings of the traditional meetinghouse burst from the posts with facial art, bulging eyes, and protruding tongues in imitation of spirits and warriors. As the sound of exploding geysers and thundering water fades into the distance, the oral history of the Maori people fills the quiet. Listen and learn about the people that have called New Zealand home, considered descendants of a long ago Polynesian tribe. The stories fade, the sizzle and bubble of the geyser disappears, and you make your way back to your accommodation full of cultural understanding and the memory of the bubbling earth."

Hear the water splash as warriors paddle down the river in an ancient canoe, their chants rising above the slapping water.

The tribespeople showcase their ta moko , body art, with spectacular, detailed designs that wrap around their shoulders, chests, and even faces. The warrior chant begins and tingles your spine and raises the hair on the back of your neck. The power in the warriors’ voices booms through the village. They stomp their feet. They pound their chest. The haka echoes into the night sky as you watch the war chant burst from their souls. The chant dissipates into the air and is replaced by the delicious and comforting taste of dinner."

The sheltering mountain ranges at the northern tip of the South Island give the area a Mediterranean style climate that helps keep the water pure and the landscapes lush. A journey to Farewell Spit offers you the longest sandspit in New Zealand. What once was a sandbar that connected the North and South Islands, the water is receding and may one day, but not one day soon, connect the islands once again. The sandbar is situated against the rush of ocean and the dancing grass. The sand is marked with grooves from the wind and mist that makes the banks look more like a sand dune in the Sahara than a sandy hill on an ocean shore. Rocky coasts surround the area as the splash of ocean mist sprays the air and echoes across the sand. As you cross over the mountains and through the trees making your way back to Nelson, the wonders of the South Island have not ceased to amaze you, while giving you the understanding of the exceptional link between the natural wonders and cultural identity of the people."

Whether wandering along the earthen path or venturing into the depths of the caves, the rushing water of the Oparara River carves through the forest. The gentle chirp of birds mixes with the rush of the river. The park is pure in its age and conservation as insects and fish thrive. The caves, forest, and river lay home to the rare short-tailed bat, the giant land snail, and the steel-gray of the Blue duck."

This anxiety will soon fall away as you appreciate how the country sets the standard for safety. New Zealand is where many of the world’s adventure activities have been tested and perfected before being copied elsewhere around the world. Ziplining in Rotorua is very safe, and you will feel the exhilaration upon completing the course. After lunch, the Maori will take over. Geothermal activity can be found all over Rotorua, and the Maori use this for many things from cooking to bathing. This underground activity has real power as well. You will marvel at the geyser, and nothing may happen for five, ten, or maybe twenty minutes. Then it will explode with a jet of water that shoots 20 meters into the sky. It is truly an impression of nature’s power. Nearby, you can see bubbling hot pools and mud baths where colors spiral in strange formations. Your dinner will be cooking underground on the thermals, which is a hangi style of cooking that you will share with your Maori hosts. Before dining, you must be formally introduced.

The guides will leave you here with a picnic, and the day will be yours to enjoy and explore. This is a very exclusive New Zealand experience, but again, it is typical of the country. With so much space and wilderness, there is always a place just for two. A helicopter adds some adventure, and the picnic will come with delicacies from all across the South Island."

Once you are inside the bay, there is silence, and it is an inspiring place to be as it is so cut off from everything. To gain access, you must first be welcomed by the Maori. They will give you the traditional visitor treatment, and a senior Maori will accompany you through the land, showing you where to pray and pay homage.

This is New Zealand’s tropical zone, where the Pacific waters are warm and small islands evoke images of paradise. With three days on the yacht, you can tailor a route that is based on your personal interests. The captain knows some spots that are ideal for fishing and spearfishing, and others should you wish to have an afternoon on a deserted beach. A jet ski and kayaks are towed behind the boat and will provide other means of exploring during these three days. Diversity is what makes the New Zealand outdoors so special. After glaciers, fjords, mountains, and probably some snow, you will now be exploring exotic blue waters and islands. Many of the islands are not accessible without a private boat, so the charter cruise opens opportunities to see wilderness areas that remain just as nature created them. You will sleep on the yacht. Plus, this way you can dine on the deck as the sunset paints the horizon on remote Pacific Ocean waters.

The boutiques clustered around Little Collins Street are funky and fresh with styles that range from avant-garde and international, to strictly Australian, bannering the proud cry, “Ozzie, Ozzie, Ozzie!” across the garment’s chest. The street art that coats the city is vibrant and adored, colorful pieces that range from political satire to comic book appreciation.

The wind blows lightly through the bearings, the ships and the sea calm beneath you. It is a quick and awesome walk to the AJ Hackett base at the center of the bridge.

Rotorua is considered the cultural center of New Zealand and there is no better place to learn about the Maori culture than at the Maori equivalent of a barbeque. A deep hole is dug and filled with coals and burning wood, covered by a metal rack, and covered in foil. The hole is then stuffed with traditional vegetables like purple sweet potatoes and carrots. Eventually, lamb and poultry are placed into the hole to cook. The air fills with the scent of tender lamb and roasted carrots. The beat of drums surrounds the crowd and Maori warriors’ eyes bulge out as they perform the Haka , the Maori war dance.

As the water rushes down the mountainside, it leaves a powerful echo in the trees and sends mist flying into the air. Milford Sound is filled with the silent beauty of nature untouched. The water reflects the mountains and the sky with such lucidity that sometimes its hard to see where the water stops and the sky begins. Cruise through the Sound where dolphins jump alongside the boat with playful glee and seals lounge on the rocks. Water drifts down the rock faces, and in some places, charges down the rocks.

The Meeting House is perfumed with polished wood and a deep sheen. The walls are adorned with spirits carved into the wood, decorated with smiles, body art, and large eyes. You can also visit the ceremonial war canoe, the largest of its kind, and witness the incredible detail and care that the Maori placed into their art, their surroundings, and their lives."

Travel along the ocean as it glows a vibrant blue in the sunlight. The mist rises into the air and perfumes the sky. The gentle lull of the boat glides along the coastline as foothills rise and fall, sandy beaches give way to rising cliffs, and a brilliant white lighthouse shines on the shore. Wander around the famous Piercy Island at the northernmost point of New Zealand, known for the large tunnels that have been carved through the rock by wind, water, and time. Travel through the smooth limestone tunnel or take the opportunity to jump off the boat and swim in the deepwater of the Pacific before returning to land and making your way back to Auckland for the night."

Depart from Auckland and watch the Sky Tower fade behind the horizon as you wind your way through large trees and expansive prairies. Make a stop at the Waitomo Caves and ready yourself for an exceptional tour to and through the center of the earth. Run your fingers along the smooth limestone of the cave walls as you travel deeper into the earth’s center. The soft sound of rushing water travels through the tunnels while you follow your guide and meander through the subterranean expanse. When you reach the water’s edge, climb aboard the boat and drift into the darkness, but not for long. Specks of light shine in the distance, spread around the cave’s ceiling like stars in the sky. The purple and blue sparkle comes from the famous glowworms that are stretch throughout the grotto giving radiance to the darkness. Follow the shine through, and eventually out of the cave as you continue on to Rotorua. Arrive in Rotorua as the city’s surroundings sizzle and steam. Originally built and famed as a resort town due to its active hot springs, Rotorua is now considered to be New Zealand’s cultural capital, home to the country’s most active Maori experiences and European history. Tonight you will venture into a hangi, a traditional Maori feast, where you will immediately catch the rich scent of roasting meat and sweet potato from the subterranean barbecue slow-roasting dinner. Be welcomed into the meetinghouse with a hongi , the traditional greeting of pressing your noses together as a sign of familiarity. As the music begins you can hear the pounding of chests and the deep grunts of warriors. The Maori stomp their feet and bulge out their eyes showing you the famously feared haka . As the night wears on and the glow of the fire begins to settle, your adventure through Rotorua fades into sleep."

Today is yours to experience the exceptional landscape and life of Rotorua beginning with a visit to Te Wakarewarewa Thermal Reserve. The earth sizzles and smolders as you wander the walkways of the reserve. The earth is scorched and bleached from millennia of sulfuric water and volcanic pressure. Watch as Pohutu, New Zealand’s largest and most reliable geyser, erupts and water sprays high into the air almost fifteen times a day. Mud pools bubble and hot pools have been used to boil vegetables and seafood. From the smoldering earth to the cultural home of the Maori, there is so much to see and do within the reserve; visit the Maori Arts and Crafts institute where you could take a lesson in woodcarving. The wood is gruff in your hand but will soon become a smooth spirit resembling the decorated spirits on the meetinghouse. The wonders and fun of New Zealand are never-ending as you make your way to Rainbow Springs, the North Island’s premier conservation and sanctuary, open and encouraging to the public. The site boasts a population of New Zealand’s native animals, from reptiles such as the Tuatara, considered to be the closest living relative to the dinosaurs, to birds such as the Kiwi, the long beaked and flightless bird for which New Zealand is known. Whether traversing the grounds to see the animals or exploring the conservation efforts, there is no lack of activity to enjoy before you make your way back to Auckland and settle in for the evening."

Board the sightseeing boat and begin your journey out to sea. The ocean is filled with vibrant life, including Dusky dolphins that swim with the speeding boat, their dorsal fins gliding through the water’s surface. You can hear the gentle spritz of a whale’s breath a short distance away, a pod quickly swimming along the surface of the sea. Their bodies are expansive, somehow at odds with their grace in the water. A fin rolls through the air; there is another spritz of breath and then a large body rises sharply from the sea and crashes with an envious thunder. As you make your way back to shore, the whales continue their journey, and you will never forget your whaling adventure."

This is an island without electricity pylons, so locals use generators and solar panels."

        "description": "After a short flight back to Auckland, you will be transferred by road to Kawhia, which is a mostly forgotten beach town on the North Island’s western coast. The beach is quiet and spacious, although its color is very different from elsewhere in New Zealand. Volcanic, black sand gives Kawhia a unique appearance. Kawhia is a sleepy town with a very typical, old-world Kiwi lifestyle. You can indulge in a short stroll out of the town before your guide leads you to a black beach and gives you a shovel so that you can dig your own jacuzzi."

Reaching the falls is part of your experience, and you will trek through luscious forest and traverse among natural stone sculptures. You may even have to remove your shoes and wade across in some places, hop between stones in others, and climb up to swing bridge crossings that provide spectacular views. The trail runs parallel to the falls for some beautiful views and continues above the falls as well."

You will witness how certain traditions remain integral to today’s lifestyle while also discovering how the people have adapted and evolved to the 21st century. This morning with the Maori will be an informal way to explore their history, and you will also be guided around a forest to discover how different plants and trees can be used. Stories of settlers and warriors will evoke New Zealand’s early years, and a large family lunch can give you as powerful a welcoming as any war dance. After lunch, you will be transferred onto the coast and a two-night stay on Waihi Beach."

Reaching the bay is an adventure, which is a one-hour hike of epic coastal views and overgrown trails. Hiking is the only way to reach this bay and beach, and you will set off on foot before quickly feeling cut off from the rest of the world. As with every day on your North Island vacation, you will not have a definitive time to start trekking or a limit on how long you can spend on the beach. Your guide will provide you with a picnic, and today is really all about escaping into off-the-beaten-track serenity."

The beauty of New Zealand awaits you as a warrior’s adrenaline courses through you. The sound of clanking swords and grunting Orcs swirls in your ears. Gandalf’s voice rings in your head urging your adventure forward and you have happily accepted. Land in Auckland, New Zealand’s largest and most diverse city at the edge of Middle Earth. Known as the City of Sails, boats decorate the harbors with colorful bows and tall masts. The water is calm along Auckland’s shores as the scent of evergreen from the city’s remarkably lush surroundings flows through the outlying streets. Soon you will make your way into the depths of Middle Earth but for now, you will be able to explore the wonderful diversity of Auckland. The city skyline, including the Sky Tower, stands tall above the harbors giving depth and diversity to the cityscape.

The doors are circular and colorful. The windows are an eclectic mix of stained glass that shine bright colors into the homes. The gardens are filled with a vivacious life of yellow, purple, and red daisies. The gentle trickle of the river roams through the village, as the laughter of the Green Dragon Inn is contagious and compelling.

The city contains a connection to its historic Maori culture along with its European settlers. The reminders of Rotorua’s original intent, being a thermal spa and resort settlement, is still apparent and prevalent; however, the cultures that may have once been threatened by the influx of outsiders have instead shaped themselves around the city’s growth. Enjoy Rotorua’s diversity by visiting the Maori Arts and Crafts Institute at Te Puia. Visit the pā , a small, delicately carved storehouse meant to safeguard heirlooms and treasures. The rich red color stands out against the surrounding forest. The faces that decorate the structure represent Maori spirits; the eyes bulge through the carvings, the designs swirl across protruding bodies representing the tā moko , traditional body art. The surrounding thermal valley is also steeped in the historic culture and mythology of the Maori tribe, where the goddesses of fire travel through the earth creating geysers, hot pools, and volcanoes as they search for their brother. From the exceptional creation stories of myths and legends to the uncanny imagination of Middle Earth, New Zealand contains and maintains its majesty."

The lake was born from a volcanic eruption that legend says was so large that it darkened the skies across the globe. The water shimmers in the sunlight brightening the surrounding city and forest. Take a moment to wander around the exceptional landscape of the lake and visit the Craters of the Moon. It is easy to imagine Frodo and Samwise Gamgee trudging through the tumult of the valley. The valley floor hisses and emits clouds of steam. The heat beneath the terrain can be felt from the elevated walkways as you peer into earthen buckets of boiling mud.

Chaotic lava flows have created vast barren areas along the foothills, while winter snowfields, hot springs, and active craters stand side by side.

The trees are lush and surround the reservoir filling the area with the scent of evergreen trees. The water is still and reflective of the surrounding hills.

Although the set has been broken down, a visit to where Bree was located makes the village easy to assemble in your mind. The hills roll along foothills. Sheep graze in the vibrant grass. As you stand in the field where Bree once stood it is easy to imagine Frodo stumbling through the Inn and meeting Aragon, the sound of laughter echoing in the field. Continue on to the quarry where Helms Deep once stood proud against the steep bluffs. The mountains loom over the craggy expanse, snow sitting atop their peaks. The sky is crisp and perfumed with earth, the ground is rocky and gray. The battle of Helms Deep lingers in the air as you recall the Orcs breaking down the castle hull and forcing their way into the deep.

The South Island’s horizon comes into view as you glide closer, the ocean mist cool on your skin. As you dock in Picton you will continue on to the seaside city of Nelson. Water along the shore of the South Island looks a more vibrant turquoise. The mountains look lusher. The sand on the beaches on the outskirts of Nelson is warm beneath your feet and the water is cold around your toes. Downtown is a pleasant array of quaint Victorian architecture that stretches through the streets. As you arrive in Nelson, before making your way to the luxuries of your accommodation, you could visit the incredible Jens Hansen Gold and Silversmith shop, the original forgers of Sauron’s ring. The sleek gold of the ring shimmers beneath the showcase lights.

Whether winding through the hills or wandering within the smooth marble of the caves, there is plenty of curvaceous terrain to explore above and below the expanse of the hills. The trees along the road are thin and wistful as you venture to Harwood Hole, New Zealand's deepest vertical shaft. The long rope descending into the pit highlights the cave’s incredible depth.

Rocks protrude from the shallow sea where seals laze in the sunlight and bark as kayaks pass by. Split Apple Rock sits close to the shore surrounded by the vibrant glare of the water. The rock formation is smooth and cool in the sun. It is also true to its name as the split boulder looks like two halves of an apple. Or you could venture into the forest filled with a dense green, where a bridge dangles over the depths of the river below. Exchange the cool salty air for the minty green of pine. Within the confines of the forest, you can find the stunning Wainui Falls. The tumult of water fills the pond, as the water spills from the trees up top where for a moment you have stumbled back into the depths of Middle Earth battling to protect Frodo and the ring he carries."

The pancake rocks are limestone formations created from lime-rich fragment deposits on the seabed and topped with weak layers of soft mud and clay. Earthquakes helped shape the immense coastal cliffs and protruding coastline. The pancake rocks look like thin layers of rocky paper stacked atop one another until forming the cliff on the shoreline. The rocks change color in the sunlight, shifting from bright gray to a rich red. The crash of the water fills the air. Heavy ocean swells crash into the caverns beneath the rocks causing water to blast skywards through the blowholes, raining ocean over the rocks and the shoreline. On the shores of the lively coast or hiding in the leaves of the dense forest, the South Island is a constant reminder of New Zealand’s captivating beauty and Middle Earths exceptional terrain.

The Blue Pools of Haast Pass sit quietly at the base of the limestone glowing bright blue in the sunlight. The limestone shines a pristine white against the pool as the green trees glisten gracefully. The gravel path is carefully maintained and winds through the silver beech forest where tui calls echo through the trees. The clear pools are fed by glaciers and give the water a deep azure allowing you to see right to the bottom. Due to the pool’s clarity, brown trout call the pools home and look like they are suspended in the mid-air. As you get closer to Wanaka you travel through the Golden Plains, where Black Riders searched for Frodo and Orcs descended upon the fellowship.

The large kings stretch out their hands almost as if to invite you in or keep you out. As you get closer to Te Anau you will drive through the ominous Dead Marshes of Middle Earth, Kepler Mire.

The peaks of the Southern Alps stand tall on the side of Lake Manapouri; however, the majesty of Middle Earth has yet to reveal itself, until you board the Sound cruiser and begin to explore Doubtful Sound. The ship is large with three sails climbing the masts, catching the wind, and floating out to sea. The cruise ship drifts quietly in the glacial water of the sound. Mountains contain the waterway and dwarf the ship and its sails. The crisp scent of saltwater combines with the fern trees that blanket the landscape. The mountain peaks are covered in opulent white snow, melting down into streams, carving into the fragile terrain, and morphing into waterfalls and thundering into the water. The sound is untouched; the still water reflects the faultless landscape, surrounding you on all sides by ineffable beauty. Penguins line the rocks; their yellow hair sits along the ridges of their eyes looking like a mixture of fuzzy eyebrows and slick hair. Their beaks are orange and long. They waddle along the boulder covered shores, dive into the water, and swiftly fish in the sea. They return back to the boulder, bask in the sun, and dry on the rock’s warmth.

The ice continues to shift and move at times filling the space between the mountains with a thunderous rumble and clouds of snowy dust. The glacier winds and twists through the mountain basins like a rambunctious river trying to break free from the ice. Although not highlighted in the Lord of the Rings, the glacier shines as a perfect example of New Zealand’s beauty, Middle Earth's majesty, and the fascinating expanse of Tolkien’s mind.

        "description": "Auckland quickly impresses its charms on its visitors. Pop-up bars and small boutiques can be found along the water, and different neighborhoods have their own unique styles that are showcased best in locally operated cafes and eateries. Hills jump up in the middle of the city and will provide you with an excellent place to look down across the city. After landing at Auckland International Airport, you will be transferred to a hotel next to the harbor. The afternoon and evening will be at your leisure, so you can choose to stay near your hotel or to explore the city interior. With either option, you will discover New Zealand’s laid-back way of life."

        "description": "You can choose from two classic experiences today. Sailing is integral to Auckland’s culture, and you can sit back on an America\u0000’s Cup yacht and cruise through Auckland Harbour. A half-day sailing expedition will have you passing tropical islands and probably encountering pods of dolphins as you experience the local love for sailing. Your other option will be to travel to the Waitakere Ranges, where you can stroll in a luscious rainforest and discover volcanic, black sand beaches. Moreover, you will be able to choose from an array of great restaurants for dinner."

        "description": "After crossing the Harbour Bridge this morning, you will soon be exploring the great wilderness that is the North Island. You will have a stop in Matakohe to visit the Kauri Museum before walking in Waipoua Forest, where majestic trees create an ancient green world that is loved by tropical birds. While admiring some of the enormous old kauris, you will also witness colorful ferns, especially the giant ones that line your route along the Hibiscus Coast to Omapere and the Bay of Islands. As with every day on your vacation, today’s transfer will be private and fully guided with the option to stop at many different places depending on your mood and interests."

        "title": "Paihia – Cruising the Bay of Islands",
        "description": "Calm inland waters make the Bay of Islands a soporific place to spend a day. This Pacific piece of the North Island is where the indigenous Maori met with new European settlements. Hopefully, you will witness a traditional Maori canoe during this morning’s sailing trip. If not, it will be beautiful just to cruise around the islands and jump out at deserted beaches. The yacht will bring you to Russell, which is a place of inspiring history that made New Zealand what it is today. After lunch in the small coastal town, you will be led on a cultural tour before continuing onward for two nights on the water in Paihia."

        "description": "The Northland is dominated by wilderness. Ninety Mile Beach really is 90 miles in length, and its sand is golden and incredibly broad. You can find seclusion here, but you can also find adventure, such as on a quad bike tour over immense sand dunes or a rally car expedition around the world rally route. Any trip to Ninety Mile Beach has to include Cape Reinga, where you can stand at the island’s northern tip and gaze across merging waters. After a day trip to the far north, you will have a leisurely evening back in Paihia, where the atmosphere will meet every expectation at a secluded, beachside lodge."

Hobbiton is en route to Rotorua, and it can be an enchanting experience of wandering past 38 strange hobbit holes and reenacting some of the movie scenes. Hobbiton is the island’s most iconic destination, and the movie set has been expertly preserved. You can almost imagine a hobbit poking his head from one of the holes."

        "title": "Rotorua – Geothermal Wonders and Maori Tradition",
        "description": "This morning, you will visit one of the key geothermal areas for a full tour of mud pools, geysers, steaming springs, and volcanic colors. Many Rotorua hotels have been built on geothermal currents, and you can spend the afternoon in your hotel’s spa, where various pools can help you to refresh after a week in New Zealand. Before sunset, you will be led to a Maori cultural center, where you can watch a few more geysers and pools before being invited to dine by a Maori chief. The welcoming will be spectacular as the community comes out to give a message of peace. All the stamping and huffing will come to a crescendo when the community performs a Maori haka or war dance, but it will all be for fun and complemented by more singing and dancing. You will end the evening with a hangi dinner, which will be a rich feast of slowly roasted meat and vegetables."

        "description": "Mount Tarawera is a domineering volcano that towers above Rotorua with a threat of eruption. It last erupted in 1981 and continues to bubble away. This morning, you will take a scenic flight around and over the crater before touching down on the volcano for a short hike around the crater rim. Its colors will impress you, and beneath your feet, you will be able to feel how lava has hardened. Your afternoon in Rotorua has been left free, so you can arrange outdoor activities locally. These activities include mountain biking along single tracks through indigenous forest, kayaking to an island hot spring, and exploring more geothermal areas."

        "dayNumber": "9",
        "title": "Taupo – Huka Falls and Lake Taupo",
        "description": "Huka Falls cascades a blissful color of blue, soft and turquoise in a way unlike any other waterfall. This magnificent waterfall will be an easy stop as you travel to Taupo for two nights of staying on the lakeshore. Like Rotorua, Lake Taupo is located in the North Island’s volcanic heart, and there are strange things happening beneath the ground. Steam sizzles up through gaps in the Earth's crust, creating hot pools and natural steam baths. Some waters bubble warm while others are remarkably cold. On a private sailing excursion, you will visit some of these strange swathes of water in addition to sitting back and soaking up the superb Taupo landscape."

        "description": "Tongariro is New Zealand’s oldest national park and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is an active volcano with 12 different cones and a history of erupting vents. Shimmering pools cluster upon the volcano, colorful waters merge together, and the strange colors are something that you may expect on Mars. After hiking to one peak, you will find another series of cones and peaks. By taking a one-way route, you will ascend on a crossing trail to the cones and craters. With a local guide, you will tackle this famous hike. The hiking can be a challenge, and this is not an easy day, especially when snow carpets the highest slopes."

        "title": "Napier – The New Zealand Home of Art Deco",
        "description": "After your hike, you may want some downtime, which is where Napier excels. The town’s center remains almost completely art deco as if it has been frozen in the 1920s or 1930s. Inspired by European styles, the town still has a quirky love of art and originality, and it will be showcased on a comfortable walking tour through the city. After your transfer and tour, you can spend the afternoon lazing around Napier, perhaps checking out the many wine boutiques and bars. Napier is an excellent North Island destination because it provides a real contrast to other cities in New Zealand, with vintage cars that roam the streets and old-world architecture that hangs above the ocean."

        "dayNumber": "12",
        "title": "Napier – Hawkes Bay Wine Tasting",
        "description": "Napier can also be a base for discovering the wines of Hawke's Bay, which is New Zealand’s oldest wine-growing region. On today’s private tour, you will visit a minimum of three Hawkes Bay wineries. This diverse wine region can reflect your mood, and after taking you to a large and well-known vineyard, your guide will have a good idea of the wine styles that you do and do not like. Lunch will include a wine pairing before your guide tailors an afternoon of tasting to your palate. This can include meeting the winemaker at a small boutique winery or some of the region’s full-bodied red wines that have garnered international acclaim."

        "description": "Wellington will complete your North Island vacation, and the city is far smaller than most people realize. The New Zealand capital is charming, can be easily walked in just a couple of hours, and really emanates the country’s easy-going atmosphere. After your private transfer, you can check-in to your hotel early. Your local city tour will end at the National Museum of New Zealand, where a Maori guide will lead you on a Te Papa journey. Your tour will end with a traditional kapu ti or hot drink and some Maori nibbles. Wellington has many excellent restaurants for your final meal in New Zealand."

        "description": "Many international flights out of Wellington depart in the evening, so you will have a free day to explore more of the New Zealand capital. Late check out will be arranged, so you can explore the city before freshening up for a private airport transfer and your return flight home."
