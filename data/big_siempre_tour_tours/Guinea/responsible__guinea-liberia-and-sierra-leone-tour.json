  "generalInfo": "An innovative itinerary combining three of West Africa’s least visited countries. Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone have been blighted in recent years by the scourges of Africa, disease and war, but are now opening up again to curious travellers keen to look beyond the dated stereotypes. With unique histories, age old traditions and inspiring landscapes, both have a huge amount to offer the Africa enthusiast.<br/><br/>We start in Conakry then make our way into the Fouta Djalon highlands - without a doubt one of West Africa’s most beautiful areas, with breathtaking mountain scenery, gushing waterfalls and lush forests, dotted with traditional villages, and we spend time discovering the region and meeting its inhabitants. From here, we return to the lowlands and the thick forests of eastern Guinea, home to secret societies and arcane traditions that are fast being lost elsewhere.<br/><br/>On our way into Liberia we track chimpanzees, then explore the lively capital of Monrovia, learning about its unique history and Americo-Liberian culture. We then cross the border into Sierra Leone.<br/><br/>Here we meet people seeking their fortune in the diamond trade, see traditional mask dances and spend a couple of nights on the idyllic Banana Islands with their gorgeous beaches and fishing villages, as well as visiting the historic fort at Bunce Island.<br/><br/>An exciting and pioneering journey through a little known part of the continent.",
