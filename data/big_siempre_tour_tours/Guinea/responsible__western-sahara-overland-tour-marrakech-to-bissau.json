  "generalInfo": "This breathtaking journey offers travellers the chance to traverse the diverse natural and cultural landscapes of Africa, on an epic scale from the Maghreb to the dense forests of Guinea-Bissau, allowing you to experience the gentle transition from the Islam of the north to the animism of West Africa. Starting in the city of Marrakech, the end point of the Saharan camel caravans of old, we journey through the lands of the Berbers and across the mighty High Atlas Mountains, to the magical landscapes of the Draa Valley, encountering huge dunes and semi-nomadic people living in the desert.<br/><br/>From here our journey into the arid lands south begins, travelling south through endless horizons and stopping at small desert towns along the way, the Sahara getting ever closer. From Tarfaya we enter the disputed territory of the Western Sahara, a land of Saharawi nomads, rolling dunes and camel trains, where traditions are strong and the scenery awe-inspiring. Stopping at wells and to meet local people, we spend a few days exploring here before rejoining the coastal road south, crossing into the desert republic of Mauritania, where we visit the age-old city of Chinguetti and explore the striking Adrar region before moving on to Senegal. <br/><br/>As the Sahara starts to disappear into the Sahel we search for wildlife, see the striking Lac Rose, and visit the former colonial capital of St Louis. Travelling further south we make a brief stop in the Gambia before arriving in the Casamance region, where Islam and Christianity never quite managed to dominate; this is the Africa of old, where ancient beliefs and customs are still revered, a world away from the lands we have just crossed, and we take time to learn about the cultural traditions of its people. <br/><br/>Our last country on the incredible journey is Guinea-Bissau; here we visit traditional communities, explore old abandoned towns and spend two days sailing between the islands of the stunning Bijagos Archipelago. This is a journey like no other, showing you the incredible variety that exists within just one small part of the continent; we hope that you’ll be as excited as we are!",
