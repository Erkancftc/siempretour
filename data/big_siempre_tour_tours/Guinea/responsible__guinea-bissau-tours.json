Gain insights into medicinal forest plants at a tribal 'clinic', then learn how to desalinate land for crop cultivation.  <br/><br/>Go in search of elusive saltwater hippos as well as other wildlife from flamingos to crocodiles, sailing between idyllic islands – with stop-offs along the way to pay tribute to the tribal chiefs on some 'secret' islands. Depending on the time of year, you may experience the Vaca Bruto Wild Bull Dancing Mask Festival or witness the natural spectacle of nesting turtles.  <br/><br/>You'll also visit the ‘ghost town’ of Bolama (the country's former Portuguese capital) along with the sacred village of Okinka Pampa - resting place of countless tribal queens.",
