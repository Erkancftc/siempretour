  "generalInfo": "It’s normal to travel around the scattered islands of French Polynesia by boat. It’s unusual to travel on a hybrid between cruise ship and cargo freighter that’s also delivering the islands’ supplies and post. This trip takes you to the Marquesas Islands from Tahiti, via the Tuamotu Archipelago – a long voyage to a remote part of the world. Cabins range from sharing dormitories to suites with balconies.<br/><br/>Whilst the local crew are busy offloading supplies to their towns and families, you can explore the islands by booking into excursions as an optional extra – such as diving or glass bottomed boat tours, and trips on the islands. <br/><br/>French Polynesia is the kind of place spoken about in hushed tones by divers for the brilliance of its underwater life – Tahuata and Bora Bora suit beginners, but advanced divers can look forward to diving sites at Fakarava, Rangiroa and Hiva Oa. <br/><br/>This cruise departs from Tahiti and on the way to and from the Marquesa Islands you’ll spend time in Rangiroa Atoll, a stunning, massive lagoon that’s great for divers and snorkellers. There’s a glass bottomed boat available, too, if you want to stay dry. <br/><br/>Travelling takes time in the remote ocean.  You’ll need to allow a full day at sea to cruise to the Marquesas from the Tuamotu Archipelago – and a second full day to return afterwards. On each passage you could join a weaving workshop or learn the ukelele. Your boat has a pool on board, plus massage room and small gym, plus lounges and two conference rooms where the crew run topical (and tropical) lectures. <br/><br/>Whether you’re on board or on shore, enjoy local food – there’s an abundant supply of fresh local fish – the much-exported coconut crab, plus fruit and veg. You can try delicacies from Marquesan underground ovens. <br/><br/>Once you reach the Marquesa islands, you’ll visit the islands of Ua Pou, Nuku Hiva, Ua Huka, Hiva Oa, and Fatu Hiva. Your boat is the only way to visit any islands without runways. On the rugged, volcanic island Hive Oa you can see the grave of Paul Gauguin, On Fatu Hiva you can hike in the rainforest, or visit one of the most beautiful beaches in the world – the Bay of Virgins. <br/><br/>Returning towards Bora Bora via a pearl farm, you’ll think a pearl a befitting export for such a small and beautiful collection of islands. <br/><br/><br/>",

      "description": "Tahuata (Vaitahu) – Hiva Oa (Atuona) The Aranui will anchor in the small bay of Tahuata. The only access is by sea, as there is no airport on Tahuata. On this leaf-shaped island, the air is thick with the scent of Tahitian tiare, frangipani and history. In 1595, Spanish explorers landed in the village of Vaitahu and opened fire on a crowd of curious islanders, killing about 200 people. Tahuata is also the site of the first French colony in the Marquesas in 1842. The large church built by the Vatican, is decorated with beautiful Marquesan sculptures and stained-glass windows representing the Virgin Mary. Tahuata is famous for its exquisite bone and helmet shell carvings. There will be much to choose from in the village. The Aranui will arrive in Hiva Oa after lunch on board, where you will have plenty of time to explore Atuona, the second largest village in the Marquesas. This is where Paul Gauguin lived and created some of his works. You can also visit the colonial store where he bought his bread, as well as a replica of his infamous “house of pleasure” and the museum. By 4X4, you will visit the largest archaeological site in the Marquesas Islands, “Tohua Taa’oa”. Walking up the hill to the cemetery, you will have a breathtaking view of the motu Hanakee. Under a huge frangipani tree is a tombstone with the simple words: Paul Gauguin 1903. Nearby is the grave of another famous European who also fell in love with Hiva Oa: the Belgian singer-songwriter Jacques Brel, who died in 1978."
