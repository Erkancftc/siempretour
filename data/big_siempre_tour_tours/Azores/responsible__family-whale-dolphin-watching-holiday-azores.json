The rest of your time is free to spend how you wish and you can add on any land tours to your program. You will see many species of dolphins and whales and if you come in the spring you may see the mighty blue whales when they stop by the islands to feed and stay around for a few days!<br/><br/>TRIPS TO SEA<br/><br/>You can choose a holiday with either three half day dolphin and whale watching trips to sea OR a holiday with one half day trip to sea and a full day trip to sea on our special educational day tour \"BE A MARINE BIOLOGIST FOR THE DAY\".
