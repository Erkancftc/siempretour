  "generalInfo": "This Somaliland and Djibouti tailor made tour takes you on a voyage of discovery to the little-visited landscapes, cities and historic sites of Djibouti and the self-declared state of Somaliland. It’s the only overland tour to connect the two regions. <br/><br/>You’ll spend time in vibrant Djibouti City before heading off to Lake Abbé, driving through the Grand Bara and Petit Barra deserts along the way and sleeping in traditional Afar huts on the shores of the lake upon arrival. The lake is particularly famous for the limestone chimneys that punctuate the surrounding landscape. Next it’s on to Lake Assal, the lowest point in the African continent, followed by Tadjourah, an old town full of whitewashed buildings and mosques, a short drive from the pretty beach at Plages de Sables Blancs. <br/><br/>Next, you’ll cross the border into Somaliland. A self-declared nation little-visited by foreign tourists, a visit here is a true adventure. Even the drive across the border to the town of Hargeisa is a remarkable journey, and includes a stop at the ancient rock painting site of Dhagax Khoure. In Hargeisa itself, you’ll visit the civil war memorial as well as a livestock market, which serves as the backbone of the city’s economy. <br/><br/>Your next stop is the Laas Geel cave paintings, a real highlight of the trip. One of the most important rock art sites in East Africa, it’s home to vibrant paintings thought to be around 10,000 years old. Next it’s on to the historic town of Berbera, which has many fine example of Ottoman and British architecture. You’ll stay at a hotel right on the beach, and there will be ample time for swimming and snorkelling. <br/><br/>On your final day you’ll drive back to Hargeisa via the cool air of the Sheikh Mountains, in preparation for your flight home the next day. The trip takes place throughout the year. You can also reverse the itinerary and start in Somaliland.<br/>",
