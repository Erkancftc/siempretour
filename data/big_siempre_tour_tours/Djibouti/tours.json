    "generalInfo": "Djibouti and Somaliland sit at the very edge of the African continent, a stone’s throw from Arabia on the shores of the Red Sea. This short trip takes in some of Africa’s most incredible landscapes, combining them with a fascinating collection of cultures that owe as much to the Middle East as they do to the countries further south.  Starting in Djibouti we embark upon an expedition to the harsh yet beautiful scenery of Lac Abbe, a huge salt lake surrounded by bizarre rock structures, staying there overnight to watch the ever changing colours as the sun sets and rises. From here we continue to Lac Assal, Africa’s lowest point and home to Afar salt collectors, before continuing to the old Ottoman settlement of Tadjourah on the coast.<br/><br/>An overland journey through harsh, barely inhabited deserts takes us to the unrecognized country of Somaliland, a low key, laid back place that couldn’t be more different from neighbouring Somalia. Here we discover some of the most impressive rock art in the world at Las Geel, barely known to the outside world, and the historic buildings of the Red Sea port of Berbera. The joy of travelling here is to feel like you are treading new ground – few people ever make it to Somaliland – and of course the friendly, welcoming people who are pleased to have visitors to their home. We explore the markets of Hargeisa, venture further afield to the rock art of Dhagax Khoure, and travel into the mountains at Sheikh, before returning to the capital to the end the trip. This is a wild and untamed land, home to nomadic communities who have barely changed in centuries, and travel here is not for everyone – creature comforts on occasion can be few and far between. But for the Africa enthusiast looking to visit a truly authentic, traditional part of this ever enchanting land, its rewards are great….",

Lac Assal crater lake is the lowest point in Africa (-150 m), as well as the most saline body of water in the world – and one of the most colourful thanks to unusual crystalline formations. Lac Abbe is even more spectacularly strange - a vast salt lake with tall limestone chimneys belching gas into the air to create vistas that featured in the cult science fiction film Planet of the Apes. <br/><br/>Crossing into Ethiopia, you'll explore the Afar desert region and its once-feared local tribes people. At Lake Afrera, see how they harvest salt, and visit the world’s lowest lying island at -102m. From the very low to the high, you'll then hike upward to the rim of Erta Ale volcano to witness its jaw-dropping lava lake – one of only five in the world. <br/><br/>There's heat too at Dallol, and not just its hot springs – this is officially one of the hottest places on Earth!

The lake is particularly famous for the limestone chimneys that punctuate the surrounding landscape. Next it’s on to Lake Assal, the lowest point in the African continent, followed by Tadjourah, an old town full of whitewashed buildings and mosques, a short drive from the pretty beach at Plages de Sables Blancs. <br/><br/>Next, you’ll cross the border into Somaliland. A self-declared nation little-visited by foreign tourists, a visit here is a true adventure. Even the drive across the border to the town of Hargeisa is a remarkable journey, and includes a stop at the ancient rock painting site of Dhagax Khoure. In Hargeisa itself, you’ll visit the civil war memorial as well as a livestock market, which serves as the backbone of the city’s economy. <br/><br/>Your next stop is the Laas Geel cave paintings, a real highlight of the trip. One of the most important rock art sites in East Africa, it’s home to vibrant paintings thought to be around 10,000 years old. Next it’s on to the historic town of Berbera, which has many fine example of Ottoman and British architecture. You’ll stay at a hotel right on the beach, and there will be ample time for swimming and snorkelling. <br/><br/>On your final day you’ll drive back to Hargeisa via the cool air of the Sheikh Mountains, in preparation for your flight home the next day. The trip takes place throughout the year. You can also reverse the itinerary and start in Somaliland.<br/>",
