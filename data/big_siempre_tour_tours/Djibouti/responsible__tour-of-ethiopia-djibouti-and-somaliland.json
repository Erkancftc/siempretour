  "generalInfo": "The horn of Africa is a fascinating mélange of cultures, a hotbed of influences from nomadic herders to Arabian traders. It is also home to some of the continent’s most remote and breathtaking landscapes, where the taste of the wild is in the air for intrepid traveller to savour. <br/><br/>From Djibouti, we head for Lac Assal - the lowest point in Africa (-150 m) plus the most saline body of water in the world (40%) - as well as the spectacular Lac Abbe, a vast salt lake whose tall limestone chimneys belching gas served as a backdrop for the film Planet Of The Apes.<br/><br/>Crossing into Ethiopia, we delve the Afar desert and its once-feared people. You'll witness one of nature's fiercer sights here too, hiking up the Erta Ale volcano to marvel at one of the world's few lava lakes. Next, visit the hot springs at Dallol - the hottest place on earth - and look out for camel caravans carting blocks of salt across the desert. <br/><br/>From Addis Ababa we fly to Hargeisa, the capital of Somaliland bustling with friendly markets. The second part of the trip also features two of the world's finest prehistoric rock art sites, at Las Geel and Dhagax Khoure, meeting nomadic communities en route. <br/><br/>You'll also visit the wonderfully atmospheric coastal city of Berbera and explore streets of an old quarter packed with Ottoman architecture. It's yet another little-explored wonder in a region full of distinctive adventure. <br/>",
