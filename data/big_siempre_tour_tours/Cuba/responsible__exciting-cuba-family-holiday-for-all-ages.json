Spend time wandering around the charming town with its candy coloured buildings. Or, why not make use of the hop-on/hop-off bus to see some of the tourist hotspots, or spot hummingbirds in the tranquil botanical gardens. For children who are feeling adventurous why not try your hand as a spot of horse-riding with a picnic lunch and a dip in the river. Prior experience is not a necessity, however for those feeling nervous there are always bikes to peddle."

      "description": "VINALES - LAS TERRAZAS Drive to Las Terrazas in the heart of a UNESCO protected area; bask in the tranquility of the undulating hills in every shade of green, groves of palm trees, orchids, hibiscus, steep mountain streams and crystal clear rocky pools. Play I Spy as you spot the many hundreds of birds, butterflies and carefully tended fields of sweet sugar cane. As the afternoon creeps in, those with older children can enjoy an exciting zipline excursion through the forest canopy and across the village of Las Terrazas. There are 6 sections on the biplane course to conquer, which makes this challenge the best of fun. For the less sporty, Las Terrazas is a community eco-project with about 1000 people living there, so is ideal for wandering around – check out the local cafes/bars (children welcome!) which are open all hours. Our favourite is Café de Maria, where you can sample the most delicious locally-grown cuban coffee. For the explorers, travel to the centre of Las Terrazas where you will find an artificial lake, home to spot (non-native) monkeys, flamingoes and many interesting local birds. Hop on a row boat and explore for yourselves. For those looking for an injection of culture, why not seek out the hidden artists’ studios and craft shops stacked high with treasures to take home. There is no “hard sell” in Las Terrazas, one the things which make it such a pleasant place to spend time."

After a traditional breakfast you will visit one of Cuba's very own coffee plantations where you will learn how they take the bean to the cup. The crumbling colonial mansions at the heart of the plantations are very evocative and it is easy to get lost in thoughts of how life might have been a hundred years ago. As the afternoon sun draws in you will drive to Playa Larga. Journey through the back roads of Cuba to get a view of rural life in the city."

      "description": "PLAYA LARGA - TRINIDAD Continue your tour of Cuba and drive to Trinidad, a journey of around 3 hours. You have the option stop in the attractive town of Cienfuegos en route, which you can discuss with your own personal driver. This is a lovely town situated in an enviable seaside location and is home to a wealth of beautiful old French buildings that were built by the settlers that arrived in the early 19th Century. It is a UNESCO world heritage site and it is easy to see why, with beautiful candy coloured palaces, whitewashed churches, luscious palm trees and a cool sea breeze. We can include a visit to Valle de los Ingenios (Valley of the Sugar Mills), which is 12km from Trinidad. A fascinating place to visit, this is essentially the best preserved living museum of Cuban sugar production of the 18th and 19th century and includes the sites of 75 former cane sugar mills, plantation houses, barracks and other facilities. Sugar production was hugely important for Cuba at that time and many slaves were housed here, even after the abolition of slavery, until the Wars of Independence in the 19th century. This visit also includes seeing the well-maintained Manaca Iznaga (Iznaga Tower), one of the main landmarks of this area."
