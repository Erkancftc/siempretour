      "description": "Welcome to Cuba! You’ve just touched down in Havana, the island’s buzzing capital where vintage motors, salsa rhythms and colonial charm all collide. No airport transfer today, so grab a cab or hitch a ride with fellow travellers—your adventure kicks off now. If you fancy a private transfer, just give us a shout and we’ll sort it."

The journey’s scenic, the views are cracking, and your guide’s full of stories to keep things fun. Once there, hop on a horse and explore the valley like a proper Cuban cowboy. No experience needed—just good vibes and a sense of adventure. Dinner’s at Finca \"El Paraiso\", an organic farm where most of what’s on your plate is grown right there. Think fresh veg, local flavours and a sunset that’ll make you forget your phone exists."

Round-trip transport is sorted—just bring your sunnies, swimmers and good energy. It’s about 1.5 hours each way, with loads of time to soak up the sun. Heads up: meals aren’t included, but there are beach shacks serving snacks and coconuts. Or pack a picnic and claim your spot in paradise. In the afternoon back to Viñales just in time for a shower and maybe a sunset mojito."

It’s a long ride, but totally worth it. Once you arrive, kick off your shoes and dive into beach mode. Whether you’re sunbathing, swimming or sipping something cold by the shore, this is your time to unwind."
