  "generalInfo": "This 12-day cultural tour of Cuba explores the western side of the Caribbean island, as you travel from Havana to Vinales, Cienfuegos, Trinidad and finally Santa Clara. Wherever possible, you will be accommodated in family-run homestays, known as casas particulares, which as well as offering a valuable income to local Cubans also gives you a culturally immersive experience. <br/><br/>Begin with one of the great Havana experiences, a city tour in a classic American automobile, a triumph of Cuban mechanical ingenuity resulting from the Castro government’s embargo on imported cars and car parts. From Havana you travel by private vehicle to the charming rural town of Vinales, where farmers till the fields with oxen and dry their tobacco leaves in barns. You can visit a campesino family in their home, and learn about their lives, and how tobacco is grown.<br/><br/>A journey through the Zapata Peninsula brings you to Cienfuegos, on the south coast, with its French colonial architecture and laidback atmosphere. You then travel further east, to Trinidad. The great joy of this UNESCO World Heritage Site is strolling the plazas in the evening, experiencing local life and listening to the strains of salsa in the air. You can even book a salsa class here if you like. The final destination before your return to the capital is Santa Clara, an ideal location to learn about the Cuban Revolution as well as the role played by Ernesto ‘Che’ Guevara.  <br/><br/>Accompanied by a knowledgeable tour leader throughout, and meeting up with a series of local guides, this small group tour is a superb introduction to Cuban history, nature and culture. Unfolding over 12 days, it allows you to take a relaxed pace, allowing for a deeper immersion into Cuban life than you would get on a whistlestop tour.<br/>",

      "description": "Walking and driving tour of old Havana. A guided tour of Old Havana will show you more of this fascinating city. The streets of La Habana Vieja were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1982, and the subsequent restoration of this part of town has transformed it into arguably Latin America’s finest colonial quarter, in marked contrast to the rambling, potholed streets and crumbling façades around it. After a local cocktail jump in a vintage American car to be driven past some of the highlights of Havana including Revolution Square, the National Hotel, Capitol building and the former Presidential Palace. Between these grand buildings, pass pastel-hued mansions, observe the bustling street life and hear the music seeping out of every doorway. You’ll have trouble keeping your hands off your camera as iconic images flash before you around each and every corner."

      "description": "Travel west to Viñales. In the morning continue west by road for 3 hours to Viñales, a small, rural town tucked away in the Sierra de los Órganos. The tree-shaded high street is lined with wooden colonnades and one-storey, red-roofed houses. Horse and carts clatter along the main road and local children play baseball with sticks and stones outside the dilapidated whitewashed church in the main square. There is a splendid old chemist’s shop and a few other bare-shelved stores, as well as a couple of salsa bars which attract a lively crowd in the evening."

      "description": "Excursions and walks in and around Viñales. Viñales is set in a valley with a distinctive landscape, featuring domed limestone mountains, known as mogotes, which jut into the sky from a fertile plain. Using oxen and carts, local farmers cultivate the red soil of the valley floor for fruit, vegetables and tobacco, and the countryside is peppered with thatched curing barns for drying the tobacco leaves. You have a guided walk through this beautiful valley. The trail passes alongside fields tilled by straw-hatted farmers and their oxen. You have the opportunity to visit a campesino family in their home and talk to them about life on the land, as well as visiting a tobacco farm to learn about the growing processes of one of Cuba’s most important crops."

This region is full of unspoilt nature and luxuriant tropical vegetation, fringed by beautiful beaches. You will also visit the Girón Museum, a collection dedicated to the failed CIA-inspired invasion of Cuba in 1961 which became known as the Bay of Pigs. In the afternoon drive onto the elegant city of Cienfuegos."

The port city of Cienfuegos was founded by French settlers from Louisiana in 1819 giving it an air and architectural style that is distinct from that of the rest of the island. You will have a walking tour of the city led by your tour leader to experience the easy-going ambiance of the city, which has well earned its sobriquet ‘Pearl of the South’."

This Garden covers 97 hectares and is one of the most important and oldest botanical gardens in Cuba. You will stop here before travelling east to Trinidad, a picturesque town which was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1988. Its popularity has not affected its colonial charm and unhurried atmosphere. Low-rise, brightly painted houses with vast shutters open out onto cobbled streets, palm trees dot the main plaza and life in the evenings goes on into the early hours with dancing and music outside the Casa de la Música."

      "description": "Explore and relax in Trinidad and on nearby Caribbean beaches. A walking tour allows you to wander through Trinidad’s cobbled streets and elegantly crumbling town houses which lead to vibrant plazas frequently filled with music and salsa dancing. As you visit the Plaza Mayor and Museo Romántico, you’ll be introduced to the history of the town, which seems barely touched by the modern world. There are also several optional excursions available. You might relax beneath the shade of a palm tree at Playa Ancón (11km from the town), a wide stretch of white sand on the Caribbean or Board a catamaran and cruise in style to Cayo Blanco or Cayo Macho. The more active might travel to Topes de Collantes, a protected area of beautiful sylvan landscapes set in the Escambray Mountains where you can spot endemic flora and fauna and hike through the verdant, fertile landscapes to reach the Caburní waterfall or make your way to the simple, yet characterful Casa Artex dance hall to pick up some fancy new footwork during an hour-long salsa lesson."

Over 55 years ago Che Guevara, assisted by just 18 guerrillas, captured the railway here, in a move that was instrumental in the triumph of the Revolution. Today, this vibrant university town is home to an excellent museum dedicated to the events of the late 1950s and to Che Guevara. There is time to visit the museum, Che’s mausoleum and a monument and plaza dedicated to the man and the Revolution."

If you wish to explore more of Cuba by travelling east to Camaguey or spend some time at the cayes or beaches on the north coast you would leave the tour and continue with your private extension."
