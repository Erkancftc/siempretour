      "description": "HavanaToday is set aside for participants to join the tour. Some flights to Havana arrive quite late in the evening, so there are no included activities today. Nevertheless, at 7pm, the tour guide will meet with those who have already arrived and go for an optional dinner. We include an airport arrival transfer if you arrive to Havana today. The transfer is also included if you arrive in Cuba before today as long as you arrange pre-tour accommodation through us. Otherwise, we can arrange your included transfer from your place of accommodation in Havana to the starting guesthouse for the tour. If you arrive earlier in the day, you have time to relax and check out Havana or start your Cuba adventures with one of our excellent Havana day tours."

      "description": "ViñalesThe road trip to Vinales today takes 3 to 4 hours. If there are 6 or more participants on the tour, the included transport is a private tour bus, otherwise we use a smaller microbus or a private car. We have 2 nights in the charming town of Vinales where there are an abundance of outdoor activities available. On the morning of Day 3 we include a half day off-road bicycle excursion in the valley, through tobacco fields, meeting locals, and with the wonderful views of the pincushion hills all around us. The difficulty level of the bike trip is medium. If you can ride a bike around town you should be fine. For those that don't like bike riding at all, we can include a walking tour of the valley instead. In the 2 afternoons we have in Vinales, the options include taking on Cuba's best zipline, exploring the impressive Cuevas Santo Tomas (by far Cuba's largest cave system), learning to salsa with a local teacher, and taking a taxi to Cayo Levisa - a beautiful white sand beach some 40 minutes drive away. Horseriding and rock-climbing can also be done. Vinales has a great nightlife owing to the fact that there is only 1 bar and all the locals go to dance and listen to live music. It's one of the best places to experience how Cubans enjoy a night out."

      "description": "Bay of PigsThe drive to the Bay of Pigs takes most of the day. On the way however, we stop for a snorkel right off the coast at a beautiful spot along on the bay. Snorkel equipment is available for hire at a low cost. We stay the night in the town of Playa Giron which is one of the beautiful beaches on the Bay of Pigs. It is also on the edge of Cuba's Cienaga de Zapata which is a densely forested area featuring wetlands, swamps, caves, and sinkholes."

      "description": "TrinidadWe spend the morning in the Bay of Pigs before heading to Trinidad in the afternoon. The activity options for the morning are scuba diving over some of the best coral reefs in Cuba, or taking a trek with a national park guide through the nearby forest to see wildlife, caves, and to a freshwater sinkhole (cenote) where you can snorkel with fish and turtles. If you prefer something more relaxing you can hang out with your guesthouse family or take a short bicycle ride to the beach. The scuba diving has been described as being as good as anywhere in Cuba. The water is usually very clear and the dive masters are experienced. On the trek through the forest, the guide can find snakes, birds, and cave bats to show you, and swimming in the clean freshwater of the sinkhole is an exhilaratingexperience. In the afternoon we head further along the Cuba's Caribbean coast to the vibrant colonial city of Trinidad."

      "description": "Sierra de EscambrayOur 2 day trek through the mountains near to Trinidad, takes us through valleys, over ridges, along mountain streams, and to secluded waterfalls. You don't need to carry your luggage on this trek and the national park employees take care of the cooking and tents. Meals and camping gear are provided, including sleeping mats and blankets, however it's best if you can bring your own sleeping bag as occasionally we have found that they don't bring along enough blankets, and it can get cold at night in the mountains, especially in the winter months of December through February. If you don't have a sleeping bag, a simple sleeping sheet will make you feel more comfortable. Other than that you just need to have some good footwear for walking, sunscreen, a hat, your swimwear and a change of clothes for sleeping in. The walk is not particularly difficult, however you need a reasonable level of fitness to be able to cover the distances (about 10km a day) without feelling too exhausted to enjoy the experience. In the event that you prefer to stay in Trinidad, we can provide the extra night of accommodation free of charge as you wait for the rest of the group to return. The night of Day 7 is back in Trinidad."

      "description": "TrinidadWe have a full day in the beautiful city Trinidad. Scuba diving is also possible here so you can indulge in another immersion if that is your thing. There is also a zipline and a very pleasant beach not far away as well as the option of horseriding to a waterfall. The main things that people enjoy about Trinidad are the colonial feel of the city, with its cobblestone streets and old mansions surrounding the town square, and the vibrant live music and dance scene. There are several live music venues within short walking distance in the colonial center near to our guesthouses."

      "description": "HavanaOn our way back to Havana, we call in on the city of Santa Clara to check out the Che Guevara Museum. This is the only museum visit we subject you to on this tour however we recommend it since Che is such an important figure in Cuba's recent history and its revolution, and his life was such an interesting one. Eventually we reach Havana and we can celebrate the last night of the tour together as a group. Needless to say, Cuba's capital city has a huge range of colourful nightspots to choose from and experience."

A departure transfer to the airport is not included in the tour, however it is very simple to organise at your guesthouse. We recommend you book a couple of additional nights in Havana at the end of the tour so that you have time to further explore this exciting city."
