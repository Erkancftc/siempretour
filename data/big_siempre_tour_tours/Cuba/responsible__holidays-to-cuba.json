  "generalInfo": "This 16-day small group tour of Cuba from Havana is an indispensable introduction to a country that for many years was frozen in time, and never ceases to fascinate visitors.<br/><br/>From the faded glamour of the capital, a favourite haunt of Ernest Hemingway, you’ll drive south to Trinidad on the Caribbean, learning about the failed Bay of Pigs invasion, then west to Santiago, before looping back to the beautiful Vinales region. In Trinidad you’ll be accommodated in a Casa Particulare, a traditional homestay, for an authentic glimpse of daily Cuban life, while in the Topes de Callantes park you’ll be staying in a charming hacienda, sleeping on the veranda in the fresh mountain air.<br/><br/>Naturally a major focus of the itinerary is on Cuba’s revolutionary history, and among the visits included are the Che Guevara Mausoleum, where an eternal flame lit by Fidel Castro burns, and La Comandancia de La Plata, a rainforest hideaway where the revolutionary army spent two years. You can see Che’s hospital hut, and even Castro’s personal fridge!<br/><br/>Cuban heritage comes alive in a series of fun cultural encounters. You might take part in a cocktail-making class, learning how to knock up a mean mojito, or take a spin with a salsa lesson in Trinidad. Wander the tobacco plantations and a famous cigar factory, and on an old sugar plantation see the infamous bell that was rung whenever a slave escaped. And as the trip winds to an end, spend some time snorkeling and suntanning on an idyllic island retreat.<br/><br/>With tropical beauty, intriguing history and a raucous culture to enjoy and absorb, this Cuba holiday is the perfect opportunity to explore a remarkable destination before it changes beyond recognition. <br/>",

      "title": "Join trip in Havana",
      "description": ": Our tour starts today in Havana - home to salsa, mojitos, and revolutionary spirit. Cuba's capital is one of the most impressive cities in the Americas, almost frozen in time with crumbling tenement blocks and 1950s American Cadillacs rubbing shoulders with grand colonial buildings and monuments to the revolution. Due to the number of evening flights into Havana, our tour leader will meet you for a welcome meeting on the morning of Day 2. Details of timings will be left in the hotel reception, as well as information about anything else you'll need for the day. There are no activities planned today, so you're free to arrive at any time. If you'd like an airport transfer, you'll need to arrive into Havana's Jose Marti International Airport (HAV) which is around a 45-minute drive from the airport. A representative from our local partners in Cuba will meet you at Havana Airport and assist you with the transfer formalities. If your flight arrives earlier in the day, you might like to head out to explore Old Havana, just a short walk from the Capitolio building and the Malecon sea esplanade with views of the city. There are several restaurants and bars within walking distance and you're likely to hear the hypnotic rhythms of salsa, trova and son being played along the Paseo del Prado."

      "title": "Havana highlights: Capitolio Building, Plaza de la Revolución, and daiquiris at Hemingway's bar",
      "description": ": Today, we'll have a full day to explore Havana and its iconic mixture of restored and crumbling buildings and historical sites. Passing by the famous Capitolio building (modelled on the White House), you'll get your first glimpse of the rows of brightly coloured vintage cars that adorn many a Cuban postcard. Our first stop is Plaza de la Revolucion, one of the largest public squares globally, famous for its significance in the Cuban revolution. This historic square is well-known for hosting numerous speeches by Fidel Castro, and features the iconic sculptural reliefs of Che Guevara and Camilo Cienfuegos. Driving through Havana we will pass through the iconic suburb of Vedado, down the Malecon and into the heart of Vieja (Old) District. Here, we exit our coach and start exploring on foot old Havana, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Guided by our tour leader, we'll visit the baroque Catedral de San Cristobal and the central Plaza de Armas, surrounded by stunning neoclassical buildings. During our journey, we'll visit two of Havana's renowned spots cherished by Ernest Hemingway: La Bodeguita and El Floridita. El Floridita, known as the birthplace of the frozen Daiquiri, provides a perfect setting to enjoy this iconic cocktail amidst its famous live music scene. After some free time for lunch, we will head up to the fortress guarding the entrance to the Havana harbour- known as Castillo del Morro. The castle offers stunning panoramic views over the sea and the city of Havana. Our tour finishes mid afternoon, where you will have free time to explore Havana more at your own pace. You might like to take a ride in a vintage car, visit one of the famous cigar factories, or simply relaxing next to the pool after a full day of sightseeing. This evening, we have an included dinner at a local restaurant, giving you the perfect opportunity to connect with your fellow travelers."

      "title": "Travel to the limestone landscape of Vinales Valley National Park. See how Cuban cigars are made",
      "description": ": This morning, we'll travel west to the Pinar Del Rio region and into Vinales - arguably the most picturesque part of Cuba. Along the way, you might notice the lack of advertisements which are commonplace in the West, and spot the hyperbolic, political slogans in their place - tokens that tell you, you really are in Cuba now. Here in Vinales, the surreal mountains take centre stage - the result of the erosion of limestone over millions of years . They're locally known as 'haystacks' (or 'mogotes' in Cuban Spanish) thanks to their steep sides and rounded, jungly tops. Around them are a patchwork of tobacco fields, with their iron-rich, red soil - the raw material for Cuba's famous cigars. We'll have a guided two-hour walk through the Vinales Valley National Park, which has UNESCO world heritage status. Your guide will point out the flora and fauna of this unique region. Mogotes tower above us as we pass through tobacco fields and past drying barns, and during our walk we'll stop at a traditional Cuban farm to learn more about Cuba's cigar-making industry, which stems from the plants growing in this region. You may even have the chance to sample the goods if you wish. After our walk, you might like to visit the Cueva del Indio - one of the many subterranean caves in this area - or relax at our hotel. Today's total drive time will take around 3.5 hours."

      "title": "Beach day on Cayo Levisa",
      "description": ": Today, we head to Cayo Levisa, a pristine, almost untouched island that makes you believe paradise truly exists. This is the perfect setting to relax, unwind, and enjoy a day basking in the sun on palm-fringed shores, completely disconnected from the outside world. On land, you'll have the chance to see a wide variety of birds, especially pelicans, that live here. Why not take a walk around the island to explore the mangroves and pine forests and see the animals which inhabit them. This is a full-day excursion with lunch included, and we expect to return to our hotel by early evening."

      "title": "Drive to Santa Clara. Visit the Orchid Garden of Soroa",
      "description": ": Today marks the beginning of our long drive as we make our way to the eastern end of Cuba. We'll be heading east past Havana and traveling to Santa Clara, located in the heart of the island. We'll break up the journey with regular stops, including a break at the Orchid Garden of Soroa, where we'll take a guided walk to see the the unique flora of this region. The town of Santa Clara is famous as being the site of the last battle of the Revolution in which Che Guevara's troops took the city, causing the Cuban dictator, Batista, to flee into exile. Because of this, the town was chosen as the final resting place for the national hero, and we'll explore some more of the Che Guevara sites tomorrow. Today's total drive time will take around 7 hours."

      "title": "Pay homage at the Che Guevara Memorial. Visit Sancti Spiritus en route to Bayamo",
      "description": ": This morning, we'll begin the second and longest leg of our journey to Cuba's east coast. To start, we'll visit Che Guevara's Mausoleum, before moving on to the centre of Santa Clara and the Tren Blindado Memorial. Guevara was buried here with full military honours in 1997 after his exhumed remains were discovered in Bolivia and returned to Cuba. A flame lit by Fidel Castro burns eternally to honour the man who played a key role in Cuba's revolution and whose image is routinely displayed throughout the country. We'll also visit the museum dedicated to Guevara's life, which contains some interesting letters and artefacts. Our next stop for the day will be Sancti Spíritus, one of the original seven settlements founded by Diego Velasquez when he claimed Cuba for Spain, before we drive across the flattest province in Cuba - Ciego de Avila. We'll pass through land predominantly used for cattle ranching, sugar growing and citrus fruit production. We estimate we will arrive into Bayamo around 8pm. Bayamo is another of the original seven Spanish settlements. The inhabitants burned this city to the ground in 1869 in an act of rebellion against the Spanish. Today's total drive time will take around 9.5 hours. *Please note that if you are travelling on our December 20th departure, the Che Memorial will be closed on Christmas Day."

      "title": "Follow Revolutionaries footsteps- Hike to La Comandancia de la Plata. Later, drive to Santiago de Cuba",
      "description": ": It's another early start this morning & a big day ahead. We start our to journey into the Sierra Maestra Mountains - the highest mountain range in Cuba. Here, we'll switch to board specialised 4WD vehicles that will take us up the steep asphalted road to El Alto de Naranjo, 950 metres/3116 feet above sea level. From there, we'll trek to La Comandancia de La Plata (6 kilometres round trip hike). It's worth noting that the path is steep, uneven, and can be muddy after rain- comfortable shoes are a must. If you wish you can bring hiking poles, however they are not essential. It was here that Fidel Castro and Che Guevara took refuge after an unsuccessful uprising against the Cuban dictator, Batista, in 1956. As you walk around this hideaway, which became the revolutionaries' headquarters until Batista fled Cuba in 1959, you get a real sense of their two-year residency here. Castro's simple camp bed and fridge still remain, along with a trap door for a speedy exit in the event of an attack. The original broadcast hut for 'Radio Rebelde' still stands, as well as Che's hospital hut where he worked as a doctor. While photography was previously forbidden here, you can now snap pictures for a small fee. After our included lunch, we'll drive down the mountain in our specialised 4WD vehicles, where we'll meet our bus and continue to our final destination and Cuba's second largest city- Santiago de Cuba. Today's total drive time will take around 6 hours. *Please note the road to get to the start of the trek to La Comandancia de La Plata is currently closed to vehicles due to the impact of hurricane Melissa. Because of this, on our January 2026 departure we will not be able to hike to La Comandancia de La Plata. Instead we will depart for Santiago de Cuba in the morning and embark on a city tour."

      "title": "Exploring Santiago de Cuba",
      "description": ": Santiago de Cuba, founded by Spanish conquistador Diego Velázquez in 1515, was the seventh village established on the island, just 23 years after Christopher Columbus claimed Cuba for Spain. Historically, Santiago de Cuba was the island's second-most important city after Havana and remains its second-largest today. It served as Cuba's capital at one point, was the birthplace of the Bacardi rum brand, and was the origin of the revolutionary movement that led to the Cuban Revolution which governed the country for over fifty years. Today, your tour leader will guide you through a walking tour of the city, visiting its historic squares and landmarks. You'll visit the Moncada Barracks, site of Fidel Castro's infamous but chaotic initial attack on the Batista regime, often considered the birth of the revolution. We will also stop at the Santa Ifigenia Cemetery, where both José Martí, the ideological father of Cuba, and Fidel Castro are buried. This afternoon, you'll have free time to explore on your own. Consider visiting the Diego Velázquez Museum, the Carnival Museum, or the Bacardi Museum. In the evening, immerse yourself in Santiago's vibrant music scene. Known for its deep Caribbean influence and laid-back atmosphere, Santiago de Cuba reflects a strong African heritage through its music and rhythms. *Please note on the January 2026 departure we would have completed the city tour on Day 7. Today we will be heading to Gran Piedra lookout near Santiago de Cuba. We will take a bus uphill for approximately 14km before climbing 459 steps to reach the lookout. Here you will be rewarded with panoramic views of Santiago de Cuba, the coastline and mountains."

      "title": "Drive east to Camaguey",
      "description": ": This morning, we'll leave Santiago de Cuba behind and start anther long driving day of the tour back to the east of Cuba, our destination for the night is the provincial capital of Camaguey - Cuba's third-largest city and a cultural centre for music, ballet and art. Thanks to its production of livestock, sugarcane, chromite, and other agricultural products, Camagüey has grown to be Cuba's largest inland city. Founded in 1514 under the name Santa María del Puerto del Príncipe, the city's historic centre was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2008. Our hotel is near to the Old Town, making it easy to head out and explore on foot. Today's total drive time will take around 6.5 hours."

      "title": "Explore Camaguey before heading to Trinidad",
      "description": ": This morning, we explore Camaguey's hidden plazas and baroque churches by bicitaxi tour. What might strike you about the city is its labyrinth street layout - a by-product of pirate fighting. Similar to a Moroccan medina, legend has it, it was designed to confuse invaders and give cover to its residents. Alternatively, you're free to wander around Camaguey at your own pace. My mid morning, we'll travel to Trinidad. We'll drive through Valle de los Ingenios, also known as the Valley of the Sugar Mills. This was the centre of sugar production for 100 years from the late 18th century, and at its peak, it was home to 30,000 slaves working in the mills and surrounding plantations. Today, the ruined sugar mills and mansions lining the valley bear witness to the previous prosperity in the area. We'll also stop at the infamous Torre de Manaca Iznaga, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This seven-floor tower was built to watch over the slaves working in the fields and had two bells. One was rung when the slaves could stop working and take a meal, the other when a slave escaped. By early evening, we'll arrive at our casa particular just outside the beautiful Spanish colonial town of Trinidad. 'Casa particulares' (local guesthouses) are a type of accommodation that's unique to Cuba. The industry began in the early 1990s when entrepreneurial homeowners would rent out rooms in their home. The side hustle was initially illegal as communist Cuba didn't allow for private enterprises but was legalised in 1997. Today, it's common to find large casas that run as bed and breakfasts, however, the majority - particularly in Havana - are still a couple of rooms in the owner's house. This gives you a truly unique, local experience as no two casas are the same - you'll have ensuite bathrooms, air-conditioning, and a delicious breakfast across the board but that's where the similarity ends. We choose to use these casas as they give a truly authentic Cuban experience, an alternative to standard hotels, and a new perspective on local life. Today's total drive time will take around 5 hours."

      "title": "Explore Trinidad, the UNESCO World Heritage Site",
      "description": ": This morning, we'll wander through the cobbled streets of the old centre of Trinidad, discovering its fine palaces, churches and cafes. A paradise for photographers, this UNESCO World Heritage Site is a perfectly preserved colonial settlement unlike any other. In the early 19th century, French settlers fleeing a slave revolt in Haiti landed here and started to grow sugar cane in the Valle de Los Ingenios. This crop generated considerable wealth and consequently, the town had to be regularly defended from pirates. Subject to opening hours, we'll visit a local museum before having free time to explore more. It's worth climbing the stairs of the bell tower at the small Museo de la Lucha contra Bandidos, purely for the views across the roofs of Trinidad out to the Caribbean at one side and the Escambray Mountains at the other. Depending on seasonality, your tour leader will guide you to visit 'Casa Chichi,' a pottery house operated by the Santander family for generations, the workshop preserves the legacy of Spanish colonialists through their unglazed bricks, roof tiles, and floor tiles still visible in Cuba. The afternoon is free to spend as you'd like. Playa Ancon's white-sand beach is just a 15-minute taxi ride away or there's the opportunity to take a salsa lesson with a local teacher. In the evening, we'll head to the open-air Casa de la Musica, just off the main square, where live bands and salsa-dancing locals do their thing well into the night. Take this chance to try the local cocktail speciality: Canchanchara"

      "title": "Journey to Topes de Collantes, forest walks and waterfall swimming",
      "description": ": Today we'll travel inland to Topes de Collantes Nature Reserve Park, famous for its many endemic species of flora and fauna. We'll have two nights to explore the area in-depth. After a ride in an old Russian military-style truck up a steep, switch-back road into the lush Escambray Mountains, we'll arrive at the park entrance. Here, we'll meet our local guide who, along with our tour leader, will help us to explore the park. Please note, there's an 8 kilometre/5 mile trek to our hacienda accommodation. Those who would prefer not to walk can continue with the truck to the hacienda. Our hike may vary slightly, depending on the weather and the group, but it's likely to take us into the coffee-growing valley of the Guayanara River. The paths are undulating and can be uneven underfoot, but the views are truly rewarding. Along our route, we'll pass rural homes and may see shepherds minding their herds of goats. After our hike, we'll arrive at our hacienda, a small farmstead set in a rocky valley, where we'll have an included lunch. The afternoon is free for you to explore at your own pace. We recommend the 5 kilometre/3 mile circular walk (approximately three hours) to the Salto de Rocio Waterfall - an area flush with trogons, hummingbirds and woodpeckers. To get to the waterfall, you'll follow a riverside track where you're likely to see tree fern, bromeliad and orchid species. On arrival at the waterfalls and lakes, adventurous swimmers might like to take a dip, or you can relax on the banks. Dinner is included tonight at our hacienda. The accommodation is simple. You have the option to sleep out under the eaves of the hacienda's veranda or in the platformed tents. Foam mattresses are provided but you might want to bring your own sleeping bag. There are male and female washing facilities in a nearby block. With the fresh mountain air, canopy of stars and peaceful, remote setting, you're guaranteed a good night's sleep. Please note that the order of Day 11 and Day 12 may be swapped. Today's total drive time from Trinidad to Topes will take around 1.5 hours."

      "description": ": This morning, we'll start with a short drive in the Russian truck to the start of our four-hour trek (approximately 8 kilometres/5 miles). Again, anyone not wanting to join the walk can continue on to tonight's hacienda with the truck. Our trek takes us through pine forest and along paths bordered by mahogany and hibiscus. If we're lucky, we may see brightly coloured hummingbirds flash past, darting from flower to flower, searching for nectar. When we reach La Batata, we'll have the opportunity to swim in an open cave. The water rarely exceeds 20°C, so it's an exhilarating dip. We'll then trek on through the forest until we reach our hacienda, set in a lush valley. This is our base for the night and where we'll have an included lunch and dinner. In the afternoon, our local guide will take us on a circular trail (approximately 1.5 kilometres/0.9 miles), telling us about the orchids and medicinal plants that we can find en route. We'll also head down through a cave, La Cueva del Altar, emerging on the other side of the hill, where we'll have views of the Caribbean. This evening is a similar set-up to our accommodation last night."

      "description": ": Leaving Topes and the Escambray Mountains behind, this morning we'll set off west, hugging the coastline with views over the sparkling turquoise waters of the Caribbean Sea. We plan to break up our journey back to Havana with several stops, the first of which is at the colonial seaport of Cienfuegos. Here, we'll stretch our legs with a short orientation tour of the town, including the Marti Park overlooked by the grand Italian-style Tomas Terry theatre. Our journey continues to Museo Giron. This small museum is dedicated to the infamous 'Bay of Pigs' invasion' - a US-supported attack by Cuban exiles which failed to overthrow the Communist regime in 1961. This museum is entirely in Spanish, however your tour leader will guide you through and give explanations to key exhibits. Our final stop on the Zapata Peninsula is a quick stop near a fresh water cenote - a pool formed when the roof of a river collapses - where we can take the opportunity for a quick dip. Alternatively, directly across the road from the cenote is the Caribbean ocean- the choice is yours on where you wish to swim. By early evening, we'll have arrived back at our hotel in Havana. Tonight we enjoy an included meal at a local rooftop restaurant to say goodbye to our new found friends. Our total driving time today will be around 7 hours."
