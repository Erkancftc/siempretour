      "title": "Havana.",
      "description": "Bienvenidos! Welcome to Cuba. Your Premium adventure begins in Havana, the country’s capital. You’ll be met at the airport by a local representative and transferred to your Feature Stay hotel for a welcome meeting at 6 pm. If you arrive early, there are plenty of excellent museums to check out, including the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes. After your meeting, head to a local restaurant for dinner. Tonight, your leader will introduce you to some classic dishes such as picadillo (a beef and tomato stew) and ropa vieja (pulled beef with vegetables)."

      "title": "Havana.",
      "description": "Start the day in style as you tour the city in a convoy of classic American vintage cars. Cruise down Havana’s grand old streets as your leader points out significant sights like the Malecon, Revolucion Square and Vedado. Finish your ride in Old Havana where you’ll continue your explorations on foot during a walking tour with your leader. Learn the history of the Havana cathedral and discover the city’s old-world charm when you stop by Plaza de Armas, San Francisco de Asis, Plaza Vieja and Central Park. You then have a free afternoon – maybe head to a rooftop bar for a cocktail or stroll around the colourful streets."

      "title": "Vinales.",
      "description": "Before departing Havana, visit Deshidratados Havana – a local dehydrated fruit workshop founded during the pandemic to help with food scarcity. Learn about how the natural preserves are made without any sugar or preservatives, and try out some samples. Next, drive west to Soroa, where you’ll tour a beautiful orchid garden. Meet with a local guide for a private tour of the gardens and learn about the vibrant array of plant and bird species – it’s not hard to see why this valley is known as the rainbow of Cuba. Make a stop at the Castle in the Clouds, a mountain-top property with wonderful views, take some time out for lunch and then continue to Vinales, where tobacco and sugarcane fields lie side by side and limestone outcrops dot the landscape. Use this travel time to take part in an informal Spanish lesson so you can converse with the friendly locals throughout the rest of your trip. Check in to your guesthouses, then take a short orientation walk with your leader to get acquainted with the town."

    {
      "dayNumber": 4,
      "title": "Vinales.",
      "description": "Begin your day with a guided walk through the farmlands of Vinales, where your leader will talk to you about the geography that makes up the area’s spectacular scenery. Vinales is known for its tobacco farms which still use traditional growing methods – learn more about the longstanding tobacco industry and watch a farmer whip up a world class cigar in seconds. Take some time to find a local place for lunch, then regroup in the late afternoon for a salsa dancing lesson. Find your feet and learn a few steps while embracing the electrifying rhythm of Cuba. After working up an appetite, head to the top of the valley for dinner at an eco-farm. Here you’ll enjoy an exceptional farm-to-table meal made entirely from organic produce grown on site."

      "title": "Cienfuegos.",
      "description": "Prepare for a long travel day as you make your way to Cienfuegos. Drive back through Havana before stopping in the Bay of Pigs for lunch. After lunch, you may like to take a dip in the crystal clear water, or unroll your beach towel and sit back as your leader shares stories of the botched USA Military counter-revolutionary invasion in the Bay of Pigs. Now a tranquil spot for relaxing, it’s hard to imagine the chaotic battle that took place here in 1961. Then it’s just a short drive to Cienfuegos, one of Cuba's prettiest coastal spots. Arrive in the early evening and join your leader on a short orientation walk before visiting the Palacio del Valle – Cienfuegos' architectural pride and joy."

    {
      "dayNumber": 6,
      "title": "Trinidad.",
      "description": "Enjoy a free morning in Cienfuegos – maybe stop by a local cafe for a cup of Cuban coffee. Then make the journey to Trinidad. When you arrive, your leader will introduce you to the town’s history and architecture during a walking tour. Take in Trinidad’s eye-catching combination of cobblestone streets, colourful houses and old-fashioned locals. It's a great town to explore on foot, and almost every scene offers great photo opportunities – from residents relaxing with huge cigars on their doorsteps to old Chevrolets cruising by. In the evening take a trip out of town to a local house for a homely and festive dinner. Be welcomed with the local drink, Canchanchara, made from 'fire water' (local honey and lime juice). There will even be a musician or two serenading you and your fellow travellers as you dine."

      "dayNumber": 7,
      "title": "Trinidad.",
      "description": "The day is yours to explore all that Trinidad has to offer. For some beachside fun and maybe a little snorkelling, head down to Playa Ancon (just be careful you don't stand on a sea urchin!). The town is dotted with open-air venues where you can check out a folklore show that nods to Cuba’s rich and varied music and dance tradition. With roots in Spain, Africa and France the show displays Cuba’s history."

      "title": "Havana.",
      "description": "Head inland with a stop at the Valle De Los Ingenios Scenic Viewpoint, where you'll have a drink while soaking in the views of sugar cane plantations. Continue to the beautiful city of Santa Clara, where you’ll enjoy an included lunch followed by a visit to the Che Guevara mausoleum. Here, you’ll see the imposing statue of the iconic revolutionary leader. In the museum that accompanies the mausoleum, you'll find a spread of photos and other ephemera related to Che – letters, medical devices and firearms. Return to Havana and arrive at your hotel, one of the newest in Havana. Perhaps soak in the amazing views from the rooftop pool or indulge in a mojito at the bar."
