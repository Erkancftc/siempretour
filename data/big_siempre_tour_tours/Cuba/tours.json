    "generalInfo": "A beguiling and captivating destination unlike any other in the Caribbean if not the world, Cuba has a great deal to offer the visitor. With its intriguing history – from the first landing of Columbus to the present day by way of the Cuban revolution, the population’s joie de vivre, and the island’s astonishing natural beauty, you’ll soon discover for yourself why Cuba is such a highly-rated destination on our 10 day / 9 night Cuba Group Tour.<br/><br/>So our tour groups can get the very most out of their time on this amazing island nation, we include a variety of amenities as standard. Nine nights of accommodation takes away the stress of finding somewhere to stay for yourself in a foreign country. Our expert guides, who escort you throughout the tour schedule, speak excellent English providing a bridge between you and the locals whether or not you speak Spanish.<br/><br/>Our 10 day / 9 night Cuba Group Tour also includes private transportation between destinations so there is no battling the Cuban public transport system and guaranteed departures provided at least two of the maximum 15 slots on the tour are booked. We also charge a very small single supplement fee, so our single travellers can have the comforts of a private room without having to break the bank. <br/><br/>Highlights:<br/>- Stay in Cuban B&amp;B’s (air-conditioned and ensuite facilities)<br/>- Private air-conditioned transportation between destinations<br/>- Guided orientation walks at each of our scheduled destinations<br/>- Swim/snorkel at the Bay of Pigs after visiting the revolution museum<br/>- Enjoy a drink at the elegant Palacio de Valle in Cienfuegos<br/>- Che Guevara Memorial and museum in Santa Clara<br/>- Informal salsa lesson<br/>- Tobacco farm and drying house<br/>- Organic farm lunch in Vinales<br/>- Explore Old Havana on foot<br/>- Tour Havana in a classic convertible<br/>- Mojito making lesson<br/>- Visit the rum museum and cigar factory in the capital<br/>- Roof-top group dinner<br/><br/>Accommodation<br/>What’s hopefully clear from our tour schedule is that interaction with the real Cuba and Cubans is an integral part of our 10 Day / 9 Night Cuba Group Tour. As a result, we place our tour guests in Cuba’s small privately run bed and breakfasts rather than the larger, state-run hotels.<br/>A unique form of holiday accommodation to Cuba, casa particular as they are known, are family-run enterprises that provide foreign visitors with a place to stay, and have only recently evolved out of the Cuban government’s relaxation on private businesses. Homelier than hotels, each casa is different in their set-up and size, however we always aim to book our guests in casas that have ensuite bathroom facilities and air-conditioning whenever this is possible.<br/><br/>Your Comfort on Tour<br/>Although our 10 Day / 9 Night Group Tour is designed for those who want to experience the real Cuba, we still want our guests to be as comfortable as possible while on tour. For this reason we always include:<br/>- Your airport transfer on arrival. <br/>- Bottled water on scheduled journeys between destinations of more than 2 hours.<br/>- Internet access cards (totalling 2 hours) so you can access the various Wifi Hotspots across the country and keep in contact with home.<br/><br/>Free time and optional activities<br/>Our 10 Day Cuba Group Tour is planned in such a way to ensure you have some free time to explore Cuba at your own pace and to meet your own exact interests. This free time also allows our guests to undertake a range of optional activities to add to the experiences gained from the extensive list of scheduled activities and highlights, so that you can make the very most of your time in Cuba.<br/>",

You don't need to carry your luggage on this trek and the national park employees take care of the cooking and tents. Meals and camping gear are provided, including sleeping mats and blankets, however it's best if you can bring your own sleeping bag as occasionally we have found that they don't bring along enough blankets, and it can get cold at night in the mountains, especially in the winter months of December through February. If you don't have a sleeping bag, a simple sleeping sheet will make you feel more comfortable. Other than that you just need to have some good footwear for walking, sunscreen, a hat, your swimwear and a change of clothes for sleeping in. The walk is not particularly difficult, however you need a reasonable level of fitness to be able to cover the distances (about 10km a day) without feelling too exhausted to enjoy the experience. In the event that you prefer to stay in Trinidad, we can provide the extra night of accommodation free of charge as you wait for the rest of the group to return.

Instead of following a fixed route or set departure, we design your Cuban journey entirely around you — your interests, travel style, timeframe and expectations. Whether you want to trace Havana’s colonial past, explore Viñales’ tobacco fields, relax on Caribbean beaches, dance to live music every night or immerse yourself in local culture, your itinerary is crafted from the ground up to match the Cuba you most want to discover.<br/><br/>What makes our tailor-made tours truly special is the combination of flexibility, local expertise, and authentic connections. You’ll work directly with our Cuba-based team who know the island intimately — the hidden neighbourhoods, the best family-run restaurants, the quietest lookout points, the warmest homestay hosts, and the real stories behind the places you visit. No two itineraries are ever the same because no two travellers are ever the same.

        "description": ": Our tour starts today in Havana - home to salsa, mojitos, and revolutionary spirit. Cuba's capital is one of the most impressive cities in the Americas, almost frozen in time with crumbling tenement blocks and 1950s American Cadillacs rubbing shoulders with grand colonial buildings and monuments to the revolution. Due to the number of evening flights into Havana, our tour leader will meet you for a welcome meeting on the morning of Day 2. Details of timings will be left in the hotel reception, as well as information about anything else you'll need for the day. There are no activities planned today, so you're free to arrive at any time. If you'd like an airport transfer, you'll need to arrive into Havana's Jose Marti International Airport (HAV) which is around a 45-minute drive from the airport. A representative from our local partners in Cuba will meet you at Havana Airport and assist you with the transfer formalities. If your flight arrives earlier in the day, you might like to head out to explore Old Havana, just a short walk from the Capitolio building and the Malecon sea esplanade with views of the city. There are several restaurants and bars within walking distance and you're likely to hear the hypnotic rhythms of salsa, trova and son being played along the Paseo del Prado."

Walking through the Vieja (Old) District, we'll discover the baroque cathedral and Plaza de Armas (the main square), alongside some beautiful neoclassical buildings. Along the way, you might notice the lack of advertisements which are commonplace in the West, and spot the hyperbolic, political slogans in their place - tokens that tell you, you really are in Cuba now. Passing by the famous Capitolio building (modelled on the White House), you'll get your first glimpse of the rows of brightly coloured vintage cards that adorn many a Cuban postcard. Interestingly, these are the result of legislation enforced until 2011 that meant only cars built before the 1959 revolution could be sold. After our tour, there'll be free time to explore more at your own pace. You might like to visit the Museum of the Revolution, housed in the former Presidential Palace. The Museum of Artes Decorativas is also worth a visit, a collection of furniture, porcelain, and art pieces from the 16th to 20th centuries, located in one of Vedado's grandest mansions. Later this afternoon, we'll get to grips with la vida Cubana with a rum and tobacco pairing followed by a salsa class, where you can learn some steps to Cuba's classic dance. To finish off our packed day, there's the option to sample some of the capital's nightlife, giving you the opportunity to practice your newly learned salsa moves. The Hotel Ambos Mundos is a Hemingway landmark where the 1954 Nobel Prize winner lived for several years. Walk in his footsteps and grab a mojito up on the roof terrace. There are also several excellent bars in both Old Havana and Vedado where live music is played and the cocktails flow freely."

Here, surreal mountains - the result of the erosion of limestone over millions of years - jut out of the landscape. They're locally known as 'haystacks' (or 'mogotes' in Cuban Spanish) thanks to their steep sides and rounded, jungly tops. Around them, are a patchwork of tobacco fields, with their iron-rich, red soil - the raw material for Cuba's famous cigars. We'll have a two-hour walk through the valleys of this remarkable landscape to the village of El Palmarito. Mogotes tower above us as we pass through tobacco fields and past drying barns, and during our walk we'll learn more about Cuba's prolific cigar-making industry, which stems from the plants growing in this region.

We'll break up the long journey with a swim in a 'cenote' - a pool formed when the ceiling of an underground river collapses. We'll also stop in Playa Giron around mid-afternoon, where we'll visit the museum dedicated to the infamous 'Bay of Pigs' invasion - a US-supported attack by Cuban exiles which failed to overthrow the Communist regime in 1961. Our journey continues, past the wooded Escambray Mountains and hugging the coastline, with views over the sparkling turquoise waters of the Caribbean Sea. By early evening, we'll arrive at the beautiful Spanish colonial town of Trinidad - our base for the next three nights. Here, we'll stay in 'casa particulares' (local guesthouses), a type of accommodation that's unique to Cuba. The industry began in the early 1990s when entrepreneurial homeowners would rent out rooms in their home. The side hustle was initially illegal as communist Cuba didn't allow for private enterprises but was legalised in 1997. Today, it's common to find large casas that run as bed and breakfasts, however, the majority are still a couple of rooms in the owner's house. This gives you a truly unique, local experience as no two casas are the same - you'll have ensuite bathrooms, air-conditioning, and breakfast across the board but that's where the similarity ends. We choose to use these casas particulares as they give a truly authentic Cuban experience, an alternative to standard hotels, and a new perspective on local life. Our driving time today will be approximately five hours."

A paradise for photographers, this UNESCO World Heritage Site is a perfectly preserved colonial settlement unlike any other. In the early 19th century, French settlers fleeing a slave revolt in Haiti landed here and started to grow sugar cane in the Valle de Los Ingenios. This crop generated considerable wealth and consequently, the town had to be regularly defended from pirates. Subject to opening hours, we'll visit a local museum before having free time to explore more. It's worth climbing the stairs of the bell tower at the small Museo de la Lucha contra Bandidos, purely for the views across the roofs of Trinidad out to the Caribbean at one side and the Escambray Mountains at the other. In the evening, you might like to head to the open-air Casa de la Musica, just off the main square, where live bands and salsa-dancing locals do their thing well into the night."

Another option is to head into the Escambray Mountains to the Topes de Collantes Nature Reserve Park. With its acres of unspoilt forest, this area is famous for its many endemic species of flora and fauna, particularly birdlife. There are several different options involving short walks through the coffee growing area and rainforest. Most trips will drive up to some incredible viewpoints and several of the options offer an opportunity of a refreshing swim in one of its waterfalls finished off with a traditional creole lunch in one of the local haciendas. Your tour leader will run through the different options with you. Alternatively, you could visit the deserted island of Cayo Blanco, where you can eat fresh paella, relax on the beach and snorkel in the coral wilderness.

Santa Clara is a pleasant university town which was originally a prosperous agricultural area, well-placed on the island's trading route. Now, it's most famous for being the site of the last battle of the Revolution, in which Che Guevara's troops took the city, causing the Cuban dictator, Batista, to flee into exile. After visiting the Tren Blindado Memorial commemorating this historic event, we'll move on to Che's Mausoleum. Guevara was buried here with full military honours in 1997 after his exhumed remains were discovered in Bolivia and returned to Cuba. A flame lit by Fidel Castro burns eternally to honour the national hero who played a key role in Cuba's revolution and whose image is routinely displayed throughout the country. We'll also visit the museum dedicated to Guevara's life, containing many interesting letters and artefacts. This evening, we'll return to Havana to enjoy a final dinner and a dance.

The many marvellous monuments, cathedrals and palaces of the city’s historical centre are brought to life by a constant hustle and bustle and the unmistakable sound of Cuban son.

Your included airport arrival transfer will take you to your Havana guesthouse for the first night. If you arrive early today, you'll have time to do some exploring on your own before meeting the rest of your tour group, and your tour guide, tonight. Your guide will leave you a note at your guesthouse with details about the group meeting time and place. Your accommodation in Havana for the tour will either be in Old Havana, Central Havana, or Vedado. The neighbourhoods of Old Havana and Central Havana are some of the places where you will feel Cuba at its most intense - narrow streets with old crumbling buildings and full of locals who are not placed there for the tourists but rather because this is their home. You will see them working, going to school, socialising, and going about their daily lives. Simply wandering the streets will give you a new experience and fill you with many questions about how Cuba functions as a country. Vedado is another interesting part of Havana where there is a concentration of restaurants, bars, majestic mansions, and historic mafia built hotels. The tour package itself does not include much time in Havana, so we recommend that you book an extra night or two in Havana, either before or after the tour. After the tour is probably preferable, as by then, you will have learnt a bit about how things work in Cuba and how to get around. Plus you'll have the chance to talk to your tour guide and get some recommendations of what to do and see in Havana. When you book the tour you can request these extra nights on your booking form."

Lush mangroves surround this serene lagoon, and it serves as a crucial habitat for a variety of bird species, including the majestic flamingos that gather in large flocks during certain times of the year. Our next stop is in Cienfuegos, whose appeal lies partly in the European flavour of its colonial hub, with a wide Parisian-style boulevard and elegant colonnades, Cuba’s most celebrated Son singer was inspired to write the words “Cienfuegos is the city I like best”. For many visitors to Cuba, Trinidad is their standout favourite destination. No other colonial city in Cuba is so well preserved, and the local residents are extremely friendly and festive. Trinidad is steeped in religiosity, none the least of which is Santeria, which is one of several Afro-Cuban religions. The thing however that visitors most love about Trinidad is the nightlife. There are no less than 10 live music venues all within a short walking distance. Many of these have lovely outdoor settings, in courtyards, and within the walls of old colonial ruins. Not far inland is the Valley of Sugarmills. This area of rich fertile soil is where the Trinidad colonists got most of their ludicrous wealth from. A 10 minute drive in the opposite direction will get you to a beautiful calm Caribbean beach called Playa Ancón. If the weather is fine, your tour guide might propose a dinner bbq here to witness the sunset over the ocean. Other optional activities in Trinidad are snorkeling, scuba diving, and a popular trek to a waterfall where you can swim in the fresh clear water spring. Suggested optional activities: Waterfall hike Dance lessons Craft market Ancon Beach"

The tobacco growing region around Viñales is next, where you can go horseriding through the valleys and mountains, bedecked with farms and plantations, limestone caves and lakes. <br/><br/>More cultural delights await in coastal Cienfuegos, otherwise known as the \"Pearl of the South\" and another Cuban UNESCO World Heritage site for its French colonial buildings and palaces. As with several other places along your way, you stay in a traditional casa particular, or homestay, where the now familiar great Cuban welcome is par for the course. <br/><br/>Coastal and Caribbean culture will take you all the way back to Havana, with a couple of days in both the colourful, historical town of Trinidad, considered the musical capital by many, and some serious chill out time on the island of Cayo Santa Maria. <br/>",

There’s also a chance to get a hands-on lesson with the musical instruments themselves in a percussion workshop. By now, hopefully you've learnt enough of the local rhythms to join in with the locals – maybe at a certain venue hidden within a cave! You could also take a hands-on percussion workshop. A bike is a great way to explore the local area, but like its cars, Cuba's bicycles are vintage, which means a little bit of practicality may be sacrificed for the romance. You could even take a trip to Playa Ancon and relax on the beach or go snorkelling through the clear waters (just watch for sea urchins, which can be a problem here).

    "generalInfo": "Discover the real Cuba on our Cuba tours, with activities including walking in the mountains, salsa classes, scuba diving, snorkelling, horseback riding, learning Spanish, catamaran trips – and enjoying the vibrant, salsa-infused nightlife. This beautiful island is ringed with coral reefs and clear blue water that laps the sandy beaches. But Cuba is not just another Caribbean island; the energy and creativity of its people lend it a unique vibe, and life here is celebrated with humour and passion. Away from the historic towns and cities, there are pristine natural landscapes – this is one of the Caribbean’s most fascinating and seductive destinations.<br/><br/>This holiday to Cuba is a round trip of the island, it can be individual fully tailor made or booked as described as a small grouptravel escorted by one of the most experienced tourleaders throughout. Licenced as well as mountainleader. You’ll start in Havana, where you’ll be staying in a boutique homestay, and cover the island with your own bus, a Cuban guide and your tourleader, staying in family-run casas particulares (homestays) along the way which gives a real insight into daily life. We’ll stop at the beaches along the way to cool off or snorkel in the crystal clear waters. The bus will stay all the time with us.<br/><br/>This 24-day Cuba holiday can start any date.and can also be booked by American citizens as with this program you support the Cuban community. In case you wish to have a private departure for a travelparty with a tourleader on the dates of your choice please check availabilities first with us and our tourguide. We also offer a 10 day variant traveling with your own bus staying on the western and central part of the island.<br/><br/>We can also adapt this itinerary for two or more people – traveling without a tourleader, as a self drive holiday, or traveling by regular bus with some local taxis. You will be joined by local experienced guides at each location for the excursions you have included.<br/><br/>These holidays all introduce you to a Cuba where little has changed over the decades. Your guide will take you out on day walks to meet local people, and at night they will accompany you to the bars to enjoy live salsa music – or wild dancing. In the Sierra de Escambray, you can experience Cuba’s subtropical forests, waterfalls and coffee plantations. In Baracoa, meet local cocoa and coconut farmers on a walk through the stunning landscape. These are easy walks at a relaxed pace, although following rain the mountain paths may become slippery, making the walks a little more difficult. Good walking shoes are essential and walking sticks may come handy.<br/><br/>Your tourleader can help you organise activities including horseback rides, salsa dancing lessons and cooking classes. You can also visit some of the best paladares – local restaurants – to enjoy traditional dishes such as lobster, vegetarian meals or just a really good mojito. Your guide can also organise trips to make the most of the Cuban nightlife. Chatting with the families in the casas particulares will improve your Spanish, and there are plenty of opportunities to meet Cuban people.<br/><br/>The tourleader for this Cuba small group holiday has been leading trips since 2001 and has made over 50 travels on Cuba from West to East since that time guiding clients and traveling with his own family. Your leader is an expert on Cuba’s rich culture and natural history, and for Cubans he is like a family member – you’re sure to feel the same as you make new friends and share stories across the island. You’re bound to receive invitations to dance, to listen to music and join in local events along with your guide. Your tourleader has extensive Cuba travel networks all over the island.<br/><br/>Our groups include solo travellers, couples, friends and families with children of all ages welcome. At all days we can improvise with the programs for those who need some flexibility and make it a great journey for everyone. Free time is factored in to relax, explore the towns or organise additional activities.<br/><br/>We can tailor the itinerary in each destination to your own interests, options include:<br/><br/> - Guided city tours<br/> - Cycling (day trips or a full itinerary)<br/> - Hikes (Vinales, Soroa, Sierra Escambray, Zapata, Sierra Maestra, Mil Cumbres, Baracoa)<br/> - Horse riding<br/> - Jeep safaris<br/> - Bird watching (in Vinales, Zapata National Park, Sierra Rosario – with the option of staying in a mountain lodge in Vinales to spot 20 endemics)<br/> - Cenote trail in Zapata<br/> - Catamaran trips to tropical cays<br/> - Scuba diving at various locations around the island, including Maria la Gorda and Jardines de la Reina<br/> - Cave tours in Vinales<br/> - Cooking classes in Havana and Trinidad<br/> - Reservations at top restaurants<br/> - Shows including Buena Vista Social Club, the National Theatre and Tropicana<br/> - Spanish courses <br/> - Salsa or drumming classes in Havana and Trinidad<br/><br/>The homestays (casas particulares) can be arranged with Spanish, salsa or cooking teachers so you can start learning right away. We also offer adapted versions of this trip with extensions for scuba diving or beach stays on the main island or smaller cays. For keen hikers, we can organise multi day coast to coast treks through the Sierra Escambray.<br/><br/>The Cuba small group tour uses private minivans to travel between destinations. The minivan and driver stay with us all the time throughout the whole journey in case of a group escorted travel. This gives us plenty of flexibility each day as well as getting us off the main roads and to travel through lesser visited areas. Besides the tourleader expert we have a Cuban guide on the bus for the travels of this year. <br/><br/>For individual tailor made departures, there are a number of transport options and prices will be adjusted accordingly:<br/><br/> - Rental car with either a driver or selfdrive.<br/> - Public buses for longer journeys, with taxis for shorter stretches.<br/> - Private taxis, or minivans for larger groups. Public buses can still be used on longer stretches to reduce costs. <br/> - Vintage cars can be used for day excursions or for longer journeys; these can carry two to four passengers with luggage, pros and contras to be explained on Skype.<br/><br/>Another way of exploring Cuba is by bicycle. In order to cover as much as possible of Western, Central and Eastern Cuba, our cycling tours make use of the regular bus and/or minivan taxi transfers on the longer transfers – leaving you to cycle the most interesting stretches. On individual tailor made cycling tours you’ll need to bring your own bike with some spare parts in order to keep costs reasonable, and we will design the day to day itinerary together with you. You can also tour around Cuba by motorbike, travelling around Western and Central Cuba on Harley Davidsons accompanied by an English speaking guide and a technical support team. The tour takes 10 days, with 1-9 travellers per group.<br/><br/>You can also dive at the most fascinating diving location in the Caribbean, the Gardens of the Queen, or Jardines de la Reina in Spanish. Important is that we can build here a balanced tailor made land program around this diving week and that this combination of both is also available for individual USA divers. Gardens of the Queen is certainly one of the last virgin reefs known by man famous for large groups of big fish and 6 varieties of sharks. Dive and snorkel sites are well protected from the winds and sea currents. Visibility is more than 40 meters. <br/><br/>We have more than 250 independent reviews on Responsible Travel on our destinations in Latin America from Cuba, Mexico, Ruta Maya to Guatemala &amp; Belize, Bolivia, Brasil, Ecuador, Peru, Colombia, Venezuela to Chile and Argentina. Contact us for a chat via Skype, Whatsapp and ask for a tailor made itinery and quote. You can find our other Cuba products on this site of Responsible travel under Cuba tours, Selfdrive Cuba family holiday and Scuba diving and tour in Cuba.<br/><br/>Important, update actual situation West and Central Cuba: all tourist services work perfect, our homestays outside Havana have their own generator, they will provide the house of electricity for you and the family in case necessary, all travellers who have been recently on Cuba had a great trip. Further due to shortages in petrol for the rental car market we recommend to travel by private taxi (private minivans for families &amp; groups), regular tourist bus or shuttle minibuses as they fall under the umbrella of the Cuban Government and can make use of special storage stations. We all arrange your transfers by private taxi, van or bus. At the actual situation we do not recommend traveling by rental car as the actual situation is very changeable meaning that we can not predict if you can find sufficient petrol at the regular petrol stations. We do offer rental cars though to experienced travellers who speak Spanish at own risk. It is a kind of adventure and depends very much on everyone’s abilities to deal with eventual challenges. Please plan a chat with us when you wish to receive more details. Cuba stays fascinating and an amazing destination. We also offer since recently again holidays and relatively short roundtrips in East Cuba with our teams in Havana &amp; Baracoa, all traveling by private taxi. You can fly in and out from the Holguin international airport.",

        "description": "Perhaps kick-start your morning with some Cuban coffee (it's served black, strong and super sweet) then bid farewell to Cienfuegos and board the bus for a short drive to Trinidad – a beautifully preserved colonial down that sits on the scenic Caribbean coast. There's no doubt it's one of Cuba's alluring destinations, a great place to wander around, with almost every scene offering a photo opportunity. Watch as locals casually smoke their huge cigars on the doorsteps of their homes, and hear the old Chevrolets rumbling by. Begin by strolling along the cobbled streets and marvelling at some of the colourful colonial architecture on display (this town was put on the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1988 for good reason), then feel the Cuban rhythms during a casual salsa class – a sure-fire way to boost your confidence in preparation for Trinidad’s nightlife!"

Enjoy a free day to check-out Trinidad at your own pace. There are some great Spanish-style churches to see, and nearby is the Valle de los Ingenios, where sugar plantations stretch out as far as the eye can see. Why not go for a dip at nearby Playa Ancon and loll about on the long stretches of white sand or hire a bike of the vintage variety and cycle along Trinidad’s colourful (and cobblestone) streets. If you’re feeling energetic, then hiking in the Sierra del Escambray (the local mountains) is a great option – just ask your leader to help you decide! This evening, a folklore dance and music show in one of the open-air venues is highly recommended – a great chance to immerse yourself in Cuba's African, French and Spanish-influenced music and dance culture."

Further due to shortages in petrol for the rental car market we recommend to travel by private taxi (private minivans for families &amp; groups), regular tourist bus or shuttle minibuses as they fall under the umbrella of the Cuban Government and can make use of special storage stations. We all arrange your transfers by private taxi, van or bus. At the actual situation we do not recommend traveling by rental car as the actual situation is very changeable meaning that we can not predict if you can find sufficient petrol at the regular petrol stations. We do offer rental cars though to experienced travellers who speak Spanish at own risk. It is a kind of adventure and depends very much on everyone’s abilities to deal with eventual challenges. Please plan a chat with us when you wish to receive more details. Cuba stays fascinating and an amazing destination. We also offer since recently again holidays and roundtrips in East Cuba with our teams in Havana &amp; Baracoa, all traveling by private taxi.

This morning your tour leader will take you on a walking tour of Old Havana. You will visit the main attractions and also to some local favourite hidden corners!

The neighbourhoods of Central Habana, Vedado, and Miramar have their own characteristics and charms, and these are best seen in a slow riding open air car.

We stop in the Bay of Pigs at an excellent site for snorkelling which can be done straight off the coast. Snorkelling gear is available for hire at low cost. If water activities are not your thing, you can sit in the share of a sea grape tree and enjoy the natural scenery. The port city of Cienfuegos was developed by the French who came here to settle. The French had a strong influence on the city layout, which features an expansive main square, and a very pretty boulevard that runs from the city center, along the edge of the bay and to the end of the peninsula. It's here at the end of Peninsula the Palacio del Valle sits. This was a privately built mansion that was constructed by a wealthy businessman and merchant. The architecture of the building is a mixture of styles, but what is clear is that a great deal of expense and effort went into its construction and decoration. The result is nothing short of spectacular. Included Activity - Bay of Pigs swim, Palacio del Valle entry. Included Meals - Breakfast, Lunch"

We'll follow a trail through forests and valleys, past streams and glades with flowers, butterflies and darting hummingbirds. Further on, we'll reach La Batata, a cave through which an underground river gurgles, gently carving out rock pools. The water rarely exceeds 20°C so a dip is exhilarating. We'll walk on until we reach the isolated Hacienda Codina, set in a green valley with manicured gardens all around. The traditional hacienda has a pleasant bar and veranda, with rocking chairs to sit back and enjoy the view. We'll enjoy a leisurely lunch in the dining area, surrounded by colourful flowers and birds, then rest through the hottest part of the day. Later in the afternoon, we'll explore a short nature trail close to the hacienda, with rare orchids and unusual medicinal plants. At one point the trail passes through a cave (Cueva del Altar), emerging on the other side of the hill to beautiful views over the distant Caribbean. Later, we'll have dinner, enjoying another traditional home-cooked meal, before settling down for the night in our tents (or, like last night, you can choose to sleep under the eaves on the veranda). Once again, you can skip the walk today and travel to the hacienda by truck if you'd prefer."

Along the way, you might notice the lack of advertisements which are commonplace in the West, and spot the hyperbolic, political slogans in their place - tokens that tell you, you really are in Cuba now. Here in Vinales, the surreal mountains take centre stage - the result of the erosion of limestone over millions of years . They're locally known as 'haystacks' (or 'mogotes' in Cuban Spanish) thanks to their steep sides and rounded, jungly tops. Around them are a patchwork of tobacco fields, with their iron-rich, red soil - the raw material for Cuba's famous cigars. We'll have a guided two-hour walk through the Vinales Valley National Park, which has UNESCO world heritage status. Your guide will point out the flora and fauna of this unique region. Mogotes tower above us as we pass through tobacco fields and past drying barns, and during our walk we'll stop at a traditional Cuban farm to learn more about Cuba's cigar-making industry, which stems from the plants growing in this region. You may even have the chance to sample the goods if you wish. After our walk, you might like to visit the Cueva del Indio - one of the many subterranean caves in this area - or relax at our hotel.

From there, we'll trek to La Comandancia de La Plata (6 kilometres round trip hike). It's worth noting that the path is steep, uneven, and can be muddy after rain- comfortable shoes are a must. If you wish you can bring hiking poles, however they are not essential. It was here that Fidel Castro and Che Guevara took refuge after an unsuccessful uprising against the Cuban dictator, Batista, in 1956. As you walk around this hideaway, which became the revolutionaries' headquarters until Batista fled Cuba in 1959, you get a real sense of their two-year residency here. Castro's simple camp bed and fridge still remain, along with a trap door for a speedy exit in the event of an attack. The original broadcast hut for 'Radio Rebelde' still stands, as well as Che's hospital hut where he worked as a doctor. While photography was previously forbidden here, you can now snap pictures for a small fee. After our included lunch, we'll drive down the mountain in our specialised 4WD vehicles, where we'll meet our bus and continue to our final destination and Cuba's second largest city- Santiago de Cuba.

Historically, Santiago de Cuba was the island's second-most important city after Havana and remains its second-largest today. It served as Cuba's capital at one point, was the birthplace of the Bacardi rum brand, and was the origin of the revolutionary movement that led to the Cuban Revolution which governed the country for over fifty years. Today, your tour leader will guide you through a walking tour of the city, visiting its historic squares and landmarks. You'll visit the Moncada Barracks, site of Fidel Castro's infamous but chaotic initial attack on the Batista regime, often considered the birth of the revolution. We will also stop at the Santa Ifigenia Cemetery, where both José Martí, the ideological father of Cuba, and Fidel Castro are buried. This afternoon, you'll have free time to explore on your own. Consider visiting the Diego Velázquez Museum, the Carnival Museum, or the Bacardi Museum. In the evening, immerse yourself in Santiago's vibrant music scene. Known for its deep Caribbean influence and laid-back atmosphere, Santiago de Cuba reflects a strong African heritage through its music and rhythms. *Please note on the January 2026 departure we would have completed the city tour on Day 7. Today we will be heading to Gran Piedra lookout near Santiago de Cuba. We will take a bus uphill for approximately 14km before climbing 459 steps to reach the lookout.

Today, the ruined sugar mills and mansions lining the valley bear witness to the previous prosperity in the area. We'll also stop at the infamous Torre de Manaca Iznaga, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This seven-floor tower was built to watch over the slaves working in the fields and had two bells. One was rung when the slaves could stop working and take a meal, the other when a slave escaped. By early evening, we'll arrive at our casa particular just outside the beautiful Spanish colonial town of Trinidad. 'Casa particulares' (local guesthouses) are a type of accommodation that's unique to Cuba. The industry began in the early 1990s when entrepreneurial homeowners would rent out rooms in their home. The side hustle was initially illegal as communist Cuba didn't allow for private enterprises but was legalised in 1997. Today, it's common to find large casas that run as bed and breakfasts, however, the majority - particularly in Havana - are still a couple of rooms in the owner's house. This gives you a truly unique, local experience as no two casas are the same - you'll have ensuite bathrooms, air-conditioning, and a delicious breakfast across the board but that's where the similarity ends. We choose to use these casas as they give a truly authentic Cuban experience, an alternative to standard hotels, and a new perspective on local life. Today's total drive time will take around 5 hours."

        "description": ": This morning, we'll wander through the cobbled streets of the old centre of Trinidad, discovering its fine palaces, churches and cafes. A paradise for photographers, this UNESCO World Heritage Site is a perfectly preserved colonial settlement unlike any other. In the early 19th century, French settlers fleeing a slave revolt in Haiti landed here and started to grow sugar cane in the Valle de Los Ingenios. This crop generated considerable wealth and consequently, the town had to be regularly defended from pirates. Subject to opening hours, we'll visit a local museum before having free time to explore more. It's worth climbing the stairs of the bell tower at the small Museo de la Lucha contra Bandidos, purely for the views across the roofs of Trinidad out to the Caribbean at one side and the Escambray Mountains at the other. Depending on seasonality, your tour leader will guide you to visit 'Casa Chichi,' a pottery house operated by the Santander family for generations, the workshop preserves the legacy of Spanish colonialists through their unglazed bricks, roof tiles, and floor tiles still visible in Cuba. The afternoon is free to spend as you'd like. Playa Ancon's white-sand beach is just a 15-minute taxi ride away or there's the opportunity to take a salsa lesson with a local teacher. In the evening, we'll head to the open-air Casa de la Musica, just off the main square, where live bands and salsa-dancing locals do their thing well into the night. Take this chance to try the local cocktail speciality: Canchanchara"

        "description": ": Today we'll travel inland to Topes de Collantes Nature Reserve Park, famous for its many endemic species of flora and fauna. We'll have two nights to explore the area in-depth. After a ride in an old Russian military-style truck up a steep, switch-back road into the lush Escambray Mountains, we'll arrive at the park entrance. Here, we'll meet our local guide who, along with our tour leader, will help us to explore the park. Please note, there's an 8 kilometre/5 mile trek to our hacienda accommodation. Those who would prefer not to walk can continue with the truck to the hacienda. Our hike may vary slightly, depending on the weather and the group, but it's likely to take us into the coffee-growing valley of the Guayanara River. The paths are undulating and can be uneven underfoot, but the views are truly rewarding. Along our route, we'll pass rural homes and may see shepherds minding their herds of goats. After our hike, we'll arrive at our hacienda, a small farmstead set in a rocky valley, where we'll have an included lunch. The afternoon is free for you to explore at your own pace. We recommend the 5 kilometre/3 mile circular walk (approximately three hours) to the Salto de Rocio Waterfall - an area flush with trogons, hummingbirds and woodpeckers. To get to the waterfall, you'll follow a riverside track where you're likely to see tree fern, bromeliad and orchid species. On arrival at the waterfalls and lakes, adventurous swimmers might like to take a dip, or you can relax on the banks. Dinner is included tonight at our hacienda. The accommodation is simple. You have the option to sleep out under the eaves of the hacienda's veranda or in the platformed tents. Foam mattresses are provided but you might want to bring your own sleeping bag. There are male and female washing facilities in a nearby block. With the fresh mountain air, canopy of stars and peaceful, remote setting, you're guaranteed a good night's sleep. Please note that the order of Day 11 and Day 12 may be swapped. Today's total drive time from Trinidad to Topes will take around 1.5 hours."

Again, anyone not wanting to join the walk can continue on to tonight's hacienda with the truck. Our trek takes us through pine forest and along paths bordered by mahogany and hibiscus. If we're lucky, we may see brightly coloured hummingbirds flash past, darting from flower to flower, searching for nectar. When we reach La Batata, we'll have the opportunity to swim in an open cave. The water rarely exceeds 20°C, so it's an exhilarating dip. We'll then trek on through the forest until we reach our hacienda, set in a lush valley. This is our base for the night and where we'll have an included lunch and dinner. In the afternoon, our local guide will take us on a circular trail (approximately 1.5 kilometres/0.9 miles), telling us about the orchids and medicinal plants that we can find en route. We'll also head down through a cave, La Cueva del Altar, emerging on the other side of the hill, where we'll have views of the Caribbean. This evening is a similar set-up to our accommodation last night."

We plan to break up our journey back to Havana with several stops, the first of which is at the colonial seaport of Cienfuegos. Here, we'll stretch our legs with a short orientation tour of the town, including the Marti Park overlooked by the grand Italian-style Tomas Terry theatre. Our journey continues to Museo Giron. This small museum is dedicated to the infamous 'Bay of Pigs' invasion' - a US-supported attack by Cuban exiles which failed to overthrow the Communist regime in 1961. This museum is entirely in Spanish, however your tour leader will guide you through and give explanations to key exhibits. Our final stop on the Zapata Peninsula is a quick stop near a fresh water cenote - a pool formed when the roof of a river collapses - where we can take the opportunity for a quick dip. Alternatively, directly across the road from the cenote is the Caribbean ocean- the choice is yours on where you wish to swim. By early evening, we'll have arrived back at our hotel in Havana. Tonight we enjoy an included meal at a local rooftop restaurant to say goodbye to our new found friends. Our total driving time today will be around 7 hours."

A visit to the church of Our Lady of Regla introduces us to Santeria, brought to Cuba by slaves in colonial times and still practiced by millions of Cubans. We then carry on to the local museum where we are introduced to some of the rhythms and chants associated with Santeria.

Activities involved are diving, walking excursions, with catamaran to a tropical key, swimming, horse riding, snorkelling and visiting a cave. <br/><br/>This holiday takes you to the Pearl of The Caribbean with the best individual programs available to experience Cuban nature &amp; culture. Cuba is a beautiful island surrounded by sandy beaches, coral reefs and blue waters. It has a very specific vibration of its own - the Cuban people show a playfulness and a joy which is remarkable. They celebrate life with humor, love and passion. The nature on Cuba is still very pure, the people a discovery, which make Cuba still the most interesting destination of the Caribbean. Traveling in Cuba is an eye and heart opener, suitable for couples, honeymoons, friends and families alike. <br/><br/>The program is for couples, diving honeymoon, families, friends traveling as a group and single travelers. Alternative beach accommodations &amp; diving locations are e.g. at Cayo Largo del Sur, Cayo Ensenachos, Cayo Santa Maria, Cayo las Brujas, Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo, Cayo Levisa, Jardines de la Reina &amp; Playa Santa Lucia for diving with sharks and night dives. <br/><br/>Price for a dive holiday depends on having mostly homestays - casas particiculares for an authentic Cuba experience (most economic) versus having mostly hotel accommodations, on the amount of diving sessions and excursions in your tailormade program and the amount of private taxi transfers versus regular bus or shuttle bus transfers. <br/><br/>This itinery can be adapted in all ways.

In late midday back to Trinidad again by truck out of the mountains, and later on by private taxi. Alternatives, or for extra days: private guided cultural tour Trinidad & Sugarmill valley, full day Catamaran group excursion to tropical island Cayo Leguano - Cayo Blanco with snorkeling, beachlife, time for exploration island and fish lunch. More alternative excursions: deep sea fishing, horseback excursion in Valle Ingenios - Sugarmill Valley or by horseback riding from Trinidad to the waterfall at El Cubano."

        "description": ": Our tour starts today in Havana - home to salsa, mojitos, and revolutionary spirit. Cuba's capital is one of the most impressive cities in the Americas, almost frozen in time with crumbling tenement blocks and 1950s American Cadillacs rubbing shoulders with grand colonial buildings and monuments to the revolution. Due to the number of evening flights into Havana, our tour leader will meet you for a welcome meeting on the morning of Day 2. Details of timings will be left in the hotel reception, as well as information about anything else you'll need for the day. There are no activities planned today, so you're free to arrive at any time. If you'd like an airport transfer, you'll need to arrive into Havana's Jose Marti International Airport (HAV) which is around a 45-minute drive from the airport. A representative from our local partners in Cuba will meet you at Havana Airport and assist you with the transfer formalities. If your flight arrives earlier in the day, you might like to head out to explore Old Havana, just a short walk from the Capitolio building and the Malecon sea esplanade with views of the city. There are several restaurants and bars within walking distance and you're likely to hear the hypnotic rhythms of salsa, trova and son being played along the Paseo del Prado."

Walking through the Vieja (Old) District, we'll discover the baroque cathedral and Plaza de Armas (the main square), alongside some beautiful neoclassical buildings. Along the way, you might notice the lack of advertisements which are commonplace in the West, and spot the hyperbolic, political slogans in their place - tokens that tell you, you really are in Cuba now. Passing by the famous Capitolio building (modelled on the White House), you'll get your first glimpse of the rows of brightly coloured vintage cards that adorn many a Cuban postcard. Interestingly, these are the result of legislation enforced until 2011 that meant only cars built before the 1959 revolution could be sold. After our tour, there'll be free time to explore Havana more at your own pace. Later this afternoon, we'll get to grips with la vida Cubana with a rum and tobacco pairing followed by a salsa class, where you can learn some steps to Cuba's classic dance. To finish off our packed day, there's the option to sample some of the capital's nightlife, giving you the opportunity to practice your newly learned salsa moves. The Hotel Ambos Mundos is a Hemingway landmark where the 1954 Nobel Prize winner lived for several years. Walk in his footsteps and grab a mojito up on the roof terrace. There are also several excellent bars in both Old Havana and Vedado where live music is played and the cocktails flow freely."

Here, surreal mountains - the result of the erosion of limestone over millions of years - jut out of the landscape. They're locally known as 'haystacks' (or 'mogotes' in Cuban Spanish) thanks to their steep sides and rounded, jungly tops. Around them, are a patchwork of tobacco fields, with their iron-rich, red soil - the raw material for Cuba's famous cigars. We'll have a two-hour walk through the valleys of this remarkable landscape to the village of El Palmarito. Mogotes tower above us as we pass through tobacco fields and past drying barns, and during our walk we'll learn more about Cuba's prolific cigar-making industry, which stems from the plants growing in this region.

We'll break up the long journey with a swim in a 'cenote' - a pool formed when the ceiling of an underground river collapses. We'll also stop in Playa Giron around mid-afternoon, where we'll visit the museum dedicated to the infamous 'Bay of Pigs' invasion - a US-supported attack by Cuban exiles which failed to overthrow the Communist regime in 1961. Our journey continues, past the wooded Escambray Mountains and hugging the coastline, with views over the sparkling turquoise waters of the Caribbean Sea. By early evening, we'll arrive at the beautiful Spanish colonial town of Trinidad - our base for the next three nights. Here, we'll stay in 'casa particulares' (local guesthouses), a type of accommodation that's unique to Cuba. The industry began in the early 1990s when entrepreneurial homeowners would rent out rooms in their home. The side hustle was initially illegal as communist Cuba didn't allow for private enterprises but was legalised in 1997. Today, it's common to find large casas that run as bed and breakfasts, however, the majority are still a couple of rooms in the owner's house. This gives you a truly unique, local experience as no two casas are the same - you'll have ensuite bathrooms, air-conditioning, and breakfast across the board but that's where the similarity ends. We choose to use these casas particulares as they give a truly authentic Cuban experience, an alternative to standard hotels, and a new perspective on local life. Our driving time today will be approximately five hours."

A paradise for photographers, this UNESCO World Heritage Site is a perfectly preserved colonial settlement unlike any other. In the early 19th century, French settlers fleeing a slave revolt in Haiti landed here and started to grow sugar cane in the Valle de Los Ingenios. This crop generated considerable wealth and consequently, the town had to be regularly defended from pirates. Subject to opening hours, we'll visit a local museum before having free time to explore more. It's worth climbing the stairs of the bell tower at the small Museo de la Lucha contra Bandidos, purely for the views across the roofs of Trinidad out to the Caribbean at one side and the Escambray Mountains at the other. In the evening, you might like to head to the open-air Casa de la Musica, just off the main square, where live bands and salsa-dancing locals do their thing well into the night."

Another option is to head into the Escambray Mountains to the Topes de Collantes Nature Reserve Park. With its acres of unspoilt forest, this area is famous for its many endemic species of flora and fauna, particularly birdlife. There are several different options involving short walks through the coffee growing area and rainforest. Most trips will drive up to some incredible viewpoints and several of the options offer an opportunity of a refreshing swim in one of its waterfalls finished off with a traditional creole lunch in one of the local haciendas. Your tour leader will run through the different options with you.

Santa Clara is a pleasant university town which was originally a prosperous agricultural area, well-placed on the island's trading route. Now, it's most famous for being the site of the last battle of the Revolution, in which Che Guevara's troops took the city, causing the Cuban dictator, Batista, to flee into exile. After visiting the Tren Blindado Memorial commemorating this historic event, we'll move on to Che's Mausoleum. Guevara was buried here with full military honours in 1997 after his exhumed remains were discovered in Bolivia and returned to Cuba. A flame lit by Fidel Castro burns eternally to honour the national hero who played a key role in Cuba's revolution and whose image is routinely displayed throughout the country. We'll also visit the museum dedicated to Guevara's life, containing many interesting letters and artefacts.

Learn about Bayamo’s pivotal role in the fight for freedom, led by local hero Carlos Manuel de Céspedes, known as the \"Father of the Homeland.\" In 1868, Céspedes made a bold and revolutionary move by freeing his slaves and initiating Cuba’s independence war, marking the beginning of the abolition of slavery and the struggle for independence from Spain. After delving into Bayamo’s rich history, we continue 2-hours east, past Santiago de Cuba to the serene Mountains of Segundo Frente, where you’ll stay in a beautiful location surrounded by nature.

We'll also see the Casa de Diego Velázquez, one of the oldest colonial houses in Cuba, and now a museum offering a glimpse into the city's early life. On the second day, we will visit the sacred Sanctuary of Our Lady of Charity of El Cobre, a beautiful yellow church perched in the hills near Santiago de Cuba. See the revered image of the Virgin, explore the Hall of Miracles, and learn about Cuban faith. Optional but highly recommended is the city tour which includes the Castillo del Morro, a well-preserved fortress overlooking the bay. Here, you will learn about the city's strategic importance and enjoy panoramic views of the coastline. A visit to the Moncada Barracks, now a school complex, provides a deep understanding of the Cuban Revolution's beginning.

The first one is an alley called the Callejon de Hammel. This is where local artist Salvador Gonzáles Escalona has done some colourful decorations of the street with a distinctive African flavour. In fact, many of the works are dedications to specific Afro-Cuban religious demi-gods. Next we visit a neighbourhood on the outskirts of Havana called Jaimanitas. It is here that Jose Fuster has made a very impressive project called Fusterlandia in which works are made in mosaic ceramics. It extends from his own residence to surrounding houses and streets. Even the local medical clinic has been targeted by his creative efforts. Next stop is a mountainous area called Las Terrazas. The town itself was built as part of an environmental project in the early days of the Revolution. You'll have time for a walk around the town and to meet some of the locals. Apart from its environmental characteristics, Las Terrazas is also known as for its art, and there are a few woodwork, painting and pottery studios, that are open to the public. We eventually arrive to the mountain resort town of Soroa where we stay in the homes of the local humble residents. There are quite a few attractions around this heavily forested area including a short trek to a waterfall, a steep walk to a lookout, and an orchid garden with about 200 different types of orchids, more than half of which are endemic to Cuba.

        "description": "Soroa via Las Terrazas & Jaimanitas - On the way to Soroa we stop by at a couple of street art projects as well as the eco-community of Las Terrazas. The first street art project is the Callejon de Hammel where local resident Salvador Gonzáles Escalona has decorated, and painted in vibrant colours, a pedestrian alleyway with scrap objects like bathtubs, hand pumps, and pin wheels, with many works being dedicated to various Afro-Cuban deities. It has now become a cultural focal point with workshops for young Cuban children to learn painting. Then we visit the fishing village of Jaimanitas and the home of the famous artist Jose Fuster. Fuster has made his entire home, and much of the surrounding neighbourhood, into an artwork using tiles in mosaic forms. Now referred to as Fusterlandia, it is a unique work of public art with over 80 houses decorated with ornate murals and domes to suit the personality of each of Fuster's neighbours. He has built a chess park with giant boards and tables, a theatre, and public swimming pools. Nowadays, Fuster’s art is a cherished part of Cuban culture and joins the rank of other public artworks such as that of Gaudi in Barcelona or that of Brâncu?i in the Romanian city of Targu Jiu. About lunch time we reach the mountain community of Las Terrazas which was built as a reforestation project in the 1960s and is now a Unesco Biosphere Reserve. You can take a walk around the town to meet the friendly locals. In Las Terrazas there are also art, woodwork and pottery studios that are open to the public. We eventually arrive to the mountain resort town of Soroa where we stay in the homes of the local humble residents. There are quite a few attractions around this heavily forested area including a short trek to a waterfall, a steep walk to a lookout, and an orchid garden with about 200 different types of orchids, more than half of which are endemic to Cuba. Today there won’t be time for activities, but you may be able to do them tomorrow morning before departing to Viñales."

Vinales is one of the more agriculturally productive areas, so an abundance of local seasonal fruit and vegetables is always on offer such as enormous avocados and mangoes, pineapples, papaya, guava, and several varieties of sweet potatoes. It's one of the cooler areas of Cuba, so it's also a nice escape from the hotter parts of the country.

Wherever possible, you will be accommodated in family-run homestays, known as casas particulares, which as well as offering a valuable income to local Cubans also gives you a culturally immersive experience. <br/><br/>Begin with one of the great Havana experiences, a city tour in a classic American automobile, a triumph of Cuban mechanical ingenuity resulting from the Castro government’s embargo on imported cars and car parts. From Havana you travel by private vehicle to the charming rural town of Vinales, where farmers till the fields with oxen and dry their tobacco leaves in barns. You can visit a campesino family in their home, and learn about their lives, and how tobacco is grown.<br/><br/>A journey through the Zapata Peninsula brings you to Cienfuegos, on the south coast, with its French colonial architecture and laidback atmosphere. You then travel further east, to Trinidad. The great joy of this UNESCO World Heritage Site is strolling the plazas in the evening, experiencing local life and listening to the strains of salsa in the air. You can even book a salsa class here if you like. The final destination before your return to the capital is Santa Clara, an ideal location to learn about the Cuban Revolution as well as the role played by Ernesto ‘Che’ Guevara.  <br/><br/>Accompanied by a knowledgeable tour leader throughout, and meeting up with a series of local guides, this small group tour is a superb introduction to Cuban history, nature and culture. Unfolding over 12 days, it allows you to take a relaxed pace, allowing for a deeper immersion into Cuban life than you would get on a whistlestop tour.<br/>",

        "description": "Today you return Havana to meet with the artists that continue to encapsulate and capture the culture of Havana. The city quickly reminds you of its seemingly endless rhythm. Classic cars cruise around Central Park. Painters find shade along the paved walkway of Paseo del Prado, adorned with two bronze lions looking inward towards the city center. Visit with members of the Fabrica de Arte Cubano, an important factor in maintaining the celebrated culture of the country and Havana. The committee hosts music, dance, film, painting, and sculpture exhibits, along with providing a gallery/performance space for local artists of all types inside a converted cooking-oil factory in the Vedado district. It is common to hear citizens in the heat of spirited debate while sipping cocktails or coffee. The scent of paint and roasted coffee beans lingers in the gallery. In the neighborhood of Jaimanitas, the “Cuban Picasso,” Jose Antonio Rodriguez Fuster, has turned the streets into a living art piece. Ceramic statues, colorful mosaics, cartoonish murals provide life to the neighborhood, making every square-foot you walk through an interactive gallery. You can even visit the artist’s eccentrically decorated home, which contains a style reminiscent of Spanish architect Antonin Gaudi."

After breakfast, you meet with a group looking forward to Cuba’s future. The government sponsors the National Center for Sex Education, which among its many missions, advocates tolerance for LGBT issues on the island. You meet with a member of the committee inside a cozy room at the heart of the city. The cordial meeting feels more like a conversation where questions and answers pass freely between people. Your voice bounces off the stucco walls. In the background, you catch the sound of cars rumbling by. The committee member talks about the importance of speaking out. You feel immersed in Havana culture, going beyond the beauty of the facades and into the heart of what the people believe. After lunch, you continue to the headquarters of Granma, the Central Committee of the Cuban Communist Party. The paper was named after the yacht that carried 81 rebels to Cuban shores in the 1950s, including Fidel Castro. The paper was founded in 1965 and has included six pages of news, front, and back, since its inception. The conversation with journalists at the paper takes a different tone than the meeting with the committee member of Cenesex . The colloquial ambiance is more relaxed but includes questions that feel more pointed. The newspaper regularly includes speeches by prominent members of the government, including Raul Castro, along with developments in Latin America and world politics."

After breakfast, you spend the day exploring the different types of art on display in the city, beginning with the Museum of Fine Arts. Your art historian guide meets you in front of the 20th-century edifice. Galleries display the Cuban artwork between the 17th and 19th centuries, spanning a spectrum of topics from landscapes to religion. In the 1970s, the style of Hyperrealism predominated. Each floor in the museum has a unique theme dedicated to colonial art, modern art, and contemporary art. In the afternoon, you meet with a local Afro-Cuban dance group for a private performance. Cuban spirit fuels the movements, accentuating the amalgamation of cultures, turning sophisticated technique into a language of itself. Each member of the group brings new experiences, feelings, intentions, and movement. The elegance creates raw emotion telling the entire history of Cuba."

Traces of former American life fill the old city, along with elements of Spanish colonialism and Caribbean vibrancy. Antique cannons sit at the edge of the crowning beauty of Hotel Nacional de Cuba.

Its seaside location casts a slightly salty aroma over the Malecón, the boulevard bordering the Atlantic Ocean. In the afternoon, the waves crash against the jutting rocks and splash over the sea wall. Couples stroll along the walkway, sip rum, and listen to the passionate sounds of the water striking the edges of the city. Your first image of Cuba comes from inside the plane. As you descend into Jose Marti International Airport, you look out the window to find tall grass stretching to the mountains in the west. After you land, your private transfer greets you at baggage claim and escorts you to the elegance of your accommodation, which has housed international glitterati, from Frank Sinatra to Marilyn Monroe. After you settle into your hotel, your guide meets you in the lobby ready to introduce you to the city. Classic American cars roam around the vibrant music scene of Parque Central. The 18th-century mansion now housing Hotel Inglaterra overlooks the marbled walkway of Paseo del Prado. The Plaza de Armas has acted as the social center of Havana since the city’s inception in the 16th century. Noble families would watch military processions from their mansion balconies. The baroque structures continue to outline the square, including the magnificent Palacio de los Capitanes, which hosted Spanish generals during their time in Cuba. In the Used Booksellers Market, you find a treasure-trove of enthralling literature of every genre.

The 17th-century stone structure of Castillo de los Tres Reyes del Morro guards the entrance to Havana Bay. A brass and wood chain connected the fortress to Castillo de San Salvador de la Punta on the opposite side of the inlet. During pirate or naval attacks, guards would tighten the chain, stopping ships from entering the harbor. After breakfast, your guide meets you in the hotel lobby and leads you to one of Havana’s most famous cigar factories. A floral, rural aroma fills the factory, different from the sea and cobblestone scent of the city. Hundreds of workers roll cigars by hand, smoothing out the leaves, layering the filler, and rolling the lining until taut. Your guide explains the focus it takes to roll a cigar, along with the pride the workers have in a job well done. In the afternoon, you visit a rations store. Your host welcomes you in with open arms, eager to explain the system, along with the two-currency arrangement. A sign on the wall details the types of foods and the days in which locals can pick up their goods, from rice to beans. Make your way to the Artisan Market in a large warehouse near the water at Almacenes de San Jose on the port. Artists display their handmade goods for sale to visitors. At the entrance, you see a man slicing open coconuts. The aroma blends into the fresh paint wafting down the aisles. Wood statues stand erect next to hand-woven straw hats. You find the passion of the Havana arts world prevalent in the work. Each piece is an emotional outlet for the artists, and their use of capturing the culture in a timeless piece is memorable."

This morning, the aroma of coffee helps refresh your senses. Your private transfer escorts you into the Sierra del Rosario Mountains to the secluded eco-community of Las Terrazas, located inside the biosphere reserve. The village has a population of approximately 1,000 people nestled in the hills and terraced around a manmade lake. The reserve encompasses 12,355 acres. A community leader meets you, keen to explain the genesis of the village, which started as caretakers of the reforestation project after decades of deforestation devastated the forest landscape. In the trees, you find colorful blossoming orchids. For a different view of the lakeside and canopy, you can follow your guide into the trees to zip line down along the lakeshores. The wind blows against your skin. You fly down from platform to platform, listening to the quiet of the treetops. An occasional Cuban Trogon, the national bird, twitters along the branches. Their iridescent plumage shines against the green leaves. After your bird-like soaring over the village, you make the hike to the former 19th-century Buenavista Coffee Plantation. You can sip a freshly roasted and slow brewed coffee in the restaurant housed inside the former master’s residence, which offers a sweeping panorama of the estate. Few things are better than enjoying a quiet moment accompanied by a pristine view."

The home allows you a small insight into the life of the famous American author who wrote two of his award-winning books while living in Cuba. The house contains approximately 9,000 books positioned around every room, including the bathroom. In the garden, you catch the aroma of freshly blossomed flowers. In the afternoon, you make your way to the town of Matanzas. The antique streets have a new sheen and polish inspiring the literary and musical heritage of Cuba, lending itself to the nickname, “Athens of Cuba.” You see past the wrinkles of the aged buildings and into the cheerful, undefeated character of the culture. Danzon and rumba, two of the country’s most popular forms of dance, began in the dancehalls of the city. Music continues to spill out of cafes and clubs at all hours of the day inspiring locals to move spontaneously through the day. Once you settle into the city, you have your first taste of Matanzas during a private dance lesson. Your instructor moves your body to the same rhythm as the music.

Three renovated museums showcase the history of the city and Cuba along the city’s main plaza. The real life of Cuba opens itself to you, showcasing the dilapidated buildings and communal housing many people reside in. Horse-drawn carriages ride through the streets making it look like time has left the city behind. For an active adventure through the wilderness, you make your way to the Cuevas de Bellamar. A former slave in the 19th century discovered the caves while working in a nearby limestone quarry. The stalagmites grow from the cave floor, and stalactites drip condensation from the ceiling. Travel 100 feet through a narrow corridor into a lit room glinting with natural crystal formations. Cold water trickles into a small pool that locals call the “Fountain of Love.”"

Funda del Catre Alley is Cuba’s narrowest street at a length just over seven-feet wide and more than 250 feet long.

The tower of Revolution Square rises above the cityscape at a height of 358 feet. During state celebrations, the plaza, which encompasses five square miles, fills with Cubans eager to hear political figures speak about the nobility of Cuban people. The tower was designed to resemble a star. It faces the silhouette of revolutionary figure Che Guevara, which decorates the side of the Ministry of the Interior.

It remains one of the oldest cathedrals in the Americas and even housed the remains of Christopher Columbus from the late 18th century to the late 19th century before they were moved to Spain. Tacon Street is the only preserved wooden street in all of Cuba, and stands in front of the Palacio de los Capitanes. The 27 murals from the colonial era have garnered 12 Tacon Street’s reputation as the “Sistine Chapel of Old Havana.” The floor-to-ceiling murals were discovered from under 27 layers of paint. As of 2004, nearly 500 homes had recovered old murals dating from the 18th and 19th centuries. The artistically covered walls at Tacon Street provide historians a window into the lives of colonial residences of a bygone era.

Local men set out on the thick walls and cast their lines into the water in search of a fresh catch for the day. The contemporary high rises of the Vedado district cast a striking contrast to the colonial buildings of Old Havana. You pass the elegant structures on 5ta. Avenue, where flags wave in the breeze in front of the different country consulates. A tree-lined walkway separates the traffic down the center of the boulevard. Locals jog or stroll underneath the shade of lush oak trees. Outside of the city, the lush grass rises around the edges of the former military airport, which now houses the national aerial museum. The farther west you travel, the more rural the atmosphere becomes. Pass a large chicken farm looking out onto untended fields of tall grass. Horses graze in the distance. People ride down the narrow street on wooden buggies pulled by horses. The classic American cars seem out of place traveling down the secluded road. Before you reach the town of Vinales, your transfer pulls into a small tobacco farm. You immediately notice the red color of the soil. The region is known for growing Cuba’s finest tobacco. A guide greets you at the entrance to the farm, keen on leading you through the cultivation of tobacco in Cuba. Farmers loosen the soil around the thick, textured leaves in the ground. Chickens cluck and roost near the edges of the field. A thatched roof hut contains the drying leaves, each individually placed on a thick pole. The process can take weeks before the leaves are ready for rolling. The aroma is pleasant and slightly fruity.

Stalactites decorate the ceiling and stalagmites rise out of the damp floor. An underground swimming hole fills the end of the walking route. The water has a depth of nearly 10 feet.

        "description": "Trinidad is a city of historic beauty set in its preserved colonial structures and antique atmosphere. Horses clop down the cobblestone streets. Red-tiled rooftops slope down covering the facades of pastel colored homes. The Spanish founded the city in the 16th century. It acted as the center for gold mining and farming until becoming the hub for sugar production in the 19th century. Mansions once owned by sugar barons continue to line the city streets. Plaza Mayor stands at the heart of Old Town. Palm trees cast thin shade over the cobbled street and paved walkways. The cafes near the center provide relaxing space to grab a refreshing drink and listen to inspiring music. Wrought iron fences enclose blossoming gardens near the pastel-yellow Palacio Cantero, which houses the Municipal History Museum. The 19th-century mansion contains Italian marble floors and large open rooms displaying documents and maps of Trinidad rise through the colonial ages to the bustling sugar economy. A steep spiral staircase leads up the tower, providing a panoramic view of the glowing city in the sunlight. You can see all the way to the Caribbean Sea and notice the way the layers of indigo color the water."

        "description": "In the morning, people choose to ride their bike to Playa Ancon. The eight-mile road takes people along the colonial homes, through a brief stretch of countryside, and to the winding edges of the white sand beach. Rolling jade mountains roll along the horizon in the background with the quiet waves crashing against the shoreline in the foreground. Today you discover the treasures in and around Trinidad. A vintage steam train travels between town and the Agabama Valley, home to the remains of the vibrant sugar mills and plantations. Adventurers seek out the cool climate and hidden coffee bushes of the Escambray Mountains. In the 1800s, more than 11,000 slaves helped till and power the 56 sugar mills around the city. Many of the slaves were taken from Africa’s west coast. Their beliefs and traditions followed them to the shores of Cuba. Trinidad boasts the most vibrant connection to the Afro-Cuban heritage with murals of orishas (saints) decorating private homes. Santeria blends Roman Catholicism with Yoruba beliefs. An authentic sanctuary has a mural of the moon and sun at different phases. The aroma of incense fills the gallery. Your guide introduces you to a priest who explains the importance of the images in the religion. The shrine awakens with energy. The goddess of the oceans stands on a pedestal overseeing her followers. A garden stands beyond the shrine. Light streams in from the windows and reflects off a carafe of water, blending sunlight and shadows."

        "description": "Today you depart from the quiet colonial streets of Trinidad and make your way back to the musical cafes and rambunctious neighborhoods of Havana. En route, you stop at the bayside city of Cienfuegos. The French founded the city in 1819, shaping the white-pearled buildings with red-tiled roofs. The bay sparkles against the bleached edifices rising above the water. A gazebo stands at the center of Parque Jose Marti. A small Arch of Triumph erected in the early 20th century stands at the western end of the square. Castillo de Jagua, a preserved colonial fortress watches over the entrance of the bay as it has since the 18th century. A drawbridge continues to link the castle to the mainland, crossing the now-dried moat. A museum details the rich history of the fortress and its powerful defense against pirate attack. Outside of the city, a small forest surrounds Laguna Guanaroca. The reflective water resembles glass in its place nature. Herons and pelicans perch in the mangrove trees. Near the bustling leaves on the opposite side of the lagoon, you can see the pink plumage and elegant necks of a flock of flamingoes. The bustle of the city has disappeared, replaced by the flapping wings of graceful flamingoes as they settle into a new spot on the water."

Classic cars return to cruising down the street. Artists open up the warehouse on Port Avenue. The 19th-century space houses a collection of painters, wood carvers, weavers, and crafts-people shaping the image of everyday life in Havana. Paintings of Che Guevara are displayed next to hand-carved bongos. After breakfast, your private transfer meets you at the hotel. You say goodbye to Havana with one last lingering glance before transferring to Jose Marti International Airport for your flight home."

The tobacco grows firm and tasty around the region of Pinar del Rio. Your guide points out the fibers of the leaves, calling them the fat of the tobacco, which provides the flavor. Inside the drying house, you find rows of leaves drying naturally underneath the thatched roof frame. The farmer explains the best way to clean the leaves after they are dried to ensure the natural oils and fibers are efficiently burned. The leaves absorb the flavor of the elements. The farmer passes around the leaves for you to inhale their natural aroma. He sits down on a small bench and places a wooden plank on his lap. A regular sized cigar takes three leaves. The farmer strips the leave lengthwise and spreads it out along the wooden plank to create the filler. The filler is the heart of the cigar. The farmer then cuts both sides to mark the cigar size, placing the filler atop the binding leaf before rolling the leaves tightly together, using water streaks to seal the cigar. Continue to Vinales to enjoy a panoramic view of the valley before returning to Havana. Before dinner, you meet with a local instructor to celebrate your time in the city by learning to dance salsa like a local."

Your guide leads you through the rich architectural heritage of the Old Town, beginning with the Cuban Baroque style of Catedral de San Cristobal. Two unequal towers frame the façade designed by Italian architect Francesco Borromini in the 18th century. It is one of the oldest cathedrals in the Americas and once housed the remains of Christopher Columbus until the late 19th century. The rugged texture stems from the blocks of coral used during the construction, taking from the ocean floor along the Gulf of Mexico. Continue your exploration of the city with an immersive tour into the Afro-Cuban culture. Your guide leads you down Callejón de Hamel. Every Sunday at noon, the pulsing rhythm of rumba music erupts through the street. Murals depicting traditions and icons of African culture piece together images of the people. The walls depict feeling, and the music expresses emotion; even the overhanging roofs resemble sculptures turning the area into a temple for the Afro-Cuban experience, filled with powerful chants, interlocking drum patters, and undeniable spirit."

After breakfast, you venture to Colon Cemetery, which contains more than 500 major mausoleums spanning nearly 140 acres. At the center of the grounds stands an octagonal neo-Byzantine church known as Capilla Central. A large fresco of the Last Judgment decorates the interior. Elegant trees dangle branches and leaves over the main bisecting lanes. Nobles in the 19th century competed to build elaborate tombs, eager to highlight their family’s social standing based on location and plot size. Marble reliefs on the triple-arched entrance gate dictate the elegant and historic ambiance of the cemetery. Your private guide leads you through the famous avenues to the most visited tombs, including the flower-bedecked grave of Amelia Goyri de Hoz. Visitors knock three times on the tombstone with one of the brass rings. They touch the tomb and request one favor, walking backward away from the tomb. Legend claims pilgrims should never turn their back on the La Milagrosa , The Miraculous One. The scents of budding flowers and palm trees harmoniously blend. The marble mausoleums glint in the sunlight. The rambunctious sounds of the city fade in the peaceful ambiance of the grounds."

Stroll through the local marketplace with your guide for an in-depth view of life in the city. The people’s market fills with fresh fruits and vegetables grown on the famous farms outside of the city. Vendors cut open pineapples showcasing the juicy yellow interior. Mounds of guavas and cauliflowers overtake the counters. Homemade sauces provide layers of flavor to every meal; their labels promote the vendor who makes each sauce from scratch in their home. You continue through the market to view the ration boards. Employees stand behind the counters and pass out the food, such as rice and beans, provided by the government. The Cuatro Caminos market is the city’s largest with beans, fruits, vegetables, and even animals for sale along the vast square block. The artistry of the food inspires a similar emotion as the quality of work on display in the art museums. The restored 1920s Palacio del Centro Asturiano houses more than 600 works of Ancient Egypt, Rome, and European Masters. The Palacio de Bellas Artes showcases Cuban art spanning 400 years, from the 17th century to present day. The Siesta, a 19th-century painting by Guillermo Collazo, shows a woman reposing in her villa while overlooking the Caribbean Sea.

        "description": "The aroma of freshly brewed Cuban coffee enlivens Havana before the music begins. On the outskirts of Havana Central, the Atlantic Ocean splashes against the sea walls. After breakfast, you meet with an architect involved in the restoration of Old Havana, returning the crumbling facades along the side streets to colonial grandeur. The architect also acts as your guide along the cobblestone avenues of the historic city. Each square has a unique feature creating a distinctive ambiance unlike any other plaza in Havana. The music of the day spills out of restaurants and cafes. Musicians linger in the small avenues and mold the classic soundtrack of Old Havana. The Plaza de Armas once acted as the social center of the city, beginning with its inception in the 16th century. The name stems from the military events and ceremonies that took place in the square. Castillo de la Real Fuerza encloses the plaza. The fortification began in the mid 16th century to protect Havana from pirates and foreign navies. French corsair Jacques de Sores had destroyed the previous castle and subsequently plundered the city. In the afternoon, you make your way to Havana’s first English bookstore, Cuba Libro, to engage in a discussion about the arts, culture, and the importance of reading with engaged citizens."

        "description": "The morning sun peels back the shade across Havana. Couples stroll hand in hand along the Malecón listening to the water crash against the sea wall. After breakfast, you meet with a university professor who specializes in U.S.-Cuban relations. The discussion allows you time to match your understanding of the topic with that of the Cuban perspective. Make your way to the Museum of Fine Arts to stroll along the three separate structures forming the museum collective. The main focus of your visit is at the Palace of Fine Arts, which houses artwork created by Cubans, focusing mainly on pieces between the 17th and 19th centuries. The elegant exterior sets the tone of the interior, where you find graceful paintings depicting life in Cuba, along with religious subjects and landscape scenes. Continue to the Fortaleza de San Carlos de la Cabana, set at the mouth of Havana Harbor. The Spanish erected the edifice in the 18th century along the east ridge of the harbor. The fortress spans 2,296 feet from end to end, covering nearly 25 acres. The refreshing sea breeze blows across the stone courtyard. The Museo de Fortificaciones y Armas expresses the bloody history of the fort and the bay. The setting provides you with a fabulous panorama of Havana spread before you."

        "title": "Havana – Days to Remember",
        "description": "Cuba has a scintillating connection to art of all types, whether it's music, dancing, painting, or writing. On the outskirts of Havana, in a suburb known as San Francisco de Paula, stands Ernest Hemingway’s former home. The famous American author lived in Cuba from 1939 to 1961. The home has been renovated so well that it looks as though Hemingway left five minutes before you arrived and could return at any minute. The author wrote two of his award-winning novels while living in Cuba: For Whom the Bell Tolls and The Old Man and the Sea. The latter novel took place in the fishing village of Cojimar, located nearly 11 miles away. Animal trophies decorate the walls. Fishing rods are hung with care. Galley and correspondence fill the rooms, along with more than 9,000 books from Hemingway’s personal library. A small standing desk continues to hold his typewriter. As of 2016, the Finca Foundation received permission from the United States and Cuban governments to construct an archive with wet and dry conservation laboratories. In the neighborhood of Vedado, you enter the famous Colon Cemetery and follow your guide through the historic grounds to view the graceful mausoleums of wealthy families, revolutionary heroes, and mythological figures."

        "description": "While in Havana, you have witnessed great stories and created some of your own. Fishermen set out along the sea wall of the Malecón and cast their lines in search of a catch worth celebrating. Locals in Old Havana head to their rooftop in search of quiet space to enjoy the city. Children let their kites loose into the sea breeze. Classic American cars roam around the city, adding to Cuba’s unique story. After breakfast, your transfer greets you at the hotel and escorts you east to the Zapata Wetlands. Outside of Havana, the streets narrow. Cars share the road with tractors and horse-drawn carriages. A local expert in ecology and the consistent conservation efforts of Cuba meets you at the edges of the wetlands. A small recreation of a Taino village, the aboriginal people of Cuba, juts out into the heart of Treasure Lake. Thatched rooftops shade the huts from the tropical sun. Larger than life sculptures depict the daily lives of the villagers. Visit a large crocodile farm, where approximately 10,000 pre-historic reptiles showcase the success of Cuba’s conservation efforts. Your guide explains that in the 1950s and 1960s, the native crocodile in Cuba was near extinction. You can also see the Manjuari, or Cuban Gar, known as a living fossil. The fish is more than six feet in length with a greenish tint that almost resembles a crocodile. Continue to Playa Giron, which Americans know best as the Bay of Pigs. A small coastal village remains, along with a museum dedicated to telling the tale of the 1961 class between Cuban rebel forces and the CIA-supported Cuban exiles. A Sea Fury fighter aircraft stands aside the Cuban flag in front of the museum entrance."

        "description": "In the pearled city of Cienfuegos, the white buildings reflect the radiance of the sparkling bay. The French settled the city in the 19th century, and the beauty once celebrated continues to shape the city in various ways. After breakfast, your guide leads you to an art school where students and faculty adopt the colorful images of everyday life in Cienfuegos. Meet with the students to learn about what inspires them in an ever-evolving Cuba. Some mention the art nouveau and neoclassical buildings. Others are inspired by the impressive Jose Mart Park located near the Paseo del Prado that leads to the Malecón. Another student discusses the aroma of the sea and the lush emerald color of yerba mate when mixed in a mojito. Depart for the city of Trinidad, which retains its colonial charm from its inception in the 16th century. The Escambray Mountains outline the majestic architecture to the north. The turquoise Caribbean Sea frames the city to the south. Pastel painted homes run alongside cobblestone streets. Horses clop along the stone-paved roads in the car-less city center. Musicians seduce passersby at the Casa de la Musica. Café tables fill the stairway leading to the restaurant at the top of the moderate incline. The aroma of mojitos and cuba libres emanate from the bar. The Historic Municipal Museum is situated in the 19th-century Borrell family mansion located in the Plaza Mayor. The neoclassical style rooms exhibit the wealth of the family attributed to the sugarcane boom."

        "description": "Independent business is still a relatively new venture and different source of revenue for most Cubans. After breakfast, your guide leads you to the farmers market in Cienfuegos to view the type of merchandise on offer. Mounds of produce, from zucchini to onions, pineapple to potatoes lines the stalls. Antique scales measure the weight of the goods people purchase. The brightly painted large room fills with locals. In the back, your guide points out a ration list, providing you with insight into the continued rationings of dietary staples such as beans and rice. You make your way to the spirited city of Santa Clara. Che Guevara led a small group of rebels to capture an armored train, turning the tide of the Cuban Revolutionary War. Santa Clara is also home to the most prestigious university outside of Havana, lending itself as an encouraging source of the rebellious temperament. Before you tour the city, you meet with a group of local seniors for an insider’s view of Cuban retirement. The men enjoy congregating outside cafes or in the Parque Vidal to play dominos. The women have taken to crocheting and various types of art in the hopes of selling their work in the crafts market. Continue to the Ernesto Che Guevara Monument, adorned with a 22-foot tall bronze statue of the rebel leader. The 38 stone-carved niches commemorate the guerillas killed in a failed revolutionary attempt in Bolivia. A large fresco behind the statue of Che depicts the rebel leader meeting with Fidel Castro."

        "description": "In the morning, the water from the bay laps gently at the sea wall along the Malecón. Palm trees cast shadows over the streets; their large fronds sway in the quiet breeze. The powerful Castillo de Jagua crowns the mouth of the bay. The Spanish built the fortress in the 18th century to protect the port against pirates. Every year in May, land crabs march along the terrain, moving from the base of the mountains to the sea. They lay their eggs in the Caribbean, crossing busy streets to do so. The sunlight washes over the former palace on the Punta Gorda at the end of the main avenue. The red-tiled cupola shines against the indigo hues of the water. The Moorish arcades give the palace a Mediterranean atmosphere. Today, you can enjoy Cienfuegos at your leisure. Soon your private transfer will meet you at your hotel and escort you to Jaime Gonzalez Airport for your flight home."
