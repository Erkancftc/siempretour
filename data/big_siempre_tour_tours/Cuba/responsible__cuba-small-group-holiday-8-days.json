  "generalInfo": "See the very best of central Cuba on this small group holiday. It begins and ends in Havana, the hectic, complicated capital city. Old Havana piles up sun-bleached monuments, Cuban tapas bars, Spanish cathedrals and sky-high murals. Or you could cycle along the Malecon to see Miramar and the shining suburbs out west.<br/><br/>You'll spend the rest of the week hopping between some of the prettiest places in Cuba, while experiencing life away from the big city. See how Cuban cigars are made in the Vinales Valley, where sloping tobacco plantations and limestone karsts paint the hills. Share dinner with a Cuban family in Cienfuegos. And road trip down to Trinidad, where there's a musician on every corner.<br/><br/>Opting for a small group holiday to Cuba gets you closer to the people that live there, so perks include relaxed salsa lessons and homestay accommodation (casas particulares) that give you real insight into a revolutionary country.<br/>",

      "description": "Welcome to Havana, the lively capital of Cuba. Founded by the Spanish in the 16th century, it is now a soulful mix of colonial architecture, street troubadours and classic cars.

      "description": "Today, we travel to the Viñales Valley in the west of Cuba. Famous for its rolling tobacco plantations and collection of limestone karsts, it’s easy to see why Viñales was awarded World Heritage status. Joined by a local resident, we walk through the Valley of Silence to soak up rural Cuban life as farmers tend to their crops using traditional farming methods. We also visit a tobacco farm to learn about the famous Cuban export and meet with a tobacco farmer to understand the growing process. After checking into our casas particulares, we visit a farm in the Viñales hills for a sunset dinner overlooking the valley. Accommodation: Casas particulares"

      "description": "This morning, we have a long drive eastward to Playa Larga. We stop at a farmer’s house in the village of Palpite with the aim of seeing the smallest birds in the world, the bee hummingbird, who like to feed on the farmer’s patio. We are then joined by a local nature expert who introduces us to the natural landscape and characteristics of the area. We also visit a small community arts and dance school in Palpite to meet participants and learn about the importance of the arts in Cuba. If time, we can also enjoy a refreshing swim in the turquoise waters of the Bay of Pigs. Tonight, we enjoy a traditional creole dinner followed by the quintessentially Cuban pastime of dominoes and rum. Today’s travel time is approximately five hours. Accommodation: Casas particulares"

      "description": "This morning, we continue eastwards to Cienfuegos, known as the Pearl of the South. Cienfuegos is a city full of architectural delights and Cuban spirit with a beautiful main square and restored buildings. On arrival, we tour the city by e-tricycle, fun tuk tuk-like vehicles that can accommodate four people and run on solar power. Used locally as public transport, they provide an authentic way to see the city. After, we depart Cienfuegos and drive down the coast to Trinidad, a World Heritage site since 1988 and perhaps the best-preserved colonial town on the island. Exploring Trinidad is like stepping back in time, the cobbled streets and horse-drawn transportation whisking you back to the Colonial era. There are many interesting museums in old colonial buildings and music drifts through the streets and plazas, bringing the town to life. We have a walking tour to learn what it’s like to live in Trinidad, which includes a visit to Casa Templo de Santeria de Yemaya where we learn about Santeria, an Afro-Cuban religion. This evening, we meet a local barman at a private paladar who is an expert at mixing the perfect mojito! We learn how to mix mojitos in the authentic Cuban way then enjoy dinner at the paladar before returning to our casas particulares. Accommodation: Casas particulares"

      "description": "This morning, we transfer to Playa Ancón, making a short stop to visit the picturesque fishing village of La Boca. This is a popular spot with local fishermen, who we meet and speak to about the fishing industry in Cuba. Then we carry on to Playa Ancón and enjoy time at the beach. It is a great place to swim or you can simply dip your toes in the water and relax. After, we have an authentic Cuban lunch prepared for us. On our return to Trinidad in the afternoon, there is the option to take part in a salsa class, learning the fundamentals with Cuban dance partners. Trinidad is known for its nightlife, so after we’ve learnt the salsa basics, we visit Casa de la Trova, a legendary live music venue, to listen to local musicians playing authentic Cuban music. This venue is always lively and sociable, with plenty of Cubans keen to let us improve our moves with them! Accommodation: Casas particulares"

      "description": "Leave Trinidad after breakfast and head to Manaca Iznaga, where we visit a project that showcases the skilled process of making textile handicrafts. Manaca Iznaga and the surrounding Valle de los Ingenios was a hugely important sugar-growing area in the 18th and 19th centuries and we learn about that history here. As we have a long transfer today, we take packed lunches from our accommodation. We also visit a country farm where you can enjoy a cafecito (Cuban coffee) and learn about the crops grown in the area. As well as being welcomed into their house for a cafecito, we have a short walk around the property with the owners, learning about small-scale agriculture techniques and industry in rural Cuba. Our next stop is Santa Clara, the site of the last battle of the Cuban Revolution in December 1958, just before Fidel Castro took Havana. Che Guevara and his troops ambushed an armoured train carrying arms to Santiago de Cuba and this was a major turning point in the Revolution. We visit the Mausoleum of Che Guevara and his comrades who died in Bolivia before driving back to Havana. Today’s travel time is approximately five to six hours. Accommodation: Casas particulares"

      "description": "This morning, we have a walking tour of Havana, the capital and largest city in Cuba. We walk the streets of Old Havana, often described as a living museum with magnificent monuments, cathedrals and palaces, as well as seeing the famous Capitolio building and four of the city’s principal squares. During our tour, we also visit a ration store, food market and artisan market. There is no better way to see Havana than by classic car. This afternoon, we get acquainted with both the old and new areas of the city in pristine classic cars, discovering the distinct areas of the capital and stopping at points of interest for explanations and stories. Stops include the historic Plaza de la Revolución and bustling Vedado district. Our final dinner is at a private paladar, run by an entrepreneurial chef who pioneers a fusion of Cuban and Asian cuisine. Accommodation: Casas particulares"
