The exact route taken through the passage may be dictated by weather and ice conditions, but your experienced captain and crew will plan each day to ensure you get to see the very best of this fascinating area. Zodiac cruises and walks will bring you up-close. Places you can expect to visit include King William Island where various remnants from the famous Franklin expedition have been found throughout the years. Nearby, we hope to visit Victory Point to get close to where the HMS Erebus and HMS Terror were abandoned in 1848. Sticking with the royalty theme, on Prince of Wales island we will hope to land at Coningham Bay to look for sightings of the Polar bears that frequent here to feast on beluga whales, before we head through the deep and windy waterway of the Bellot Strait to reach the most northern continental point of the Americas. As we sail down the east coast of Somerset Island we will reach an important bird area and some time on deck should reward in multiple bird sightings, as well as the possibility of seeing beluga whales and the elusive narwhals. Around here we will hope to land at Fort Ross to enjoy guided walks along the tundra and see the abandoned Hudson’s Bay Company trading outpost which was founded here in 1937. On the edge of the wildlife-rich Lancaster Sound, we will reach the towering bird cliffs of Prince Leopold Island - the most important bird sanctuary in the Canadian Arctic – for some enjoyable birdwatching experiences. After some time looking up to the sky, we’ll focus our eyes back on land and sea as we look for Polar bears and whales, as well as taking a visit to the ruins of another, even older, Hudson’s Bay trading post. We will also hope to visit Cunningham Inlet on the north coast of Somerset Island where it may be possible, if timing is right, to see the amazing spectacle of hundreds of beluga whales shedding their skin on shallow sandy banks."

Sailing into the Lancaster Sound, the ‘wildlife super highway’ of the Arctic, we will hope to see an abundance of wildlife as we make our way to Devon Island, the largest uninhabited island on Earth. We will hope to make land here to see the stunning geology of flat-topped mountains and glacial valleys, before Zodiac cruising around Croker Bay or Maxwell Bay. A walk around nearby Dundas Harbour should reward in more fantastic birdwatching and walrus spotting opportunities, as well as the chance to see some ancient semi-subterranean Thule dwellings. Next on our list of impressive areas will be the picturesque hamlet of Pond Inlet where we will spend some time looking for the wildlife that abounds here including seals, whales, narwhal, orca, caribou and even some Polar bears. You can also take a walk to visit the Natinnak Center to learn about the local Inuit community and their history and way of life in the High Arctic. We will then enjoy a sail along the scenic coast of nearby Bylot Island to see its majestic mountains, icefields, steep cliffs, snowfields and glaciers which are home to 74 distinct species of Arctic birds. Our penultimate day in the Canadian Arctic will allow for a slow sail around the glaciers of Sillem Island before we reach the east coast of Baffin Island to see Isabella Bay and the soaring cliffs of Sam Ford Fjord.

    "generalInfo": "Our East Greenland voyages are ideal for those seeking to experience one of the Earth's most dramatic landscapes at the edge of the Greenland ice cap, spotting whales, cruising around Antarctic sized icebergs, and gaining an insight into local Inuit culture. The voyage timing (late Aug/September) also invites wonderful opportunities to see the Northern Lights (Aurora borealis).<br/><br/>The voyage starts and ends in Iceland which is itself an excellent location to explore either before or after your voyage with again more northern light opportunities. From Iceland we cross the Denmark Strait to Greenland, watching out for Blue Whales and other marine life along the way.<br/><br/>We will be exploring East Greenland onboard small luxury and comfortable expedition cruise ships in the company of expert natural history guides and lecturers. Those keen on trekking can enjoy some wonderful opportunities to explore on land,  with groups split between those who want to enjoy longer hikes and scale higher up the hillsides and those who want to take a more leisurely stroll closer to the shore. Looking back out to sea, the ship will look incredibly small and the sea usually devoid of any sign of another visitor.<br/><br/>Scoresby Sund is the largest, most spectacular fjord in the World. The sheer scale of this inlet is difficult to imagine. Around you mountains rise 2,000m from the sea and you will be able to see as many as seven glaciers at once grinding their way through rugged rocks towards the water. Unlike Spitsbergen,  huge icebergs can be seen here, as much as 100m high and a km in length, the scale of which you are only likely to see in Antarctica. These bergs can dwarf your ship and provide beautiful objects to explore at relatively close, but safe range in a rigid inflatable boat.<br/><br/>The Northeast Greenland National Park is the world's largest covering an incredible 97,200,000 hectares. Wildlife is more dispersed than in Spitsbergen, but Polar Bears have been seen on these voyages, as well as Atlantic Walrus, Arctic Foxes, the Canadian Arctic hare, grey wolves and the large hairy Musk Oxen.<br/><br/>Greenland is a sparely inhabited island and on this voyage we aim to visit the modern Inuit settlement of Illoqqortoormiut. We will also visit sites where humans have tried to live in the past, but have long since abandoned their settlements. .<br/><br/>As a company our polar team have been guiding and sending our guests to Greenland and the wider Arctic for more than 15 years. We also offer kayaking and on certain departures, - a serene escape to explore the turquoise icebergs, glaciers and islands of the calmer fjords. Some departures also offer scuba diving and snorkelling for the intrepid and experienced- ask one of our polar dive guide for further information on add-on adventures.<br/><br/>If you are trying to decide which polar voyage to consider, call one of our polar guides and experts who from first hand experience can share how a voyage to Greenland can offer long-lasting memories<br/><br/>Select departures offer kayaking or additional diving.",

Often called Iceland’s best-kept secret, this rugged peninsula at the country’s remote northwestern tip is rife with fjords, and mountains that slope to the sea. We spend our time exploring the fjords and shores of Iceland’s oldest region, enjoying a kaleidoscope of diverse land and seascapes. Here, tumbling cliffs and gushing waterfalls alternate with colourful beaches, and rolling green hills lead to high moorlands dotted with rocky outcrops, small lakes, and the occasional shaggy Icelandic sheep or pony grazing in the distance. A few modest outposts of civilisation, in the form small fishing communities nestled along the fjords and shores of the Denmark Strait, face out into the mighty Atlantic - keeping alive a maritime heritage that dates to the Viking days. One of today’s highlights is a chance to visit Vigur, a private island that provides guests with unique opportunities to delve into Icelandic culture and heritage as early as the 11th century. Vigur is widely regarded as a capsule of Icelandic heritage. Upon arriving on shore by Zodiac, we are welcomed by the people who own this incredible island. One of the co-owners is polar explorer Felicity Aston, the first woman to ski solo across Antarctica. You learn about the Icelandic tradition of eiderdown harvesting, and the wide array of Arctic birdlife and seals that are found in Vigur. It’s estimated the island is home to more than 7,000 breeding ducks, 100,000 puffins, Europe’s largest colony of black guillemot, and huge flocks of Arctic terns. You also have opportunities to ramble about the island, taste local food and visit the island cafe. Today’s adventure options include Zodiac cruising, sea kayaking, paddle excursions, and, potentially, a guided shore hike. Right across the bay is Mongufoss, one of Iceland’s most remote and beautiful waterfalls, which we visit by ship after our onboard lunch. Meals included: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner"

        "description": "Exploring Southeast Greenland: Your exploration of Greenland begins with East Greenland, one of the least-visited and most remote parts of the world’s largest island. Our journey along the coast is influenced by weather and ice conditions, with each day and each off-ship excursion – presenting new adventures. Expect glaciers, steep mountains and breathtaking fjords. Transiting the 62mi (100km) long Prins Christian Sund (Ikerasassuaq) – one of the world’s most scenic fjords – reveals incredible views. Expect dramatic mountain and seascapes with glaciers tumbling to the sea, and captivating vistas stretching along the entire fjord. The South Greenlanders who live on this frontier are as unique as the region they inhabit. This is where the migrating hunting people from the east eventually settled around the European trading posts. The handful of villages in this region are renowned for their inhabitants’ strong commitment to traditional hunting and fishing practices. We hope to visit Aappilattoq, perched on the shores of Prins Christian Sund (Ikerasassuaq), to introduce you to some of our local partners, listen to their stories, hear their music, taste local food, learn about the fishing and hunting heritage, and perhaps even join a friendly game of soccer – as a player or spectator. If you are looking for the most iconic peaks of South Greenland, you’ll be in your glory when we reach Tasermiut Fjord in the heart of what’s known as Arctic Patagonia. We offer Zodiac excursions and guided on-shore hikes (tailored for different levels of ability and interest) to view the jagged peaks, tumbling glaciers, ice-laden landscapes, alpine vistas and wildlife. Tasermiut Fjord is ideal for our sea kayaking and paddling programs, as well. We continue our quest to explore the wild fjords of the uninhabited southeast coast, one of which is Lindenow Fjord, also known by its Greenlandic name, Kangerlussuatsiaq. Thousands of years ago, groups of Paleo-Inuit hunters and fish harvesters settled in these isolated fjords, living off the land, and surviving on food from the sea. This preceded the arrival of European explorers and the establishment of settlements, which prompted one of the biggest waves of migration in Greenland. Marine mammals frequent the many fjords in this region. Humpback whales are often observed in the shallow waters at the entrance to the fjords where nutrients are drawn up to the surface. Rare sightings of polar bears are possible as they drift down from the north on sea ice floes propelled by the East Greenland current. We keep our eyes peeled for other wildlife as we continue to explore the remote icescapes of the wild southeast, which is also ideal for hiking, paddle excursions, Zodiac cruises and shore landings. The southern coast of Greenland is steeped in Norse history. We anticipate a visit to Hvalsey (Qaqortukulooq), the site of Greenland’s largest and best-preserved Norse ruins. Exploring the remains of the church (circa 14th century) will make you feel like you’re stepping back in time, as the building appears much as it did when it was abandoned in the 15th century. The surrounding fells and fjords remain similarly untouched. Also on our planned itinerary is charming Qassiarsuk, one of the five sites that make up the Kujataa World Heritage Site. It’s a small sheep-farming settlement where you can experience true South Greenland hospitality and gain insight into the fascinating lives of sheep farmers living at the edge of the massive Greenland Ice Sheet. We suggest you take time to explore the remains and replicas of Brattahlíð, Erik the Red’s estate, once the epicentre of the Greenland Norse Eastern Settlement. During or time in Qassiarsuk, guests have opportunities to sample local food, enjoy a hike, and, if time and weather allow, take a Zodiac cruise amid towering icebergs.

As we head north, we hope to embark on daily Zodiac excursions to explore local bays, channels and select landing sites. We also explore some of the quaint settlements throughout the picturesque islands and fjords. Nuuk, the charming Greenlandic capital, is a must-visit destination on the west coast. You have time to wander the streets of the historic Old Nuuk neighbourhood and see the Hans Egede Church and Hans Egede statue near the waterfront, both named after the 18th-century missionary who founded the settlement. History buffs will make haste to the national museum to view the famous Greenlandic mummies, which were found under a rock outcrop in 1972. The remarkably preserved mummies of six women and two children date to the 15th century. Pride of place for our seasoned expedition team is Eternity Fjord, home to the tallest mountains in West Greenland. This a favourite spot for us to launch our Zodiacs into the water to explore in-depth – where larger vessels can’t navigate. There are few settlements in this long fjord – but you will quickly appreciate nature in its rawest form as you hike among the towering mountains, and photograph the colourful tundra and other dramatic landscapes.

    "generalInfo": "This highly scenic and historically interesting expedition cruise explores some of Greenland’s most remote regions. Starting in Iceland, you will sail into the icy waters of the rarely-travelled southeastern coast of Greenland; then onwards to the lush southern tip before cruising the dramatic west coast of the world’s largest island. Along the way you have chances for spotting whales and seabirds along with rugged landscapes, imposing glaciers and historical sites from the Thule, Norse and Viking periods.<br/><br/>Crossing the Denmark Strait from Iceland you will tour one of the most remote parts of Greenland – it’s southeast coast. This area is a maze of vast glaciers, steep mountains and stunning fjord systems. Here you can enjoy a range of zodiac excursions and hiking opportunities for impressive views over snowcapped mountains, deep turquoise waters and surprisingly colourful Arctic tundra.<br/><br/>Moving to the fertile southern tip of Greenland, it is easy to see why Erik the Red gave Greenland it’s name. The area’s rich Norse and Viking history has some well-preserved ruins, including 14th Century churches; and Greenland’s oldest sheep-farming settlement which is still being worked today. This region is also scenically spectacular including the towering mountains surrounding Tasermiut Fjord – an area often referred to as the Patagonia of the North. Prins Christian Sund is another scenic highlight, with its complex maze of narrow fjords and channels where you might see one of its glaciers calving.<br/><br/>Rounding the coast, you will explore the dramatic west coast of Greenland characterised by more colourful settlements, spectacular glaciers, huge mountains and fjord systems. The waters here can offer chances for seeing whales, seals and seabirds, while there are opportunities for Arctic foxes and musk oxen on a remote hike.<br/><br/>Travelling on a small expedition ship, you will enjoy opportunities throughout the trip for shore landings, hikes and zodiac cruises. Your experienced Expedition Team will also offer a series of lectures and presentations throughout the voyage with a focus on wildlife, history and culture of the places you will see on your journey. An optional kayaking programme is offered on many of these voyages, which offers a unique and intimate way to explore the stunning fjord systems here. Kayaking is particularly fitting here, since the kayak was invented in Greenland almost 4,000 years ago.<br/><br/>When to Visit South &amp; West Greenland<br/><br/>A summer voyage will offer 24 hours daylight above the Arctic Circle under the midnight sun. This normally comes to an end in mid-August when spectacular long sunsets offer great photographic opportunities, especially against mountains and glaciers. A September voyage offers good opportunities for the Aurora borealis (Northern Lights); a truly unforgettable experience as the sky dances overhead with hues of green, red, blue and purple. In Greenlandic legend it is said that when you see the Northern Lights it means that the dead are playing football with the skull of a walrus; not perhaps as pleasant as the Inuit belief that they are torches set by spirits to guide new arrivals to the heavens, or as magical as them being the origin of dragon myths.<br/><br/>If you are trying to decide which polar voyage to consider, call one of our polar guides and experts who from first hand experience can share how a voyage to Greenland can offer long-lasting memories.<br/><br/>Please note that select voyage dates are invoiced in a foreign currency which is subject to currency fluctuations.",

Unlike the west coast, which has had uninterrupted contact with Europe since the 1700s, the coast of East Greenland remained more or less uncontacted until around 1894, when a Danish trading post was established at Tasiilaq. The vast distances involved in Arctic travel meant that the people of East Greenland (Tunumiit) were isolated from their cousins to the west, and the language, traditions and culture of East Greenland therefore differ significantly to those in other parts of the country. Tasiilaq sits in a perfect natural harbour on Ammassalik Island (meaning 'the Place of Many Capelin'). While superficially similar to towns on the West Coast, the landscape here is much more rugged, with fewer people outnumbers by sled dogs. Tasiilaq offers scenic hiking routes such as the Flower Valley or nearby hill; whilst its museum houses an great exhibition on Tunumiit culture. You may get the opportunity to watch a drum dancer in traditional East Greenlandic costume perform a millennia-old spiritual tradition; and visit a local workshop where skilled craftsmen create beautiful pieces from natural local materials."

Kuummiut - meaning People who Live by the River - is one of the larger villages in the area, and one of the most prosperous. Sitting upon some of East Greenland's richest fishing grounds, Kuummiut holds the only fish factory in the region. Fishermen from miles around come through Ammassalik Fjord (which is wide enough to stay mostly ice-free year-round) to sell their catch. Kuummiut is an ideal place to experience life in an East Greenlandic settlement. Whereas other towns have traffic, Kuummiut has the yowling of sled dogs and the sigh of the wind through the grass. No roads lead in or out of this isolated village and the sea is the highway for local transport - although motorboats have replaced the skin boats which brought people to these shores long ago. It is a perfect place to simply sit, watch the icebergs pass; and perhaps see the whales which often frolic in the calm waters offshore. From Kuummiut, you will continue to navigate through the labyrinth of fjords, heading towards Sermilik."

The icebergs here mostly originate at the vast Helheim Glacier, one of the largest glaciers in this icy country. The Helheim and other glaciers which empty into the fjord pour directly off the Greenland Ice Sheet, the edges of which can be seen to the east, rising thousands of metres towards the frozen core of this vast island. The volume of ice will dictate your activities in Sermilikfjord, although options include coming ashore to marvel at the spectacular scenery and untouched nature of the area, or exploring on the water and marvelling at the natural ice sculptures of the area on a Zodiac cruise through the icebergs. Whatever you do, prepare to be amazed by the jaw-dropping beauty of this otherwordly place."

The fjord is named for Skjold, an ancient Danish King of legend, while the Greenlandic name, Saqqisikuik, references the sunny climate of the area. Various archaeological finds on the island which sits in the middle of the fjord suggests nomadic Inuit groups visited and stayed in the area in years gone by; more recently, settlers were brought from Tasiilaq to settle the island in the 1930s, but returned there thirty years later. Today, uninhabited Skjoldungen sits almost 300km from the nearest village, with Mother Nature its only ruler. Vast saw-toothed mountains lined with opalescent glaciers line the deep chilly waters of the fjord, which can freeze even in summer. At the head of the fjord lies the magnificent Thryms Glacier, a magnificent river of ice flowing down from the ice sheet. On the southern side of Thryms Glacier lies the sweeping U-shaped glacial valley of Dronning Maries Dal - a textbook example of a glacially-produced landscape. Join your expedition team for a walk on the flower-lined floor of this valley, and marvel at the stunning scenery.

Kept free of ice year round by strong tidal currents, the strait is hemmed in on either side by mountains which rise straight out of the water some reaching over 2,000m in height. Large glaciers flow from the ice sheet into the sea on the northern side of the strait, while sapphire blue mountain glaciers loom over the water from the southern side, and vast icebergs stud the glassy waters. In the afternoon, you should approach the small village of Aappilattoq, which sits hunkered beneath the towering mountains at the end of Prins Christians Sund. The village is a world away from busy Tasiilaq or even Kuummiut; life here moves at a slower pace, following the rhythms of the wind, waves and tides. Aappilattoq (meaning 'Red' in Greenlandic, referring to the stark granite bluffs above) offers excellent hiking opportunities, and the local choir is renowned throughout Greenland."

        "description": "During the early morning, you will plan to sail through the majestic mountains of Tunulliarfik Fjord towards the small beach of Itilleq. The southern fjords of Greenland offer a very different environment to the chilly north and east of the country. Situated at roughly 60°N, this region is level with northern Scotland or southern Scandinavia, with a climate to match. Here, the weather is calm, stable and humid, with much warmer summers and milder winters than the rest of the country. In place of rocky hillsides, the fjords here are lined with lush green meadows and dotted with small sheep-farming settlements, of which Qassiarsuk and Igaliku are perhaps the best known. Coming ashore in the morning at the sheltered bay of Itilleq, a farm trail beckons you to the village of Igaliku. During the morning, you will plan to trek through the lush green hills to see the remains of the Norse Bishop's palace at Garðar - once a place of great power and influence in this remote corner of the Norse world. During the afternoon, you will reposition to the other side of the fjord to the sheep-farming village of Qassiarsuk. While the modern village was founded in 1924, the location has a fascinating and much longer history; it was here that legendary Norse explorer Eric the Red settled after being banished from Iceland. He named the land he discovered 'Greenland' to encourage other settlers to follow him - a marketing ploy that has stood for over a thousand years! Erik the Red settled in this green landscape and set up a small farmstead in typical Norse style, naming his new home 'Brattahlíð'. Today the outlines of buildings can be seen, along with stunningly accurate reconstructions of Eric's farm, where modern Inuit farmers continue to raise sheep to this day. A statue of Erik now overlooks the area, commemorating the first European to reach the Americas, and whose son Leif would be the first European to reach Baffin Island and Newfoundland. Sites rich in fascinating history and culture old and new, the settlements of Brattahlíð and Garðar are today part of the Kujataa UNESCO World Heritage Site."

        "description": "From South Greenland, you will follow the rugged coast of this vast island northwards. All settlements in Greenland (with the exception of Kangerlussuaq) are situated directly on the ocean coast of the country. The vast majority of Nuuk’s residents (some 50,000 or so) live on the narrow strip of coast on the west of the country, facing the Davis Strait. Ocean currents bring warm water up from the Atlantic to the west coast, enriching these wildlife-filled waters. Be sure to spend time out on deck watching for the whales, seals and a huge variety of seabirds which are common in these rich waters."

The vibrant bustling capital of Greenland, Nuuk feels much larger than it’s 19,000 inhabitants, and offers a wealth of experiences to visitors. Nuuk has a bustling cosmopolitan vibe, and hosts some of Greenland's best attractions including the Greenlandic National Museum, a treasure trove of history stretching back to the first inhabitants of this icy island - including artefacts from the Paleo-Inuit and Norse periods, as well as the spellbinding Qilakistoq mummies; the Greenlandic cultural centre at Katuaq; shop for authentic Greenlandic artworks in the city's many boutique shops, or simply relax at a hip curbside café with a Greenlandic coffee and watch this vibrant city in action. Nuuk York (as proud locals call it) is unlike any other city in Greenland, or indeed the world."

        "description": "On the last full day of your expedition cruise, you will arrive at the small village of Kangaamiut - an incredibly picturesque settlement in Greenland’s central Qeqqata region. Surrounded by cold rich waters and a vast back country brimming with game, life in Kangaamiut moves at a slower pace, and locals still live a largely traditional lifestyle, surviving by hunting and fishing. Hike to the heliport atop the hill for stunning views over the town and the surrounding fjordlands, or meet the friendly local people during a display of traditional clothing, foods, and seal-flensing. The artists of Kangaamiut are well-known throughout Greenland, and some of the locals' most splendid work can be viewed in the town's small museum. In the afternoon, you will sail inland into Evighedsfjorden / Kangerlussuatsiaq: one of the many deep fjords carved between the steep mountains of this region. The Danish name Evighedsfjorden means The Eternity Fjord, referring to the vast size of the inlet; whilst the Greenlandic name Kangerlussuatsiaq translates as The Rather Large Fjord - something of an understatement! Evighedsfjorden stretches around 100km into the glacier-clad mountains, bisecting the large ice cap which overlies much of the land between Nuuk and Sisimiut - Greenland's two largest cities. The aim will be to explore on a Zodiac cruise in front of the Evigheds Glacier, which flows into the fjord from the Maniitsoq Ice Cap above. Watch for calvings from the glacier, and guillemots and kittiwakes on the nearby bird cliffs."
