These endangered and completely harmless gentle giants can grow to the length of a bus, and swimming alongside them is sure to be a truly unforgettable experience. We will then take a visit to Kwatisore village to meet with local guides to learn about West Papuan customs, cultures and the traditional lifestyles of the people here."

        "description": "Num Island & Manokwari: In the Yapen Islands group in Northeast Indonesia, we will make our way to Palau Num to visit some traditional fishing villages on stilts and enjoy snorkelling, swimming and Zodiac cruising through the picturesque waterways and lagoons. Our final day of adventure will see us arrive in Manokwari, the capital of West Papua, which is located right on the tip of the island and is surrounded by lush rolling hills and the Arfak Mountains. There are over twenty-four different tribal groups living in Manokwari, each with its own unique language and culture. In Manokwari, you will be able to choose from three unique excursions to fill your time here. Birding and wildlife enthusiasts may choose to join an exciting excursion into the Pegunungan Arfak Nature Reserve in the Arfak Mountains where trekking through misty tropical rainforests you can hope for sightings of cuscus possum, endemic plants and some of the region’s 320 bird species including lesser birds of paradise, common paradise kingfisher, magnificent riflebird and king bird of paradise. The other options are a guided city tour of Manokwari with time to explore at your leisure, or a visit to the religious island of Mansinam where you can learn all about the history and significance of the island and participate in snorkelling and diving to WWII wrecks."
