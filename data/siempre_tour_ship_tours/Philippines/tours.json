    "generalInfo": "This unique voyage from Taipei through the Philippines and on to Borneo and Kuala Lumpur offers a unique opportunity to visit little known and remote regions that are well away from the usual cruise routes. The privilege of exploring these remarkable lands from a small ship in the company of just over 100 fellow passengers and knowledgeable local guides is an opportunity not to be missed. Marvellous experiences are to be had as we land on pristine beaches, witness traditional ways of life in remote communities and explore mangrove forests looking out for endemic flora and fauna, each evening returning to the considerable comforts of the all-suite MS Island Sky.<br/><br/>Our journey begins in Taiwan where, having first been under control of the Chinese empire in the 17th century and later a colony of Japan, history abounds. Witness the stunning mountain, lake and coastal scenery vie with futuristic cityscapes, hot springs and remote islands as we explore this beautiful country and its outlying islands. We then make our way to the Philippines where we will experience the legendary Filipino hospitality with visits to traditional villages and remote island communities and discover the rich cultural history with Chinese traders, Spanish conquistadors, and American rulers all having left their mark. We will spend time in the capital city of Manila where quaint street stalls sit side by side with ancient Spanish churches and modern high-rise buildings and also visit Vigan, the finest surviving example of a Spanish Colonial town in Asia. As we journey through the staggeringly beautiful islands, there will be opportunities to swim from the white-sand beaches and, a highlight for the birders will be the Subterranean River National Park which is home to long-tailed macaques, blue-naped parrots and other indigenous wildlife. Our final few days will be spent immersing ourselves in the culture and nature of Malaysia as we observe the diverse range of plants, trees and wildlife including the ‘wild man of Borneo’ – the orangutan, before our journey ends in the city of Kuala Lumpur.",
