    "generalInfo": "North East India is a very different, far lesser visited place than the rest of the country. Assam, its largest state, is famous for national parks which elephant and one-horned rhino call home. And who could forget its tea: vivid green tea plantations lie close to the humid banks of the wide Brahmaputra River, a river that starts high in the Himalayas. <br/><br/>On an eight day river boat trip, you can cruise upstream from Guwahati to Silghat, stopping in nature parks and tea plantations on the way. At the start of the trip you can take a tour of Guwahati, the biggest city in the region. This trip saves the best 'til last: at the end of your trip you’ll visit the UNESCO-listed Kaziranga National Park in search for the greater one-horned rhino. You might spot wild buffalo and swamp deer too.<br/><br/>The Brahmaputra River contains the world’s largest river island. Visit the Mishing people on Majuli Island, who live in stilted houses close to the monsoon-flooded banks. Take a trip on the Jia-Bhoreli River, one of the Brahmaputra’s many tributaries, through Nameri National Park. This park hides hoards of birdlife – magnificently-beaked hornbills among them  – and wild elephants, too.  <br/><br/>Your home will be a river boat where the on-board décor - from the decks to the cabins – has been made by local artisans, using attractive wicker and wood. Going by boat is a great introduction to this lesser visited part of India. <br/>",
