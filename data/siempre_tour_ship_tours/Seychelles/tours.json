    "generalInfo": "A stunning 8 day Seychelles sailing cruise around Praslin and La Digue islands as well as some of the smaller highly protected beautiful island idylls, supporting conservation organisations en route. The Seychelles have the most unique ecosystems in the world, with ancient geological and natural features that stretch back to the time when this archipelago, actually a submerged mountain range, broke away from the famous Gondwana supercontinent millennia ago. <br/><br/>The Seychelles are also famous for their blissful beaches, of course, as well as an impressive ongoing commitment to conservation. Many of the islands that we anchor by and visit are run by non profit making organisations or conservation foundations, charging a visitor’s fee which goes towards preserving these very special ecosystems and habitats. <br/><br/>The largest islands we visit are Praslin and La Digue. The former is home to the UNESCO World Heritage Site, Vallée de Mai, where the famous double sea coconut grows. It is also a popular spot for snorkelling and scuba diving, both of which we can facilitate on this sailing cruise, with PADI courses an additional option. The latter, a beach rich beauty, is a tranquil island where everyone gets around by bike and where the Anse Source D'Argent coast, with its granite boulder natural sculptures, is sometimes considered one of the planet’s most photogenic beaches. <br/><br/>We also visit some of the tiny satellite islets, such as Curieuse, where we can explore mangrove forests, a sea turtle farm and the ruins of a former leper colony, making for quite a magical mix on such a small, virtually uninhabited island. Or Cousin Island, where a nature reserve and Important Bird Area now preserve the all important habitats for colonies of sea birds and rare endemics, such as the Seychelles sunbird, Seychelles blue pigeon and the Malagasy turtle dove. <br/><br/>As well as these unique and diverse island landscapes, the Seychelles also have diverse cultures and varying island histories, making every day different on this holiday. You will have plenty of time to wander and explore both on land and underwater as we sail through every blue in the palette. All meals are provided on this trip, with ingredients sourced locally. <br/><br/>",

    "generalInfo": "Join us on a small-ship sailing eco-cruise across the Seychelles, weaving your way through islands such as Praslin, La Digue, Curieuse, Cousin and St Anne, with just 44 fellow travellers aboard. This island-hopping adventure offers you the chance to experience the Seychelles in a truly authentic way — its wildlife, marine life, culture and remote protected landscapes — without the hurry and noise of mass tourism.<br/><br/>The rhythm of the holiday is leisurely yet full of discovery. Cruising by sea means we can access hidden coves, untouched beaches and wildlife sanctuaries that larger ships skip over. Many days allow you to swim or snorkel in crystal-clear turquoise water, stroll through lush forest trails, or share a relaxed BBQ on a deserted sandbank. It’s slow travel in its most compelling form, giving you time to absorb the palette of blue seas and green islands, and feel the calm of the Indian Ocean all around.<br/><br/>The core of the experience is rooted in conservation and sustainable travel. Numerous islands on our route are managed by local environmental organisations, so your visit helps support vital habitat restoration and species-protection work. On Cousin Island Nature Reserve you may encounter rare birds such as the Seychelles sunbird or Seychelles blue pigeon, and learn how nest-sites for seabirds and turtles are being preserved. On Curieuse Island you’ll come across giant tortoises meandering under the mangroves, and trace the history of its former leper colony — all woven into the island’s nature-conservation story.<br/><br/>Our island-hopping itinerary also offers iconic must-sees. On Praslin you’ll find Vallée de Mai — a UNESCO-listed palm forest where the legendary coco de mer grows — while La Digue is perfect for slowing down: bicycles instead of cars, snow-white beaches and the extraordinary granite scenery of Anse Source d’Argent, often described as one of the world’s most photogenic shores.<br/><br/>Wildlife encounters are frequent and unforgettable. Hawksbill turtles may come ashore to nest in broad daylight. Dolphins often surface alongside our boat as we sail. And under the waves, coral reefs teem with fish in vivid colours — making this a genuine highlight for snorkellers, swimmers and nature-lovers alike.<br/><br/>On board you’ll find comfort in a relaxed, friendly environment: fresh local ingredients used in meals, plenty of deck space for sunbathing or watching the stars, and a small group size that makes the holiday feel personal without ever being crowded. The crew know the islands intimately and are committed to making the journey feel like one of discovery, not just a stop-and-go.<br/><br/>This small-ship eco-cruise is perfect for travellers seeking a meaningful way to explore the Seychelles — combining responsible tourism, island-hopping, wildlife, marine life and the joy of travelling by sea. It’s more than a holiday: it’s a chance to form a deeper connection with these remarkable islands and carry home memories that last long after the journey ends.",
