    "generalInfo": "If you've got your sights set on big wildlife – bears, whales and orcas – and big landscapes – like the three million acre Glacier Bay National Park – then a small ship cruise in Alaska is for you. Your cruise ship is small enough to reach sights that big ships can't, but big enough to fit a hot tub on board.<br/><br/>Starting in Juneau, the route loops around Admiralty Island in search for the best wildlife and the most spectacular parks in which to see them. Your first stop is Glacier Bay, naturally, then it's on to look out for black bears on Kuiu Island in the heart of Tongass National Park, and then to Frederick Sound, where humpback whales come every year to feed.<br/><br/>You'll decamp to smaller vessels to get an even closer look at the scenery. Hop into a skiff to approach Dawes Glacier and on your way, you might see colonies of harbour seals on the icebergs. You can climb into a sea kayak to explore Dundas and Taylors Bay, where sea otters dwell among vast kelp forests. On shore, comb the beaches and the tidal pools, look out for sea lions sleeping on the rocks, and go in search of edible flora.",

Grab a cup of coffee (let us grab it for you) and a warm jacket; directly off the bow is either Johns Hopkins Glacier or Margerie Glacier, depending on the season and ice condition. The quiet of the morning is only interrupted by the thundering crash of the glacier as 10 story-buildings of ice crash into the sea in the soft light of sunrise. Grab a pastry and a big breakfast, today is going to be a banner day. The captain drops the anchor deftly at Lamplugh Glacier – the morning is your choice of how you want to experience the glacier. Kayaks, ridge hikes, and ice garden explorations are all at your fingertips. The afternoon is spent singularly focused on the wildlife of the park. Get your binoculars out and spot Mountain Goats at Gloomy Knob and Tufted Puffins at the birder’s paradise of South Marble Island. This is our final day in the park – take it all in."

    "generalInfo": "This cruise slips down a treat. In a week you can make some serious headway into southeast Alaska’s sounds, fjords and straits. Start in Sitka, a city right on the edge of the ocean and end in Ketchikan, the salmon capital of the world.<br/> <br/>Southeast Alaska is a thin strip of the USA that sits on the edge of Canada. Its lacy edge of islands is raggedy with glaciers and cloaked with the temperate rainforest of Tongass National Forest. Many people come here to explore Glacier Bay and its surrounding Glacier Bay National Park, but on this small ship cruise you can also visit Tlingit towns like Kake and see the world’s tallest totem pole. <br/><br/>It’s waterways, not roads, that connect the communities on the islands, so a small cruise ship is the best way to see everything. Excursions by kayak and reinforced inflatable boat get you even closer to the scenery.<br/><br/>In the water, there’s every chance of seeing whales feeding in Frederick Sound and sea lions hunting off the rocks. On the shore, you might see a foraging bear emerging from between the Sitka spruce. Decamp to your boat’s DIB (Demaree Inflatable Boat), which is designed to cruise in shallow water, and you can safely observe wildlife close to the shore.  <br/>",
