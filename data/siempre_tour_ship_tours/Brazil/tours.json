    "generalInfo": "The Amazon might be a mighty river, but it doesn’t mean you should explore it on a massive boat. On a smaller vessel you can get into the small tributary rivers, too, where it’s much easier to spot wildlife on the shore and get away from the main settlements. This custom-built river boat is designed to be able to creep up hidden channels, to see a side to the Amazon that not everyone gets to experience.<br/><br/>The Ria Negro tributary is the largest river to flow into the Amazon. It’s flanked by forests that haven’t changed for millions of years, but which are always growing and bristling with new life. There are huge boughs draped with vines and trembling orchids. You’ll spend the first days of the cruise on the Ria Negro, before encountering the Amazon itself. <br/><br/>Each day there are multiple excursions: forest walks, village visits, stops in river trading towns and lazy afternoons spent fishing. Don't be worried about piranhas – you'll eat them before they’ll eat you. You might come across them as an appetiser, and you can fish for them in the river. At night, you might spend the evening drinking caipirinhas, or you might slip out in a launch and glide through the darkness, listening out for nocturnal creatures and looking up at a star-filled sky. <br/>",

        "description": "Manaus, Rio Negro. This afternoon we embark on the Motor Yacht Tucano in Manaus, Brasil. We depart on the Rio Negro and as the vessel glides upstream we will have our first talk about Amazon environments. By late afternoon we enter one of the world’s largest river island systems, the Anavilhanas Archipelago. The boat will weave along a winding channel with rainforest on both sides in a riot of brilliant vegetation. Weather permitting, we will go for a launch excursion in the gnarled and dense flooded forest along the river’s edge. We may see some Squirrel Monkeys and we may hear the other-worldly growls of Howler Monkeys echoing through the primitive rainforest. The Amazon has one of the greatest collection of birds in the world and we are sure to see some of these brightly colored jewels perched in the treetops. We return to the M/Y Tucano for hors d’oeuvres on the observation deck and a toast to the rainforest sunset. Following dinner we will embark in our launches in search of nocturnal creatures such as the Caiman, the Amazon’s crocodilians. We may also see one of the large night birds such as a Great Potoo, with its bulging eyes and large mouth, adapted to swallow the huge Mariposa Moths. (D)"

Shortly after sunrise this morning we explore the Anavilhanas Archipelago, a reserve that includes the world’s largest system of river islands and also areas of tall dense rainforest. Here we will see the strange environment called the Igapó, the black water flooded forest where dense forests grow right out of the dark water of the Rio Negro. Mid morning we return to the vessel for a hearty Brasilian breakfast. After some time to relax, weather permitting we will disembark at mid-morning and will go for a walk in the type of rainforest known as the Terra Firme. Here we have a good chance to see the markings, if not the animals themselves, of some of the Amazon’s great mammals like peccaries (wild pigs) or even a jaguar. Around mid-day return to the vessel for lunch and a siesta. In the afternoon we will excursion in our launches along the edges of the dense forest and listen to the sunset chorus of birds, howler monkeys, and frogs. Weather permitting, tonight we will have an excursion to spot caiman (the Amazon’s crocodiles) and other nocturnal creatures. We very often see arboreal porcupines or sloths scrambling high in the limbs. (BLD)"

As you voyage deeper and deeper into the jungle you’ll find yourself in the most untouched rainforest of the whole Amazon. <br/><br/>Exploring the Amazon’s tributaries takes you away from the many settlements on the bank of the main river, giving you more chances to spot wildlife. Your home for the seven days is a riverboat with loads of windows over its decks. From the observation deck, you can fully appreciate the magnitude of the forest, whilst motor launches take you on smaller expeditions away from the main vessel.<br/><br/>There are many different kinds of rainforest, and you’ll explore many of them, from terre firme forest, free from flooding, where tall hardwood trees grow, to varzea forest, annually dosed with rich floodwater so its trees grow thick and green. There are orchids and bromeliads, iguanas and tall, elegant fishing birds, and monkeys cavort on the branches.<br/><br/>When night falls, you’ll venture out with torches to listen to the rainforest’s chorus in the darkness. Your torch might pick out red eyes glowing in the night – the eyes of caiman, Amazonian alligator, lurking in the water.<br/>",
